You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Arpa is researching the Mexican wave.

There are n spectators in the stadium, labeled from 1 to n. They start the Mexican wave at time 0. 

  At time 1, the first spectator stands.  At time 2, the second spectator stands.  ...  At time k, the k-th spectator stands.  At time k + 1, the (k + 1)-th spectator stands and the first spectator sits.  At time k + 2, the (k + 2)-th spectator stands and the second spectator sits.  ...  At time n, the n-th spectator stands and the (n - k)-th spectator sits.  At time n + 1, the (n + 1 - k)-th spectator sits.  ...  At time n + k, the n-th spectator sits. 

Arpa wants to know how many spectators are standing at time t.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers n, k, t (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, 1 ≤ t < n + k).


-----Output-----

Print single integer: how many spectators are standing at time t.


-----Examples-----
Input
10 5 3

Output
3

Input
10 5 7

Output
5

Input
10 5 12

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the following a sitting spectator is represented as -, a standing spectator is represented as ^.

  At t = 0  ---------- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 0.  At t = 1  ^--------- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 1.  At t = 2  ^^-------- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 2.  At t = 3  ^^^------- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 3.  At t = 4  ^^^^------ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 4.  At t = 5  ^^^^^----- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 6  -^^^^^---- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 7  --^^^^^--- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 8  ---^^^^^-- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 9  ----^^^^^- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 10 -----^^^^^ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 11 ------^^^^ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 4.  At t = 12 -------^^^ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 3.  At t = 13 --------^^ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 2.  At t = 14 ---------^ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 1.  At t = 15 ---------- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 0.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k, t) = map(int, input().split())
    if t <= k:
        print(t)
    elif t <= n:
        print(k)
    else:
        print(n + k - t)


```
Original Assessment: To assess the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we can evaluate the logic within the `func()` function as it relates to the cases described.

The program checks the time `t` in three conditions:
1. If `t <= k`, it prints `t`, which accounts for the first `k` times when spectators are gradually standing.
2. If `t <= n`, it prints `k`, which handles the situation when the number of standing spectators has reached `k` spectators and no spectators are sitting yet.
3. If `t > n`, it prints `n + k - t`, which calculates how many spectators are still standing after `k` spectators have stood and spectators begin to sit.

Now, let’s consider various potential edge cases:

### Case 1: Minimum Values
- Input: `1 1 1`
  - Expected Output: `1`
  - Program Output: `1` (Correct)

### Case 2: Full Capacity After Stepping Into Sitting Mode
- Input: `10 5 5`
  - Expected Output: `5`
  - Program Output: `5` (Correct)

### Case 3: Time Just After Full Capacity Transition
- Input: `10 5 6`
  - Expected Output: `5`
  - Program Output: `5` (Correct)

### Case 4: Time Before All Have Sat
- Input: `10 5 10`
  - Expected Output: `5`
  - Program Output: `5` (Correct)

### Case 5: Time in the Sitting Phase
- Input: `10 5 11`
  - Expected Output: `4`
  - Program Output: `4` (Correct)

### Case 6: Time When Only One Spectator is Standing
- Input: `10 5 14`
  - Expected Output: `1`
  - Program Output: `1` (Correct)

### Case 7: Maximum Values
- Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`
  - Expected Output: `1000000000`
  - Program Output: `1000000000` (Correct)

### Analysis
Based on the above evaluations, the program responds correctly in every case tested. Each branch of the if-elif-else statements is correctly aligned with the intended logic defined in the problem description. Therefore, it appears to handle all situations where the number of spectators standing is being calculated accurately.

Since there are no found cases where the program does not meet the requirements, we conclude:

Correctness: **True**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, k, and t are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k.
def func():
    n, k, t = map(int, input().split())
    if (t <= k) :
        print(t)
    else :
        if (t <= n) :
            print(k)
        else :
            print(n + k - t)
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `k`, `t` are assigned values `n'`, `k'`, `t'` respectively, where 1 ≤ n' ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k' ≤ n', and 1 ≤ t' < n' + k'. If `t'` is less than or equal to `n'`, then `k'` has been printed. If `t'` is greater than `n'`, the printed value will be `n' + k' - t'` (which is a negative value).
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `t` are assigned values `n'`, `k'`, `t'` respectively, where 1 ≤ n' ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k' ≤ n', and 1 ≤ t' < n' + k'. If `t'` is less than or equal to `k'`, then `t` is printed. Otherwise, if `t'` is less than or equal to `n'`, `k'` is printed. If `t'` is greater than `n'`, the printed value will be `n' + k' - t'`, which is a negative value.*
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three integer parameters `n`, `k`, and `t`, with constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k. It outputs the following: If `t` is less than or equal to `k`, it prints `t`. If `t` is greater than `k` but less than or equal to `n`, it prints `k`. If `t` is greater than `n`, it prints `n + k - t`. Notably, the output of `n + k - t` can potentially be a negative value if `t` is sufficiently large, which isn't addressed in the annotations.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
