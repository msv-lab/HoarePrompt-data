To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's break down the requirements and the implementation logic.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **At time t = 1 to k**:
   - The number of standing spectators increases from 1 to k.
   - Therefore, the output should be `t` (since `t` spectators are standing).
   
2. **At time t = k + 1 to n**:
   - The standing spectators remain constant at `k` as new spectators stand up and the first ones sit down.
   - Thus for these values of `t`, the output should be `k`.

3. **At time t > n**:
   - Spectators will start sitting down. The number of standing spectators will decrease from `k` to 0.
   - For `t = n + 1`, exactly 1 spectator will sit down, leading to `k - 1` standing spectators.
   - Similarly, the number of standing spectators will follow a periodic decrement overall pattern defined by `k`.

### Implementation Analysis:
The function implements the following logic:
- If `t <= n`, it computes `min(t, k)`, which accurately gives the number of standing spectators for the first case (1 through k) and maintains the `k` standing for the second case (k + 1 through n).
- If `t > n`, it computes `k - (t - n) % k`. This expression accounts for the periodic nature of those standing and sitting after reaching the maximum `k`.

### Comparisons with Example Cases:
- **Example 1: Input `10 5 3`**:
  - Expected Output: 3 (correct)
- **Example 2: Input `10 5 7`**:
  - Expected Output: 5 (correct)
- **Example 3: Input `10 5 12`**:
  - Expected Output: 3 (correct, as it's correctly calculated using periodic nature)

These analyses show that the function's logic conforms to the requirements set out in the problem description, and it accurately reflects the number of spectators standing at any given time `t`.

### Conclusion:
The function behaves correctly for all defined ranges of `t`, abiding by the logic of the 'Mexican wave' as described.

Correctness: **True**
