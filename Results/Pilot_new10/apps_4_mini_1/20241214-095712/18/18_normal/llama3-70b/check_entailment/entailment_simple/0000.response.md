To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the program's logic in relation to the wave behavior described.

### Breakdown of the Program:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   The program reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `t`, which represent the number of spectators, the maximum number that can stand at once, and the time at which we want to know how many spectators are standing.

2. **Wave Logic**:
    - For `t` from `1` to `n`:
        - The number of standing spectators increases from `1` to `k` (1 for time `1`, 2 for time `2`, ..., up to `k` for time `k`).
    - For `t` from `n+1` to `n+k`:
        - The spectators start sitting down after reaching `k` standing spectators. The standing spectators will decrease as the wave continues.
        
3. **Mathematical Logic Used**:
    - If `t <= n`, it directly returns the minimum of `t` (which ranges from `1` up to `k` while accumulating) and `k` (which limits the maximum standing spectators).
    - If `t > n`, the formula `k - (t - n) % k` computes the number of standing spectators based upon how many have sat down since time `n`.

### Verification against the Problem Description:

- For `1 ≤ t ≤ n`: 
    - The number of spectators standing is correctly computed as `min(t, k)`, which conforms to the wave pattern described.

- For `n < t < n + k`:
    - The logic `k - (t - n) % k` accurately mirrors the sit-down mechanics detailed in the problem description.

### Conclusion

The program behaves correctly according to the problem description for all specified ranges of `t`. 

Thus, the final judgment is:

Correctness: **True** 

The program correctly implements the logic of a Mexican wave by tracking how many spectators are standing at any given time `t`, following the outlined behavior of standing and sitting as per the specifications of the problem.
