You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Arpa is researching the Mexican wave.

There are n spectators in the stadium, labeled from 1 to n. They start the Mexican wave at time 0. 

  At time 1, the first spectator stands.  At time 2, the second spectator stands.  ...  At time k, the k-th spectator stands.  At time k + 1, the (k + 1)-th spectator stands and the first spectator sits.  At time k + 2, the (k + 2)-th spectator stands and the second spectator sits.  ...  At time n, the n-th spectator stands and the (n - k)-th spectator sits.  At time n + 1, the (n + 1 - k)-th spectator sits.  ...  At time n + k, the n-th spectator sits. 

Arpa wants to know how many spectators are standing at time t.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers n, k, t (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, 1 ≤ t < n + k).


-----Output-----

Print single integer: how many spectators are standing at time t.


-----Examples-----
Input
10 5 3

Output
3

Input
10 5 7

Output
5

Input
10 5 12

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the following a sitting spectator is represented as -, a standing spectator is represented as ^.

  At t = 0  ---------- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 0.  At t = 1  ^--------- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 1.  At t = 2  ^^-------- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 2.  At t = 3  ^^^------- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 3.  At t = 4  ^^^^------ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 4.  At t = 5  ^^^^^----- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 6  -^^^^^---- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 7  --^^^^^--- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 8  ---^^^^^-- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 9  ----^^^^^- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 10 -----^^^^^ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 11 ------^^^^ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 4.  At t = 12 -------^^^ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 3.  At t = 13 --------^^ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 2.  At t = 14 ---------^ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 1.  At t = 15 ---------- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 0.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k, t) = map(int, input().split())
    print(min(t, k) if t <= n else k - (t - n) % k)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze the logic implemented in the function according to the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Standing Sequence**:
   - At `t = 1`, 1 person stands.
   - At `t = 2`, 2 people stand.
   - At `t = 3`, 3 people stand.
   - This continues up to `k`, where `k` people stand at `t = k`.
   - After reaching `k`, the first person sits down as the next person stands.
   - From `t = k + 1` to `t = n`, there will always be `k` people standing.
   - After `t = n`, spectators begin to sit down in the reverse order.

2. **Observer Count**:
   - From `t = 1` to `t = k`, the number of standing spectators equals `t`.
   - From `t = k + 1` to `t = n`, the number of standing spectators remains `k`.
   - From `t = n + 1` to `t = n + k`, the number of standing spectators decreases sequentially back to `0`.

### Program Logic Review

The function contains the following logic:

- `print(min(t, k) if t <= n else k - (t - n) % k)`

**Understanding the Logic**:
- If `t` is less than or equal to `n`, the output is `min(t, k)`, which captures the count of standing spectators correctly for the range `1` to `k`.
- If `t` is greater than `n`, the program calculates `k - (t - n) % k`, which attempts to represent how many spectators are still standing as they sit down sequentially.

### Edge Case Evaluation

To evaluate the correctness further, we need to check edge cases:

1. **For t = 1 (Expect 1)**:
   - Output: 1 (correct)

2. **For t = 2 (Expect 2)**:
   - Output: 2 (correct)

3. **For t = k (Expect k)**:
   - Let's say `k = 5`. For `n = 10` and `t = 5`, we expect 5.
   - Output should be 5 (correct)

4. **For t = k + 1 (Expect still k)**:
   - For `t = 6`: Output should be `5` (correct)

5. **For t = n (Still k)**:
   - For `t = 10`: Output should be `5` (correct)

6. **For t = n + 1 (Expect k - 1)**:
   - For `t = 11`: Expected output is `4`.
   - Actual output via logic: `k - (11 - 10) % 5` => `5 - 1` = 4 (correct)

7. **For t = n + k (Expect 0)**:
   - For `t = 15`: Expected output is `0`.
   - Actual output via logic: `k - (15 - 10) % 5` => `5 - 0` = 5 (incorrect)

### Conclusion

The program fails in the case where `t = n + k`. According to the description, the output should be `0`, but the logic in the program gives `5`. 

Thus, the program does not handle the complete specifications of the given problem.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts three integers, `n`, `k`, and `t`, provided via standard input. It computes and prints either `min(t, k)` if `t` is less than or equal to `n`, or `k - (t - n) % k` if `t` is greater than `n`. This logic effectively allows for two scenarios: when `t` is within the bounds of `n`, it returns the minimum of `t` and `k`; otherwise, it calculates a value based on the periodic behavior defined by `k` for the excess of `t` over `n`. The function does not return any values, as it only prints the result. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
