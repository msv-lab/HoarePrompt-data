The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, but it operates based on three integer values: `n`, `k`, and `t`. The constraints state that `n`, `k`, and `t` are integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\), \(1 \leq k \leq n\), and \(1 \leq t < n + k\). The specific output behavior of the function is not described, so we will generalize based on the given constraints.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to handle integers `n`, `k`, and `t` within the specified ranges without directly accepting them as arguments. The precise output behavior based on `n`, `k`, and `t` will depend on the implementation specifics that are not provided.

Functionality: **The function operates based on three internal integers n, k, and t with constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k, but does not return specific behavior as the output details are not provided.**
