Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n`, which represents the number of integers in a list `a`, and reads a list of `n` positive integers from input. It calculates the minimum cost to adjust the integers in `a` such that they fall within the range `[t - 1, t + 1]` for values of `t` from 1 to 100. The function then returns the value of `t` that results in the minimum cost and the corresponding minimum cost itself.**
