The variable `current_cost` is assigned the value `0`. The other variables' states remain unaffected as this assignment does not depend on or alter them directly. Therefore, `current_cost` is now `0`, maintaining its relationship to `min_cost` since it is less than `min_cost`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= `a_i` <= 100), `current_cost` is 0, `min_cost` is updated to the previous value of `current_cost`, `best_t` is set to 1, `t` is 2**
