Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000) and `a` is a list of integers containing at least 1 integer. If `length` is less than 1, `current_cost` is increased by 1 and `min_cost` is updated to the new value of `current_cost`, with `best_t` remaining at 1. If `length` is greater than or equal to 1 and the length of `a` is greater than `t + 1`, then `current_cost` is updated to `length - 3` (where `length` is >= 4), `min_cost` is set to 0, and `best_t` remains at 1.***
