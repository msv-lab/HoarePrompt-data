Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= `a_i` <= 100). If `current_cost` is less than `min_cost`, then `min_cost` is updated to the value of `current_cost`, `best_t` is set to 1, and `t` remains 1. If `current_cost` is not less than `min_cost`, then `min_cost` and `best_t` remain unchanged while `t` is still 1.***
