To analyze the state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the operations performed within the loop and the conditions that define how the `current_cost` is updated based on each `length` from the list `a`.

The loop updates `current_cost` based on the condition of `length` compared to the values of `t - 1` and `t + 1`. 

### Summary of Conditions
- If `length < t - 1`, then `current_cost` is increased by `t - 1 - length`.
- If `length > t + 1`, then `current_cost` is increased by `length - (t + 1)`.
- If `length` is within the range `[t - 1, t + 1]`, there is no change to `current_cost`.

### Output State Determination
1. After the loop processes each integer in the list `a`, `current_cost` reflects the total cost accumulated from the conditions based on all elements of `a`.
2. If the list `a` has integers capable of affecting `current_cost`, this total will be computed depending on their values relative to `t - 1` and `t + 1`.
3. `min_cost` is updated based on the initial value of `current_cost` but remains unchanged during loop iterations unless certain conditions are met. 
4. `best_t` does not change as there are no conditional statements altering it during the loop.

### Final Variables Statements
- If the loop executes at least once, `current_cost` will have a non-negative integer value accumulated over all elements of `a`.
- The initial values of `min_cost`, `best_t`, and `n` remain or are updated as described.

### Conclusion
Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop are finished reflects the relationships and final values:

Output State: **`current_cost` is the total cost after analyzing all elements in `a`, `min_cost` is the original value of `current_cost`, `best_t` is 1, `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), and `a` is a list of integers containing `n` elements.**
