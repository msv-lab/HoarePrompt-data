To determine the output state after executing the given code snippet, we analyze the initial state and how the code affects relevant variables.

Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000)
- `a` is a list of integers that contains at least 1 integer
- `current_cost` is 0
- `min_cost` is updated to the previous value of `current_cost` (which is 0)
- `best_t` is 1
- `t` is 2
- The length of `a` is greater than or equal to 1
- The length of `a` is greater than `t + 1` (which is 3)

The code:
```
current_cost += length - (t + 1)
```

Here, `length` refers to the length of the list `a`. Since the length of `a` is greater than `t + 1`, we know that `length` will be at least 4. 

Let's denote the length of `a` as `length`, which could be any value greater than or equal to 4.

We calculate `current_cost` after executing the code:

1. `t + 1` equals `2 + 1`, which is `3`.
2. Therefore, the expression `length - (t + 1)` simplifies to `length - 3`.
3. `current_cost` will be updated by adding `length - 3` to its prior value of 0.
4. Hence, `current_cost` becomes `length - 3`, which is at least `4 - 3 = 1` (as length is at least 4).

Now, we compile the Output State, considering that `current_cost` has changed from 0 to at least 1 (specifically `length - 3`), and all the other variables remain unchanged. We express the new state in terms of the previous variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `a` is a list of integers that contains at least 1 integer, `current_cost` is `length - 3` (where `length` is >= 4), `min_cost` is 0, `best_t` is 1, `t` is 2, the length of `a` is greater than or equal to 1, and the length of `a` is greater than 3.**
