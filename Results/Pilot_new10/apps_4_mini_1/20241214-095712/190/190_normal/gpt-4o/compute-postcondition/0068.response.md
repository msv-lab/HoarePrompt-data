Postcondition: ***`current_cost` is calculated based on the value of `length`. If `length < t - 1`, then `current_cost` is `t - 1 - length`, and `min_cost` remains 0, with `best_t` unchanged. If `length` is greater than `t + 1`, then `current_cost` is `length - (t + 1)`, while `min_cost` remains 0 and `best_t` remains unchanged. If `length` is less than or equal to `t + 1`, the values of `current_cost`, `min_cost`, and `best_t` remain unchanged.***
