According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. The loop will execute as long as there are more integers remaining in `a`. At the end of the last iteration, `length` is the next integer in the list `a`, and since `a` has at least one more integer remaining for iteration, the loop can be executed again for the next integer in `a`.

The current state shows that `length` is the current integer from `a`, and for the loop to execute again, `length` needs to be updated to the next integer in the list. As `length` is taken from the list `a`, we assume that it will be the next element which is now `a[i+1]` (for the next iteration, where `i` is the index of the last processed `length`).

Since `n` is a positive integer and we are assured there are integers left in the list for further iteration, we can conclude that `length` needs to change to the next integer in `a`, and for it to execute again, `min_cost` and `best_t` may or may not change depending on future iterations, but they were not explicitly modified in the provided context.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:
State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` integers with at least one integer remaining for iteration, `min_cost` is float('inf'), `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, and `length` is the next integer in the list `a` (after the current `length`).**
