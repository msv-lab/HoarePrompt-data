To evaluate the impact of the provided code snippet, we first need to identify how the `current_cost` is altered based on the existing variables in the initial state.

1. `current_cost` is updated with the expression `t - 1 - length`.
2. `length` is defined to be the next integer in `a`, which is an integer list with at least one integer, thus it has a specific value.
3. `t` is not defined in the initial conditions, so we will keep it as it is (assume it may have any integer value).
4. Other variables including `current_cost`, `min_cost`, and `best_t` remain unchanged except for `current_cost`, which will now take a new value based on the calculation.

The expression shows that `current_cost` decreases by `length` and `t - 1`. 

Let's summarize the variables based on the provided conditions:
- `n`: is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000)
- `a`: is a list of integers containing at least 1 integer
- `length`: is equal to `a[i + 1]` for some valid index `i`, thus it has a specific value.
- `current_cost`: updates due to the expression.
- `min_cost`: remains unchanged
- `best_t`: is unchanged and remains at 1.

Given this information, the output state is updated for `current_cost` but we keep it represented in terms of the unchanged variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `a` is a list of integers containing at least 1 integer, `length` must be the next integer in `a`, `current_cost` is now updated to be `current_cost + t - 1 - length`, `min_cost` remains unchanged, `best_t` is 1.**
