The variable `current_cost` is updated by adding the result of the expression `length - (t + 1)` to its previous value. The variables `min_cost`, `best_t`, and any other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state. The output state will include the new value of `current_cost`.

Output State: **`current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + (length - (t + 1))`, `min_cost` remains 0, `best_t` is unchanged, `length` is the next element in the array `a`.**
