Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `a` is a list of integers containing at least 1 integer, and `length` is the next integer in `a`. If `length` is less than `t - 1`, then `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + t - 1 - length`, while `min_cost` remains unchanged and `best_t` remains at 1. If `length` is greater than `t + 1`, then `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + (length - (t + 1))`, with `min_cost` remaining unchanged and `best_t` still at 1. If `length` is less than or equal to `t + 1`, there are no changes to `current_cost`, `min_cost`, or `best_t`.***
