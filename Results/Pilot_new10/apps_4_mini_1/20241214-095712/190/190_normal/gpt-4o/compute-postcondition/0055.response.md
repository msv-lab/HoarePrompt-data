In the given code, `current_cost` is assigned the value of `0`. Since `min_cost` was equal to `current_cost` prior to this assignment, it will now also become `0`. The variable `best_t`, which was equal to `t` if `current_cost` was less than `min_cost`, will not change because `current_cost` is now equal to `min_cost`. The initial value of `t` is `100`.

Therefore, after the execution of the code:
- `current_cost` is `0`
- `min_cost` is also `0`
- `best_t` remains unchanged from its previous state, as the condition for changing it was not met.

Output State: **`current_cost` is 0, `min_cost` is 0, `best_t` remains unchanged, `t` is 100**
