Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000) and `a` is a list of integers that contains at least 1 integer. If the length of `a` is greater than `t + 1` (which is 3), then `current_cost` is updated to `length - 3` (where `length` is >= 4), `min_cost` is set to 0, and `best_t` remains at 1.***
