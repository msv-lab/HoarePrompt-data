The variable `current_cost` is assigned the value `0`. This action only affects the `current_cost` variable, and the other variables retain their values. Therefore, the Output State will reflect the new value for `current_cost` along with the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, `min_cost` is float('inf'), `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, `current_cost` is 0**
