Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of sticks `n` and the lengths of the sticks `a` correctly from the input. It ensures that `n` is constrained to the range `[1, 1000]` and each `a_i` is within `[1, 100]`.

2. **Cost Calculation**: The program iterates through each possible value of `t` from `1` to `100`. For every stick length in `a`, it calculates the cost to adjust the stick so that its length becomes "almost good" for the current value of `t`. The conditions used:
   - If `length < t - 1`, it calculates the cost to increase the length to `t - 1`.
   - If `length > t + 1`, it calculates the cost to decrease the length to `t + 1`.
   This matches the requirement of having all stick lengths fall within the range `[t - 1, t + 1]`, which defines what it means for a length to be "almost good".

3. **Minimum Cost Tracking**: The program keeps track of the minimum cost (`min_cost`) and the associated `t` value (`best_t`). This is appropriately updated whenever a lower cost is found.

4. **Output**: After evaluating all potential `t` values, it prints the `best_t` and the `min_cost`, as required by the problem description.

Overall, the program properly follows the instructions by evaluating the adjustments needed for all sticks and finds the optimal cost-effectively. Thus, it meets the problem's requirements in all cases considered by the constraints.
