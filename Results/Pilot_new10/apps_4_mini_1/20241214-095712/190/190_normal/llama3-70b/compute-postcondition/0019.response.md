According to the code, the loop is set to iterate based on the range from `mid - 1` down to `1`, in descending order. The loop can continue executing as long as `i` is greater than `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` must be `1` to allow the loop to execute again. For the loop to run one more time, the value of `i` will be decremented by 1, so `i` will be `0`. The conditions for the loop to execute again require `i` to be greater than `0`. 

Thus, after the last iteration, if `i` is adjusted to `0`, the loop won't execute as the range will no longer satisfy the condition to iterate. Therefore, there are no changes in `min_cost` and `min_t` after the last iteration, but for a conceptual understanding, the state should still reflect the possibility of the loop running once more.

State: **`min_cost` remains the same, `min_t` remains the same, `i` is 0, `mid` must be at least 2**
