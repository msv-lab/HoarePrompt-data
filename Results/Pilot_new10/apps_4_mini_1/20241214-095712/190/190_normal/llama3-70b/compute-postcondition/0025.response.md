According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `mid`. The loop will execute for `i` starting from `mid + 1` up to 100. Thus, for the loop to execute, `mid` must be less than 100. 

If `mid` is 100 or greater, then the loop cannot start, and `min_cost` will not be updated from its initial value, and `min_t` will remain equal to `mid`.

Additionally, if the loop executes, `i` will start at `mid + 1`. 

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `min_cost` is the minimum cost found, `min_t` is the corresponding value of `t` that minimized the cost, `i` is `mid + 1`, `mid` must be less than 100**.
