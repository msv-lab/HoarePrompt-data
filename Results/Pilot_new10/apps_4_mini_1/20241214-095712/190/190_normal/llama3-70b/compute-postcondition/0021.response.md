The value of `min_cost` is updated to the value of `cost`. The values of `min_t`, `i`, and `cost` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `min_cost` is equal to `cost`, `min_t` remains the same, `i` is 0, and `cost` is the sum of min(abs(x), abs(x - 1)) for each x in sticks.

Output State: **`min_cost` is equal to `cost`, `min_t` remains the same, `i` is 0, and `cost` is the sum of min(abs(x), abs(x - 1)) for each x in sticks.**
