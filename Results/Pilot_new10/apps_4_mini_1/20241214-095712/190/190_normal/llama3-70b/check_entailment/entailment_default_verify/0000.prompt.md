You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Salem gave you $n$ sticks with integer positive lengths $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$.

For every stick, you can change its length to any other positive integer length (that is, either shrink or stretch it). The cost of changing the stick's length from $a$ to $b$ is $|a - b|$, where $|x|$ means the absolute value of $x$.

A stick length $a_i$ is called almost good for some integer $t$ if $|a_i - t| \le 1$.

Salem asks you to change the lengths of some sticks (possibly all or none), such that all sticks' lengths are almost good for some positive integer $t$ and the total cost of changing is minimum possible. The value of $t$ is not fixed in advance and you can choose it as any positive integer. 

As an answer, print the value of $t$ and the minimum cost. If there are multiple optimal choices for $t$, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 1000$) — the number of sticks.

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_i$ ($1 \le a_i \le 100$) — the lengths of the sticks.


-----Output-----

Print the value of $t$ and the minimum possible cost. If there are multiple optimal choices for $t$, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
10 1 4

Output
3 7

Input
5
1 1 2 2 3

Output
2 0



-----Note-----

In the first example, we can change $1$ into $2$ and $10$ into $4$ with cost $|1 - 2| + |10 - 4| = 1 + 6 = 7$ and the resulting lengths $[2, 4, 4]$ are almost good for $t = 3$.

In the second example, the sticks lengths are already almost good for $t = 2$, so we don't have to do anything.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    sticks = list(map(int, input().split()))
    sticks.sort()
    mid = sticks[n // 2]
    cost = sum((abs(x - mid) for x in sticks))
    t = mid
    min_cost = cost
    min_t = t
    for i in range(mid - 1, 0, -1):
        cost = sum((min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i + 1))) for x in sticks))
        if cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = cost
            min_t = i
    for i in range(mid + 1, 101):
        cost = sum((min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i - 1))) for x in sticks))
        if cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = cost
            min_t = i
    print(min_t, min_cost)


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's break down the requirements and the logic in the code.

### Problem Requirements:
1. We need to find a positive integer `t` such that all stick lengths are "almost good" for `t`, meaning `|a_i - t| <= 1`.
2. The total cost of changing the lengths of the sticks should be minimized.

### Program Analysis:
- The program first sorts the stick lengths and calculates the median length to start with. This is a reasonable choice for minimizing the total adjustment cost when changing values.
- It then checks for potential values of `t` below the median (`mid - 1` down to `1`) and above the median (`mid + 1` up to `100`).
- For each potential `t`, it calculates the cost to bring each stick length within the almost good range.
  
### Edge Case Analysis:
1. **Single Stick**: If there is only one stick, the program should correctly identify `t` as the stick's length (or the stick's length ± 1) and the cost as `0`. The current code handles this correctly if `n == 1`.
2. **Sticks Already Almost Good**: The program should output `0` cost when sticks are already almost good for `t`. The code should handle this as well due to checking a range around the median.
3. **Sticks with High Variation**: Consider sticks `[1, 1, 100]`. Here, the median is `1`, and the program may fail to appropriately minimize costs because it might miss the optimal `t` when it goes beyond the immediate vicinity of the median. 

### Failure Case:
Suppose we test an edge case such as:
- **Input**: 
  ```
  3
  1 1 100
  ```
- **Expected Output**: 
  ```
  1 98
  ```
  (change one `1` to `2` and `100` to `2` resulting in costs of `1 + 98 = 99` total adjustment cost).
  
However, when running the current code, it may not appropriately reach `t = 2` as a viable option, since the checks for `t` are primarily around the median and may miss out on significant potential cost reductions far from the median.

Therefore, the program might overlook optimal solutions in scenarios with extreme values and distribution, leading to potentially incorrect results for certain inputs.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not handle cases with high variability in stick lengths effectively, leading to incorrect output in scenarios like the one demonstrated.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts an integer `n` (between 1 and 1000) and a list `sticks` of `n` positive integers (each between 1 and 100) that represent stick lengths. It finds the optimal stick length `min_t` between 1 and 100 that minimizes the total cost of adjusting all sticks to that length, where the cost is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between each stick and the optimal length. It returns the optimal length `min_t` along with the associated minimum cost `min_cost` of adjustment. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
