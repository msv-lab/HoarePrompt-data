Postcondition: ***`n` is a specific positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 0, and `visited` contains True values for all indices that were visited during the loop. If index `i` has not been visited, `cycle` contains the sequence of indices visited starting from 0 and ending when a previously visited index is encountered. The variable `x` is set to the index that was lastly updated via `x = p[x] - 1`, and `cycles` includes the new `cycle` added to it.***
