The value of `x` is assigned the value of `p[x] - 1`. We know that `visited[x]` was previously False and has now changed to True. The variable `i` remains unchanged at 0, and since `n` is a specific positive integer, it is still in the range of 1 to 200,000. The state of `cycle` is also unchanged. 

Thus, the Output State is: `n` is a specific positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 0; `visited[0]` is True; `visited[x]` is True; `cycle` is [0, p[0] - 1, x]; `x` is equal to `p[x] - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a specific positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 0; `visited[0]` is True; `visited[x]` is True; `cycle` is [0, p[0] - 1, x]; `x` is equal to `p[x] - 1.**
