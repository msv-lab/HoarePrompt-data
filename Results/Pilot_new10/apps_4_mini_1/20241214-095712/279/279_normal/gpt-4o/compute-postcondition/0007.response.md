According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment by 1 until it reaches `n - 1`. Given that `n` is a specific positive integer between 1 and 200,000, the loop will definitely execute when `n` is at least 1. 

Before the loop starts, the variable `i` should be initialized to 0 since it's the starting point of the loop. There are no additional conditions required from the other variables to ensure the loop executes, as they are just maintained throughout the loop's iterations.

State: **`n` is a specific positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 0**
