According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `visited`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `visited[x]` is not True. At the end of the last iteration, we have `visited[0]` as True, which means that the condition `not visited[x]` will evaluate to False (since `x` is equal to `p[0] - 1`).

To ensure that the loop executes at least one more time, the `visited[x]` state must be adjusted to False. Thus, the `visited` array must be modified to reflect that `visited[x]` is now False.

State: **`n` is a specific positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 0; `visited[0]` is True; `cycle` is [0]; `x` is equal to `p[0] - 1; visited[x] must be False**
