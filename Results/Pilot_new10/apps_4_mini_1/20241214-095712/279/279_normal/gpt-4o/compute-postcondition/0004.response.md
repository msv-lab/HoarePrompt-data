In the provided code snippet, the variable `b` is assigned the list created by mapping the `int` function over a slice of the `data` list. The slice `data[n + 1:2 * n + 1]` extracts elements from index `n + 1` to `2 * n + 1`, which corresponds to a section of `data` that holds integers.

Here's the breakdown:
- `n` is a specific positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000.
- `data` is a list of strings from input split by whitespace, so `data[n + 1:2 * n + 1]` consists of a subset of these strings starting from index `n + 1`, with a length of `n`.

The output state will reflect the assignment of `b` as a list of integers created from the specified portion of `data`.

Output State: **`n` is a specific positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `p` is a list of integers from `data[1:n + 1]`; `b` is a list of integers converted from `data[n + 1:2 * n + 1]`; `data` is a list of strings from input split by whitespace.**
