According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x` and the condition `not visited[x]`. For the loop to execute, `visited[x]` must be `False`. Right before the loop, `x` is 0 and `visited[i]` is False.

Since `visited[i]` is False for `i` (which is 0), this means `visited[0]` is False, allowing the loop to execute initially. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a specific positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 0, `visited[0]` is False, `cycle` is an empty list `[]`, `x` is 0**
