The variable `cycle` is updated by appending the value of `x` to it. Prior to this operation, `cycle` contained two elements: `0` and `p[0] - 1`. With the new value `x` appended, `cycle` will now hold three elements: `0`, `p[0] - 1`, and `x`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a specific positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 0; `visited[0]` is True; `cycle` is [0, p[0] - 1, x]; `visited[x]` is True, where `visited[x]` was previously False.**
