The code assigns `True` to `visited[x]`. Therefore, the state of the `visited` array changes to indicate that the index `x` has now been visited. The other variables remain unchanged: `n` is still a specific positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is still 1, `visited[1]` is still True, `cycle` still has the value [1], and `cycles` is unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a specific positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; `visited[1]` is True; `visited[x]` is True; `cycle` is a list containing the value 1; `cycles` remains unchanged.**
