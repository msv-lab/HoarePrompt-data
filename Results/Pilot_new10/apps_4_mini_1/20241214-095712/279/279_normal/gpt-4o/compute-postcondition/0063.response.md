The code calculates `no_reverse_components`, which is the sum of boolean evaluations for each cycle found in the permutation. For each cycle, it checks if all indices in the cycle are not visited (i.e., `b[x] == 0` for all `x` in the cycle). If all indices in a cycle have not been visited, it counts that cycle as a reverse component.

Let’s outline the impact of the code:

- `no_reverse_components` is calculated by summing the results of a generator expression that checks each `cycle` in the `cycles` list to see if all corresponding boolean values in the `visited` list are `0`.

The values of `n`, `visited`, and `cycles` remain unchanged in terms of their particulars; however, `no_reverse_components` will now hold a computed value based on the conditions applied to the existing cycle lists and the `visited` states. 

Since the initial state is unspecified with respect to the values of `visited` and `cycles`, the best representation includes the impact of evaluating all cycles.

Output State: **`n` is a specific positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values indicating whether each index has been visited; `cycles` is a list containing all cycles found in the permutation represented by `p`; `no_reverse_components` is the sum of all cycles where all elements in each cycle have not been visited (all `b[x] == 0`).**
