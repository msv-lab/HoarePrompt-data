The variable `b` is assigned the value of a list created from the input provided by the user, where the input is converted into integers. It will consist of zeros and ones, maintaining the length equal to that of the list `p`, but the specific values will depend on the input. Other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer inputted from the user; `p` is a list of integers representing a new permutation from the input; `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones based on user input.**
