Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of integers representing a new permutation, `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones based on user input, and `i` is equal to `n`. If `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1`, then `ans` is incremented by 1. If `p[i]` is equal to `i + 1`, no change is made to `ans`.***
