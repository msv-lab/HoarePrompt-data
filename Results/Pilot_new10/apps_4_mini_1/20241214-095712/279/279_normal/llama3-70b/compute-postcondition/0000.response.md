The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it into an integer. The variables `p` and `b` remain unchanged in this step but are still assumed to be as previously described: `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`, and `b` is a list of integers (either 0 or 1) with the same length as `p`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer inputted from the user, `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of numbers from 1 to n, and `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones with the same length as p.**
