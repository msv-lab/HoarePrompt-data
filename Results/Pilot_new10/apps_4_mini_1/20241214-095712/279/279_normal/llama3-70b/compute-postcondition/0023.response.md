The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `p`, and `b`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 200,000. The parameter `p` is a list of integers that represents a permutation of the numbers from 1 to `n`. The parameter `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones and has the same length as `p`. Based on these inputs, the function performs certain operations and returns results based on the relationships between the elements in `p` and `b`. 

The specific outputs of the function depend on the conditions and manipulations performed on these parameters, which have not been detailed here. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n, a list of integers p that is a permutation of numbers from 1 to n, and a list of zeros and ones b of the same length as p.**
