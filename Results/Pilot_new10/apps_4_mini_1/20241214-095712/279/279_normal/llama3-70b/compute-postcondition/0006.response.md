`ans` is incremented by 1. The value of `ans` was initially 0, so after the operation, it becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of integers representing a new permutation from the input, `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones based on user input, `ans` is 1, `i` is 0, and the current value of `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1.
