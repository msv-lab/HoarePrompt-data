Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly handle all cases as per the problem description. 

Specifically, the main flaw lies in the management of the `full_rows` variable and how the position is calculated when `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`. The logic for alternating movements between upward and downward movement across rows assumes that each row has `m` columns available, but this is incorrect when reducing the `remaining_steps`.

Here's a counterexample to illustrate this issue:
- For input `4 3 8`, considering `k = 8` means that Lara has made 8 moves from the starting position. Based on the description, after 8 moves, Lara ends up in cell `(3, 1)`. However, the program will end up trying to calculate position based on incorrect assumptions about remaining cells. 

Calculating from the `remaining_steps` logic will yield wrong cells for certain `k` values because the transition between full rows and their respective columns is masked.

This inconsistency demonstrates that there are indeed cases where the output of the program can diverge from the expected result, making it incorrect for all potential cases.
