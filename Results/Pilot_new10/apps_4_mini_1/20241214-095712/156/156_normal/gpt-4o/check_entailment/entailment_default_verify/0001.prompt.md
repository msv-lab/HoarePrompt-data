You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You might have heard about the next game in Lara Croft series coming out this year. You also might have watched its trailer. Though you definitely missed the main idea about its plot, so let me lift the veil of secrecy.

Lara is going to explore yet another dangerous dungeon. Game designers decided to use good old 2D environment. The dungeon can be represented as a rectangle matrix of n rows and m columns. Cell (x, y) is the cell in the x-th row in the y-th column. Lara can move between the neighbouring by side cells in all four directions.

Moreover, she has even chosen the path for herself to avoid all the traps. She enters the dungeon in cell (1, 1), that is top left corner of the matrix. Then she goes down all the way to cell (n, 1) — the bottom left corner. Then she starts moving in the snake fashion — all the way to the right, one cell up, then to the left to the cell in 2-nd column, one cell up. She moves until she runs out of non-visited cells. n and m given are such that she always end up in cell (1, 2).

Lara has already moved to a neighbouring cell k times. Can you determine her current position?


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers n, m and k (2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, n is always even, 0 ≤ k < n·m). Note that k doesn't fit into 32-bit integer type!


-----Output-----

Print the cell (the row and the column where the cell is situated) where Lara ends up after she moves k times.


-----Examples-----

-----Note-----

Here is her path on matrix 4 by 3: [Image]
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().strip().split()
(n, m, k) = (int(data[0]), int(data[1]), int(data[2]))
func_1(n, m, k)

def func_1(n, m, k):
    if k < n - 1:
        print(k + 1, 1)
    else:
        k -= n - 1
        full_rows = k // (m - 1)
        remaining_steps = k % (m - 1)
        if full_rows % 2 == 0:
            row = n - full_rows
            col = 2 + remaining_steps
        else:
            row = n - full_rows
            col = m - remaining_steps
        print(row, col)


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the provided program in accordance with the problem description, we need to carefully analyze how the program determines Lara's position after moving `k` times in the rectangular matrix defined by dimensions `n` (rows) and `m` (columns).

### Evaluation of the Code Logic

1. **Initial Move to the Bottom**: The program handles the first `n - 1` moves correctly, which represent moving straight down from (1, 1) to (n, 1). This part of the code:
   ```python
   if k < n - 1:
       print(k + 1, 1)
   ```
   correctly outputs the position (k + 1, 1) for moves that don't exceed this downward path.

2. **Handling Remaining Moves**: After reaching (n, 1), the program attempts to handle the remaining moves. It calculates the number of "full rows" that can be traversed horizontally, and the remaining steps in the current row:
   ```python
   k -= n - 1
   full_rows = k // (m - 1)
   remaining_steps = k % (m - 1)
   ```

3. **Determining Row and Column for Remaining Moves**:
   - The code alternates the row calculation based on whether the `full_rows` count is even or odd:
     ```python
     if full_rows % 2 == 0:
         row = n - full_rows
         col = 2 + remaining_steps
     else:
         row = n - full_rows
         col = m - remaining_steps
     ```
   - This logic is intended to move Lara through the snake-like path until all movements are accounted for.

### Testing Edge Cases 

To determine if there are any edge cases where this logic may be incorrect, let's consider one potential case, particularly for a matrix size with only two rows and several columns:

**Test Case**:
```plaintext
Input: 2 5 1
Expected Output: (2, 1) (as she would move from (1, 1) to (2, 1))
```

### Check Program Output
For the above input:
1. Initially, `k = 1` is less than `n - 1 = 1`, so the program logic jumps directly to:
   ```python
   print(k + 1, 1) 
   ```
   This correctly outputs (2, 1).

Testing with the maximum moves slightly more complicated case:
**Test Case**:
```plaintext
Input: 4 3 12
Expected Output: (1, 1) (this would exceed the defined grid)
```

### Evaluate
For k = 12:
- Lara should start moving (1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (3, 1) -> (4, 1) on the initial down move of (n - 1) = 3 moves, then:
- Calculate remaining moves: `k - (n - 1) = 12 - 3 = 9`
- Full Rows move: `full_rows = 9 // 2 = 4`, but this means moving through rows beyond defined row limits.

### Conclusion
The original logic does not account for the situation where the number of moves leads Lara to exceed the defined boundaries of the matrix. Therefore, specific large values of `k` could either lead to incorrect locations or unintended results. 

Hence, there exists at least one case where the program fails to meet the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False** 

The program fails particularly when `k` is at the upper limit, exceeding matrix bounds improperly without boundary checks.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts two even integers `n` and `m` (where 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9) and a non-negative integer `k` (where 0 ≤ k < n·m). It calculates and prints the position in the grid defined by these parameters. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, it prints `k + 1` and `1`. Otherwise, it computes how many full rows are completed and the remaining steps to determine the specific row and column in which the position falls, with row calculated as `n - full_rows` and column depending on whether `full_rows` is even or odd. This results in different column values based on the parity of `full_rows`. The function does not return a value; it directly prints the calculated position. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
