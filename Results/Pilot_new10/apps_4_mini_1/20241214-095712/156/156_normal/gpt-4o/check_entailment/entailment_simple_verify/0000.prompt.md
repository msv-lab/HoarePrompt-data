You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You might have heard about the next game in Lara Croft series coming out this year. You also might have watched its trailer. Though you definitely missed the main idea about its plot, so let me lift the veil of secrecy.

Lara is going to explore yet another dangerous dungeon. Game designers decided to use good old 2D environment. The dungeon can be represented as a rectangle matrix of n rows and m columns. Cell (x, y) is the cell in the x-th row in the y-th column. Lara can move between the neighbouring by side cells in all four directions.

Moreover, she has even chosen the path for herself to avoid all the traps. She enters the dungeon in cell (1, 1), that is top left corner of the matrix. Then she goes down all the way to cell (n, 1) — the bottom left corner. Then she starts moving in the snake fashion — all the way to the right, one cell up, then to the left to the cell in 2-nd column, one cell up. She moves until she runs out of non-visited cells. n and m given are such that she always end up in cell (1, 2).

Lara has already moved to a neighbouring cell k times. Can you determine her current position?


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers n, m and k (2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, n is always even, 0 ≤ k < n·m). Note that k doesn't fit into 32-bit integer type!


-----Output-----

Print the cell (the row and the column where the cell is situated) where Lara ends up after she moves k times.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 0

Output
1 1

Input
4 3 11

Output
1 2

Input
4 3 7

Output
3 2



-----Note-----

Here is her path on matrix 4 by 3: [Image]
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().strip().split()
(n, m, k) = (int(data[0]), int(data[1]), int(data[2]))
func_1(n, m, k)

def func_1(n, m, k):
    if k < n - 1:
        print(k + 1, 1)
    else:
        k -= n - 1
        full_rows = k // (m - 1)
        remaining_steps = k % (m - 1)
        if full_rows % 2 == 0:
            row = n - full_rows
            col = 2 + remaining_steps
        else:
            row = n - full_rows
            col = m - remaining_steps
        print(row, col)


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the description, let’s analyze the given code:

The program is designed to find Lara's position in a dungeon represented as a matrix after making `k` moves. The first part of the movement is straight down, and as specified, she moves in a snake-like pattern (to the right, up, to the left, up) across the columns.

1. **Initial Movement**: The program checks if `k` is less than `n - 1`. If this is the case, it prints the position as `(k + 1, 1)` which corresponds to moving downward in the first column.

2. **Snake Movement**: If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, it calculates how many complete rows of snake movements Lara can make and how many additional steps within the next row she can take.

3. **Determining the Current Position**:
   - It uses the `full_rows` variable to determine what position Lara would be in and then calculates the corresponding row and column based on the even or odd status of `full_rows`.

Now, upon further inspection, we can identify a flaw in the logic:

### Potential Failure Case
Let’s consider the case when:
- `n = 4`, `m = 3`, and `k = 10`.

This means Lara has made 10 moves in total. 
When the program computes:
- `k >= n - 1`, we have `k = 10`, so it calculates:
  ```
  k -= (n - 1)  # k = 10 - (4 - 1) = 7
  ```

Then the program computes:
```
full_rows = k // (m - 1)  # full_rows = 7 // 2 = 3
remaining_steps = k % (m - 1)  # remaining_steps = 7 % 2 = 1
```

The next steps would depend on the parity of `full_rows`:
- Since `full_rows = 3` (odd), it calculates:
```
row = n - full_rows  # row = 4 - 3 = 1
col = m - remaining_steps  # col = 3 - 1 = 2
```
Thus, it gives `(1, 2)` as the output.

However, after 10 moves, Lara should actually be at position `(4, 2)` according to the expected snake-like movement within a 4x3 matrix. 

### Conclusion
The solution presents a logical flaw in calculating the row for odd-numbered full rows, which leads to an incorrect final position. 

Therefore, based on this error and inconsistency with the problem description for at least one input case:

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().strip().split()
(n, m, k) = (int(data[0]), int(data[1]), int(data[2]))
func_1(n, m, k)

import sys

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are even integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, and k is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k < n·m.
def func_1(n, m, k):
    if (k < n - 1) :
        print(k + 1, 1)
    else :
        k -= n - 1
        full_rows = k // (m - 1)
        remaining_steps = k % (m - 1)
        if (full_rows % 2 == 0) :
            row = n - full_rows
            col = 2 + remaining_steps
        else :
            row = n - full_rows
            col = m - remaining_steps
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` and `m` are even integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k < n·m. If `full_rows` is even, then `full_rows` is assigned the value of `k // (m - 1)`, `remaining_steps` is equal to `k % (m - 1)`, `row` is equal to `n - full_rows`, and `col` is equal to `2 + remaining_steps`. If `full_rows` is odd, then `full_rows` is calculated as before, but `col` is assigned the value equal to `m - remaining_steps` instead.
        print(row, col)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` and `m` are even integers within the range of 2 to 10^9. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, the function outputs `k + 1` and `1`. Otherwise, `k` is in the range from 0 to less than `n·m`, `full_rows` is computed as `k // (m - 1)`, `remaining_steps` as `k % (m - 1)`, leading to the calculation of `row` as `n - full_rows`, and `col` is `2 + remaining_steps` if `full_rows` is even, or `m - remaining_steps` if `full_rows` is odd, and the values of `row` and `col` are printed.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
