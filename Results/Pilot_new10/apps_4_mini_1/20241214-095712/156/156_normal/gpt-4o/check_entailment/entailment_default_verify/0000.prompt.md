You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You might have heard about the next game in Lara Croft series coming out this year. You also might have watched its trailer. Though you definitely missed the main idea about its plot, so let me lift the veil of secrecy.

Lara is going to explore yet another dangerous dungeon. Game designers decided to use good old 2D environment. The dungeon can be represented as a rectangle matrix of n rows and m columns. Cell (x, y) is the cell in the x-th row in the y-th column. Lara can move between the neighbouring by side cells in all four directions.

Moreover, she has even chosen the path for herself to avoid all the traps. She enters the dungeon in cell (1, 1), that is top left corner of the matrix. Then she goes down all the way to cell (n, 1) — the bottom left corner. Then she starts moving in the snake fashion — all the way to the right, one cell up, then to the left to the cell in 2-nd column, one cell up. She moves until she runs out of non-visited cells. n and m given are such that she always end up in cell (1, 2).

Lara has already moved to a neighbouring cell k times. Can you determine her current position?


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers n, m and k (2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, n is always even, 0 ≤ k < n·m). Note that k doesn't fit into 32-bit integer type!


-----Output-----

Print the cell (the row and the column where the cell is situated) where Lara ends up after she moves k times.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 0

Output
1 1

Input
4 3 11

Output
1 2

Input
4 3 7

Output
3 2



-----Note-----

Here is her path on matrix 4 by 3: [Image]
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().strip().split()
(n, m, k) = (int(data[0]), int(data[1]), int(data[2]))
func_1(n, m, k)

def func_1(n, m, k):
    if k < n - 1:
        print(k + 1, 1)
    else:
        k -= n - 1
        full_rows = k // (m - 1)
        remaining_steps = k % (m - 1)
        if full_rows % 2 == 0:
            row = n - full_rows
            col = 2 + remaining_steps
        else:
            row = n - full_rows
            col = m - remaining_steps
        print(row, col)


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the description, let’s analyze the given code:

The program is designed to find Lara's position in a dungeon represented as a matrix after making `k` moves. The first part of the movement is straight down, and as specified, she moves in a snake-like pattern (to the right, up, to the left, up) across the columns.

1. **Initial Movement**: The program checks if `k` is less than `n - 1`. If this is the case, it prints the position as `(k + 1, 1)` which corresponds to moving downward in the first column.

2. **Snake Movement**: If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, it calculates how many complete rows of snake movements Lara can make and how many additional steps within the next row she can take.

3. **Determining the Current Position**:
   - It uses the `full_rows` variable to determine what position Lara would be in and then calculates the corresponding row and column based on the even or odd status of `full_rows`.

Now, upon further inspection, we can identify a flaw in the logic:

### Potential Failure Case
Let’s consider the case when:
- `n = 4`, `m = 3`, and `k = 10`.

This means Lara has made 10 moves in total. 
When the program computes:
- `k >= n - 1`, we have `k = 10`, so it calculates:
  ```
  k -= (n - 1)  # k = 10 - (4 - 1) = 7
  ```

Then the program computes:
```
full_rows = k // (m - 1)  # full_rows = 7 // 2 = 3
remaining_steps = k % (m - 1)  # remaining_steps = 7 % 2 = 1
```

The next steps would depend on the parity of `full_rows`:
- Since `full_rows = 3` (odd), it calculates:
```
row = n - full_rows  # row = 4 - 3 = 1
col = m - remaining_steps  # col = 3 - 1 = 2
```
Thus, it gives `(1, 2)` as the output.

However, after 10 moves, Lara should actually be at position `(4, 2)` according to the expected snake-like movement within a 4x3 matrix. 

### Conclusion
The solution presents a logical flaw in calculating the row for odd-numbered full rows, which leads to an incorrect final position. 

Therefore, based on this error and inconsistency with the problem description for at least one input case:

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts two even integers `n` and `m` (where 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9) and a non-negative integer `k` (where 0 ≤ k < n·m). It calculates and prints the position in the grid defined by these parameters. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, it prints `k + 1` and `1`. Otherwise, it computes how many full rows are completed and the remaining steps to determine the specific row and column in which the position falls, with row calculated as `n - full_rows` and column depending on whether `full_rows` is even or odd. This results in different column values based on the parity of `full_rows`. The function does not return a value; it directly prints the calculated position. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
