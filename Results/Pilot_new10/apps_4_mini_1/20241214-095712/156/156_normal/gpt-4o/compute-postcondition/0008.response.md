Let's analyze the provided code snippet step by step based on the initial state.

Initial State: 
- `n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 
- `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k < n·m 
- `full_rows` is assigned the value `k // (m - 1)` and is even 
- `remaining_steps` is equal to `k % (m - 1)` 
- `row` is equal to `n - full_rows`.

The code snippet is:
```
col = 2 + remaining_steps
```

Analysis:
- The variable `col` is assigned the value `2 + remaining_steps`. 
- The value of `remaining_steps` is taken from the initial state, where `remaining_steps = k % (m - 1)`. Thus, `col` will be calculated based on `remaining_steps`.

Since `remaining_steps` holds a specific value derived from `k`, the exact value of `col` will change based on the known value of `remaining_steps`. However, the variable `n`, `k`, `full_rows`, and `row` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the assignment to `col`.

Therefore, the output state includes `n`, `k`, `full_rows`, `remaining_steps`, and `row` along with the newly computed value for `col`.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k < n·m; `full_rows` is assigned the value `k // (m - 1)` and is even; `remaining_steps` is equal to `k % (m - 1); `row` is equal to `n - full_rows; `col` is equal to `2 + remaining_steps`.**
