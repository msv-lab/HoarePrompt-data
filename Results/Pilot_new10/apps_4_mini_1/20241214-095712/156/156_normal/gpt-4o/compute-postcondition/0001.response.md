The code outputs two values: `k + 1` and `1`. Since `k` is a non-negative integer and is less than `n - 1`, `k + 1` is guaranteed to be at least `1` (when `k` is `0`) and at most `n - 1` (if `k` is at its maximum). The value `1` is a constant output.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this output operation, so the Output State is: 
`n` and `m` are both even integers where `2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9`, and `k` is a non-negative integer where `0 ≤ k < n·m`, and `k` is currently less than `n - 1`. 
Since `print` is used, the output also includes the values printed.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are even integers such that `2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9`; `k` is a non-negative integer `0 ≤ k < n·m`, where `k` is less than `n - 1`, and the output of the print function is `k + 1` and `1`.**
