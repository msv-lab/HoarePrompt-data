You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You might have heard about the next game in Lara Croft series coming out this year. You also might have watched its trailer. Though you definitely missed the main idea about its plot, so let me lift the veil of secrecy.

Lara is going to explore yet another dangerous dungeon. Game designers decided to use good old 2D environment. The dungeon can be represented as a rectangle matrix of n rows and m columns. Cell (x, y) is the cell in the x-th row in the y-th column. Lara can move between the neighbouring by side cells in all four directions.

Moreover, she has even chosen the path for herself to avoid all the traps. She enters the dungeon in cell (1, 1), that is top left corner of the matrix. Then she goes down all the way to cell (n, 1) — the bottom left corner. Then she starts moving in the snake fashion — all the way to the right, one cell up, then to the left to the cell in 2-nd column, one cell up. She moves until she runs out of non-visited cells. n and m given are such that she always end up in cell (1, 2).

Lara has already moved to a neighbouring cell k times. Can you determine her current position?


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers n, m and k (2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, n is always even, 0 ≤ k < n·m). Note that k doesn't fit into 32-bit integer type!


-----Output-----

Print the cell (the row and the column where the cell is situated) where Lara ends up after she moves k times.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 0

Output
1 1

Input
4 3 11

Output
1 2

Input
4 3 7

Output
3 2



-----Note-----

Here is her path on matrix 4 by 3: [Image]
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    k %= n * 2 - 2
    if k < n - 1:
        print(k + 1, 1)
    elif k < n * 2 - 2:
        print(n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1, (k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1)
    else:
        print(1, 2)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given program is intended to determine Lara's current position in a dungeon represented as a matrix after she has moved `k` times. However, there's a flaw in the handling of the value `k`. 

1. **Boundary Case**: The program states that `k` should be taken modulo `n * 2 - 2`. However, this doesn't effectively handle the case where `k` is close to the maximum possible. For example, if `n = 4`, `m = 3`, and `k = 11` (which maps to the maximum potential moves in a 4x3 dungeon), the program would incorrectly output `(1, 2)` instead of `(3, 2)` because it handles the condition of `k` incorrectly.

2. **Range of `k`**: While `k` is correctly bounded between `0` and `nm - 1`, the logic to calculate the end positions based on `k` does not take full consideration of the zigzagging pattern that Lara follows after her initial downward movement. Specifically, the process to compute the row and column indices fails in cases where `k` leads to positions in the upper row outside the specified bounds after all downward traversals begin.

An example that exposes the flaw is:
- For input `n = 4`, `m = 3`, `k = 8`, the actual path reaches (3, 2). The program incorrectly would output a position or demonstrate undefined behavior through the current checks.

These issues indicate that the program does not satisfy all cases as described in the problem statement, thus it is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9 and n is always even; k is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k < n·m.
def func():
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    k %= n * 2 - 2
    if (k < n - 1) :
        print(k + 1, 1)
    else :
        if (k < n * 2 - 2) :
            print(n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1, (k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1)
        else :
            print(1, 2)
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an even integer in the range [2, 10^9]; `m` is an integer in the range [2, 10^9]; `k` is a non-negative integer that after being updated to \(k \% (n \times 2 - 2)\) satisfies \(k \geq n - 1\) and \(0 \leq k < n \times 2 - 2\). If \(k < n \times 2 - 2\), the first printed value is calculated as \(n - (k - n + 1) \% (n - 1) - 1\) and the second printed value is \((k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1\). Otherwise, if \(k \geq n \times 2 - 2\), the values (1, 2) are printed.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an even integer in the range [2, 10^9]; `m` is an integer in the range [2, 10^9]; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `k` < `n * 2 - 2`. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, the output is `(k + 1, 1)`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, given that `0 ≤ k < n * 2 - 2`, if `k < n * 2 - 2`, the first printed value is calculated as `n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1` and the second printed value is `(k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1`. If `k` is equal to or greater than `n * 2 - 2`, the values (1, 2) are printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three integers: `n` (an even integer between 2 and 10^9), `m` (an integer between 2 and 10^9), and `k` (a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `k` < `n * m`). It modifies the value of `k` to `k % (n * 2 - 2)` and prints a pair of integers based on the value of `k`. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, it prints `(k + 1, 1)`. If `k` is between `n - 1` and `n * 2 - 2`, it calculates and prints two specific values based on `k`. If `k` is equal to or greater than `n * 2 - 2`, it prints `(1, 2)`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
