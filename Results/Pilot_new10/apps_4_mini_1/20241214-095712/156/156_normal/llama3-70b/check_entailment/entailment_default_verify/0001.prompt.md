You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You might have heard about the next game in Lara Croft series coming out this year. You also might have watched its trailer. Though you definitely missed the main idea about its plot, so let me lift the veil of secrecy.

Lara is going to explore yet another dangerous dungeon. Game designers decided to use good old 2D environment. The dungeon can be represented as a rectangle matrix of n rows and m columns. Cell (x, y) is the cell in the x-th row in the y-th column. Lara can move between the neighbouring by side cells in all four directions.

Moreover, she has even chosen the path for herself to avoid all the traps. She enters the dungeon in cell (1, 1), that is top left corner of the matrix. Then she goes down all the way to cell (n, 1) — the bottom left corner. Then she starts moving in the snake fashion — all the way to the right, one cell up, then to the left to the cell in 2-nd column, one cell up. She moves until she runs out of non-visited cells. n and m given are such that she always end up in cell (1, 2).

Lara has already moved to a neighbouring cell k times. Can you determine her current position?


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers n, m and k (2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, n is always even, 0 ≤ k < n·m). Note that k doesn't fit into 32-bit integer type!


-----Output-----

Print the cell (the row and the column where the cell is situated) where Lara ends up after she moves k times.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 0

Output
1 1

Input
4 3 11

Output
1 2

Input
4 3 7

Output
3 2



-----Note-----

Here is her path on matrix 4 by 3: [Image]
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    k %= n * 2 - 2
    if k < n - 1:
        print(k + 1, 1)
    elif k < n * 2 - 2:
        print(n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1, (k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1)
    else:
        print(1, 2)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given program is intended to determine Lara's current position in a dungeon represented as a matrix after she has moved `k` times. However, there's a flaw in the handling of the value `k`. 

1. **Boundary Case**: The program states that `k` should be taken modulo `n * 2 - 2`. However, this doesn't effectively handle the case where `k` is close to the maximum possible. For example, if `n = 4`, `m = 3`, and `k = 11` (which maps to the maximum potential moves in a 4x3 dungeon), the program would incorrectly output `(1, 2)` instead of `(3, 2)` because it handles the condition of `k` incorrectly.

2. **Range of `k`**: While `k` is correctly bounded between `0` and `nm - 1`, the logic to calculate the end positions based on `k` does not take full consideration of the zigzagging pattern that Lara follows after her initial downward movement. Specifically, the process to compute the row and column indices fails in cases where `k` leads to positions in the upper row outside the specified bounds after all downward traversals begin.

An example that exposes the flaw is:
- For input `n = 4`, `m = 3`, `k = 8`, the actual path reaches (3, 2). The program incorrectly would output a position or demonstrate undefined behavior through the current checks.

These issues indicate that the program does not satisfy all cases as described in the problem statement, thus it is incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts three integers: `n` (an even integer between 2 and 10^9), `m` (an integer between 2 and 10^9), and `k` (a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `k` < `n * m`). It modifies the value of `k` to `k % (n * 2 - 2)` and prints a pair of integers based on the value of `k`. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, it prints `(k + 1, 1)`. If `k` is between `n - 1` and `n * 2 - 2`, it calculates and prints two specific values based on `k`. If `k` is equal to or greater than `n * 2 - 2`, it prints `(1, 2)`. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
