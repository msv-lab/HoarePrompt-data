You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You might have heard about the next game in Lara Croft series coming out this year. You also might have watched its trailer. Though you definitely missed the main idea about its plot, so let me lift the veil of secrecy.

Lara is going to explore yet another dangerous dungeon. Game designers decided to use good old 2D environment. The dungeon can be represented as a rectangle matrix of n rows and m columns. Cell (x, y) is the cell in the x-th row in the y-th column. Lara can move between the neighbouring by side cells in all four directions.

Moreover, she has even chosen the path for herself to avoid all the traps. She enters the dungeon in cell (1, 1), that is top left corner of the matrix. Then she goes down all the way to cell (n, 1) — the bottom left corner. Then she starts moving in the snake fashion — all the way to the right, one cell up, then to the left to the cell in 2-nd column, one cell up. She moves until she runs out of non-visited cells. n and m given are such that she always end up in cell (1, 2).

Lara has already moved to a neighbouring cell k times. Can you determine her current position?


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers n, m and k (2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, n is always even, 0 ≤ k < n·m). Note that k doesn't fit into 32-bit integer type!


-----Output-----

Print the cell (the row and the column where the cell is situated) where Lara ends up after she moves k times.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 0

Output
1 1

Input
4 3 11

Output
1 2

Input
4 3 7

Output
3 2



-----Note-----

Here is her path on matrix 4 by 3: [Image]
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    k %= n * 2 - 2
    if k < n - 1:
        print(k + 1, 1)
    elif k < n * 2 - 2:
        print(n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1, (k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1)
    else:
        print(1, 2)


```
Original Assessment: To assess the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic of the program carefully:

The problem description specifies that Lara moves in a particular pattern through the dungeon matrix: 

1. From the top-left corner (1, 1) to the bottom-left corner (n, 1).
2. She then moves in a serpentine manner rightwards, moving up one cell and then left to the next column.
3. This continues until she runs out of unvisited cells, landing ultimately at (1, 2).

### Breakdown of the provided program:
The function computes where Lara ends up after making `k` moves:

1. The first conditional checks if `k` is less than `n - 1`, which means Lara is still moving down the first column. This is correctly handled by returning `(k + 1, 1)`.
  
2. The second conditional addresses moves made after reaching `(n, 1)`. The logic here attempts to determine Lara's row and column after she has filled the first column and has begun moving around:
   - By calculating the effective moves modulo the perimeter of the unvisited cells (`n * 2 - 2`).
   - The position is computed based on how many moves she has made from the left-bottom corner.

3. Lastly, the program assumes that if `k` is in the range of `n * 2 - 2`, she ends up at `(1, 2)` after all moves are complete.

### Testing Edge Cases:
While analyzing, we need to consider if there might be any cases the logic misses or fails, particularly with large values of `n` and `m` and with complex conditions following the serpentine movement.

#### Potential Issue Case:
Suppose:
- **Input:** `n = 4`, `m = 3`, `k = 12`
- `k` reaches the maximum possible positions (beyond the declared cells).
  
In this situation, while the modulo operation and conditions might cause it to yield a result, the logic mentioned seems incorrect. Specifically, when `k` is equal to or exceeds the total path length (in terms of cells) that Lara can reach (which is `n * m - 1`), evaluating this could yield incorrect or nonsensical positions.

There is no defined behavior for `k` = `n * m - 1`, and thus it could lead to the program returning invalid results.

### Conclusion:
Since the program fails to account for the possibility when `k` equals or exceeds the expected limits of movement based on the described logic, it does not correctly follow the problem description for every case.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9 and n is always even; k is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k < n·m.
def func():
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    k %= n * 2 - 2
    if (k < n - 1) :
        print(k + 1, 1)
    else :
        if (k < n * 2 - 2) :
            print(n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1, (k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1)
        else :
            print(1, 2)
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an even integer in the range [2, 10^9]; `m` is an integer in the range [2, 10^9]; `k` is a non-negative integer that after being updated to \(k \% (n \times 2 - 2)\) satisfies \(k \geq n - 1\) and \(0 \leq k < n \times 2 - 2\). If \(k < n \times 2 - 2\), the first printed value is calculated as \(n - (k - n + 1) \% (n - 1) - 1\) and the second printed value is \((k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1\). Otherwise, if \(k \geq n \times 2 - 2\), the values (1, 2) are printed.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an even integer in the range [2, 10^9]; `m` is an integer in the range [2, 10^9]; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `k` < `n * 2 - 2`. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, the output is `(k + 1, 1)`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, given that `0 ≤ k < n * 2 - 2`, if `k < n * 2 - 2`, the first printed value is calculated as `n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1` and the second printed value is `(k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1`. If `k` is equal to or greater than `n * 2 - 2`, the values (1, 2) are printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three integers: `n` (an even integer between 2 and 10^9), `m` (an integer between 2 and 10^9), and `k` (a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `k` < `n * m`). It modifies the value of `k` to `k % (n * 2 - 2)` and prints a pair of integers based on the value of `k`. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, it prints `(k + 1, 1)`. If `k` is between `n - 1` and `n * 2 - 2`, it calculates and prints two specific values based on `k`. If `k` is equal to or greater than `n * 2 - 2`, it prints `(1, 2)`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
