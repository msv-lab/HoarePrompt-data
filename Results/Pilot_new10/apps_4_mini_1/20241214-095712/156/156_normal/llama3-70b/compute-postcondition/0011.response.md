The function `func` does not explicitly accept parameters as arguments; however, it relies on three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `k`. The parameter `n` is an even integer, and its value is constrained to be between 2 and \(10^9\). The parameter `m` is an integer constrained to the same range as `n`. The parameter `k` is a non-negative integer constrained to be less than the product of `n` and `m`.

Given the constraints, the function is expected to perform operations based on these parameters, but the exact return value is not provided in the output information. Therefore, we can summarize the following:

Functionality: **The function relies on parameters n (even integer), m (integer), and k (non-negative integer), where 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k < n·m. The specific return value based on those parameters is not defined.**
