You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A string is called bracket sequence if it does not contain any characters other than "(" and ")". A bracket sequence is called regular if it it is possible to obtain correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters "+" and "1" into this sequence. For example, "", "(())" and "()()" are regular bracket sequences; "))" and ")((" are bracket sequences (but not regular ones), and "(a)" and "(1)+(1)" are not bracket sequences at all.

You have a number of strings; each string is a bracket sequence of length $2$. So, overall you have $cnt_1$ strings "((", $cnt_2$ strings "()", $cnt_3$ strings ")(" and $cnt_4$ strings "))". You want to write all these strings in some order, one after another; after that, you will get a long bracket sequence of length $2(cnt_1 + cnt_2 + cnt_3 + cnt_4)$. You wonder: is it possible to choose some order of the strings you have such that you will get a regular bracket sequence? Note that you may not remove any characters or strings, and you may not add anything either.


-----Input-----

The input consists of four lines, $i$-th of them contains one integer $cnt_i$ ($0 \le cnt_i \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Print one integer: $1$ if it is possible to form a regular bracket sequence by choosing the correct order of the given strings, $0$ otherwise.

-----Note-----

In the first example it is possible to construct a string "(())()(()((()()()())))", which is a regular bracket sequence.

In the second example it is possible to construct a string "", which is a regular bracket sequence.
Program:
```
def func():
    (cnt1, cnt2, cnt3, cnt4) = map(int, [input() for _ in range(4)])
    if cnt3 > cnt1:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(1)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let’s analyze the program in detail.

The problem asks whether it's possible to form a regular bracket sequence from the given counts of different 2-character strings: `( (`, `()`, `) (`, and `) )`. The key conditions for creating a regular bracket sequence are:

1. The number of closing brackets `)` cannot exceed the number of opening brackets `(` at any point in the sequence, and
2. The total number of `(` must be equal to the total number of `)` at the end of the sequence.

Given the counts `cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt3`, and `cnt4`:
- `cnt1` corresponds to `((`
- `cnt2` corresponds to `()`
- `cnt3` corresponds to `)(`
- `cnt4` corresponds to `)`

From the analysis of the program:

1. The first condition checks if the number of `)(` sequences (`cnt3`) is greater than the number of `((` sequences (`cnt1`). This is indeed important because every `)(` will need a corresponding `(` before it to remain balanced. If `cnt3` is greater than `cnt1`, it's impossible to form a valid sequence, and it correctly outputs `0`.
  
2. However, the program does not consider the number of `)` brackets properly. Although it checks just `cnt3 > cnt1`, it neglects to verify if the total count of `(` and `)` (which should balance out) are valid. 

For instance, if `cnt1 = 1`, `cnt2 = 0`, `cnt3 = 1`, and `cnt4 = 1`, there are not enough open brackets to match the close brackets. This needs another layer of logic that sums up the specific totals of opening and closing brackets. The condition `cnt1 - cnt3 < 0` and `cnt4` should also be taken into account to verify that there’s enough initial opening brackets to accommodate all closing brackets. 

A counterexample:
- If the inputs are `cnt1 = 0`, `cnt2 = 0`, `cnt3 = 1`, `cnt4 = 1`, the output should return `0` as there are more closing brackets than opening brackets, which is not handled by the current implementation.

Therefore, the correct assessment of the program shows that it does not take into account forces and balances present in all cases, ultimately leading to incorrect conclusions in edge cases.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts four non-negative integers as input, cnt1, cnt2, cnt3, and cnt4. It compares cnt3 with cnt1 and prints 0 if cnt3 is greater than cnt1, and 1 if cnt3 is less than or equal to cnt1. The values of cnt2 and cnt4 are taken as input but are not used in the function's logic. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
