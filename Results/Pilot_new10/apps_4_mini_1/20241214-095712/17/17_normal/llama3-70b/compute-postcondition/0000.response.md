The code reads four integers from input and assigns them to the variables `cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt3`, and `cnt4` using the `map` function, which converts the input strings to integers. The initial state of `cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4` being non-negative integers is still valid after the execution, but their values have changed to the respective inputs. 

Output State: **`cnt_1` is the first input integer, `cnt_2` is the second input integer, `cnt_3` is the third input integer, `cnt_4` is the fourth input integer**
