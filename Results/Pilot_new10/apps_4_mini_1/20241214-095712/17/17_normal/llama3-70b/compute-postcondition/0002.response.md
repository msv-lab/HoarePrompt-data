The code `print(0)` outputs the value 0 but does not change any variables or their values. The values of `cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the preconditions.

Output State: **`cnt_1` is the first input integer, `cnt_2` is the second input integer, `cnt_3` is the third input integer, `cnt_4` is the fourth input integer, and the output 0 is printed.**
