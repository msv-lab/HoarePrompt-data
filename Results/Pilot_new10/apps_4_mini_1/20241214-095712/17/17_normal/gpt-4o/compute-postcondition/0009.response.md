The function `func` does not accept any parameters. After executing the function body, it uses four non-negative integers: `cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4`, each of which is within the range of 0 to 10^9. However, since there are no details provided regarding the actual output or behavior based on these integers, we cannot infer specific conditions for returning values. Therefore, the functionality is not clearly defined based on the provided information about the outputs. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its output based on cnt_1, cnt_2, cnt_3, and cnt_4 is not specified.**
