Postcondition: ***`cnt_1` is a non-negative integer, `cnt_2` is an integer, `cnt_3` is an integer within the range 0 to 10^9, and `cnt_4` is a non-negative integer. If the sum of `cnt_1` and `cnt_2` equals the sum of `cnt_3` and `cnt_4` and `cnt_2` is greater than or equal to `cnt_3`, the value `1` has been printed. Otherwise, either the sum of `cnt_1` and `cnt_2` does not equal the sum of `cnt_3` and `cnt_4` or `cnt_2` is less than `cnt_3`.***
