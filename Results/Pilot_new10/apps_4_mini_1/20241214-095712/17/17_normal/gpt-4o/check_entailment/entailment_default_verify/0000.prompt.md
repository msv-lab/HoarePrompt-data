You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A string is called bracket sequence if it does not contain any characters other than "(" and ")". A bracket sequence is called regular if it it is possible to obtain correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters "+" and "1" into this sequence. For example, "", "(())" and "()()" are regular bracket sequences; "))" and ")((" are bracket sequences (but not regular ones), and "(a)" and "(1)+(1)" are not bracket sequences at all.

You have a number of strings; each string is a bracket sequence of length $2$. So, overall you have $cnt_1$ strings "((", $cnt_2$ strings "()", $cnt_3$ strings ")(" and $cnt_4$ strings "))". You want to write all these strings in some order, one after another; after that, you will get a long bracket sequence of length $2(cnt_1 + cnt_2 + cnt_3 + cnt_4)$. You wonder: is it possible to choose some order of the strings you have such that you will get a regular bracket sequence? Note that you may not remove any characters or strings, and you may not add anything either.


-----Input-----

The input consists of four lines, $i$-th of them contains one integer $cnt_i$ ($0 \le cnt_i \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Print one integer: $1$ if it is possible to form a regular bracket sequence by choosing the correct order of the given strings, $0$ otherwise.

-----Note-----

In the first example it is possible to construct a string "(())()(()((()()()())))", which is a regular bracket sequence.

In the second example it is possible to construct a string "", which is a regular bracket sequence.
Program:
```
def func():
    cnt1 = int(input())
    cnt2 = int(input())
    cnt3 = int(input())
    cnt4 = int(input())
    if cnt1 + cnt2 == cnt3 + cnt4 and cnt2 >= cnt3:
        print(1)
    else:
        print(0)


```
Original Assessment: To determine if the provided program fulfills the specified problem description, we need to analyze the logic used in the program and see if it covers all potential scenarios.

Given the problem description:
1. We're allowed to count strings of specific forms: "((", "()", ")(", and "))".
2. A valid regular bracket sequence is formed if:
   - The total number of opening brackets (from "((" and "()") equals the total number of closing brackets (from ")(" and "))").
   - The number of remaining unmatched opening brackets (from "()" and "((") must be sufficient to match the unmatched closing brackets.

The program reads four integers which represent the counts of these strings and checks:
- If the total number of opening brackets is equal to the total number of closing brackets.
- If the count of "()" (which can balance out closing brackets) is greater than or equal to the count of ")(" (which introduces unmatched closings).

### Analyzing the Program Logic:
The provided program checks:
- `cnt1 + cnt2 == cnt3 + cnt4`: This condition ensures that all opening brackets can potentially be matched by closing brackets.
- `cnt2 >= cnt3`: This condition checks if we have enough "()" to balance out any unmatched closing brackets from the ")(".

### Edge Cases:
- If we have all zeros (0, 0, 0, 0), this is a trivial case where no brackets exist, but it is still a valid sequence (output should be 1).
- The condition `cnt1 + cnt2 == cnt3 + cnt4` ensures that all openings match the closings, but it does not cover the case when `cnt1` is very high compared to `cnt3`. For instance, if `cnt1 = 5`, `cnt2 = 0`, `cnt3 = 0`, and `cnt4 = 0`, we have a mismatch in the brackets where there are too many openings without the capability to close them, yielding an invalid sequence even though it satisfies the first condition.

### Counter Example:
Suppose:
- cnt1 = 5 (five "((" strings)
- cnt2 = 0 (no "()" strings)
- cnt3 = 0 (no ")(" strings)
- cnt4 = 0 (no "))" strings)

The program would evaluate:
- `cnt1 + cnt2 == cnt3 + cnt4` â†’ `5 + 0 == 0 + 0` (False, so output is 0)
However, there is no sequence possible with 5 unmatched opening brackets, thus making the output truly invalid in terms of forming a regular sequence.

Therefore, we find that all conditions are not properly checked to determine whether a valid sequence can indeed be formed based on a balanced view of unmatched opening and closing brackets.

### Conclusion:
Given this analysis, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function does not accept any parameters and reads four non-negative integers from input. It checks if the sum of the first two integers equals the sum of the last two integers and if the second integer is greater than or equal to the third integer. It prints `1` if both conditions are met; otherwise, it prints `0`. The function does not handle any edge cases for invalid inputs, and it relies on the assumption that the inputs will always be within the specified range (0 to 10^9). 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
