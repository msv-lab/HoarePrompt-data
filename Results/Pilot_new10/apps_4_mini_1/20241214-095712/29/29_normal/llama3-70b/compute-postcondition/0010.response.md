`files` will now contain the original tuples plus an appended new tuple consisting of `name` (a string value from input) and `int(type_)` (the integer value converted from user input). The initial state indicates that `n` is at least 2, and since `files` originally contains at least two tuples, it will now contain at least three tuples after appending the new tuple. The states of `n` and the original tuples in `files` are unchanged, but the number of tuples in `files` has increased.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2; `files` contains at least three tuples: the original tuples and the new tuple (`name`, `int(type_)`).**
