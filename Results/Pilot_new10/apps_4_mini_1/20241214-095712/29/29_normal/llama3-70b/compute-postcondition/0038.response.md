The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, but it relies on the input provided through standard input. The input consists of a positive integer `n`, followed by `n` lines, each containing a distinct filename made up of digits and lowercase English letters (1 to 6 characters) and a type indicator (0 or 1). The function processes these filenames and type indicators. 

Based on the output described, the function is expected to categorize or handle the filenames according to their type indicators. However, since no specific output behavior is provided, we cannot detail the return value.

Functionality: **The function processes a number of distinct filenames and their type indicators from standard input, categorizing them based on the provided indicators but does not specify the return value or output behavior.**
