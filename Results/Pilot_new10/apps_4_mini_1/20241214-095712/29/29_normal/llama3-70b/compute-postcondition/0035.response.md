According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `script`. If `script` has more lines remaining, the loop will execute again for the next line. Since at the end of the last iteration the value of `line` has been printed, the next value in the `script` must be assigned to `line`.

If `script` is non-empty, `line` must correspond to the next line. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `script` must have at least one more line, making it necessary for the length of `script` to be more than the current index of `line`.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is sorted in descending order based on the second element of each tuple, `script` is non-empty with at least one more line remaining, `line` is the next line in the script after the printed line**
