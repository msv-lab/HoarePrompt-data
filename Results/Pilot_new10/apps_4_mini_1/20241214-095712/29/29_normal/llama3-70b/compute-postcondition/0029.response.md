To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished executing, we need to analyze the structure of the loop and the existing conditions based on the initial state.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates over `regular`, starting the index `i` from `len(examples) + 1`. For each iteration, it appends a string formatted as `'move {file} {i}'` to the list `script`, where `file` is derived from the `regular` list.

Given that:
- `examples` must have at least one element for the loop to execute at all.
- The number of iterations will depend on the length of `regular`, which has to contain enough entries.

### Final State After Loop Execution:
1. If the loop executes, it will append multiple entries to `script` based on the contents of `regular`.
2. Given that it starts from `len(examples) + 1`, if `len(examples)` is \( k \), then the loop executes until there are no more entries in `regular`.
3. If the loop runs completely, it will append \( \text{len(regular)} - (k + 1) \) entries to `script`, meaning the final value of `i` will be \( \text{len(regular)} + 1 \).
4. If `examples` is empty, `script` remains empty since the loop doesn’t execute.

### Output Statement:
- If `examples` is empty (loop doesn't execute), the values are as follows:
  - `n` remains unchanged (still within range \( 1 \le n \le 100000 \)).
  - `files` remains sorted in descending order based on the second element of each tuple.
  - `examples` remains as an empty list.
  - `script` is empty.

- If `examples` has at least one element, the values are:
  - The final state of `script` will have all the appended strings during the loop iterations, indicating the `file` and the corresponding incremented `i`.
  - The loop's execution depends on the length of `regular`, which must be at least `len(examples) + 1`.

Putting this together:

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is sorted in descending order based on the second element of each tuple, `examples` must have at least 1 element if the loop executed, `script` contains strings formatted as 'move {file} {i}' for each `file` in `regular`, where `i` ranges from `len(examples) + 1` to `len(regular) + 1`, and if `examples` is empty, `script` remains empty.**
