To determine which states need to be adjusted for the for loop to execute, let's analyze the provided information step by step:

1. The loop iterates over `regular` using `enumerate`, starting from `len(examples) + 1`. Thus, for the loop to execute, `regular` should be non-empty, meaning it must contain at least one element.

2. The variable `i` will start from `len(examples) + 1`, which ensures that `i` is at least 1 greater than the number of `examples`. 

3. The state before the loop indicates that `n` is an integer between 1 and 100,000, `files` is sorted, `examples` is a list tied to the items in `files`, and if `examples` is empty, `script` becomes empty. Given that the `script` variable relates to `examples`, its contents depend on `examples` containing at least elements where the second element of the tuples from `files` is equal to 1. 

4. If `examples` is empty, the length `len(examples)` is 0, making `i` start from 1. Importantly, to iterate over `regular`, it must be a non-empty list; otherwise, the loop will not execute.

Therefore, the needed adjustments to the state before the execution of the loop are as follows:

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is sorted in descending order based on the second element of each tuple, `examples` must have at least 1 element, `script` contains strings for each element in `examples`, `i` is starting from `len(examples) + 1 (which is at least 1)`**.
