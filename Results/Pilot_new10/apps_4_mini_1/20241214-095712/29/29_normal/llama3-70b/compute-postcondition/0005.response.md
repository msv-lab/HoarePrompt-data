According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute for each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 1, indicating that it has not yet reached 0. As each iteration of the loop reduces `n` by 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 2. The loop variable `_` does not affect the rest of the state, so it can be considered as an unused variable.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `files` contains one tuple with (`name`, `int(type_)`), `name` is an input string, `type_` is an input string converted to an integer**
