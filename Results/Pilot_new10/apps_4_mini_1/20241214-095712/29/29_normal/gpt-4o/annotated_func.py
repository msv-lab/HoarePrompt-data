#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000) representing the number of files with tests, and files is a list of n tuples where each tuple contains a string (the filename) consisting of digits and small English letters (length from 1 to 6), and an integer (type) which is either 0 or 1, indicating whether the file is a regular test (0) or an example test (1). The filenames are guaranteed to be distinct.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `examples` contains all filenames with potentially updated string representations, `moves` includes all appropriate move commands generated, `temp_counter` exceeds `2 * n` and is incremented appropriately for every iteration, `regulars` is updated such that all `regulars[i]` equal their final target values.
    return moves
    #The program returns all appropriate move commands generated which are contained in 'moves'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` strings representing filenames and their associated types (0 for regular tests and 1 for example tests). It generates and returns a list of move commands to reorganize the filenames based on their types. If filenames are not in their expected positions, it generates commands to move them to new temporary positions or to their final target positions, while ensuring that each filename's representation conforms to a specific ordering. The code does not handle potential cases where the `files` list may contain invalid entries or types beyond the expected '0' and '1', nor does it enforce the correctness of the input formatting for filenames.
