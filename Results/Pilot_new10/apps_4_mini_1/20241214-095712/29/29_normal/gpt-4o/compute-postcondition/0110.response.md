Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, `i` is now equal to `len(regulars)`, `moves` includes the commands up to `move str(temp_counter - 1) len(examples) + (i - 1) + 1` for all valid iterations, and the loop won't execute because both conditions `temp_counter <= 2 * n` and `str(temp_counter) in files_set` are not satisfied.**
