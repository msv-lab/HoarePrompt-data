To determine what needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the provided conditions and the state:

1. The loop condition is `temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set`.
2. At the end of the last iteration:
   - `temp_counter` is greater than 6,
   - `n` must be greater than 2.5,
   - `examples` contains at least 2 filenames (this means `files_set` contains at least 2 strings).

Now we need to consider each part of the loop condition:

- Since `temp_counter` is greater than 6, for `temp_counter <= 2 * n` to hold true, `n` must be adjusted. Given `n` is currently just stated to be greater than 2.5, we need to find an upper bound for `n` that still allows `temp_counter` to satisfy the loop condition. Since `temp_counter` is greater than 6, we need:
  
  \[ 6 < 2 * n \]
  
  This simplifies to:
  
  \[ n > 3 \]
  
- Additionally, `str(temp_counter) in files_set` must hold true for the loop condition. If `temp_counter` is, for example, 7, then `files_set` must contain the string "7".

From the established conditions:
- We have already noted that `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again because `temp_counter` is greater than 6.

Since `temp_counter` being greater than 6 implies it will not satisfy the condition with any `n` less than or equal to 3. 

Considering that `n` is currently stated to be greater than 2.5, we revise it to ensure that for the loop to execute again:
- `n` must be greater than 3. 

State: **`examples` contains at least 2 filenames, `i` is 1, `temp_counter` is greater than 6, and `n` must be greater than 3**
