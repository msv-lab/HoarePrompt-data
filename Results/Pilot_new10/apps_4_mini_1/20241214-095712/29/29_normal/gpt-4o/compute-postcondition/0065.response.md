Postcondition: ***`examples` contains at least 3 filenames, `temp_counter` is greater than 5, and if `examples[2]` does not equal `str(3)`, then `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n + 1`, `i` is 2, `examples` contains at least 2 previous filenames, and `n` is at least 3. The current value of `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`.***
