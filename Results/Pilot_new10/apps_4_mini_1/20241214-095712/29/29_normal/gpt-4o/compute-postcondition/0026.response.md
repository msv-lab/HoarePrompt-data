According to the code, for the `while` loop to execute again, both conditions need to be satisfied: `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` must be present in `files_set`. At the end of the last iteration, `temp_counter` has been incremented by 1, which means its current value is `temp_counter + 1`. 

Given that `i` is 0 and `examples` contains at least one filename, we haven't been provided with the current value of `n`, the initial value of `temp_counter`, or the contents of `files_set`. However, we know that `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n` to continue the loop execution. Thus, if `temp_counter` was equal to `2 * n`, we need to ensure that the current count remains 2 or less than it, requiring `n` to be adjusted accordingly.

Also, since `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`, the contents of `files_set` need to include the string representation of what `temp_counter` will be after this increment.

Therefore, `temp_counter` must currently be less than or equal to `2 * n - 1` (ensuring the next value is still included in the range) and `files_set` must contain the string representation of this updated `temp_counter`.

State: **`examples` contains at least 1 filename, `i` is 0, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n - 1 and str(temp_counter + 1) must be in files_set**
