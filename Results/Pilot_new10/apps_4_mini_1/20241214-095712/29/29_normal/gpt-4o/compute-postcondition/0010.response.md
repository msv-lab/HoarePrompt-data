Initial State: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list of n tuples containing filenames and types, `file` is the second tuple in `files`.

The line of code `name, type_ = file.split()` suggests that `file` should be a string that can be split into two parts, which will be stored in the variables `name` and `type_`. However, in the current state, `file` is defined as the second tuple in `files`, which does not directly support the `split()` method since tuples do not have a `split()` function.

If we take the assumption that `file` is a string representation of a tuple (like `"filename.txt image"`), then `name` would capture the first part (the filename) and `type_` would capture the second part (the type). 

Here's the impact of the code:
- If `file` consists of a string that can be split (which we assume must be the case here based on the intention of the code), then `name` and `type_` will be assigned the respective parts of that string.

However, based on the defined state `file` is actually a tuple, and for tuples, the code will throw an error. The values of `files`, `n`, and `file` remain the same but cannot extract `name` and `type_` due to the type conflict.

Therefore, the output state considers the assumption that the operation is valid, but since it cannot be, the most accurate reflection of the state is just to mention the integrity of other variables remains intact.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list of n tuples containing filenames and types, `file` is the second tuple in `files`, and `name` and `type_` cannot be assigned due to an error in calling `split()` on a tuple instead of a string.**
