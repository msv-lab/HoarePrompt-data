The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, but the specific value is not provided. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged. 

Thus, the Output State will reflect that `temp_counter` has increased by 1.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, `i` is now equal to `len(regulars)`, `moves` includes the command `move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}` appended to the existing commands for all valid iterations; `regulars[i]` is now equal to `str(temp_counter + 1)`**.
