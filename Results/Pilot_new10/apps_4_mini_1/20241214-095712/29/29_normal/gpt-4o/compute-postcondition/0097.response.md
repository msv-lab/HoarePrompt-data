The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Since it was previously greater than `2 * n`, it will still be greater than `2 * n` after the update. The other variables remain unchanged, and the specific relationship regarding the incremented value of `temp_counter` is preserved. 

Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, `temp_counter` has incremented by 1, `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, `examples` still contains all filenames with potentially updated string representations, `moves` includes the command `move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}`, `regulars[i]` is equal to `str(temp_counter)`, `target` is equal to `len(examples) + i + 1`.**
