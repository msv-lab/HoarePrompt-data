Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than or equal to `n + 1 + the number of moves appended` and less than or equal to `2 * n + the number of iterations executed`, `str(temp_counter)` must be included in `files_set`. If the loop executed, the final value of `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n` and the current value of `regulars[i]` remains unchanged.**
