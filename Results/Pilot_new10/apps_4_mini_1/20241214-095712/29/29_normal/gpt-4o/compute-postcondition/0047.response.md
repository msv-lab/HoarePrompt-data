The code assigns the value of `temp_counter` (which is greater than 4) to `examples[i]`, where `i` is currently 1. Since `temp_counter` is greater than 4, `examples[1]` will now hold a string representation of that value. The state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State will be updated to reflect this change.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than `4`, `examples` contains at least 2 filenames, `i` is 1, `examples[1]` is a string representation of `temp_counter`**
