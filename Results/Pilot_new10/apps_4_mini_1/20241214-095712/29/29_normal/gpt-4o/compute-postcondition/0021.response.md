The value of `temp_counter` is assigned to be `n + 1`. The variable `n` is referenced, but its specific value is not provided in the initial state description. The other variables `examples`, `regulars`, and `moves` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `examples` contains all filenames from `files` with type '1', `regulars` contains all filenames from `files` with type not equal to '1', and `temp_counter` is equal to `n + 1`.

Output State: **`examples` contains all filenames from `files` with type '1', `regulars` contains all filenames from `files` with type not equal to '1', `moves` is an empty list, and `temp_counter` is equal to `n + 1`.**
