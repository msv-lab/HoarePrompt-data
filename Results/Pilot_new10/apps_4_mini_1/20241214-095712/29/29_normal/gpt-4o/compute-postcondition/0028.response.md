According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `temp_counter` and `n`, as well as the condition involving `files_set`. The conditions for the loop to execute again are:

1. `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
2. `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `temp_counter` was incremented by 1, so its value is currently `temp_counter + 1`.
- `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n - 1`, so for the loop to execute one more time, it must currently be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
- It is necessary that `str(temp_counter + 1)` is in `files_set` for the loop to execute again.

Since `temp_counter` is currently incremented by 1, we can denote its new value as `temp_counter + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, it would also require that `temp_counter + 1` (the new value) is less than or equal to `2 * n` and that `str(temp_counter + 1)` is within `files_set`.

Thus, `temp_counter` must be equal to `2 * n - 1` or less, and also, `str(temp_counter + 1)` must be in `files_set`. 

No other states need adjustment as the remaining conditions regarding the initial values of `examples` and `i` are already sufficient for the loop to execute again.

State: **examples contains at least 1 filename, `i` is 0, `temp_counter` must be equal to or less than `2 * n - 1`, and `str(temp_counter + 1)` must be in `files_set`.**
