The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The previous constraint that `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n` still holds, so the new value of `temp_counter` is now either `temp_counter + 1` (if it was originally less than `2 * n`) or it would violate that constraint if `temp_counter` was already equal to `2 * n`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`examples` contains all filenames with potentially updated string representations; `moves` includes an additional command `move {regulars[i]} {target}`; `temp_counter` is now `temp_counter + 1`, which may violate the condition if it was previously `2 * n`; `files_set` includes `str(temp_counter)`; `regulars[i]` is now `str(temp_counter)`; `i` is now `i + 1` and less than `len(regulars)`; `target` is `len(examples) + i + 1`.**
