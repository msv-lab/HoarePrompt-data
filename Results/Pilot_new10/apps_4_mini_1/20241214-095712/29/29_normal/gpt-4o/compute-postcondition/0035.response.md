Postcondition: ***`examples` contains at least 1 filename, `i` is 0, `temp_counter` is greater than 4, `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, and the current value of `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`. The string `move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}` continues to be appended to `moves`, and `examples[i]` is equal to `str(temp_counter)`.***
