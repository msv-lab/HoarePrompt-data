The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `files`. Parameter `n` is a positive integer that represents the number of files with tests, constrained between 1 and 100000. Parameter `files` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple consists of a string (the filename) containing digits and small English letters with a length between 1 and 6, and an integer (type) which can either be 0 (indicating a regular test) or 1 (indicating an example test). The filenames in the list are guaranteed to be distinct. After executing the function, it returns a collection of all appropriate move commands generated, which are contained in `moves`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` tuples `files`, and returns all appropriate move commands generated contained in `moves`.**
