Output State: **`examples` contains all filenames with potentially updated string representations, `regulars[i]` is now equal to `str(temp_counter)`, `moves` includes the new command `move str(temp_counter) len(examples) + i + 1`, `temp_counter` is now `temp_counter + 1`, which is less than or equal to `2 * n`, `str(temp_counter)` is still in `files_set`, `i` is now `i + 1` and less than `len(regulars)`; `target` is equal to `len(examples) + i + 1`.**
