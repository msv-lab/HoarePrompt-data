Postcondition: ***`examples` contains all filenames with potentially updated string representations. `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, and `i` has been updated to equal `len(regulars)`. `moves` includes the command `move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}` appended. Additionally, `regulars[i]` has been updated to equal `str(temp_counter + 1)`, and currently, `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`.***
