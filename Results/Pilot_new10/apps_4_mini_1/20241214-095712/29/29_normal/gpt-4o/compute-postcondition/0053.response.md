According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to the length of the `examples` list. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `examples` contains at least 2 filenames, meaning the length of `examples` is at least 2. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1, resulting in `i` being 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be less than the length of `examples`, which must be at least 3 since `i` is now 2.

State: **`examples` contains at least 3 filenames, `i` is 2, `temp_counter` is greater than 5.**
