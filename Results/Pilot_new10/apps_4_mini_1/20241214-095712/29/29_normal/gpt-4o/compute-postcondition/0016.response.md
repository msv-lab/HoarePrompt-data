The variable `examples` is assumed to be a list that is collecting filenames. The code appends the filename `name` to the `examples` list. The initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer and `files` contains a list of tuples representing filenames and their types, but the contents of those tuples are not changed by this operation.

Since the variable `name` holds the filename extracted from the `files` list, it will be added to `examples`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `files`, and `type_`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list of n tuples containing filenames and types; `examples` now contains `name` as an additional filename.**
