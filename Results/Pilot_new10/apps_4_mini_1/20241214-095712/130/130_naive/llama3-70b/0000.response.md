To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the requirements and what the function is implementing.

### Problem requirements:
1. There are `N` different collectible coins.
2. Ivan currently has `K` of those coins.
3. `M` friends plan to gift Ivan coins, but each friend must gift the same number of coins.
4. There must be at least `L` new coins added to Ivan's collection from the gifts.
5. All coins gifted must be different.

### Key conditions:
- All `M` friends must gift the same quantity of coins, denoted as `x`. Therefore, the total number of coins gifted is `M * x`.
- All the coins gifted must be different, so the total number of different coins gifted (`M * x`) must not exceed `N`.
- To ensure that at least `L` coins are new, we need that the number of new coins gifted is at least `L` which also translates to the condition that:
  - `M * x` (total coins gifted) minus `K` (coins Ivan already has) must be at least `L`.

### Assessing the existing code:

The logic in the provided program checks:
- If `M >= N - K + 1` (this means that the number of friends must be able to gift enough different coins)
- If `M >= L` (the total number of friends should also be enough to find at least `L` new coins).

However, it misses the check on `x`. The program prints `1` directly if both condition checks are satisfied without determining the actual minimum `x` which should satisfy both the uniqueness of coins gifted and the requirement for new coins.

### Examples where the function fails:
1. Case where `N=5`, `M=3`, `K=2`, `L=2`.
   - Here, since Ivan has 2 coins out of 5, he can potentially get 3 new coins. However, to satisfy the requirement that all friends must give the same amount, the code would only print `1` without ensuring it satisfies the uniqueness and L conditions correctly based on `x`.
   - Given the conditions, `x` needs to be `1`, and thus there is a possibility of gifting 3 different coins when `N` only allows for `3` new unique coins which would work, but the original code does not print `1` by correctly analyzing the situation.

2. Case where `N=10`, `M=11`, `K=2`, `L=4`.
   - Here `11` friends cannot gift Ivan different coins because there are only `10` types available, hence the output should be `-1` which is correctly checked. However, it doesn't properly handle how to determine the amount of gifts given the constraints.

In summary, while the initial checks are reasonable, they do not correctly compute the requirement of coins for the friends nor the minimum `x` correctly, which leads to potential discrepancies in the outputs required by the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to implement the necessary logic to compute the minimum number of coins one friend should gift while ensuring that all conditions and requirements are met correctly.
