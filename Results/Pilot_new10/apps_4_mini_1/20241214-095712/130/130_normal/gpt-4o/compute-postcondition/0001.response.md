The variables `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` are assigned values from standard input in the form of four integers. Since these integers are positive, the new values assigned to `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` will still respect the given conditions  (1 ≤ K ≤ N, 1 ≤ M, and 1 ≤ L). The previous values of these variables are overwritten by the values provided as input.

Output State: **`N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` are set to the respective input positive integers.**
