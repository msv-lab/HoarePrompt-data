You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Ivan is collecting coins. There are only $N$ different collectible coins, Ivan has $K$ of them. He will be celebrating his birthday soon, so all his $M$ freinds decided to gift him coins. They all agreed to three terms:  Everyone must gift as many coins as others. All coins given to Ivan must be different. Not less than $L$ coins from gifts altogether, must be new in Ivan's collection.

But his friends don't know which coins have Ivan already got in his collection. They don't want to spend money so they want to buy minimum quantity of coins, that satisfy all terms, irrespective of the Ivan's collection. Help them to find this minimum number of coins or define it's not possible to meet all the terms.


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains 4 integers $N$, $M$, $K$, $L$ ($1 \le K \le N \le 10^{18}$; $1 \le M, \,\, L \le 10^{18}$) — quantity of different coins, number of Ivan's friends, size of Ivan's collection and quantity of coins, that must be new in Ivan's collection.


-----Output-----

Print one number — minimal number of coins one friend can gift to satisfy all the conditions. If it is impossible to satisfy all three conditions print "-1" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
20 15 2 3

Output
1
Input
10 11 2 4

Output
-1


-----Note-----

In the first test, one coin from each friend is enough, as he will be presented with 15 different coins and 13 of them will definitely be new.

In the second test, Ivan has 11 friends, but there are only 10 different coins. So all friends can't present him different coins.
Program:
```
import sys

def func():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    (N, M, K, L) = map(int, input().split())
    min_x = (L + M - 1) // M
    if M * min_x <= N - K:
        print(min_x)
    else:
        print(-1)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, we will analyze the program step by step.

### Problem Description Recap
Ivan has `N` different collectible coins and `K` coins in his collection. His `M` friends must gift him coins that are distinct and must meet the condition that at least `L` of those coins are new to his collection. 

### Key Conditions
1. Each friend must gift the same number of coins.
2. All coins gifted must be distinct.
3. At least `L` of the gifted coins must be new to Ivan's collection.

### Program Analysis
The program calculates `min_x`, which is the minimum number of coins that each friend must gift to ensure at least `L` new coins are provided:
```python
min_x = (L + M - 1) // M
```
This formula essentially rounds up when `L` is not evenly divisible by `M`, ensuring that there's enough total coins gifted collectively to meet the minimum.

Next, it checks if the total number of coins the friends will gift (`M * min_x`) is less than or equal to the total number of coins available that can be given as gifts (`N - K`). If it is, it prints `min_x`, otherwise, it prints `-1`.

### Edge Cases Considered
1. When `N = K` (All collectible coins are already in Ivan's collection) and `L > 0`. In this case, we cannot satisfy the condition of giving at least `L` new coins since there are no available new coins (`N - K = 0`).
2. When `M` is greater than `N - K` or `M` is such that even the maximum distinct coins available can't satisfy the gifting condition.
3. The situation where `M` is 1, and we check if a sufficient number of coins can still be chosen.

### Example Considerations
1. **Input:** `20 15 2 3`
   - `min_x` computes to `1` since `3/15` rounds up to `1`. Therefore `M * min_x = 15` which is less than `N - K = 18`. Correct output is `1`. Works correctly.
   
2. **Input:** `10 11 2 4`
   - `min_x` computes to `1` since `4/11` rounds up to `1`. Thus `M * min_x = 11`, which exceeds `N - K = 8` (because 10 - 2 = 8). Correct output is `-1`. Works correctly.

### Tests for Other Cases
- If we take the case `N = K = 1`, `M = 1`, `L = 1`: 
  - The friends can’t gift any new coins because all collectible coins are already in the collection. Here the program should return `-1`, which it does correctly.
  
- If we take the case `N = 5, K = 3, M = 1, L = 3`: 
  - Similar reasoning applies: `min_x` would compute to `3`, but since only `2` coins can be new (`5 - 3`), the output should be `-1`. The program checks this correctly.

### Conclusion
The program seems to handle all edge cases and conditions mentioned in the problem description properly. After analyzing examples and potential edge cases, we can conclude that the program behaves correctly for all discussed scenarios.

Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of coins each of Ivan's friends must gift while satisfying all the conditions outlined in the problem statement.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys

#State of the program right berfore the function call: N, M, K, and L are positive integers such that 1 ≤ K ≤ N, 1 ≤ M, and 1 ≤ L, with constraints up to 10^18.
def func():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    N, M, K, L = map(int, input().split())
    min_x = (L + M - 1) // M
    if (M * min_x <= N - K) :
        print(min_x)
    else :
        print(-1)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`N`, `M`, `K`, `L` are positive integers, and `min_x` is calculated as `(L + M - 1) // M`. If `M * min_x` is less than or equal to `N - K`, then the value of `min_x` is printed. Otherwise, `M * min_x` is greater than `N - K`.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
