To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we will analyze both the requirements of the problem and the program's logic.

### Problem Requirements
1. **Input Constraints**: The program receives four integers: N (total different types of coins), M (number of friends), K (coins already owned by Ivan), and L (minimum new coins that must be gifted).
2. **Gifting Conditions**:
   - Each friend must gift the same number of coins.
   - All coins given must be different.
   - At least L coins must be new to Ivan's collection.

3. **Output**: The program should calculate the minimum number of coins one friend should gift to meet the conditions, or return `-1` if it is impossible.

### Program Logic
1. **Input Handling**: The first step reads the input and maps it to the variables N, M, K, and L.
2. **Calculate minimum coins per friend**: The expression `(L + M - 1) // M` is used to ensure that the total number of new coins (at least L) is distributed among M friends evenly, rounding up if necessary.
3. **Feasibility Check**: The program checks if the total coins gifted (`M * min_x`) can fit within the available new coins (`N - K`):
   - If `M * min_x <= N - K`, then it prints the minimum coins per friend (`min_x`).
   - Otherwise, it prints `-1`.

### Correctness Evaluation
1. **Validation of conditions**:
   - The program ensures that the number of new coins going to Ivan meets the minimum required (`L`).
   - It checks if there are enough different types of coins available, ensuring each friend can gift a different coin.
  
2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Case when `M > N`, directly returning `-1` since itâ€™s impossible to satisfy the distinctiveness requirement.
   - Correctly calculates and returns the minimum amount even if the total number of different coins is large.

### Conclusion
The logical flow of the program adheres to the requirements set forth in the problem statement. The conditions for gifting and the constraints on new coins are appropriately managed. Given these analyses, the program correctly handles all cases as required.

Therefore, we conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
