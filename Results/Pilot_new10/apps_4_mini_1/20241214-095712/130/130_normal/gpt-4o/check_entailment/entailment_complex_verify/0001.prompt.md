You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Ivan is collecting coins. There are only $N$ different collectible coins, Ivan has $K$ of them. He will be celebrating his birthday soon, so all his $M$ freinds decided to gift him coins. They all agreed to three terms:  Everyone must gift as many coins as others. All coins given to Ivan must be different. Not less than $L$ coins from gifts altogether, must be new in Ivan's collection.

But his friends don't know which coins have Ivan already got in his collection. They don't want to spend money so they want to buy minimum quantity of coins, that satisfy all terms, irrespective of the Ivan's collection. Help them to find this minimum number of coins or define it's not possible to meet all the terms.


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains 4 integers $N$, $M$, $K$, $L$ ($1 \le K \le N \le 10^{18}$; $1 \le M, \,\, L \le 10^{18}$) — quantity of different coins, number of Ivan's friends, size of Ivan's collection and quantity of coins, that must be new in Ivan's collection.


-----Output-----

Print one number — minimal number of coins one friend can gift to satisfy all the conditions. If it is impossible to satisfy all three conditions print "-1" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
20 15 2 3

Output
1
Input
10 11 2 4

Output
-1


-----Note-----

In the first test, one coin from each friend is enough, as he will be presented with 15 different coins and 13 of them will definitely be new.

In the second test, Ivan has 11 friends, but there are only 10 different coins. So all friends can't present him different coins.
Program:
```
import sys

def func():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    (N, M, K, L) = map(int, input().split())
    min_x = (L + M - 1) // M
    if M * min_x <= N - K:
        print(min_x)
    else:
        print(-1)


```
Original Assessment: To assess the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to evaluate if it correctly calculates the minimum number of coins each friend must gift, while adhering to the stipulations laid out.

### Conditions from the problem description:
1. All gifts must consist of different coins.
2. Each of Ivan's friends must give the same number of coins.
3. At least \( L \) coins gifted must be new to Ivan's collection.

### Analysis of the program:
1. It first calculates `min_x` as the minimum number of coins each friend should give, which is determined by the formula:
   \[
   \text{min_x} = \left\lceil \frac{L}{M} \right\rceil = \frac{L + M - 1}{M}
   \]
   This ensures that at least \( L \) new coins are given overall (because \( M \times \text{min_x} \geq L \)).
   
2. The next condition checks if the total number of coins given \( M \times \text{min_x} \) is less than or equal to the total number of new coins available \( N - K \):
   \[
   M \times \text{min_x} \leq N - K
   \]
   If this condition is satisfied, it outputs `min_x`, otherwise `-1`.

### Edge cases to consider:

1. **When Ivan already has all coins**: If \( K = N \), then there are no new coins to give. In this case, even if \( M \) and \( L \) are greater than 0, \( \text{min_x} \) would still have to be calculated, and the output should be `-1` as no new coins exist.
   
   Example: \( N = 10, M = 5, K = 10, L = 1 \)
   Expected Output: `-1` (but the program might not handle this correctly)

2. **When the number of friends exceeds the total types of coins**: For instance, if \( N < M \), it is impossible to meet the gifting conditions as friends cannot provide unique coins.
   
   Example: \( N = 5, M = 6, K = 0, L = 1 \)
   Expected Output: `-1` (should fail but might output some number incorrectly)

Analyzing cases where the friends cannot fulfill the gifting conditions should yield `-1` based on the rules. In both cases above, according to the program's logic, it may not produce the expected result.

### Conclusion:
- Given the provided code does not correctly handle cases like when Ivan already possesses all types of coins or when the number of friends exceeds unique coin types, there are valid inputs where the code would fail to meet the problem's conditions.
  
Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys

#State of the program right berfore the function call: N, M, K, and L are positive integers such that 1 ≤ K ≤ N, 1 ≤ M, and 1 ≤ L, with constraints up to 10^18.
def func():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    N, M, K, L = map(int, input().split())
    min_x = (L + M - 1) // M
    if (M * min_x <= N - K) :
        print(min_x)
    else :
        print(-1)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`N`, `M`, `K`, `L` are positive integers, and `min_x` is calculated as `(L + M - 1) // M`. If `M * min_x` is less than or equal to `N - K`, then the value of `min_x` is printed. Otherwise, `M * min_x` is greater than `N - K`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads four positive integers `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` from input, calculates `min_x`, which represents the minimum number of `M` units needed to meet or exceed `L`. If the product of `M` and `min_x` is less than or equal to `N - K`, it prints the value of `min_x`. Otherwise, it prints `-1`. This means that if the remaining units available (given by `N - K`) cannot accommodate the required units to meet `L`, the function correctly returns `-1`. The function does not explicitly return any value, it only prints the result.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
