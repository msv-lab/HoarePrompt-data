Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine the minimal number of coins each friend must gift to satisfy all the terms stated in the problem description.

1. It checks if `M` (number of friends) is greater than or equal to `N - K + 1` and `M` is also greater than or equal to `L`. If both conditions are satisfied, it prints `1`, suggesting that each friend can gift one coin.
   
2. However, the first condition `M >= N - K + 1` is flawed. This condition does not guarantee that every friend can gift a unique coin while ensuring that at least `L` coins are new. For example:
   - If Ivan has `K` coins and `M` friends, then the maximum number of coins that can be given as new coins is restricted by how many unique coins are available, which is derived from `N` (the total unique coins) minus `K` (the coins Ivan already owns).
   - The programâ€™s logic does not correctly account for the scenario in which `L` is greater than the remaining unique coins after considering Ivan's collection.

3. The correct approach would involve calculating how many new coins are needed and determining how many coins each friend must give (which could be found by dividing the necessary new coins by the number of friends) while also ensuring that there are enough coins available.

4. Additionally, if the total number of coins `N` is less than the number of friends `M`, it is impossible for every friend to gift a different coin. 

Thus, the conditions checked and the logic used in this program do not adequately cover all scenarios stipulated in the problem description. It fails to handle cases where Ivan's friends cannot provide a sufficient number of new coins or where they are not able to gift different coins, thus leading to incorrect outputs.

In summary, the program's logic does not fulfill all the requirements of the problem description, which confirms that it is incorrect.
