To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let’s analyze both the requirements and the program systematically.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Input Variables**:
   - **N**: Total different types of coins.
   - **M**: Number of friends.
   - **K**: Coins Ivan currently has.
   - **L**: Minimum number of new coins required that are not in Ivan's current collection.

2. **Conditions**:
   - Each of Ivan’s friends must give the same number of coins.
   - All coins gifted must be different.
   - At least **L** coins must be new to Ivan’s collection.

### Checking Conditions
- Since Ivan has **K** coins out of **N**, the number of coins that can be given to him that are new is at most **N - K**.
- Thus, for the friends to satisfy the requirement of offering at least **L** new coins, there must be:
  - **N - K >= L** 
- Additionally, all friends should be able to give different coins. This means:
  - **M** friends should be able to provide distinct coins, requiring at least **M** different coins. Thus:
  - **M <= N**
- Thus, we derive two inequalities that need to be satisfied:
  1. **N - K >= L** (for the requirement of new coins)
  2. **M <= N** (for the requirement of distinct coins)

### Program Analysis
The program checks:
```python
if (M >= N - K + 1 and M >= L) :
    print(1)
else :
    print(-1)
```

#### Issues in the Logic:
1. **`M >= N - K + 1`**:
   - This condition is incorrect because it implies that the number of friends must be at least `N - K + 1`. 
   - The correct logic should check if `M` (the number of friends) is less than or equal to the number of different coins remaining after accounting for what Ivan has and that `M` equals or exceeds **L**:
   - The correct condition should rather check if the number of distinct coins is sufficient and can adequately fulfill both **new coins (L)** and the unique coins requirement.

### Summary of Issue:
The condition `M >= N - K + 1` fails to satisfy the requirement for distinct coins correctly. If there are enough coins available, it should state `M` should be able to give distinct coins as long as **M <= N** holds true. 

Thus, the approach taken in the provided code does not accurately represent the conditions required to solve the problem. 

### Final Decision
Since the program produces the wrong output for the problem description based on the analysis, the correctness of the presented code should be:

Correctness: **False**
