You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Recently Vasya found a golden ticket — a sequence which consists of $n$ digits $a_1a_2\dots a_n$. Vasya considers a ticket to be lucky if it can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums. For example, ticket $350178$ is lucky since it can be divided into three segments $350$, $17$ and $8$: $3+5+0=1+7=8$. Note that each digit of sequence should belong to exactly one segment.

Help Vasya! Tell him if the golden ticket he found is lucky or not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 100$) — the number of digits in the ticket.

The second line contains $n$ digits $a_1 a_2 \dots a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le 9$) — the golden ticket. Digits are printed without spaces.


-----Output-----

If the golden ticket is lucky then print "YES", otherwise print "NO" (both case insensitive).


-----Examples-----
Input
5
73452

Output
YES

Input
4
1248

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example the ticket can be divided into $7$, $34$ and $52$: $7=3+4=5+2$.

In the second example it is impossible to divide ticket into segments with equal sum.
Program:
```
n = int(input())
ticket = list(map(int, input()))
if func_1(ticket):
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')

def func_1(ticket):
    total_sum = sum(ticket)
    if total_sum % 2 != 0:
        return False
    target_sum = total_sum // 2
    curr_sum = 0
    segments = 0
    for digit in ticket:
        curr_sum += digit
        if curr_sum == target_sum:
            segments += 1
            curr_sum = 0
    return segments >= 2


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program against the given problem description, we can analyze the logic of the function `func_1` and how it processes the input ticket.

Key points from the problem description:
1. A lucky ticket must be split into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums.
2. The input consists of an integer `n` followed by `n` digits as a sequence.

Analyzing the program:
1. It first checks if the total sum of the digits is odd. If so, it returns `False`, which is correct since an odd total cannot be split evenly.
2. If the total sum is even, it calculates the target sum (half of the total).
3. As it iterates through the digits, it maintains a `curr_sum` to accumulate the digits and counts how many segments equal the `target_sum` it can form.
4. Finally, it checks if the count of segments is at least 2 to determine if the ticket is lucky.

Now let's examine potential edge cases and scenarios where this function might fail:

1. **Minimum Case (n=2)**: Consider the input where `n = 2` and the digits are `1 1`. Here, the total sum is `2`, which is even, and the `target_sum` is `1`. The function will find `curr_sum` equal to `1` after processing the first digit and will count one segment. It will then check the second digit but reach the end without forming two segments. This should return "NO" but would return "YES" due to counting the last segment. Therefore, it incorrectly indicates that the ticket is lucky.

Given this counterexample, we can conclude that the program does not always adhere to the problem description because it fails for the case of two equal segments of minimum length.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
n = int(input())
ticket = list(map(int, input()))
if func_1(ticket):
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: ticket is a string of digits with a length between 2 and 100, where each digit is between 0 and 9.
def func_1(ticket):
    total_sum = sum(ticket)
    if (total_sum % 2 != 0) :
        return False
        #The program returns False, indicating that the current value of `total_sum`, which is the sum of the digits in the `ticket` string, is odd.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`ticket` is a string of digits with a length between 2 and 100, where each digit is between 0 and 9; `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket`, and `total_sum` is an even number.
    target_sum = total_sum // 2
    curr_sum = 0
    segments = 0
    for digit in ticket:
        curr_sum += digit
        
        if curr_sum == target_sum:
            segments += 1
            curr_sum = 0
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `ticket` is a string of digits with length between 2 and 100, `total_sum` is an even number formed by the sum of the digits in `ticket`, `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`, `curr_sum` is the sum of the digits processed and may be less than `target_sum` if there are remaining digits not forming a complete segment, and `segments` is the total number of complete segments formed that equal `target_sum`.
    return segments >= 2
    #The program returns whether the number of complete segments formed that equal `target_sum` is greater than or equal to 2


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
