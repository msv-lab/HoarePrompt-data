According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `segment_length` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `segment_length` is 1 and `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive. For the loop to execute one more time, `segment_length` needs to be increased by 1. Therefore, `segment_length` must become 2. 

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `current_sum` is the sum of the last segment of tickets that equaled `target_sum`, `segment_count` is the total number of segments whose sums equaled `target_sum`, `segment_length` is 2, `target_sum` is the result of `segment_sum(0, 0)`, and `i` is 100 if the loop executed fully. Either `current_sum` is not equal to 0 or `segment_count` is less than or equal to 1.**
