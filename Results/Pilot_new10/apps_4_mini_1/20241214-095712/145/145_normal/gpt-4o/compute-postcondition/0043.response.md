Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive. If `current_sum` is equal to `target_sum`, then `current_sum` is 0, `segment_length` is 2, `i` is 2, and `segment_count` is increased to 3. Since there is no else part, the program does not change the state when `current_sum` is not equal to `target_sum`.***
