The value of `current_sum` is updated to `0`. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 1, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is the result of `segment_sum(0, 0)`, `current_sum` is 0, and `segment_count` is 1 if `current_sum` equals `target_sum`.**
