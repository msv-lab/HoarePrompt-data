According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is stated to be an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, the loop will execute for the entire range of its value. The initialization of the loop variable `i` starts at 0 and increments with each iteration until it reaches `n-1`. 

Given the initial state, we need to indicate that the loop variable `i` should start from 0, as it will begin from there on the first execution of the loop. The other variables (`segment_length`, `target_sum`, `current_sum`, `segment_count`) do not affect whether the loop can execute. 

Thus, we summarize the state required for the loop to execute as follows:

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 0, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is the result of segment_sum(0, 0), `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 0**
