Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_length` is 2, `target_sum` is 0, `i` is n-1 if `segment_count` is greater than 0, and `segment_count` is the number of segments whose sum equals `target_sum`. If no segments matched the target sum, then `segment_count` is 0 and `i` is n-1.**
