The value of `segment_count` is incremented by 1 from its previous value (which was `1`, as stated in the initial conditions) to `2`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_length` is 2, `target_sum` is 0, `i` is 1, and `segment_count` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_length` is 2, `target_sum` is 0, `i` is 1, and `segment_count` is 2.**
