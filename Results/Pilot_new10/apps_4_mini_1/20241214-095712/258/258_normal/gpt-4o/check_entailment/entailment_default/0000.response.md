Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle edge cases correctly, as identified in the output hints for `func_3`. Specifically, while the function `func_3` reads input data correctly, it does not check for potential input issues such as incorrect formats or violations of the problem constraints (e.g., K being greater than N). As a consequence, if the provided input is malformed or inconsistent, the program may not function correctly. 

Moreover, there is no validation for the ranges of the coordinates (x, y) and hardness (c), which could lead to unexpected behavior if the input values are outside the defined constraints.

These shortcomings mean that the program does not meet the reliability expected from a solution to this problem. Thus, it fails to ensure correctness for all potential input scenarios.
