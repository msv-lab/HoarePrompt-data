You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Takahashi wants to grill N pieces of meat on a grilling net, which can be seen as a two-dimensional plane. The coordinates of the i-th piece of meat are \left(x_i, y_i\right), and its hardness is c_i.
Takahashi can use one heat source to grill the meat. If he puts the heat source at coordinates \left(X, Y\right), where X and Y are real numbers, the i-th piece of meat will be ready to eat in c_i \times \sqrt{\left(X - x_i\right)^2 + \left(Y-y_i\right)^2} seconds.
Takahashi wants to eat K pieces of meat. Find the time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready if he put the heat source to minimize this time.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N \leq 60
 - 1 \leq K \leq N
 - -1000 \leq x_i , y_i \leq 1000
 - \left(x_i, y_i\right) \neq \left(x_j, y_j\right) \left(i \neq j \right)
 - 1 \leq c_i \leq 100

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
x_1 y_1 c_1
\vdots
x_N y_N c_N

-----Output-----
Print the answer.
It will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error from our answer is at most 10^{-6}.

-----Sample Input-----
4 3
-1 0 3
0 0 3
1 0 2
1 1 40

-----Sample Output-----
2.4

If we put the heat source at \left(-0.2, 0\right), the 1-st, 2-nd, and 3-rd pieces of meat will be ready to eat within 2.4 seconds. This is the optimal place to put the heat source.

            if count >= K:
                return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `meats` remains unchanged; `K` remains unchanged; `N` remains unchanged; `count` is the number of elements in `meats` that satisfy the condition defined by the distances from the calculated midpoint `(mx, my)` to each point in `meats`, specifically such that the distance is less than or equal to `T`; if `count` is greater than or equal to `K`, the function has determined a valid configuration and would theoretically return `True`; if `count` is less than `K`, the function completes without returning any value, leaving all else unchanged.
    return False
    #The program returns False, indicating that the count of elements in 'meats' that satisfy the distance condition is less than 'K'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of tuples `meats`, where each tuple contains the coordinates and hardness of pieces of meat, an integer `K`, and a real number `T`. It checks if there exist two pieces of meat such that when considering their hardness and position, a calculated midpoint can be found that allows for at least `K` pieces of meat to be within a distance `T`. If this condition is satisfied, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. If the `meats` list is empty or does not contain sufficient data, or if no suitable pairs of meat are found, the function will return `False`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is a positive integer representing the number of pieces of meat, K is a positive integer representing the number of pieces of meat to be grilled where 1 <= K <= N, and meats is a list of tuples, each tuple containing three integers (x_i, y_i, c_i) representing the coordinates and hardness of each piece of meat, with constraints -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000 and 1 <= c_i <= 100.
def func_2(N, K, meats):
    low, high = 0, 1000000000.0
    while high - low > 1e-07:
        mid = (low + high) / 2
        
        if func_1(meats, K, mid):
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `low` is approximately equal to `high`, with both less than `1e-07` difference. The final value of `mid` represents the maximum hardness threshold for grilling `K` pieces of meat, where `N` is the initial count of meat, and `K` is the count of pieces to grill. `meats` retains its original list of tuples containing their coordinates and hardness.
    return high
    #The program returns high, which is approximately equal to low, and both are less than 1e-07 difference, representing the maximum hardness threshold for grilling K pieces of meat.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `N` representing the total number of pieces of meat, an integer `K` indicating the number of pieces to grill, and a list of tuples `meats`, where each tuple contains three integers representing the coordinates and hardness of each piece of meat. It performs a binary search to determine the maximum hardness threshold for grilling exactly `K` pieces of meat. The function returns this maximum hardness threshold as a floating-point number, where the difference between the returned value and a calculated lower bound is less than `1e-07`. This allows for precision in the threshold calculation, ensuring that the result is approximately accurate within that tolerance.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer between 1 and 60, K is an integer between 1 and N, and meats is a list of tuples, each containing three integers (x_i, y_i, c_i), where -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000, and 1 <= c_i <= 100.
def func_3():
    data = input().split()
    N = int(data[0])
    K = int(data[1])
    meats = []
    index = 2
    for _ in range(N):
        x = int(data[index])
        
        y = int(data[index + 1])
        
        c = int(data[index + 2])
        
        meats.append((x, y, c))
        
        index += 3
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is between 1 and 60; `K` is between 1 and `N`; `meats` contains `N` tuples of the form `(int(data[2]), int(data[3]), int(data[4])), ..., (int(data[3N-3]), int(data[3N-2]), int(data[3N-1]))`; `data` is a list of strings from the input; `index` is `2 + 3 * N`; `x` is equal to `int(data[3N-3])`; `y` is equal to `int(data[3N-2])`; `c` is equal to `int(data[3N-1])`.
    result = func_2(N, K, meats)
    print(f'{result:.6f}')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts input data which includes two integers, N (between 1 and 60) and K (between 1 and N), followed by a list of N tuples, each containing three integers (x, y, c) conforming to specified constraints. It processes this input to call another function with these parameters to compute a result, which it prints formatted to six decimal places. However, the function does not handle cases where the input format is incorrect or where K is greater than N, nor does it validate the ranges of x, y, and c beyond their type.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
