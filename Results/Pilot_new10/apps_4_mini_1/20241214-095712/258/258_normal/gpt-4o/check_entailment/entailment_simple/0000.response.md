To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze how the program implements the requirements.

### Problem Requirements:
1. The program should allow Takahashi to grill pieces of meat located at given coordinates with respective hardness.
2. The time to grill each piece based on the heat source's position must be calculated, and the goal is to minimize the time required to have at least K pieces ready.

### Program Structure:
- The program consists of three main functions:
  - `func_1(meats, K, T)`: Checks if it is possible to get K pieces of meat ready within time T by evaluating all possible heat source positions.
  - `func_2(N, K, meats)`: Performs a binary search on time to find the minimum time required to have K pieces of meat grilled.
  - `func_3()`: Handles input reading and invokes the other functions.

### Analysis:
1. **Functionality of `func_1(meats, K, T)`**:
   - It iterates over pairs of meats to determine possible positions (mx, my) for a heat source, calculating the time needed for each meat piece based on that position and checking if K pieces can be cooked within time T. 
   - This corresponds to the requirement of placing a heat source optimally to minimize the cooking time.

2. **Functionality of `func_2(N, K, meats)`**:
   - This function implements a binary search pattern to efficiently find the minimum T such that at least K pieces of meat can be cooked. The limits for T are set appropriately. 
   - The condition checks in a while loop confirm that the approximation of time is within the specified precision (1e-7).

3. **Main function `func_3()`**:
   - It correctly parses input data and constructs the list of meats as tuples of (x, y, c). The function calls `func_2` with this data to compute the result, which is printed with six decimal precision.

### Correctness Consideration:
- The algorithm looks at all pairs of meat pieces to investigate all possible placements of the heat source in order to find the optimal grilling position. 
- The nesting of calculations within `func_1` ensures that K pieces can be served in a valid timeframe by evaluating various candidates derived from `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`.
  
### Conclusion:
The program accurately implements the requirements set forth in the problem description. It properly calculates the cooking time based on heat source placements, evaluates whether K pieces can be cooked in a given time, and efficiently finds the minimum time through binary search.

Thus,

Correctness: **True**
