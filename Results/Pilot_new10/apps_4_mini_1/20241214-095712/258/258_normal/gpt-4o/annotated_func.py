#State of the program right berfore the function call: meats is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integer values (x_i, y_i, c_i) representing the coordinates and hardness of the pieces of meat, K is a positive integer such that 1 <= K <= len(meats), and T is a positive real number representing time.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `meats` remains unchanged; `K` remains unchanged; `N` remains unchanged; `count` is the number of elements in `meats` that satisfy the condition defined by the distances from the calculated midpoint `(mx, my)` to each point in `meats`, specifically such that the distance is less than or equal to `T`; if `count` is greater than or equal to `K`, the function has determined a valid configuration and would theoretically return `True`; if `count` is less than `K`, the function completes without returning any value, leaving all else unchanged.
    return False
    #The program returns False, indicating that the count of elements in 'meats' that satisfy the distance condition is less than 'K'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of tuples `meats`, where each tuple contains the coordinates and hardness of pieces of meat, an integer `K`, and a real number `T`. It checks if there exist two pieces of meat such that when considering their hardness and position, a calculated midpoint can be found that allows for at least `K` pieces of meat to be within a distance `T`. If this condition is satisfied, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. If the `meats` list is empty or does not contain sufficient data, or if no suitable pairs of meat are found, the function will return `False`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is a positive integer representing the number of pieces of meat, K is a positive integer representing the number of pieces of meat to be grilled where 1 <= K <= N, and meats is a list of tuples, each tuple containing three integers (x_i, y_i, c_i) representing the coordinates and hardness of each piece of meat, with constraints -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000 and 1 <= c_i <= 100.
def func_2(N, K, meats):
    low, high = 0, 1000000000.0
    while high - low > 1e-07:
        mid = (low + high) / 2
        
        if func_1(meats, K, mid):
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `low` is approximately equal to `high`, with both less than `1e-07` difference. The final value of `mid` represents the maximum hardness threshold for grilling `K` pieces of meat, where `N` is the initial count of meat, and `K` is the count of pieces to grill. `meats` retains its original list of tuples containing their coordinates and hardness.
    return high
    #The program returns high, which is approximately equal to low, and both are less than 1e-07 difference, representing the maximum hardness threshold for grilling K pieces of meat.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `N` representing the total number of pieces of meat, an integer `K` indicating the number of pieces to grill, and a list of tuples `meats`, where each tuple contains three integers representing the coordinates and hardness of each piece of meat. It performs a binary search to determine the maximum hardness threshold for grilling exactly `K` pieces of meat. The function returns this maximum hardness threshold as a floating-point number, where the difference between the returned value and a calculated lower bound is less than `1e-07`. This allows for precision in the threshold calculation, ensuring that the result is approximately accurate within that tolerance.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer between 1 and 60, K is an integer between 1 and N, and meats is a list of tuples, each containing three integers (x_i, y_i, c_i), where -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000, and 1 <= c_i <= 100.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts input data which includes two integers, N (between 1 and 60) and K (between 1 and N), followed by a list of N tuples, each containing three integers (x, y, c) conforming to specified constraints. It processes this input to call another function with these parameters to compute a result, which it prints formatted to six decimal places. However, the function does not handle cases where the input format is incorrect or where K is greater than N, nor does it validate the ranges of x, y, and c beyond their type.
