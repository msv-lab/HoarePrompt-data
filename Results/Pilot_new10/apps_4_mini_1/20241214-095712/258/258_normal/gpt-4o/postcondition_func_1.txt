The function accepts an integer `N` representing the total number of pieces of meat, an integer `K` indicating the number of pieces to grill, and a list of tuples `meats`, where each tuple contains three integers representing the coordinates and hardness of each piece of meat. It performs a binary search to determine the maximum hardness threshold for grilling exactly `K` pieces of meat. The function returns this maximum hardness threshold as a floating-point number, where the difference between the returned value and a calculated lower bound is less than `1e-07`. This allows for precision in the threshold calculation, ensuring that the result is approximately accurate within that tolerance.
