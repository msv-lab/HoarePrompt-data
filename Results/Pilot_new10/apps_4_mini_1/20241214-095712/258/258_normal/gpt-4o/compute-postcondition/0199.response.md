The code snippet calculates `d2` based on the previously defined values of `dx` and `dy`. The expression `d2 = dx * dx + dy * dy` assigns to `d2` the sum of the squares of `dx` and `dy`. 

Given:
- `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`
- `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`

Thus, after executing the code, `d2` will hold the value of `((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2)` which can be rewritten as:

`d2 = ((x1 - x2)² + (y1 - y2)²) / 4`.

The variables `meats`, `N`, `i`, `j`, `d`, `cx`, `cy` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`meats` remains unchanged; `N` is greater than `i + 3; `i` is less than `N - 1; `j` is equal to `i + 3; `d` is now `d` divided by (c1 * c2); `cx` is equal to (x1 + x2) / 2; `cy` is equal to (y1 + y2) / 2; `dx` is equal to (x1 - x2) / 2; `dy` is equal to (y1 - y2) / 2; `d2` is equal to ((x1 - x2)² + (y1 - y2)²) / 4.**
