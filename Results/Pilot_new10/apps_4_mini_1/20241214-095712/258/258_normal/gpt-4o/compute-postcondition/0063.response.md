Postcondition: ***`meats`, `K`, `T`, `N` remain unchanged; `count` is greater than or equal to `K`; `j` is equal to `i + 2`; `N` is greater than or equal to `j`; `c1 * T < c2 * T`; `d` is updated to a smaller negative value; `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`; `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`; `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`; `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`; `d2` is equal to `(dx * dx + dy * dy)`; if `d * d2 > d2`, we proceed to the next iteration of the loop. ***
