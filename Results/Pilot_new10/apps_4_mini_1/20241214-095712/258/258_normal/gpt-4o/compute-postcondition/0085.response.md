The code snippet calculates the value of `dy` based on the values of `y1` and `y2`. Given the formula `dy = (y1 - y2) / 2`, it means that `dy` will take on a new value which is half the difference between `y1` and `y2`. The other variables are unchanged, so except the value of `dy`, everything else remains the same. 

Therefore, the updated state reflects that `dy` now has a specific value, while all other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`meats`, `K`, `N` remain unchanged; `i` is less than `N`; `j` is greater than `i`; `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` maintain their previous values; `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` are set to the previous values of `x2`, `y2`, and `c2`; `c1 * T` still does not hold as greater than or equal to its previous value; `d` is now equal to `d / (c1 * c2)` where `d` remains a negative value; the loop continues to the next iteration; `cx` is equal to the previous value of `x2`; `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`; `dx` is 0; `dy` is now equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`.**
