The function `func_3` accepts three parameters: `N`, `K`, and `meats`. 

1. `N` is an integer constrained between 1 and 60.
2. `K` is an integer constrained between 1 and `N`.
3. `meats` is a list of tuples, where each tuple consists of three integers (x_i, y_i, c_i) with the following constraints:
   - -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000
   - 1 <= c_i <= 100

Based on the provided output description, the function processes these inputs and computes a result. However, the specific details of the output based on the calculations involving `N`, `K`, and `meats` are not stated.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept an integer `N`, an integer `K`, and a list of tuples `meats` and process them according to its internal logic.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `N`, `K`, and `meats`, where `N` is an integer between 1 and 60, `K` is an integer between 1 and `N`, and `meats` is a list of tuples with specific integer constraints, and it computes a result based on these inputs.**
