The variable `d2` is assigned the value of `dx * dx + dy * dy`. Given that `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2` and `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`, we can express `d2` in terms of `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, and `y2`. 

The value for `d2` becomes:
\[ 
d2 = \left(\frac{x1 - x2}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\right)^2 
\]
This results in:
\[ 
d2 = \frac{(x1 - x2)^2}{4} + \frac{(y1 - y2)^2}{4} 
\]

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: 
`meats`, `K`, and `N` remain unchanged; `i` is less than `N`; `j` is equal to `i + 1`; `count` is still less than `K`; `d` is updated to `d / (c1 * c2)`; `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`; `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`; `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`; `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`; `d2` is equal to \(\frac{(x1 - x2)^2}{4} + \frac{(y1 - y2)^2}{4}\).
