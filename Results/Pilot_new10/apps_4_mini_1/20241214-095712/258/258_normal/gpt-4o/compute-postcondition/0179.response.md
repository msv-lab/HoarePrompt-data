The code `continue` is used to skip the rest of the current iteration in a loop, causing execution to proceed to the next iteration. However, it does not change any variable values directly. 

Given the initial state:
- `meats` and `K` remain unchanged.
- `N` is greater than 1.
- `i` is less than `N - 1`.
- `j` is equal to `i + 2`.
- `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`.
- `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`.
- `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`.
- `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`.
- `d2` is equal to `dx * dx + dy * dy`.
- `mx` is equal to `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.
- `my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.
- `count` is less than `K`.
- `d` is equal to `d / (c1 * c2)`.
- `cx` remains the same as `(x1 + x2) / 2`.

Since there are no variable assignments or computations resulting from the line of code provided, the output state remains unchanged. Thus, the Output State can be expressed as follows:

Output State: **`meats` and `K` remain unchanged; `N` is greater than 1; `i` is less than `N - 1`; `j` is equal to `i + 2`; `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`; `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`; `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`; `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`; `d2` is equal to `dx * dx + dy * dy`; `mx` is equal to `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`; `my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`; `count` is less than `K`; `d` is equal to `d / (c1 * c2)`; `cx` remains the same as `(x1 + x2) / 2` and we proceed to the next iteration of the loop.**
