Postcondition: ***`meats`, `K`, `T`, `N` remain unchanged; `count` is greater than or equal to `K`; `j` is equal to `i + 2`; `N` is greater than or equal to `j`; if `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then the values `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` are assigned from the elements of `meats` at index `j`, while `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` are the elements of `meats` at index `j`.***
