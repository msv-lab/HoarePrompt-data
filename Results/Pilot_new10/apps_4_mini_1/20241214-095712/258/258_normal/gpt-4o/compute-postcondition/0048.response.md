To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Initialization of Loop Variables**: The loop index `j` is initialized with `range(i + 1, N)`. This means that `j` will take values starting from `i + 1` up to (but not including) `N`.

2. **Current State**: In the given state, `i` remains unchanged. The specific values of `count`, `K`, `T`, and `N` are indicated to remain the same as well, which means they do not change between iterations.

3. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute as long as the values of `j` are within the bounds defined by `N`. 
   - The first value of `j` would be `i + 1`.
   - The loop will continue executing whilst `j < N`.

4. **Next Iteration Condition**: If `j` is at `i + 1` currently at the end of the last iteration, we need to increment `j` for the next iteration.
   - So, at the end of the last iteration, if `j` was `i + 1`, for the next iteration, `j` will be incremented to `i + 2`.

5. **Evaluating the Loop Continuation**: For the loop to execute one more time,
   - Since `j` needs to be less than `N`, we can deduce that the condition for the loop to run again is:
     - `N` must be greater than or equal to `i + 2`.
  
Taking all this into consideration, we summarize the state changes and conditions necessary for the next iteration as follows:

State: **`meats`, `K`, `T`, `N` remain unchanged, `count` is greater than or equal to `K`, j is `i + 2`, N must be greater than or equal to `i + 2`**
