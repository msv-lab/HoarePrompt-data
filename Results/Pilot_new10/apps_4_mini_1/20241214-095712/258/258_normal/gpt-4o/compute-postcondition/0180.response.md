Postcondition: ***`meats` and `K` remain unchanged; `N` is greater than 1; `i` is less than `N - 1`; `j` is equal to `i + 2`; `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`; `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`; `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`; `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`; `d2` is equal to `dx * dx + dy * dy`; if `d * d2` is greater than `d2`, `mx` is updated to `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `my` is updated to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `count` remains less than `K`, and `d` is equal to `d / (c1 * c2)`; `cx` remains the same as `(x1 + x2) / 2` and we proceed to the next iteration of the loop.***
