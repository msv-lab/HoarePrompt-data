Since the `continue` statement is used inside a loop, it causes the program to skip the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables remain unchanged in this instance since no calculations or assignments are made.

Output State: **If `d` is less than 0, `my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2; K remains unchanged, N remains unchanged, `j` is equal to `i + 2`, `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is equal to `dx * dx + dy * dy`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
