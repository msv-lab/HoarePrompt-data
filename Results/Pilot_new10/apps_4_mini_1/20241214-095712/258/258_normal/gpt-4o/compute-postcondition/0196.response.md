`cy` is assigned the value of `(y1 + y2) / 2`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged as `meats` is unchanged, and the other variable relationships remain valid. Therefore, the Output State is: `meats` remains unchanged; `N` is greater than `i + 3`; `i` is less than `N - 1`; `j` is equal to `i + 3`; `d` is now `d` divided by `(c1 * c2)`; `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`; `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`.
