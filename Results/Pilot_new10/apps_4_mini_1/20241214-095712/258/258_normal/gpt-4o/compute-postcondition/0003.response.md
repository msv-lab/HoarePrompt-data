The code assigns an empty list to the variable `meats`, which updates its value from whatever it was initially (before the execution, it contained previous tuples). The other variables remain unchanged since the snippet only modifies `meats`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 60; `K` is an integer between 1 and N; `meats` is an empty list; `data` is a list of strings from the input.**
