The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. In this case, the values of `meats`, `K`, `N`, `i`, `j`, `count`, `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, and `d2` remain unchanged as the loop simply continues to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State reflects that all variables remain in their previous state.

Output State: **`meats` remains unchanged; `K` remains unchanged; `N` remains unchanged; `i` is less than `N`; `j` is equal to `i + 1`; `count` is still less than `K`; `d` is updated to `d / (c1 * c2)`; `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`; `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`; `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`; `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`; `d2` is equal to \(\frac{(x1 - x2)^2}{4} + \frac{(y1 - y2)^2}{4}\).**
