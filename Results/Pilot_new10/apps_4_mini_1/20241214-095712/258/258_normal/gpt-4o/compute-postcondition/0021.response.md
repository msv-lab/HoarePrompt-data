The statement `meats.append((x, y, c))` adds a tuple containing the values of `x`, `y`, and `c` to the list `meats`. The value of `x` is equal to `int(data[10])`, the value of `y` is equal to `int(data[11])`, and the value of `c` is equal to `int(data[12])`. The initial states of the other variables do not change.

Output State: **`N` is between 10 and 60; `K` is between 1 and `N`; `meats` contains additional tuple `(x, int(data[11]), c)` which now includes `(int(data[10]), int(data[11]), int(data[12]))`; `data` is a list of strings from the input; `index` is 10; `x` is equal to `int(data[10])`; `y` is equal to `int(data[11])`; `c` is equal to `int(data[12])`.**
