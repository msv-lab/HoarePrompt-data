Postcondition: ***`meats` remains unchanged; `N` is greater than `i + 3; `i` is less than `N - 1; `j` is equal to `i + 3; `d` may change but remains constant for this operation; `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2; `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2; `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2; `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2; `d2` is equal to `((x1 - x2)² + (y1 - y2)²) / 4. If `count` is greater than or equal to `K`, the function returns True. Otherwise, there is no else part in the code.***
