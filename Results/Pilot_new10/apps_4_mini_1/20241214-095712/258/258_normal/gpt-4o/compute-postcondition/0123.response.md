The command `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since the execution context of the variables remains unchanged, the values of all variables, including `my`, `K`, `N`, `j`, and `d`, do not change as a result of this command. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the context in which the `continue` statement was used.

Output State: **`my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `K` remains unchanged, `N` remains unchanged, `j` is `i + 2`, and `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
