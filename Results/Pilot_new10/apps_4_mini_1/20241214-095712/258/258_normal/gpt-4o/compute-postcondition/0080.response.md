Postcondition: ***`meats`, `K`, `N` remain unchanged; `i` is less than `N`; `j` is greater than `i`; `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` maintain their previous values; `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` are set to the previous values of `x2`, `y2`, and `c2`; `c1 * T` does not hold as greater than or equal to its previous value; `d` remains a negative value, ensuring that the current value of `d` is less than 0; thus, the loop continues to the next iteration.***
