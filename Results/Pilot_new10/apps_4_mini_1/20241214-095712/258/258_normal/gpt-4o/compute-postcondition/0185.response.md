Postcondition: ***`meats` and `K` remain unchanged; `N` is greater than 1; `i` is less than `N - 1`; `j` is equal to `i + 2`; `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`; `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`; `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`; `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`; `d2` is equal to `dx * dx + dy * dy`. If `count` is greater than or equal to `K`, the program returns True. If `count` is less than `K`, no action is specified in the else part.**
