The value of `index` is assigned the integer value `2`. The initial states of `N`, `K`, `meats`, and `data` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the unchanged values of those variables alongside the new value assigned to `index`. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 60; `K` is an integer between 1 and N; `meats` is an empty list; `data` is a list of strings from the input; `index` is 2**.
