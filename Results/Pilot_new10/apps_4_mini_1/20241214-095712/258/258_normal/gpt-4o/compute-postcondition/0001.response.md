The value of `N` is assigned from `data[0]`, which is a string that gets converted to an integer. Since `N` is stated to be an integer between 1 and 60, it will take a value within that range. The values of `K`, `meats`, and `data` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated variable `N`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 60 (updated from `data[0]`), `K` is an integer between 1 and N, `meats` is a list of tuples each containing three integers (x_i, y_i, c_i), and `data` is a list of strings from the input.**
