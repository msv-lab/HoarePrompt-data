The code snippet appends a tuple `(x, y, c)` to the `meats` list. The values of `x`, `y`, and `c` are defined as `int(data[2])`, `int(data[3])`, and `int(data[4])` respectively. Since `data` is a list of strings and these specific indices are accessed, `x`, `y`, and `c` will hold integer values based on the input strings.

The state of the variables that have been changed is as follows:
- `meats` now contains one new tuple `(x, y, c)` appended to it.

The other variables: `N`, `K`, `index`, `data` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 1 and 60; `K` is between 1 and `N`; `meats` now contains one tuple `(x, y, c)`; `data` is a list of strings from the input; `index` is 2; `x` is equal to `int(data[2])`; `y` is equal to `int(data[3])`; `c` is equal to `int(data[4])`.**
