The variable `dy` is assigned the value of `(y1 - y2) / 2`. The previous values of `y1` and `y2` are unknown but `dy` will represent half the difference between them. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`meats` remains unchanged, `K` remains unchanged, `N` is greater than 1, `i` is less than `N - 1`, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, `d` is now equal to the previous value of `d` divided by (c1 * c2) with `d` remaining negative, `cx` is equal to (x1 + x2) / 2, `cy` is equal to (y1 + y2) / 2, `dx` is equal to (x1 - x2) / 2, `dy` is equal to (y1 - y2) / 2.**
