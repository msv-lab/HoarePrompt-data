To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, let's analyze the variables involved:

1. Variables `meats`, `K`, `T`, `N` remain unchanged.
2. `count` is greater than or equal to `K`; thus, it holds a valid value.
3. `j` is equal to `i + 2`, which gives a specific numeric context to `j` based on variable `i`.
4. `N` is greater than or equal to `j`, meaning `N` is guaranteed to hold a value that is not less than `j`.
5. `c1 * T < c2 * T` implies a comparison between `c1` and `c2`, indicating `c1 < c2` since `T` is greater than 0.
6. `d` is updated to a smaller negative value, which shows that `d` retains its properties as a negative number.
7. `cx` and `cy` are the midpoints computed from `(x1, x2)` and `(y1, y2)` respectively.
8. `dx` and `dy` are calculated as half the differences between `x1, x2` and `y1, y2` allowing for measurements or adjustments.
9. `d2` represents the squared distance based on `dx` and `dy`, serving as an important metric in geometric calculations.

In the provided code:
```python
my = cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2
```
- `my` is computed using `cy`, `dx`, `d2`, and `d`. Particularly, the term `math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d)` involves `d2` and `d` in a direct computation.
  
Now, considering these updates:
1. `my` takes a specific computed value based on the previous state.
2. The other variables stated remain unchanged.

Thus, the updated output state will include the new value for `my` while all other variables maintain their previously described states.

Output State: **`meats`, `K`, `T`, `N` remain unchanged; `count` is greater than or equal to `K`; `j` is equal to `i + 2`; `N` is greater than or equal to `j`; `c1 * T < c2 * T`; `d` is updated to a smaller negative value; `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`; `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`; `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`; `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`; `d2` is equal to `(dx * dx + dy * dy)`; `mx` is equal to `cx + (dy * math.sqrt((d2 * d) - (d * d)) / d2)`; `my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2**.
