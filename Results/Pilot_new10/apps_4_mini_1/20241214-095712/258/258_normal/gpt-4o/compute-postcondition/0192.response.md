The code is a `continue` statement, which causes the current iteration of the loop to end and proceeds to the next iteration of that loop. The values of the variables `meats` and `N` remain unchanged, while `i` and `j` are still valid in their previously described relationships. Since `continue` doesn't change any values, we can summarize the state as follows:

Output State: **`meats` remains unchanged; `N` is greater than `i + 3`; `i` is less than `N - 1`; `j` is equal to `i + 3; we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
