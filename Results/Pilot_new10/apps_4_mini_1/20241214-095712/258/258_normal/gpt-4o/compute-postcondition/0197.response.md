The variable `dx` is assigned the value of `(x1 - x2) / 2`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. The initial conditions about `N`, `i`, `j`, `d`, `cx`, and `cy` are still valid after the execution, as they are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`meats` remains unchanged; `N` is greater than `i + 3; `i` is less than `N - 1; `j` is equal to `i + 3; `d` is now `d` divided by `(c1 * c2)`; `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2; `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2; `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2.**
