The value of `dx` is assigned the value `(x1 - x2) / 2`, which calculates half the difference between `x1` and `x2`. The conditions and relationships involving `d`, `my`, `K`, `N`, `j`, `cx`, and `cy` remain unchanged and intact within the context provided.

Output State: **If `d` is less than 0, `my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2; `K` remains unchanged, `N` remains unchanged, `j` is `i + 2`, `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`.**
