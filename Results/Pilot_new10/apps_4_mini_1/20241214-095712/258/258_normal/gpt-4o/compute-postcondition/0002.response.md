The variable `K` is assigned the value of `int(data[1])`, which converts the second element of the `data` list from a string to an integer. The values of `N`, `meats`, and `data` remain unchanged. Since `K` is assigned a value between 1 and `N`, the output state reflects this.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 60; `K` is an integer between 1 and N (now updated from `data[1]`); `meats` is a list of tuples each containing three integers (x_i, y_i, c_i); `data` is a list of strings from the input.**
