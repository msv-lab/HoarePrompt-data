The new variable `d2` is assigned the value of `dx * dx + dy * dy`. The values of `dx` and `dy` depend on the initial state, where `dx` equals to `(x1 - x2) / 2` and `dy` equals to `(y1 - y2) / 2`. Therefore, `d2` will be calculated as the sum of the squares of these two expressions.

Additionally, the values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **If `d` is less than 0, `my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2; K remains unchanged, N remains unchanged, j is equal to i + 2, d is equal to (c1 - c2) * T / (c1 * c2), cx is equal to (x1 + x2) / 2, cy is equal to (y1 + y2) / 2, dx is equal to (x1 - x2) / 2, dy is equal to (y1 - y2) / 2, `d2` is equal to `dx * dx + dy * dy`.**
