The code snippet assigns the value of `dy` to the result of `(y1 - y2) / 2`. The variables `y1` and `y2` have not been defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine their specific values. However, their relationship is direct in the assignment of `dy`. The initial states of the other variables remain unchanged as per the conditions stated.

Therefore, the Output State includes all unchanged variables, and specifies the new variable `dy` based on the given expression.

Output State: **`meats`, `K`, `T`, `N`, `i` remain unchanged; `count` remains less than `K`; `j` is equal to `i + 1`; `N` is greater than `i + 1`; `d` is equal to `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`; `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`; `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`; `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`; `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`.**
