Postcondition: ***`meats`, `K`, `T`, `N` remain unchanged; `i` is less than `N`; `j` is greater than `i`; if `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` maintain their previous values, while `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` are set to the previous values of `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` respectively, ensuring that `c1 * T` does not hold as greater than or equal to its previous value.***
