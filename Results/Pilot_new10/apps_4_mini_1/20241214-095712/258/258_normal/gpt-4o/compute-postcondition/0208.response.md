Output State: **`meats` remains unchanged; `K` remains unchanged; `N` remains unchanged; `count` is the number of elements in `meats` that satisfy the condition defined by the distances from the calculated midpoint `(mx, my)` to each point in `meats`, specifically such that the distance is less than or equal to `T`; if `count` is greater than or equal to `K`, the function has determined a valid configuration and would theoretically return `True`; if `count` is less than `K`, the function completes without returning any value, leaving all else unchanged.**
