The value of `d` is divided by the product of `c1` and `c2`. Since `d` is currently negative, the change will yield a new value for `d`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the specifics of `c1` and `c2` will determine the new value of `d`.

Output State: **`meats` and `K` remain unchanged, `N` is greater than 1, `i` is less than `N - 1`, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, `d` is now equal to the previous value of `d` divided by (c1 * c2), with `d` remaining negative.**
