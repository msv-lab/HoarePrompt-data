Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and iterates through all integer coordinate combinations (x, y) from -1000 to 1000, calling another function `func_2` with these coordinates to retrieve a list of values. It then sorts these values and determines the minimum value of `times[K - 1]` across all combinations, returning this minimum value. The function assumes that `K` is pre-defined as a positive integer in the scope where the function is called, with the condition that 1 <= K <= N. If K exceeds the length of the list returned by `func_2`, it may lead to an index error which is not handled in the code.**
