The operation `times.sort()` arranges the elements in the list `times` in non-decreasing order. However, the initial state does not specify the initial contents of `times`, only that it is updated from the output of `func_2(-999, -999, -999, -999)`. This means that `times` now contains elements that relate to that function's output, but we don't know the exact values. 

The other variables, `K`, `x`, `y`, and `ans`, are not directly affected by this operation. Since `K` is given to be a positive integer within the range 1 to `N`, and since `ans` gets updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`, we can state that `ans` could potentially change based on the sorting of `times`, but we don't have the specific initial value of `ans` after its update to evaluate this further.

Thus, while we know that `times` is now sorted, we cannot give its exact contents or its effect on `ans` without additional information.

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `x` is -999, `y` is -999, `times` is sorted, and `ans` is updated to be the minimum between its previous value and `times[K - 1]`.**
