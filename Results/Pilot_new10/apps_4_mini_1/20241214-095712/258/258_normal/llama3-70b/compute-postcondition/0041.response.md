The variable `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`. The initial state indicates that `K` is a positive integer within the range, and `times` is sorted. Consequently, `ans` will be assigned the value of the minimum between its previous value and the specific element `times[K - 1]`. 

Since no specific values are provided for `ans` or `times`, we can only describe `ans` in relation to these conditions.

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `x` is -998, `y` is -998, `times` is sorted, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]**
