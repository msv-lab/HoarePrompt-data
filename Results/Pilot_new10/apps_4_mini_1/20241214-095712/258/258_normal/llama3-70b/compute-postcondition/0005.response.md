The `ans` variable is assigned the minimum value between its previous value and `times[K - 1]`. Since `ans` starts as positive infinity, `ans` will take the value of `times[K - 1]`, assuming that `times` has at least `K` elements due to the condition 1 <= `K` <= `N` and that `times` is sorted, allowing us to access the `K - 1` index safely.

The state of the other variables (`x`, `y`, `K`, `times`) remains unaffected. Therefore, we assume that `times[K - 1]` is a finite value based on the given context. 

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `x` is -1000, `y` is -1000, `ans` is equal to `times[K - 1]`, `times` is sorted.**
