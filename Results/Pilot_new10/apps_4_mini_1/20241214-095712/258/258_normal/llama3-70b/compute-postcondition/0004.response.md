The variable `times` is assigned the output of `func_2(-1000, -1000, -1000, -1000)`. After that, the `sort()` method is applied to the `times` list, which rearranges its elements in ascending order. However, since the specific contents of the `times` list are not provided, we cannot determine the exact output after sorting.

The initial state includes:
- `K` is a positive integer such that `1 <= K <= N`
- `x` is -1000
- `y` is -1000
- `ans` is positive infinity
- `times` is the output of `func_2(-1000, -1000, -1000, -1000)` (the exact value of `times` is unknown)

After executing `times.sort()`, we know that the `times` variable is altered, but we do not have information about its previous state since we do not have the output of `func_2`.

Thus, the relevant updates to the output state only encompass the specific references and the change to `times`, while the other variables remain as they were:

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `x` is -1000, `y` is -1000, `ans` is positive infinity, `times` is sorted**.
