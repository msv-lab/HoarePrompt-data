The function `func_2(x, y, x, y)` takes the values of `x` and `y`, both of which are initially -1000. The function processes these values and returns a certain output. We do not have the definition of `func_2`, but based on the function call, we can deduce that it might modify `ans`, which is currently set to positive infinity. 

Since `x` and `y` do not take on new values before the function call, and we still do not know how `func_2` modifies those values or its returns, we'll assume that the output of `func_2` assigns a result to `times`, and `ans` could potentially be modified, although we don't have specifics about their changes within this context.

The output state should reflect the unchanged variables `K`, `x`, `y`, and indicate that `times` has been assigned some value based on the function. 

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `x` is -1000, `y` is -1000, `ans` is positive infinity, `times` is the output of func_2(-1000, -1000, -1000, -1000)**
