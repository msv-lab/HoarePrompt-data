According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `y`, which ranges from -1000 to 1000. In the current state, `y` is -1000. Since the loop will execute while `y` is less than 1001, it can execute again for the next value of `y`.

At the end of the last iteration, `y` is -1000, so for the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be incremented by 1. Thus, `y` will be updated to -999 during the next iteration. 

The other variables (`K`, `x`, `times`, and `ans`) do not change in this particular loop iteration, as they are not dependent on `y`.

State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `x` is -998, `y` is -999, `times` is sorted, and `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]**
