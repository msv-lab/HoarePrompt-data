The variable `ans` is assigned the minimum value between its previous value and `times[K - 1]`. Given that `K` is a positive integer within the range from 1 to `N`, `times[K - 1]` represents an element from the sorted list `times`, specifically the `(K-1)`-th index. The previous value of `ans` is updated based on this comparison. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Thus, the Output State reflects this update, stating that `ans` is now the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`, while the other variables retain their original conditions.

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `x` is -998, `y` is -999, `times` is sorted, and `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]**
