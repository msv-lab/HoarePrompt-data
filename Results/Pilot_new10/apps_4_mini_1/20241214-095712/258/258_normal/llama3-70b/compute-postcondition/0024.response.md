According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `y`. The loop iterates over the range from -1000 to 1000, inclusive, which means it will execute for a total of 2001 times, starting from -1000 up to 1000. 

At the end of the last iteration, the value of `y` must be -999, which means the next value of `y` for the loop to execute one more time will be -998. Since the loop's final value will be 1000, we can conclude that for the loop to execute one more time after the previous iteration, `y` must be updated to -998.

State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `x` is -999, `y` is -998, `times` is sorted, `ans` is updated to be the minimum between its previous value and `times[K - 1]`.**
