The code sorts the `times` list in ascending order, but the values of the other variables remain unaffected. The initial state indicates that `times` has already been updated based on the result of `func_2(x, y, x, y)`. Since the resulting sorted order of `times` is not specified, we can only state that the previous values are changed to reflect that `times` is now sorted.

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `x` is -998, `y` is -1000, `times` is sorted, `ans` is the minimum value of `times[K - 1]` over iterations of `y`.**
