Based on the evaluation of the provided code and output hints, the program does not fully comply with the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the issues identified are:

1. **Scope of `meats` in `func_2`:** The variable `meats` that is used in `func_2` is not defined within the function's local scope. This means that unless `meats` is globally defined, calling `func_2` will lead to a `NameError`. This introduces a significant problem because it may lead to unexpected crashes when the program is runâ€”this is a failure to handle the case where `func_2` is called without `meats` being defined in the expected scope.

2. **Sorting and List Access in `func_3`:** The function `func_3` assumes that calling `func_2` will always produce enough entries to access `times[K - 1]` safely. If `K` were to exceed the number of pieces of meat returning from `func_2`, this would also lead to an `IndexError`. While given that `1 <= K <= N`, and `N` is the total number of meats, this scenario seems unlikely under normal circumstances; the lack of error handling for unexpected list sizes indicates a gap in reliability.

3. **Integer Coordinates Limitation in `func_3`:** The iteration in `func_3` restricts the search for the optimal heat source position to integer coordinates, while the problem description clearly states that the optimal coordinates can be any real numbers. This limitation could prevent the program from finding the true minimum grilling time.

Due to these critical issues that affect the correctness of the program in multiple scenarios, the determination must be that it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
