According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` starts from `i + 1` which is `1` and goes up to `n` inclusive. Since `n` is the length of the non-empty string `s`, `n` must be at least 1 to allow for the loop to execute at least once. At the end of the last iteration, `j` will be equal to `n + 1`, and `i` remains `0`.

For the loop to be executed, `j` must start from `1`, and it will increment on each iteration up to `n`. 

State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is equal to the length of `s`, `i` is 0, `j` starts at 1**
