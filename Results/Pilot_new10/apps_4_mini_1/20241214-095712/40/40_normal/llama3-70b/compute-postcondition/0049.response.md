In this block of code, `print(max_len if max_len > 0 else 0)` checks the value of `max_len`. If `max_len` is greater than 0, it will print the value of `max_len`. If not, it prints `0`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the output will be based on the value of `max_len`.

The output state will reflect whether `max_len` is greater than 0 or not:

- If `max_len > 0`, it remains unchanged and gets printed.
- If `max_len <= 0`, it becomes `0` when printed but is not stored in any variable within this code snippet.

Therefore, the output state can be summarized based on the value of `max_len`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is equal to the length of `s`, `max_len` is printed; if `max_len > 0` it is unchanged, else it is `0`.**
