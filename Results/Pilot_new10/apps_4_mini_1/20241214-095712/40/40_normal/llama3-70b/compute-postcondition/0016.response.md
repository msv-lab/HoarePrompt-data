Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `substr` is equal to `s[0:3]`. If `substr` is not equal to its reverse, then `max_len` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and 3. There is no else part in the code.***
