The variable `substr` is being assigned a new value based on the slice of `s` from index `i` to index `j`. Initially, `i` is `n - 1` and `j` is `n + 1`, which means `s[i:j]` will extract characters from the string `s`. Given that `s` is a non-empty string, `s[n - 1:n + 1]` will yield the last character of `s` along with an empty string (as there is no character at index `n`). So, `substr` will now hold the last character of `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is equal to the length of `s`, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `j` is equal to `n + 1`, and `substr` is equal to the last character of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is equal to the length of `s`, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `j` is equal to `n + 1`, and `substr` is equal to `s[n - 1]`.**
