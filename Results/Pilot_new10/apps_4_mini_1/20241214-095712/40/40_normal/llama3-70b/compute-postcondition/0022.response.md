The code updates the value of `max_len` to be the maximum between its current value and the length of `substr`. Since `substr` is a substring of `s` and is not equal to its reverse, the length of `substr` contributes positively to the length tracked by `max_len`. The states of the other variables are not affected, and the variables are left in their respective states except for `max_len`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is equal to the length of `s`, `max_len` is updated to max(max_len, len(substr)), `i` is equal to n - 1, `substr` is the substring of `s` from index `n - 1` to `j`, and `substr` is not equal to its reverse (`substr != substr[::-1]`).**
