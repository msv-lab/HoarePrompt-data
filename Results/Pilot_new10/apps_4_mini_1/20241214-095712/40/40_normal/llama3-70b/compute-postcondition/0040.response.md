`substr` is assigned the value of the substring of `s` starting from index `i` and ending at index `j`. Since `j` is equal to `n + 1`, and `n` is the length of `s`, this means `j` will be one index past the last character of the string `s`. Therefore, `substr` will be equal to the entire string `s`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is equal to the length of `s`, `i` is unchanged, `j` is equal to `n + 1`, `substr` is equal to `s`.**
