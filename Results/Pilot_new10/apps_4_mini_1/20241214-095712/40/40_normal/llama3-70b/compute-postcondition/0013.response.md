According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`, which is iterating from `i + 1` to `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `n` is greater than or equal to 2. Since `j` starts from `i + 1`, it can proceed to 3 for the loop to execute one more time.

To adjust the states for the next iteration, `j` needs to be updated to 3, as `i` remains 0, and `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again, given that `j` will iterate up to `n + 1`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, and `substr` is equal to `s[0:2]`**
