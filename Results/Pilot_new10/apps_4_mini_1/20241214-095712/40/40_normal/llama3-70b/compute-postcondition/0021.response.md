Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is equal to the length of `s`, `max_len` is the length of the longest substring of `s` that is not equal to its reverse, `i` is equal to n - 1, `substr` is the substring of `s` from index `n - 1` to `j`, and the value of `substr` is not equal to its reverse (`substr != substr[::-1]`).***
