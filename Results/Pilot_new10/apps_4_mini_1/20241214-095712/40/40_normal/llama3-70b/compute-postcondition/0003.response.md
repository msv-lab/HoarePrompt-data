According to the code, the loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. Since `s` is a non-empty string, `n` is guaranteed to be at least 1. The loop variable `i` will start at 0 and increment by 1 on each iteration.

For the loop to execute, the following states are relevant:
- The value of `i` needs to be initialized to 0, as this is the starting point of the loop iteration.
- `n`, being the length of `s`, must be equal to or greater than 1, which is already satisfied as `s` is a non-empty string.

Since `max_len` is not relevant for determining whether the loop can execute and doesn't affect the loop conditions, we leave it as is.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is equal to the length of `s`, `i` is 0**
