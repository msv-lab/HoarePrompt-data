According to the code, the loop iterates over the range defined by `n`. During each iteration, the variable `i` starts from `0` and goes up to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `n`, meaning the next iteration would be the terminating condition of the for loop. However, since the loop is structured to run while `i` is less than `n`, the loop will not execute again when `i` is `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we have:
- `s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters,
- `n` is equal to the length of `s`,
- `i` is `n - 1`, and
- `max_len` is the length of the longest non-palindromic substring of `s`.

Since the loop cannot execute again (it has already completed its range), the state would reflect that `i` has reached `n`, thus indicating that the loop can no longer run.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is equal to the length of `s`, `i` is `n`, `max_len` is the length of the longest non-palindromic substring of `s`**
