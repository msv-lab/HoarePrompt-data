To analyze the given code fragment, we first look at the initial state:

- `s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is 3.
- `substr` is equal to `s[0:3]`, which means `substr` extracts the first three characters from the string `s`.

Now, we examine the line of code:

```
max_len = max(max_len, len(substr))
```

Here, `max_len` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and the length of `substr`. Since `substr` is equal to `s[0:3]`, its length will be 3 (as long as `s` has at least 3 characters, which it does).

Therefore, if `max_len` was already defined, it will be updated according to the maximum of its current value or 3.

Since there are no other variables affected and assuming `max_len` is initially defined (but its specific value is not given), the output state will just reflect that `max_len` has been updated.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `substr` is equal to `s[0:3]`, and `max_len` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and 3.**
