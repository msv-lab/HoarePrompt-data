The code assigns a new value to `max_len` based on the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr`. The length of `substr` is equal to the length of `s`, which is `n`. Thus, the new value of `max_len` will be the maximum between its previous value and `n`.

The other variables (`s`, `n`, `i`, `j`, and `substr`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `max_len` has been updated based on the comparison.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is equal to the length of `s`, `i` is unchanged, `j` is equal to `n + 1`, `substr` is equal to `s`, and `max_len` is now the maximum of its previous value and `n`.**
