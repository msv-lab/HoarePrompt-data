You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A string is a palindrome if it reads the same from the left to the right and from the right to the left. For example, the strings "kek", "abacaba", "r" and "papicipap" are palindromes, while the strings "abb" and "iq" are not.

A substring $s[l \ldots r]$ ($1 \leq l \leq r \leq |s|$) of a string $s = s_{1}s_{2} \ldots s_{|s|}$ is the string $s_{l}s_{l + 1} \ldots s_{r}$.

Anna does not like palindromes, so she makes her friends call her Ann. She also changes all the words she reads in a similar way. Namely, each word $s$ is changed into its longest substring that is not a palindrome. If all the substrings of $s$ are palindromes, she skips the word at all.

Some time ago Ann read the word $s$. What is the word she changed it into?


-----Input-----

The first line contains a non-empty string $s$ with length at most $50$ characters, containing lowercase English letters only.


-----Output-----

If there is such a substring in $s$ that is not a palindrome, print the maximum length of such a substring. Otherwise print $0$.

Note that there can be multiple longest substrings that are not palindromes, but their length is unique.


-----Examples-----
Input
mew

Output
3

Input
wuffuw

Output
5

Input
qqqqqqqq

Output
0



-----Note-----

"mew" is not a palindrome, so the longest substring of it that is not a palindrome, is the string "mew" itself. Thus, the answer for the first example is $3$.

The string "uffuw" is one of the longest non-palindrome substrings (of length $5$) of the string "wuffuw", so the answer for the second example is $5$.

All substrings of the string "qqqqqqqq" consist of equal characters so they are palindromes. This way, there are no non-palindrome substrings. Thus, the answer for the third example is $0$.
Program:
```
s = input().strip()
if len(s) <= 1:
    print(0)
elif not func_1(s):
    print(len(s))
elif not func_1(s[1:]):
    print(len(s) - 1)
elif not func_1(s[:-1]):
    print(len(s) - 1)
else:
    print(0)

def func_1(s):
    return s == s[::-1]


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, we will analyze the logic and potential edge cases based on the problem description regarding palindromes and non-palindrome substrings.

The program logic is as follows:
1. It checks if the input string length is less than or equal to 1 and outputs `0` in that case, which is correct as a string of length 1 or less cannot have a non-palindrome substring.
2. It calls `func_1(s)` to check if the entire string is a palindrome. If it is not, it returns the length of the string, which is the correct response.
3. If the string is a palindrome, it checks `func_1(s[1:])` and `func_1(s[:-1])`. If either of these are not palindromes, it returns `len(s) - 1`, which is also correct because removing one character from either end of a string can create a non-palindrome.
4. Finally, it prints `0` if all checks indicate the string or its immediate variations are palindromes.

Now to find potential failures, let's consider the following test case:

**Test Case 1:** Input: `"aaaaaa"`
- All substrings of `"aaaaaa"` are palindromes since they all consist of the same character.
- The program would call `func_1` on the original and modified strings and finally return `0`, which is correct.

**Test Case 2:** Input: `"abcba"`
- The entire string is a palindrome, but `s[1:]` which results in `"bcba"` is also a palindrome and so is `s[:-1]` which results in `"abcb"`, again a palindrome.
- The program would correctly return `0`.

Now checking a more tricky potential case:

**Test Case 3:** Input: `"aab"`
- The string is not a palindrome.
- The program will return the length of the string `3` upon the first check since `func_1("aab")` will return `False`.

**Test Case 4:** Input: `"abb"`
- The string is a palindrome, but `s[1:] = "bb"` which is a palindrome and `s[:-1] = "ab"` which is not a palindrome.
- The program correctly returns `2`, which is correct.

After evaluating these test cases, the logic employed in the program reflects a good understanding of the conditions under which substrings can be deemed non-palindromic and correctly assesses lengths for both cases of palindromes and non-palindromes.

However, an issue is found in:
**Example Explanation:** If there are multiple identical characters, the function does not actually explore substrings of different lengths properly and could return incorrect assessments on longer segments, especially those that are near the maximal length of the input. For instance, strings like `"aaaab"` may not deliver maximal length correctly if all but one character are the same.

Thus, considering these variables, the conclusion for the program's correctness is as follows:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not accommodate the requirement to check through substrings of varying lengths thoroughly enough in cases of alternating characters, resulting in potential misassessments in cases like those that contain a sequence of repeated characters that do not adequately handle maximal non-palindrome substrings correctly.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting solely of lowercase English letters and returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome (meaning it reads the same forwards and backwards), otherwise it returns `False`. It does not account for edge cases involving an empty string or non-lowercase letters, but these are not applicable given the specification of `s`. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
