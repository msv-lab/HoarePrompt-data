#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters and has a length of at most 50 characters.
def func_1(s):
    return s == s[::-1]
    #The program returns True if the string 's' is a palindrome, which means it reads the same forwards and backwards. Otherwise, it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting solely of lowercase English letters and returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome (meaning it reads the same forwards and backwards), otherwise it returns `False`. It does not account for edge cases involving an empty string or non-lowercase letters, but these are not applicable given the specification of `s`.
