In the provided code snippet, the function `heapq.heappush()` is used to push a new tuple onto the heap. The tuple being pushed is `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)`, where `coverage(x, y)` calculates some value based on `x` and `y`, and the negative value is used to maintain a max-heap structure using Python's min-heap implementation.

Given that:
- `n` cannot be greater than `n`, meaning `n` has a constraint of being a certain value or condition.
- `m` must be greater than 1, indicating `m` has a lower bound.
- `y` is 1, a fixed value.
- The current `heap` contains `m` tuples before the operation.

The state after executing the `heapq.heappush` operation will include the new tuple that has been added to the heap, but the values of `n`, `m`, and `y` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` cannot be greater than `n`, `m` must be greater than 1, `y` is 1, heap contains `m` tuples and now contains an additional tuple `(-coverage(x, 1), x, 1)`**.
