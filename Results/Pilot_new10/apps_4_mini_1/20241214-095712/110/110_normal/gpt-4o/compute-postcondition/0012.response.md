According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `y` and `m`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `y` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 0, and `m` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` will be incremented by 1, making it 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 10^5, `m` must be greater than 1, `y` is 1, and a tuple `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` has been pushed onto the `heap`.**
