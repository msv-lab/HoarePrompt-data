To construct the output state, we need to consider that the code snippet involves a function call that pushes a tuple onto a heap. Here's the assessment:

- `heap` will now contain an additional tuple, which is determined by `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)`.
- The specific values of `x` and `y` are not given or constrained in the initial state.

Since we do not know the values of `x` and `y`, which affect the `coverage` function's output, we cannot define them specifically. However, since `m` is known to be greater than 0, we know `y` can vary from `0` to `m-1`, and `x` is not constrained from being less than or equal to `n`.

Therefore, the updated output state should emphasize the unchanged values while acknowledging the addition to the heap.

Output State: **`n` cannot be greater than `n`, `m` is greater than 0, `y` is 0, heap contains `m` tuples, and an additional tuple `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` has been pushed onto the heap.**
