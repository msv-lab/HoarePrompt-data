Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 10^5, `m` is between 1 and 10^5, `heap` contains `n * m` tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)`, `total_coverage` is 0, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1, `cov` is -coverage(x, y), `x` is x, `y` is y, where (cov, x, y) is the tuple with the highest coverage in the heap.**
