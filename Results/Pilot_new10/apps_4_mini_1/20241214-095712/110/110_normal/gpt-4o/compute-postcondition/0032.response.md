The variable `total_coverage` is decremented by the value of `cov`. Since `total_coverage` was initially equal to `-cov`, after the operation `total_coverage -= cov`, it will become `-cov - cov` which simplifies to `-2 * cov`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 10^5, `m` is between 1 and 10^5, `heap` contains `n * m` tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` with one tuple removed, `total_coverage` is equal to `-2 * cov`, `k` is 2, `cov` is the coverage value of the popped tuple, `x` is the x value of the popped tuple, `y` is the y value of the popped tuple.**
