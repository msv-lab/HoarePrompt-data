The variable `total_coverage` is updated by subtracting the value of `cov` from it. The value of `cov` is given as `-coverage(x, y)`, which is the negation of the coverage from the tuple with the highest coverage in the `heap`. As `total_coverage` was previously `0`, the new value will be `0 - cov`, resulting in `cov` being added to `total_coverage`.

The other variables remain unchanged because none of them have been affected by this specific operation.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 10^5, `m` is between 1 and 10^5, `heap` contains `n * m` tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)`, `total_coverage` is equal to `-cov`, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1, `cov` is -coverage(x, y), `x` is x, `y` is y, where (cov, x, y) is the tuple with the highest coverage in the heap.**
