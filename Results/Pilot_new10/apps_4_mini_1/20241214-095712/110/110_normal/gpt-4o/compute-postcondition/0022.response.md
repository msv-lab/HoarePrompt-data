According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `y` and `m`. The loop will iterate as long as `y` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 1 and `m` must be greater than 1, allowing for another execution. Therefore, for the next iteration, `y` will be incremented by 1, so `y` will become 2. For the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` cannot be greater than `n`, `m` must be greater than 2, `y` is 2, heap contains `m` tuples including an additional tuple `(-coverage(x, 1), x, 1)`**
