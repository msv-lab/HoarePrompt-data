The code snippet provided is using the `heapq.heappush` function to add an item onto a min-heap (where the smallest item is retrieved first) represented by the variable `heap`. The new item being pushed onto the heap is a tuple consisting of three elements: the negative value of `coverage(x, y)`, the value of `x`, and the value of `y`.

In the initial state:
- `n` is between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive).
- `m` must be greater than 1 (exact value is not given).
- `y` is 1.
- An item with the value `(-coverage(x, 0), x, 0)` has been pushed onto the heap.

The execution of the provided code snippet will push a new item onto the heap, specifically `(-coverage(x, 1), x, 1)` since `y` is 1.

The current state of variables is mostly intact apart from the heap, which now has an additional entry. However, since we do not have the exact values of `coverage(x, 1)` or the state of the heap before this operation, we can't determine those exact values. 

Thus, we conclude:
1. `y` remains 1.
2. `n` remains between 1 and 10^5.
3. `m` remains greater than 1.
4. Somebody has pushed the new item onto the heap.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 10^5; `m` must be greater than 1; `y` is 1; an item (-coverage(x, 1), x, 1) has been pushed onto the heap.**
