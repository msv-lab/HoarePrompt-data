You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: While Grisha was celebrating New Year with Ded Moroz, Misha gifted Sasha a small rectangular pond of size n × m, divided into cells of size 1 × 1, inhabited by tiny evil fishes (no more than one fish per cell, otherwise they'll strife!).

The gift bundle also includes a square scoop of size r × r, designed for fishing. If the lower-left corner of the scoop-net is located at cell (x, y), all fishes inside the square (x, y)...(x + r - 1, y + r - 1) get caught. Note that the scoop-net should lie completely inside the pond when used.

Unfortunately, Sasha is not that skilled in fishing and hence throws the scoop randomly. In order to not frustrate Sasha, Misha decided to release k fishes into the empty pond in such a way that the expected value of the number of caught fishes is as high as possible. Help Misha! In other words, put k fishes in the pond into distinct cells in such a way that when the scoop-net is placed into a random position among (n - r + 1)·(m - r + 1) possible positions, the average number of caught fishes is as high as possible.


-----Input-----

The only line contains four integers n, m, r, k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m), 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n·m, 10^5)).


-----Output-----

Print a single number — the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes.

You answer is considered correct, is its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 9}. Namely, let your answer be a, and the jury's answer be b. Your answer is considered correct, if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1,|b|)} \leq 10^{-9}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3 2 3

Output
2.0000000000

Input
12 17 9 40

Output
32.8333333333



-----Note-----

In the first example you can put the fishes in cells (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3). In this case, for any of four possible positions of the scoop-net (highlighted with light green), the number of fishes inside is equal to two, and so is the expected value. [Image]
Program:
```
import heapq
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
(n, m, r, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(f'{func_1(n, m, r, k):.10f}')

def func_1(n, m, r, k):

    heap = []
    for x in range(n):
        for y in range(m):
            heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))
    total_coverage = 0
    for _ in range(k):
        (cov, x, y) = heapq.heappop(heap)
        total_coverage -= cov
    total_positions = (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)
    return total_coverage / total_positions

def coverage(x, y):
    return (min(x + 1, n - r + 1) - max(x - r + 1 + 1, 0)) * (min(y + 1, m - r + 1) - max(y - r + 1 + 1, 0))


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic and potential edge cases.

The program is supposed to find the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes in a rectangular pond using a square scoop-net. The input consists of four integers: the dimensions of the pond (n, m), the size of the scoop-net (r), and the number of fishes to be placed (k). The output should be the expected number of caught fishes, formatted to a precision of 10 decimal places.

Now, reviewing the code:

1. The `coverage` function calculates the potential coverage of the scoop-net at any given position `(x, y)`, which is key for determining where to place the fishes.
2. The code also uses a max-heap to prioritize the positions based on their coverage potential, then it adds the top `k` coverage positions, which represents the best placement of `k` fishes.
3. The expected value is calculated by dividing the total coverage of the top `k` positions by the total number of positions `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)` where the scoop can be placed.

Potential Issues:
- The computation of coverage depends on bounding the positions of the scoop to ensure it's valid within the pond boundaries. The use of `min()` and `max()` functions aims to handle this.
- However, in the `coverage` function, the bounds on `x` and `y` might lead to some positions being calculated incorrectly:
    - For example, if `x` or `y` is on the edge of the pond, the calculations using `min` and `max` need to be accurately ensuring valid range handling. An incorrect calculation could result in coverage positions that exceed valid positions.
  
Edge Case to Consider:
1. **When `k` is larger than the available positions**: If `k` exceeds the available tiles `(n * m)`, it should be clamped to that maximum.
2. **Boundary Cases**: E.g., when `n`, `m`, and `r` are chosen such that the scoop can only be in one position (like `n = 1`, `m = 1`, `r = 1`).

A basic case that highlights potential issues could be:
- For input `(1, 1, 1, 2)`, the expectation is only one position can hold a fish, but `k = 2` implies trying to place two fishes, which contradicts the distinct cells requirement.

Given this analysis, the code does not correctly handle the conditions when `k` exceeds the number of cells available, and there could be issues with edge cases where coverage is not handled correctly for boundary positions.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts four integers: `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k`, where `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100,000`, `1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m)`, and `1 ≤ k ≤ min(n * m, 100,000)`. It calculates the total coverage values of the k highest positions from a coverage function over a grid defined by dimensions `n` and `m`. The function then returns the average coverage per valid position, calculated as `total_coverage / total_positions`, where `total_positions` is given by `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`. The function does not handle scenarios where `total_positions` could be zero (e.g., when `n` or `m` is less than `r`), which could lead to a division by zero error. 

Output hint for function_2: The function accepts two non-negative integers `x` and `y`, and computes a product based on their values and the integers `n`, `m`, and `r`. The output is determined by two calculations involving `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m` where it evaluates the ranges defined by `r`. It does not explicitly check the inputs beyond their non-negativity and does not account for potential out-of-bound scenarios or errors. The result may yield negative values if the inputs lead to such conditions, which is not captured in the annotations. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
