The given Python program aims to maximize the expected number of caught fishes in a pond defined by dimensions \( n \), \( m \), and a scoop of size \( r \times r \) when \( k \) fishes are placed in the pond.

Upon reviewing the function `func_1` and its helper `coverage`, we notice several key things:

1. **Division by Zero Risk**: The calculation of `total_positions` is done by the formula `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`. If either \( n \) or \( m \) is less than \( r \), `total_positions` would result in a negative value or even zero. Then, the division by `total_positions` would lead to a runtime error.

2. **Negative Coverage Handling**: The `coverage` function may potentially return negative values if the computed ranges fall outside the expected boundaries. The definition of coverage relies on the arrangement of fishes and could yield incorrect coverage if \( x \) or \( y \) are chosen incorrectly relative to pond dimensions.

3. **Expected Value Calculation**: The goal is to maximize the average number of caught fishes across all valid positions of the scoop-net. It isn't clear if the method of using a heap to store positions based on coverage correctly yields the right coverage values considering all possible positions in accordance with the fish placement strategy.

Given these observations, the program does not handle cases where \( n \) or \( m \) is less than \( r \), leading to possible errors or incorrect outputs, violating the invariant conditions stated in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
