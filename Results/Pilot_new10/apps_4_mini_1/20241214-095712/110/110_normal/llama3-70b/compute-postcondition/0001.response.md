To analyze the given code and determine the output state, we start with the initial state where `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` are all input integers. The code calculates `ans` as the minimum of `k` and the product of two terms: `(n - r + 1)` and `(m - r + 1)`.

1. The formula used is: 
   ```
   ans = min(k, (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1))
   ```

2. The value of `ans` is impacted by the values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k`. After computing this expression, we have:
   - `ans` will be updated to hold either `k` or the result of the product `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`.

3. Since `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` are input integers, their values remain unchanged. Only `ans` takes on a new value based on the calculations.

Therefore, we summarize the output state reflecting these changes while preserving the integrity of the unchanged state of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `ans` is the minimum of `k` and `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`**
