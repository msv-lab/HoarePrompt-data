Correctness: **False**

The provided program incorrectly calculates whether the grasshopper can jump to the insect due to the handling of the obstacles ('#') and the modulo operation. Specifically, it uses the modulo operation for indexing which might lead to incorrect behavior for out-of-bound indexes when jumping. 

Here's a case where the program fails:
1. Input: 
```
6 2
G.#..T
```
In this case, the grasshopper starts at position 0 ('G') and needs to reach position 5 ('T'). The grasshopper can jump over the obstacle at index 1 by jumping to indexes 2, 4, and finally 5. However, the condition in the code does not account for the fact that when checking for obstacles in its jumping path, it will erroneously consider index 1 as part of its jump and return "NO", even though the grasshopper can successfully reach the insect.

Thus, this example demonstrates that the program does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case.
