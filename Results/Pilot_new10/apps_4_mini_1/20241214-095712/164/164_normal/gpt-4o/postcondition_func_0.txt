The function accepts an integer `n` (the number of cells), an integer `k` (the length of the grasshopper's jump), and a string `line` containing the characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T'. It checks if the grasshopper can reach the target 'T' from its starting position 'G' by jumping exactly `k` cells at a time without landing on any obstacles (`'#'`). It prints 'YES' if the target is reachable and 'NO' otherwise. The code does not handle cases where the grasshopper might overshoot the target if `k` is larger than the distance to the target, nor does it validate the input parameters beyond guaranteed constraints.
