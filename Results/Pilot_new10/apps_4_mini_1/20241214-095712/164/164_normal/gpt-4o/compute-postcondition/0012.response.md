Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1), `line` is a string, `G_pos` must be less than or equal to `T_pos`, `reachable` is True, and `pos` is equal to `G_pos`. The current value of `pos` is equal to `T_pos`. If the character at position `pos` in `line` is '#', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
