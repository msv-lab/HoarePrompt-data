The code swaps the values of `G_pos` and `T_pos`. Since it is stated that the current value of `G_pos` is greater than `T_pos`, their values will be exchanged. After the execution, `G_pos` will have the value previously held by `T_pos`, and `T_pos` will have the value previously held by `G_pos`. 

The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1), `line` is a string obtained from input, `G_pos` is now equal to the previous value of `T_pos`, `T_pos` is now equal to the previous value of `G_pos`, with the condition that the previous value of `G_pos` is greater than the previous value of `T_pos`.**
