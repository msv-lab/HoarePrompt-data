Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1), `line` is a string obtained from input, `G_pos` and `T_pos` are indices of 'G' and 'T' in `line` respectively. If `G_pos` is greater than `T_pos`, `G_pos` is now assigned the previous value of `T_pos`, and `T_pos` is now assigned the previous value of `G_pos`.***
