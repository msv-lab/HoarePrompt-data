According to the given code, the execution of the loop depends on the values of `G_pos`, `T_pos`, and `k`. The loop will execute if `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos` and the increment step `k` is such that it allows movement from `G_pos` to `T_pos`.

1. **Ensure indices are correctly set**: Since `G_pos` and `T_pos` are the start and end points respectively, `G_pos` must be less than or equal to `T_pos` for the loop to execute.
2. **Adjust the values**: If `reachable` is False, this potentially indicates that `G_pos` cannot reach `T_pos` using step size `k`. Therefore, to make the loop executable, it must be ensured that `G_pos` can reach `T_pos` by `k` increments.

As such, the conditions that need to be satisfied are:
- `G_pos <= T_pos`
- (`T_pos - G_pos`) must be divisible by `k` that allows travel from `G_pos` to `T_pos` in increments of `k`.

Thus, the necessary changes are:
- Ensure `reachable` is True, indicating possible reach.
- Set `pos` to `G_pos`, as it is the starting index for the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1), `line` is a string, `G_pos` must be less than or equal to `T_pos`, `reachable` is True, `pos` is `G_pos`**
