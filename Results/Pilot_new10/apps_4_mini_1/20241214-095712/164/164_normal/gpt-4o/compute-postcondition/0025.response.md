The statement `reachable = True` assigns a boolean value of `True` to the variable `reachable`. Since `reachable` was already `True` in the initial state, there is no change in its value. The values of the other variables are unaffected. Therefore, the output state remains the same.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1), `line` is a string, `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, `reachable` is True, `pos` is equal to `G_pos + 2k`, and `pos` must be less than or equal to `T_pos.**
