`G_pos` is assigned the value of the index of the character 'G' in the string `line`. Since the initial state indicates that `line` is a string obtained from input, we do not know its specific value or the position of 'G' within it. Therefore, the output state will indicate that `G_pos` has been calculated but we do not know the specific value. The states of the other variables remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1), `line` is a string obtained from input, and `G_pos` is the index of 'G' in `line`.**
