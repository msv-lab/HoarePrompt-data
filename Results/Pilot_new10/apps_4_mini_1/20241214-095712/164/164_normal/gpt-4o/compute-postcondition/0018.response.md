Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1), `line` is a string, `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, `reachable` is True, `pos` is equal to `G_pos + k`, and `pos` must be less than or equal to `T_pos`. If `line[pos]` is '#', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
