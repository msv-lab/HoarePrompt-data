n is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of cells, k is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1) representing the length of one grasshopper's jump, and a string of length n contains the characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T' where 'G' is the grasshopper's starting position, 'T' is the target position, '.' represents empty cells, and '#' represents obstacles. It is guaranteed that 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once in the string.
