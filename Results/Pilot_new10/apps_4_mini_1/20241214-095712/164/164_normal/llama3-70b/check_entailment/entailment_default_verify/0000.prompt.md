You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: On the way to Rio de Janeiro Ostap kills time playing with a grasshopper he took with him in a special box. Ostap builds a line of length n such that some cells of this line are empty and some contain obstacles. Then, he places his grasshopper to one of the empty cells and a small insect in another empty cell. The grasshopper wants to eat the insect.

Ostap knows that grasshopper is able to jump to any empty cell that is exactly k cells away from the current (to the left or to the right). Note that it doesn't matter whether intermediate cells are empty or not as the grasshopper makes a jump over them. For example, if k = 1 the grasshopper can jump to a neighboring cell only, and if k = 2 the grasshopper can jump over a single cell.

Your goal is to determine whether there is a sequence of jumps such that grasshopper will get from his initial position to the cell with an insect.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1) — the number of cells in the line and the length of one grasshopper's jump.

The second line contains a string of length n consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G' and 'T'. Character '.' means that the corresponding cell is empty, character '#' means that the corresponding cell contains an obstacle and grasshopper can't jump there. Character 'G' means that the grasshopper starts at this position and, finally, 'T' means that the target insect is located at this cell. It's guaranteed that characters 'G' and 'T' appear in this line exactly once.


-----Output-----

If there exists a sequence of jumps (each jump of length k), such that the grasshopper can get from his initial position to the cell with the insect, print "YES" (without quotes) in the only line of the input. Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2
#G#T#

Output
YES

Input
6 1
T....G

Output
YES

Input
7 3
T..#..G

Output
NO

Input
6 2
..GT..

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first sample, the grasshopper can make one jump to the right in order to get from cell 2 to cell 4.

In the second sample, the grasshopper is only able to jump to neighboring cells but the way to the insect is free — he can get there by jumping left 5 times.

In the third sample, the grasshopper can't make a single jump.

In the fourth sample, the grasshopper can only jump to the cells with odd indices, thus he won't be able to reach the insect.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    (g, t) = (-1, -1)
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'G':
            g = i
        elif s[i] == 'T':
            t = i
    if g == -1 or t == -1:
        print('NO')
    elif abs(t - g) % k == 0 and all((s[(g + i * k) % n] != '#' for i in range(abs(t - g) // k + 1))):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we first go through the logic of the program and check it against potential edge cases.

### Problem Description Recap:
- A grasshopper is placed at position 'G', and there is a target 'T'.
- The grasshopper can jump over obstacles '#' to another empty cell '.' exactly k positions away.
- We need to determine if the grasshopper can jump from 'G' to 'T'.

### Key Considerations:
1. **Jumps**: The grasshopper can jump to any empty cell k positions away either to the left or right.
2. **Obstacles**: If there is an obstacle in between the grasshopper's starting position and the target during any of the jumps, it cannot make that jump.
3. **Input Constraints**: Ensure that the program correctly processes the input as defined by the constraints (strings and positions).

### Program Logic Analysis:
The program works as follows:
- It reads the input values of `n` (length of the line) and `k` (jump distance).
- It locates the indices of 'G' and 'T'.
- It checks if the absolute difference between the indices of 'G' and 'T' is divisible by `k`. If not, the jump is impossible.
- It verifies that there are no obstacles '#' in the cells that the grasshopper would jump over.

### Edge Case Exploration:
#### Case Analysis:
1. Input where `G` and `T` are the same cell (not possible per constraints).
2. Case where `G` is much closer or further from `T`, and varying positions of `#` that could block the path.

#### Specific Test Case:
Consider the input:
```
5 2
G###T
```
- Here, the grasshopper 'G' is at index 0 and 'T' is at index 4.
- The distance `abs(t - g) = 4`, which is divisible by `k = 2`.
- The jumps would be from 0 to 2 and then from 2 to 4. However, there are obstacles '#' at indices 1 and 2.
- The program will output "NO" correctly because the path is blocked.

#### Another Case:
For the input:
```
5 2
.G..T
```
- Here, `G` is at index 1 and `T` is at index 4.
- The distance `abs(t - g) = 3`, which is not divisible by `k = 2`. 
- This should lead to a "NO", which the program will output correctly.

However, the program's design could potentially overlook cases where:
```
6 2
...GT.
```
- Here `G` is at index 3 and `T` is at index 2.
- The distance `abs(t - g) = 1`, which is not divisible by `k = 2`. This should also yield "NO".

### Conclusion:
The program will generally function correctly under the constraints provided, but it has a flaw. Specifically, there is no handling for cases where obstacles could occur at certain indices despite feasible jumps and immediate blockages. 

I have not found an instance where it fails for all the logical reasoning outlined based on jumping and position but it did miscalculate in the test cases.

Correctness: **True**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts two integers, `n` (between 2 and 100) and `k` (between 1 and n-1), along with a string of length `n` containing exactly one 'G' and one 'T' character, and characters representing empty cells or obstacles. It checks if it is possible to reach 'T' from 'G' by moving `k` steps at a time, ensuring that no obstacles ('#') are encountered along the way. If it is possible, it outputs 'YES'; otherwise, it outputs 'NO'. If either 'G' or 'T' is not found in the string, it outputs 'NO'. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
