Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers, `n` (between 2 and 100) and `k` (between 1 and n-1), along with a string of length `n` containing exactly one 'G' and one 'T' character, and characters representing empty cells or obstacles. It checks if it is possible to reach 'T' from 'G' by moving `k` steps at a time, ensuring that no obstacles ('#') are encountered along the way. If it is possible, it outputs 'YES'; otherwise, it outputs 'NO'. If either 'G' or 'T' is not found in the string, it outputs 'NO'.**
