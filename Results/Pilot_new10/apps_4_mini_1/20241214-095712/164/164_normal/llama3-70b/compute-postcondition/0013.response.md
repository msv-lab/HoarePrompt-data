The assignment `t = i` assigns the value of `i` to `t`. The value of `i` is currently 1, so `t` will also be set to 1. The initial conditions regarding `n`, `g`, and `s[1]` remain unchanged as the code does not affect them directly. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 1, `t` is 1, and the conditions about `g` and `s[1]` are intact.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 1, `t` is 1, if `s[1]` is 'G' then `g` is set to 0; otherwise, if `s[1]` is not 'G' and is equal to 'T', then `t` is set to 0.**
