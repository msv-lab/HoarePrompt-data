To determine the necessary adjustments to the state for the loop to execute, we analyze the provided variables and the loop structure. 

The loop iterates over `i` in the range defined by `n`. The key variables in the current state before the loop starts are:

- `n`, which is an integer between 2 and 100. This indicates that `n` is at least 2, which means the range for `i` will be from 0 to `n-1` (inclusive).
- The loop iterates `n` times, meaning `i` will take on values from 0 up to `n-1`.

Since `n` is guaranteed to be between 2 and 100, the loop will have at least one iteration, which is enough to ensure that the loop executes.

We also have:
- `k`, which is an integer between 1 and `n-1`. This indicates that `k` is relevant if accessed in the loop but does not affect the execution of the loop itself.
- `s`, an input string, which may or may not be used in the loop body.
- `g`, which is -1, and `t`, which is -1. Their roles in the loop are unclear without the loop body but do not impact the execution of the loop.

Given this analysis, we conclude that for the loop to execute, the states that need to be confirmed or acknowledged are:

1. The initialization of `i` before the loop.
2. Confirmation that `n` is greater than or equal to 2 (already satisfied since `n` is between 2 and 100).

Thus, the adjustments needed are minimal:

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 0**
