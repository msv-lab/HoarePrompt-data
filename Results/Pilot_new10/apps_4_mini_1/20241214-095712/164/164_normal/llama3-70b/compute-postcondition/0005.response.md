In the provided code, `g` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 0. The initial state of `n` remains unchanged since the code does not affect it, and the value of `s[i]` remains 'G' as well. Thus, the only variable that changes is `g`, which takes the value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 0, `s[i]` is 'G', `g` is 0**
