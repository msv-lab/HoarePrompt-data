Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `segments` contains all tuples of start and end indices of consecutive 'G' characters in `trophies`. If `trophies` consists of any 'G' characters, these tuples are based on the original value of `i`, which identifies the start of each segment of 'G's within the initial string `trophies`. If there are no 'G' characters, `segments` will remain an empty list.**
