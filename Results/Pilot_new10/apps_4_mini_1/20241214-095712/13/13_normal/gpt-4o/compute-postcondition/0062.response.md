The code assigns values to `prev_start` and `prev_end` based on the values in the `segments` list at index `i - 1`, which is `2` since `i` is `3`. Thus, `prev_start` will be assigned the value `segments[2][0]` and `prev_end` will be assigned the value `segments[2][1]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`i` is 3, `curr_start` is equal to `segments[3][0]`, `curr_end` is equal to `segments[3][1]`, `segments` remains unchanged, `prev_start` is equal to `segments[2][0]`, `prev_end` is equal to `segments[2][1]`, and `len(segments)` is greater than 3.**
