The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing it from 1 to 2. The other variables remain unaffected. The output state is as follows, including all relevant information:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, `trophies[0]` must be 'G', `trophies[1]` must be 'G', `segments` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `start` is 0**
