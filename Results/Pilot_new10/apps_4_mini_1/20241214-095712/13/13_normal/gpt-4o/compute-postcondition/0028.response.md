Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `i`. If `trophies[i]` is 'G', `segments` includes a tuple `(start, i - 1)` where `start` is equal to the original value of `i`, and `i` is at least equal to its original value and less than `n`. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1, maintaining the condition that `n` is greater than `i`.***
