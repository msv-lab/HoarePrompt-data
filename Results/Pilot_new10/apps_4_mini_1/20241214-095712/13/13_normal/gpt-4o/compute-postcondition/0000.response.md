The variable `segments` is initialized as an empty list. The initial state of variable `n` and the string `trophies` remain unaffected by this operation. Thus, the output state will include the unchanged values of these variables along with the new value of `segments`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000; `trophies` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'; `segments` is an empty list**
