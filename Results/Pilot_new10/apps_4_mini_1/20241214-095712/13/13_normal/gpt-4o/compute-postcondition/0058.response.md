Given that `i` is 2, `curr_start` and `curr_end` are assigned the values from `segments[i]`. The initial values indicate that `curr_start` and `curr_end` will now hold the values from the third segment, as `i` corresponds to the index of the third item in the list `segments`. The states of the variables `segments`, `prev_start`, and `prev_end` will remain unchanged, but `curr_start` and `curr_end` will be updated. 

Output State: **`i` is 2, `curr_start` is equal to `segments[2][0]`, `curr_end` is equal to `segments[2][1]`, `segments` remains unchanged, `prev_start` and `prev_end` are equal to the values from `segments[1]`, and `len(segments)` is greater than 2.**
