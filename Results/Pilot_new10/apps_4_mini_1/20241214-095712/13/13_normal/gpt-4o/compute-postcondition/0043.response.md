Postcondition: ***`i` is equal to `n`, `segments` contains all tuples of start and end indices of consecutive 'G' characters in `trophies`. If `trophies` consists of any 'G' characters, these tuples are based on the original value of `i`. Currently, `segments` is an empty list, indicating that there are no 'G' characters in `trophies`.***
