You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vova has won $n$ trophies in different competitions. Each trophy is either golden or silver. The trophies are arranged in a row.

The beauty of the arrangement is the length of the longest subsegment consisting of golden trophies. Vova wants to swap two trophies (not necessarily adjacent ones) to make the arrangement as beautiful as possible — that means, to maximize the length of the longest such subsegment.

Help Vova! Tell him the maximum possible beauty of the arrangement if he is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^5$) — the number of trophies.

The second line contains $n$ characters, each of them is either G or S. If the $i$-th character is G, then the $i$-th trophy is a golden one, otherwise it's a silver trophy. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of a subsegment of golden trophies, if Vova is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Examples-----
Input
10
GGGSGGGSGG

Output
7

Input
4
GGGG

Output
4

Input
3
SSS

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example Vova has to swap trophies with indices $4$ and $10$. Thus he will obtain the sequence "GGGGGGGSGS", the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies is $7$. 

In the second example Vova can make no swaps at all. The length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence is $4$. 

In the third example Vova cannot do anything to make the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence greater than $0$.
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
trophies = data[1]
print(func_1(n, trophies))

def func_1(n, trophies):
    segments = []
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if trophies[i] == 'G':
            start = i
            while i < n and trophies[i] == 'G':
                i += 1
            segments.append((start, i - 1))
        else:
            i += 1
    if not segments:
        return 0
    max_length = max((end - start + 1 for (start, end) in segments))
    if len(segments) == 1:
        return max_length
    for i in range(1, len(segments)):
        (prev_start, prev_end) = segments[i - 1]
        (curr_start, curr_end) = segments[i]
        if curr_start - prev_end == 2:
            max_length = max(max_length, curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1)
    return min(max_length + 1, n)


```
Original Assessment: To analyze the provided program based on the problem description, let's break down the requirements and the implementation step by step.

**Problem Description Recap:**
- We need to determine the maximum length of a contiguous segment of golden trophies ('G') after performing at most one swap of any two trophies (which can be of either color).
- If there are no golden trophies, the output should be 0.
- The program must handle various cases including all golden trophies, no golden trophies, and configurations where swaps can connect segments of golden trophies.

**Program Analysis:**
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads input and initializes the count of trophies and their arrangement correctly.
2. **Segment Identification**: The implementation correctly identifies segments of 'G' trophies and stores their starting and ending indexes.
3. **Maximum Length Calculation**:
    - The program finds the maximum segment length initially: `max_length = max((end - start + 1 for (start, end) in segments))`.
    - It also correctly handles the case where there’s only one segment of 'G' trophies by returning that length.
4. **Swapping Logic**: The logic to check if two segments of 'G' can be connected by a swap (i.e., if they are separated by exactly one 'S') is implemented, but the following issues exist:
   - The swap logic only checks for segments that are exactly two positions apart. It doesn't consider cases where a swap might make segments closer if there are multiple 'S' trophies in between, which could lead to different maximum lengths being achievable.
5. **Final Return Statement**: The program returns `min(max_length + 1, n)`, which could lead to incorrect results when there are unswapped segments of 'G' that would form a longer contiguous segment than the calculated maximum.

**Edge Case Example**:
Consider the case where we have:
```
5
GSGSG
```
- The longest segment of 'G' currently is 1 (from either segment).
- A swap between the first 'G' (index 0) and the last 'G' (index 4) does not seem to connect any segments since we only have 'S' in between.
- The program incorrectly suggests that the maximum could be greater simply due to potential swaps.

In summary, while the program works in various scenarios, it does not fully account for the impact of swaps across multiple 'S' between the 'G' segments, leading to potentially incorrect results.

Therefore, the overall conclusion is that the program does not meet the requirement to find the maximum beauty of the arrangement in all cases.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program could output wrong results for cases such as 'GSGSG' as demonstrated, as it does not correctly calculate the maximum possible contiguous 'G' segment after one swap.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts an integer `n` and a string `trophies` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'. It returns 0 if there are no 'G' characters in the string. If there's only one segment of consecutive 'G' characters, it returns the length of that segment. If there are multiple segments, it calculates the maximum length of consecutive 'G' segments, checks if any two segments are separated by exactly one 'S', and returns the minimum between `max_length + 1` and `n`. This function effectively identifies and evaluates the segments of 'G', handling cases with no 'G's, a single segment of 'G's, and multiple segments efficiently. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
