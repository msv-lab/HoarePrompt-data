Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `max_beauty` is unchanged; `left` is the index of the first 'G' found before reaching the end of the string (or `n` if none found); `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0; `curr_beauty` is set to 1 if `s[j]` is 'G', else `curr_beauty` remains 0; `j` is `i - 2`; if `s[j]` is 'G', then `beauty` is incremented by 1; otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
