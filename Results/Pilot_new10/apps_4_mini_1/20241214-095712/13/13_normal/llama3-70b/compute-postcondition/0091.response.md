According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop iterates as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at a value less than `n - 1`, allowing for another iteration.

Since `n` is an integer between 2 and 100000, and `i` can take values from 0 to `n - 2`, to execute the loop one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`. 

For the loop to continue executing, `i` should now be equal to `n - 2` (which is still less than `n - 1`), ensuring that the loop can run again. Hence, we don't need to change the value of `n`.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100000, `i` is equal to `n - 2`**
