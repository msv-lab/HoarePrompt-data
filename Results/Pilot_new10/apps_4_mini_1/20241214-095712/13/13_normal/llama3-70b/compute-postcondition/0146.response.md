The code provided is a `break` statement, which exits the most internal loop or if statement the code is currently in. The values of the variables do not change, but the control flow is modified by breaking out of the loop.

Given the initial state, since `break` does not alter the values of `n`, `i`, `j`, or `beauty`, but effectively ends the current loop execution, we summarize the state as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100000, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `j` is initialized to a value that allows for iteration, `beauty` is calculated as described, and the value at `s[j]` is not 'G'; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
