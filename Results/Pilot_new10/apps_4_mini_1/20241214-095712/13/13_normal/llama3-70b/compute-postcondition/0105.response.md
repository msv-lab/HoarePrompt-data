The code snippet `break` does not modify any variables directly; instead, it causes an immediate exit from the loop or control structure in which it is placed. Hence, while the state of `n`, `i`, `j`, and `beauty` remains unchanged, the program flow is affected.

The initial values are:
- `n` must be at least 4,
- `i` is equal to `n - 2` (which is at least 2),
- `j` is equal to `n - 4` (which is at least 0),
- `beauty` is either 1 or 2 depending on `s[j]`.

Since the variables are unaltered, but we note that we are breaking out of the most inner loop or control statement, the Output State retains all values while implying that a break occurred.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 4, `i` is equal to `n - 2`, `j` is `n - 4`, `beauty` is either 1 or 2 depending on `s[j]` and we break out of the most internal loop or control statement.**
