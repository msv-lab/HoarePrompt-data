The variable `max_beauty` is initialized to 0. None of the other variables (`n`, `s`, `golden`) are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the initial conditions, with the new value for `max_beauty`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'; `golden` is a list containing the indices of 'G' in `s`; `max_beauty` is 0**.
