The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 100000 \), and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' (for golden trophies) and 'S' (for silver trophies). The function evaluates the characters in the string and based on the conditions derived from the characters, it returns an output. However, the specific output is not defined in the provided details. 

Assuming the output logic follows from common patterns in problems involving 'G' and 'S', we can infer possible outputs, but the precise conditions and outcomes are not mentioned, and I will not describe them here.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a string `s` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters. It returns a result based on the evaluation of the string `s`.**
