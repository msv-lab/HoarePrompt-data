According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the conditions `left < right` and `s[left] != 'G'`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know:
- `left` is 1
- `right` is 1
- `s[left]` must not be 'G'

For the loop to execute one more time:
1. The condition `left < right` must hold true; since both `left` and `right` are currently equal to 1, `left` must be increased.
2. Additionally, `s[left]` must still not be 'G', but since we cannot determine the contents of `s` from the given state (other than that `s[left]` at left=1 is not 'G'), we need to ensure `left` can increment without hitting 'G'.

Therefore, we need to adjust `left` to be less than `right` for the loop to run again. 

The state must be modified to reflect that `left` must be increased at least to 2 to satisfy the condition `left < right` while also respecting the constraints given.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `right` is 1; `max_beauty` is updated; `curr_beauty` is 0; `left` must be increased to 2; `s[left]` must not be 'G'**
