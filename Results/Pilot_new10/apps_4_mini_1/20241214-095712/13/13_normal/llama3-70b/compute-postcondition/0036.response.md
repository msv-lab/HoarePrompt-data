Postcondition: ***`left` is the index of the first 'G' in the string `s`, with `right` unchanged at 1. If `left` is less than `right`, then `max_beauty` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, which is now 1. The condition ensures that `s[left]` is 'G' if `left` is less than `n`, or `left` equals `n` if 'G' is not present, and `left` is guaranteed to be less than `right`.***
