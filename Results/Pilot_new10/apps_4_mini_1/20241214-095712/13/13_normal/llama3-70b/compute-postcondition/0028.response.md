The value of `left` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged, and all conditions regarding their state are still valid. Hence, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `right` is 1; `max_beauty` is updated; `curr_beauty` is 0; `left` is now 1; `s[left]` must not be 'G'.
