The variable `beauty` is incremented by 1. The previous state of `beauty` is known to be the total count of 'G's plus one, so the new value of `beauty` will be the total count of 'G's plus two. The other variables remain unchanged as the operation only affects `beauty`.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100000, `left` is the index of the first 'G' found (or `n` if none), `i` is less than or equal to `n - 2`, `j` is now `i + 2`, `max_beauty` is unchanged, `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0, `curr_beauty` is the number of 'G's found before hitting a non-'G', `beauty` is the total count of 'G's plus two, and the character at index `j` is 'G'.**
