According to the code, whether the loop can execute relies on the condition that `left` must be less than `right`, and the character at index `left` in `s` must not be 'G'. Right before the loop, it's stated that `right` is 0, which implies that `left` must also be less than `right` for the loop to execute. Since `right` is 0, `left` must be adjusted to be less than `right` and would need to be less than 0 for the loop to execute at least once. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, we must ensure:
- `left` must be less than `right`, implying `left` must currently be negative.

Also, since the character at index `right` (0) cannot be 'G' (which would not be possible given the above states), we need to ensure `left` is properly set.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `right` is 0, `left` must be less than 0, the character at index `right` in `s` must not be 'G', `max_beauty` is either unchanged or equal to `max(max_beauty, curr_beauty)`, `curr_beauty` is 0**
