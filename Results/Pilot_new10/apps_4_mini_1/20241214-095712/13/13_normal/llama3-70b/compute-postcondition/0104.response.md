The value of `beauty` is incremented by 1. Since `beauty` was initially either 1 or 2 depending on `s[j]`, the possible new values for `beauty` would be 2 or 3 respectively after the increment. The other variables are not affected, so the output state maintains their previous conditions with the only change being to `beauty`. 

Output State: **`n` must be at least 4, `i` is equal to `n - 2`, `j` is `n - 4`, `beauty` is either 2 or 3 depending on `s[j]`**.
