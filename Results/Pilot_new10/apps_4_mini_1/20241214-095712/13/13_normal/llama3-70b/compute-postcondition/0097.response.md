The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be at least 3, `i` is equal to `n - 2`, `j` is 0, `beauty` is 1, and the first element of `s` at index `j` (i.e., `s[0]`) is not equal to 'G' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
