Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 100000, `i` is equal to `n - 2`, and `j` is initialized to 0. If `s[j]` is 'G', `beauty` is one more than the previous count of consecutive 'G' characters from the end of the `s` string. If `s[j]` is not 'G', `beauty` remains the count of consecutive 'G' characters from the end of the `s` string up to index `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
