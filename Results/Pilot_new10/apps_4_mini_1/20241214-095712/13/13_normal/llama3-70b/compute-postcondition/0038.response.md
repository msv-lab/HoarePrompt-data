According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `right`. The loop executes for each index in the range from 0 to `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `right` is 1. The next iteration will increment `right` by 1. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `right` should be 2. The loop will still respect the condition of `right` being less than `n`. Thus, given the constraints, `n` remains unchanged, and `curr_beauty`, `max_beauty`, and `left` may update based on the loop's logic, but they are not specifically determined in this context.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `right` is 2**
