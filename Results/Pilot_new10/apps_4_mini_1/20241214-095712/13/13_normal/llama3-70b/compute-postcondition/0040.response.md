The code affects the variable `max_beauty`, which is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `curr_beauty`. However, there are no details provided regarding the initial value of `max_beauty` or `curr_beauty`, so we cannot specify specific values for these variables. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this line of code.

The output state must reflect that `max_beauty` has been updated based on the comparison, but the precise values depend on the values of `curr_beauty`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `right` is 2, `max_beauty` is updated to max(max_beauty, curr_beauty)**.
