According to the code, the for loop will execute as long as the variable `j` is less than `n`. The initialization of `j` in the loop starts from `i + 2`, and since `i` is less than `n - 2`, we know that there is room for `j` to increment within the loop's range.

At the end of the last iteration, we have:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 100000,
- `i` is less than `n - 2`,
- `j` is initialized to a value allowing for iteration starting from `i + 2`.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need `j` to be incremented by 1 to `j + 1`. Therefore, `j` must be updated accordingly for the next iteration of the loop.

Now, to determine what the value of `j` must be at the start of the next iteration, we consider the current value of `j`. Since the loop will only continue as long as `j < n`, we need to ensure that after incrementing `j`, it stays less than `n`. This will extend the iterations depending on the current value of `j`.

Thus, the updated state would reflect the increment in `j`.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100000, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `j` is initialized to `j + 1`, `beauty` remains as calculated in the previous iteration.**
