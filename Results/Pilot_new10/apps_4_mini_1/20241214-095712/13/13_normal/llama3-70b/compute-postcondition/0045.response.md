The value of `left` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `left` is 1, so the new value of `left` becomes 2. The other variables remain unchanged, and `s[left]` must still not be 'G'.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `right` is 2, `left` is 2, and `s[left]` must not be 'G'**.
