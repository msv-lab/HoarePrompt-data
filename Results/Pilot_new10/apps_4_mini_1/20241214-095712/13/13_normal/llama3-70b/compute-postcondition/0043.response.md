The value of `left` is incremented by 1. Since `left` must be either 0 or 1 before the operation, after the operation, `left` will take a value of either 1 or 2. Given the precondition that `s[left]` must not be 'G' indicates that `left` becomes 1 (because if it were 2, then `s[2]` would need to be checked and could potentially violate the condition in the next operation). The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `right` is 2, `left` is 1**
