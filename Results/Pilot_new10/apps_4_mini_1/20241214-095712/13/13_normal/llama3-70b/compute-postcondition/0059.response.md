To determine the necessary conditions for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the range of the for loop. The loop is structured as `for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1)`, which means that `j` will start at `i - 1` and count down to `0`, inclusive, stopping before reaching `-1`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `0`, which means `i - 1` will equal `-1`.

Since the starting point for `j` is `-1`, it cannot iterate as there are no integers in the range from `-1` to `-1` (exclusive). Therefore, to allow the loop to execute, we need `i` to be greater than `0`. If `i` were at least `1`, the loop would correctly get a starting point of `0` and be able to execute, iterating through the range down to `0`.

Thus, the necessary adjustments to the state for the loop to execute are:
- `i` must be greater than `0`, so `j` can start at `i - 1`, which would be `0` or higher for valid iterations. 

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `max_beauty` is unchanged, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is the index of the first 'G' found before reaching the end of the string (or `n` if none found), `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0, `i` must be greater than 0, and the character at index `i` of string `s` is 'G' while the character at index `i + 1` of string `s` is 'S'; `beauty` is 1**.
