The list `golden` is created by iterating over the string `s` and collecting the indices of the characters that are 'G'. The variable `n` remains unchanged and retains its value as an input integer between 2 and 100000, while `s` retains its string value of length `n`. The state of `golden` depends on the number of 'G' characters in `s` and their respective positions.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'; `golden` is a list containing the indices of 'G' in `s`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'; `golden` is a list containing the indices of 'G' in `s`.**
