The code `beauty += 1` increments the value of `beauty` by 1. The initial value of `beauty` is defined as either 2 or 1, depending on the character at index `j`. Since the code modifies `beauty`, we will update that variable accordingly while keeping the other variables unchanged. 

- If the character at index `j` (which is `n - 3`) of `s` is 'G', `beauty` becomes 3.
- If the character at index `j` is not 'G', `beauty` becomes 2.

Therefore, the Output State is dependent on the specific condition of the character at index `j`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100000, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `n - 3`, and `beauty` is 3 if the character at index `j` of `s` is 'G', else `beauty` is 2.**
