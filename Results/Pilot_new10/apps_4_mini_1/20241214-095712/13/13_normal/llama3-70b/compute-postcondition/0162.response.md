Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 <= n <= 100000) and a string `s` consisting of characters 'G' (for golden trophies) and 'S' (for silver trophies). It calculates the maximum number of consecutive 'G's that can be achieved in the string, either as-is or by swapping a single 'S' adjacent to a 'G' with another 'G'. The function returns the highest value of these consecutive 'G's. If there are no 'G's present, it returns 0. **
