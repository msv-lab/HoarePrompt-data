According to the code, the loop can continue executing as long as `right` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `right` is 0, and `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000. For the loop to execute one more time, `right` needs to be incremented by 1. 

So, after the last iteration, `right` will be 1. The character at this new index `right` in string `s` could either be 'G' or not, but the value of `curr_beauty` may change based on the character at this position. The `max_beauty` value may also be updated if `curr_beauty` exceeds it.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `right` is 1**
