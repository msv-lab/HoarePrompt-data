The code snippet increments the variable `beauty` by 1. The values of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. The initial state indicates that `n` is an integer between 2 and 100000, `i` is equal to `n - 2`, and `j` is 2. Thus, after running the code, the output state reflects that `beauty` has been increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100000, `i` is equal to `n - 2`, `j` is 2, `beauty` is increased by 1.**
