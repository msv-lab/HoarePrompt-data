The value of `left` is incremented by 1. Given that `left` starts at 2, after the increment, `left` becomes 3. The constraints on `n`, `right`, and the condition for `s[left]` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `right` must be greater than 2, `left` is 3, and `s[left]` is not 'G'**
