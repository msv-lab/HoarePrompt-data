In the given code, `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1. The other variables are not affected, and we know that `n` is an input integer between 2 and 100000, while `right` remains 1. Therefore, the only updated variable will be `curr_beauty`, which increases by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `right` is 1, `curr_beauty` is increased by 1**
