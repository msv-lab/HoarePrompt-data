The variable `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `n` is an input integer in the range 2 to 100000, `right` is 0, and the character at index `right` of string `s` is 'G'. Other variables' states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `right` is 0, the character at index `right` of string `s` is 'G', and `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1**.
