Postcondition: ***`n` is between 2 and 100000. If the character at index `j` is 'G', then `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1, and `beauty` increases by one, resulting in a total count of 'G's plus two. Otherwise, if `s[j]` is not 'G', the `curr_beauty` remains unchanged, and `beauty` increases by one, with a total count of 'G's plus one, while we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
