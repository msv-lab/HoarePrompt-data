Postcondition: ***`left` is the index of the first 'G' in the string `s` after the loop has completed or `n` if 'G' is not present, `right` is unchanged at 1, `max_beauty` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is 0, `s[left]` must be 'G' if `left` is less than `n`, or `left` equals `n` if 'G' is not present. Additionally, `left` is less than `right` (which is 1).***
