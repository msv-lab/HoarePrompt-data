Correctness: **False**

The provided program doesn't handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, if we consider an input of `n = 7`, the function will return `0`, but this is incorrect according to the problem's requirements. The valid combinations that can form a rectangle but not a square are not accounted for in the current implementation.

For `n = 7`, possible configurations could include:
- {1, 1, 2, 3} which cannot form a rectangle.
- {1, 1, 3, 2} which also cannot form a rectangle.

However, if we incrementally check for valid configurations up till `7`, as per the problem, it turns out there is a missing logic that counts potential combinations accurately for the condition that allows the formation of a rectangle without forming a square.

In short, the method fails to count combinations correctly for cases that could lead to valid rectangles while still being distinct, leading to an incorrect response for certain inputs. Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential inputs.
