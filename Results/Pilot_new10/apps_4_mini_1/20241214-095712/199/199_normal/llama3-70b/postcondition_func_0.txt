The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the number of distinct pairs `(a, b)` such that `2 * (a + b) = n` with the constraints that `1 â‰¤ a < b` and both `a` and `b` must fit within the calculated bounds. The function does not handle cases where `n` is odd, which will result in zero pairs, as no two distinct integers would satisfy the equation in that scenario. Therefore, the function effectively counts the valid pairs only for even values of `n`.
