The provided program attempts to count the number of distinct ways to split a stick of length `n` into four parts such that it is possible to form a rectangle and impossible to form a square. 

### Analysis of the Program:
1. The function `func_1(n)` calculates the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` such that:
   - `a` and `b` satisfy the equation `2 * (a + b) = n`.
   - The conditions that `1 â‰¤ a < b` are met.
   
2. The inner logic checks these pairs within the range where `a` starts from `1` and `b` is derived by making sure that `a` is less than `b`.

3. The critical issue lies in how the function treats odd values of `n`. According to the output hints, the function does not account for odd values well, and since it's impossible to form pairs `(a, b)` when `n` is odd, the function would indeed return `0` correctly but does not handle the scenario in a nuanced way as required by the problem, which asks for counting arrangements where they are valid for achieving a rectangle.

### Missing Case Consideration:
- The challenge clearly states examples which would yield `1` and `4` valid arrangements but is silent about values of `n` that could be odd providing an incorrect count of possible arrangements as it will always yield `0`. Thus, cases like `n=5`, or any odd numbers do not trigger correctly based on this arrangement requirement of distinct pairs and would logically support the condition to check pairs relying on the symmetry of evenness leading to counting issues.

### Conclusion:
The output hints clarify that the function effectively only evaluates the case for even `n`, while completely ignoring how odd values of `n` should be treated or validated based on the problem statement. Therefore, since the program fails to adequately address configurations for all potential input cases, including those for odd inputs, it does not meet the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **False**.
