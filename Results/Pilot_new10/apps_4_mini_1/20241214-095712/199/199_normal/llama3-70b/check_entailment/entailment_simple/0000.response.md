To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze both carefully.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We have a stick of length `n`.
- We want to split this stick into 4 parts such that:
  - The lengths are positive integers.
  - The sum of these lengths equals `n`.
  - The lengths form a rectangle (which means we need two pairs of equal lengths).
  - The lengths do not form a square (which means the two pairs must have different lengths).

### Annotated Program Overview:
- The program defines a function `func_1(n)` that counts the ways to achieve valid pairs of lengths `(a, b)` such that:
  1. `1 â‰¤ a < b`
  2. The equation `2 * (a + b) = n` holds true.
  
### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Variable Initialization**: `ways` is initialized to zero, which is correct as we start counting ways.
2. **Loop Structure**:
   - The outer loop iterates over possible values of `a` from `1` to `n // 2`.
   - The inner loop iterates over possible values of `b` starting from `a` to ensure that `a` is less than or equal to `b`.
   - The condition `if a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n` checks if the pair `(a, b)` can form the desired two pairs needed for the rectangle while ensuring they are not the same lengths (to avoid forming a square).
3. **Return Value**: The function returns the count of valid pairs that meet the conditions.

### Points of Consideration:
- The program correctly handles the requirement that `a` and `b` must be distinct to avoid forming a square.
- The condition `2 * (a + b) = n` ensures that we account for the total length of the stick. 

### Edge Cases:
- Consider cases where `n` is less than `6`: For `n=1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, it's impossible to split into valid lengths that satisfy the rectangle condition because it simply doesn't support four positive parts.
- When `n` equals `6` (the minimal value to allow valid splits), the only combination `{1, 1, 2, 2}` is correctly returned as 1.
- For values of `n` such as `20`, the function correctly returns 4 based on valid distinct pairs.

### Conclusion:
The program accurately reflects what is required in the problem description. It counts the distinct ways of cutting a stick into lengths allowing for rectangle formation without forming a square, and it handles edge cases where less than 6 length cannot yield valid configurations.

**Final Verdict**:
Correctness: **True**
