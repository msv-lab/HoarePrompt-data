You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Pasha has a wooden stick of some positive integer length n. He wants to perform exactly three cuts to get four parts of the stick. Each part must have some positive integer length and the sum of these lengths will obviously be n. 

Pasha likes rectangles but hates squares, so he wonders, how many ways are there to split a stick into four parts so that it's possible to form a rectangle using these parts, but is impossible to form a square.

Your task is to help Pasha and count the number of such ways. Two ways to cut the stick are considered distinct if there exists some integer x, such that the number of parts of length x in the first way differ from the number of parts of length x in the second way.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9) — the length of Pasha's stick.


-----Output-----

The output should contain a single integer — the number of ways to split Pasha's stick into four parts of positive integer length so that it's possible to make a rectangle by connecting the ends of these parts, but is impossible to form a square. 


-----Examples-----
Input
6

Output
1

Input
20

Output
4



-----Note-----

There is only one way to divide the stick in the first sample {1, 1, 2, 2}.

Four ways to divide the stick in the second sample are {1, 1, 9, 9}, {2, 2, 8, 8}, {3, 3, 7, 7} and {4, 4, 6, 6}. Note that {5, 5, 5, 5} doesn't work.
Program:
```
n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(n):
    ways = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
            if a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n:
                ways += 1
    return ways


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the given problem description, let's analyze the requirements closely.

### Problem Requirements:
1. We need to split a stick of length `n` into four parts, each having positive integer lengths.
2. The cuts must allow us to form a rectangle but not a square.
   - A rectangle requires two pairs of equal lengths.
   - A square requires all four parts to be of equal length (which is not allowed).
   
### Code Analysis:
The function `func_1(n)` aims to calculate the number of ways to split the stick as described. Here’s a breakdown of the logic:

- It iterates over all integer lengths `a` from `1` to `n // 2`.
- For each length `a`, it iterates over all possible lengths `b` starting from `a` to half the remaining length `(n - a) // 2`.
- It checks if `2 * (a + b) == n`, implying that we can form pairs `(a, a)` and `(b, b)`.
- It ensures that `a != b` (to ensure it's not a square).
- It counts each valid combination that meets these requirements.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Minimum Input Case:** If `n = 1`, the program does not produce any output since we cannot form any valid lengths.
2. **Valid Pair Test:** For example, if `n = 8`, the pairs it would consider are `(1,1,3,3)` or `(2,2,2,2)`, but `(2,2,2,2)` would be an invalid square case.
3. **General Case:** If `n` is odd (e.g., `n = 7`), it would be impossible to form pairs needed to create a rectangle, as the total must be even.

### Test Case:
Let’s consider `n = 10`. 
- The pairs that would be checked are `(1,1,4,4)` which is valid, `(2,2,3,3)`, and so on.
- The pairs `(5,5)` would be invalid because they would create a square.

This prompts consideration if any value of `n` leads to forming pairs not satisfying the conditions, especially if both `a` and `b` can be the same which creates a square type situation.

### Conclusion:
The program seems to correctly evaluate the counts for the pairs. However, the iterative logic has edge cases that might not entirely validate positive lengths properly leading to incorrect counts when the stick length is small or leads to odd lengths.

After considering multiple scenarios:
- For `n = 9`, the program does not count valid pairs because valid pairs are not checked correctly when both values can be the same, as this leads to a case that may yield a square.

Thus, we have reason to believe that there are inputs that may produce incorrect outputs.

### Final Decision:
Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not cover all edge cases and could incorrectly determine counts especially for certain lengths or fail to count combinations leading to valid rectangles without squares.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9.
def func_1(n):
    ways = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
            if a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n:
                ways += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^9, `ways` is the number of distinct pairs `(a, b)` such that `2 * (a + b) = n` with `1 ≤ a < b` and `b` being within the specified range.
    return ways
    #The program returns the number of distinct pairs `(a, b)` such that `2 * (a + b) = n` with `1 ≤ a < b` and `b` being within the specified range


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
