Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly address the requirements outlined in the problem description. Specifically, the problem requires finding distinct ways to split Pasha's stick, such that the four parts can form a rectangle but cannot form a square. 

The program only counts distinct pairs `(a, b)` such that `2 * (a + b) = n` and where `a` and `b` meet certain conditions. However, it fails to consider how the values `a` and `b` can be arranged to form four distinct parts (i.e., two parts of length `a` and two parts of length `b`) or how to ensure that these combinations can create a rectangle that is not a square. 

Additionally, the program does not handle the scenario when `n` is odd; in such cases, there are no valid pairs of integers `a` and `b` which can satisfy `2 * (a + b) = n`. This directly contradicts the requirement to find valid partitions that sum up to `n` and meet the specified conditions for forming rectangles and avoiding squares.

For example, with `n = 6`, the only viable partition is `{1, 1, 2, 2}`, which the function correctly identifies. Yet, by only counting pairs `(a, b)`, it neglects other potential combinations and does not evaluate the full range of possibilities as specified in the problem description. Furthermore, the solution fails entirely for other cases like `n = 5`, where a valid partition does not exist, but the program will simply return 0 without considering the implications of odd `n` and identifying valid integer partitions.

Thus, the function does not capture the full breadth of valid configurations as required by the problem statement.
