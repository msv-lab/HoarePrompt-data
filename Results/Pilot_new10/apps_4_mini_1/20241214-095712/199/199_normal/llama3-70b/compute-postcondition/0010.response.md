`ways` is incremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `ways` is set to 1 (or 2 based on conditions regarding `n`). Therefore, after the execution of the code, `ways` becomes either 2 (if it was initially 1) or 3 (if it was initially 2). The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are unaffected by this operation. 

Output State: **If `n` is at least 7, `a` is 1, `b` is 3, and `ways` is either 2 or 3 based on previous value**
