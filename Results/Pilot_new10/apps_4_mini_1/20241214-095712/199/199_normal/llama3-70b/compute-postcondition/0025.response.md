According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `a` in relation to `n`. The loop continues as long as `a` is less than or equal to `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is 2 and `n` is at least 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` would be incremented by 1, leading to `a` becoming 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 6 (since 3 needs to be less than or equal to `n // 2` which implies `n` must be at least 6).

State: **`n` must be at least 6, `a` is 3, `ways` is the number of valid pairs `(3, b)` such that `3 * (3 + b) == n`, for `b` in range from 2 to `(n - 2) // 2`.**
