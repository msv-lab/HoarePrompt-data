According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n // 2 + 1`. If `n` is 1, the range would be `range(1, 1)` which results in an empty range and the loop wouldn't execute. Therefore, the state adjustments needed are that `n` is at least 2, and `a` starts at 1.

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `ways` is 0, `a` is 1**
