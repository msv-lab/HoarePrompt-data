The code `ways += 1` increments the value of `ways` by 1. Since `ways` is initially set to 1 if `a` is not equal to `b` (which is true as `1` is not `2`) and `2 * (a + b)` equals `n`, we need to check if this condition holds true. 

Given that `a` is 1 and `b` is 2: 
- `2 * (1 + 2) = 2 * 3 = 6`.
- Therefore, for the condition `2 * (a + b) == n` to hold, `n` must equal 6 or more (`n` is at least 4). 

Assuming the value of `n` is indeed 6 or greater, the initial state confirms that:
- `n` is at least 4, 
- `a` is 1,
- `b` is 2,
- `ways` is initially set to 1.

After executing the code line `ways += 1`, `ways` would be 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `a` is 1, `b` is 2, `ways` is 2**.
