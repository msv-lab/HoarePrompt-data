The code increases the value of `ways` by 1. The previous value of `ways` was 0, so now it becomes 1. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `ways` is 1, `a` is 1, `b` is initially 1, and the current values satisfy that `a` is not equal to `b` while `2 * (a + b)` equals `n`.**
