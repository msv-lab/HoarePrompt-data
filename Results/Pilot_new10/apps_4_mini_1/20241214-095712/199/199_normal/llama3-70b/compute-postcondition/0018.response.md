According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `b` starting from `a` (which is 2) to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, we have:
- `n` is at least 4, which means `(n - a) // 2 + 1` will be calculated as follows: 
  - With `n = 4`, `(4 - 2) // 2 + 1` equals 2.
  - With `n = 5`, `(5 - 2) // 2 + 1` equals 2.
  - With `n = 6`, `(6 - 2) // 2 + 1` equals 3.
  - With `n = 7`, `(7 - 2) // 2 + 1` equals 3.
  - With `n = 8`, `(8 - 2) // 2 + 1` equals 4.

The maximum value for `b` that allows the loop to execute will depend on these calculations. Since `b` is starting from `a=2`, we need to check if there are possible values for `b` in the next iteration.

If the last iteration had `b` equal to its maximum limit (which is `(n - a) // 2`), we would increase it by 1 to prepare for the next execution. Otherwise, we simply increment `b` by 1 for the next iteration.

Assuming the loop has not reached its end yet:
- If `b` is currently 2, and since `n` is at least 4, we need to know if we can continue the loop. The maximum potential value for `b` in the next iteration will depend on `n`. If `n` is 4, it would set `b` to `3`, which is not permissible as it's not within range of effective values.

So, in this case, we should restrict it based on `n` being greater than 4 (at least 5+) to ensure that there can be an additional iteration. The state at the next iteration can be set directly to incrementing `b` from its last value.

Thus, if its current calculated max possible was 3, the adjustment for the next would ideally allow for `b` to catch up while still confirming the range:

State: **`n` is at least 4, `a` is 2, `b` is 3.**
