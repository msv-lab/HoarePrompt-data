The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9) and returns 0 if `n` is less than 6. If `n` is 6 or greater, it calculates and returns the number of valid configurations based on pairs (a, b) and a remainder (rem) derived from `n`. Specifically, the function counts configurations where `rem` is positive and even, and a is not equal to half of `rem`. The function's functionality accounts for edge cases when `n` is less than 6 and only computes valid configurations for larger values of `n`.
