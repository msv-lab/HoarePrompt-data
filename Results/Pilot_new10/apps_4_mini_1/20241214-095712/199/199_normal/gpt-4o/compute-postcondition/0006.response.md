In the initial state, `n` is a positive integer ranging from 6 to 2·10^9, `count` is 0, `a` is 1, and `b` is 1. 

The line of code `rem = n - 2 * (a + b)` will impact the value of `rem`. 

Calculating the value:
- Here, `a + b` equals `1 + 1`, which is `2`.
- Therefore, `2 * (a + b)` equals `2 * 2`, which is `4`.
- Thus, `rem` is assigned the value of `n - 4`.

So, `rem` will hold the value `n - 4`.

The values of the other variables (`n`, `count`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged. 

Thus, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^9 and `n` is greater than or equal to 6; `count` is 0; `a` is 1; `b` is 1; `rem` is equal to `n - 4`.**
