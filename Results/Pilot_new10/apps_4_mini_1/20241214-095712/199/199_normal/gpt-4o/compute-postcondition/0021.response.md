The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` was 2, so after the execution, `count` becomes 3. The states of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `rem`) remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than or equal to 12, `count` is 3, `a` is 3, `b` is 3, `rem` is equal to `n - 12`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 12, `count` is 3, `a` is 3, `b` is 3, `rem` is equal to `n - 12**
