Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential configurations needed to satisfy the problem description fully. Specifically, the code attempts to count valid pairs that can form a rectangle but fails to account for configurations that could yield valid rectangles under varying conditions, especially when `n` has values that can yield more combinations.

For instance, let's examine the case when `n = 8`. The proper configurations that satisfy the conditions of forming rectangles but not squares should include:
- {1, 1, 3, 3}
- {2, 2, 2, 2} (this forms a square and should be excluded)
- {2, 2, 3, 3} (also valid)
Thus, `8` should yield configurations `{1, 1, 3, 3}` and any other valid pairs as per the length restrictions.

However, the code logic revolves strictly around iterating with `a` from `1` to `n // 4`, which restricts the valid combinations excessively. The program's conditions may miss others like `{2, 2, 4, 4}` as it focuses on pairs of the same length instead of allowing combinations of differing lengths.

Therefore, it does not meet conditions for "every potential case," and since it doesn't accurately count possible configurations, it outputs incorrect results for some input values.
