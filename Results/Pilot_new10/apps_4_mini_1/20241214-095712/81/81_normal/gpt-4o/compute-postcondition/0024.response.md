Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r`, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x`, `y` is an integer such that `x` ≤ `y`, and `z` is an integer such that `z` ≥ 4. If `z` is even (i.e., `z % 2 == 0`), then `count` is updated to 2 or 3 if `a` equals `b` and 3 or 4 otherwise, where `a` is equal to `2 * x` and `b` is equal to `(z // 2) * x` given that `l` ≤ `a ≤ r`, `l` ≤ `b ≤ r`, `math.gcd(a, b) == x`, and `a * b // math.gcd(a, b) == y`. Otherwise, if `z` is odd, no changes occur to the values of `count`, `i`, `a`, or `b.***
