The variable `z` is assigned the value of `y // x`, which is the integer division of `y` by `x`. Given that `y` is divisible by `x` (y % x = 0), `z` will be a positive integer. The values of `l`, `r`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged in this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `l`, `r`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `y` ≤ 10^9; `z` is equal to `y // x`, which is a positive integer.

Output State: **`l`, `r`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `y` ≤ 10^9; `z` is equal to `y // x`, which is a positive integer.**
