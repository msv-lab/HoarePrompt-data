The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `l`, `r`, `x`, and `y`. All parameters are integers with the constraints that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 10^9. The function evaluates two cases based on its internal logic. 

In Case_1, the function returns 0. In Case_2, the function returns the count of valid pairs `(a, b)` that meet specified conditions, with the counting process depending on the value of `z`, which is determined within the function.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept four integers `l`, `r`, `x`, and `y`, and return either 0 or the count of valid pairs `(a, b)` based on certain conditions derived from the inputs. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters l, r, x, and y, and returns 0 under certain conditions; otherwise, it returns the count of valid pairs (a, b) based on further specified criteria.**
