To find the output state, we start with the initial conditions:

- `l` and `r` are integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq r\).
- `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x\).
- `y` is an integer such that \(x \leq y\).
- `z` is an integer such that \(z \geq 4\).
- `i` is equal to \(k + 1\).
- `a` is equal to \((k + 1) * x\).

Now, let's break down the code:

```
b = z // i * x
```

We are calculating `b` using the formula \(b = \frac{z}{i} \times x\).
- `z // i` performs integer division of `z` by `i`, which means that `b` will take the largest integer less than or equal to \(\frac{z}{i}\) multiplied by `x`.

After running this code, we can summarize that:
- The value of `b` is computed as described, which changes the output state but does not affect the other variables `l`, `r`, `x`, `y`, `z`, `i`, or `a`.

Now let's state the output. 

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r`, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x`, `y` is an integer such that `x` ≤ `y`, `z` is an integer such that `z` ≥ 4, `i` is `k + 1`, `a` is equal to `(k + 1) * x`, and `b` is equal to `z // i * x`.**
