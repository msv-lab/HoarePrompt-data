In the given code snippet, `b` is assigned the value of `z // i * x`. The values of the affected variables are `z`, `i`, and `x`. 

- From the initial state, we know that:
  - `z` is equal to `y // x`, which is a positive integer.
  - `i` is currently 1.
  - `x` is an integer such that `1 ≤ x`.
  
Given these, we can calculate `b` as follows:
- Since `i` is 1, `z // i` is equal to `z`.
- Thus, `b = z * x`.

All other variables remain unaffected. The output state retains the conditions defined for `l`, `r`, `x`, `y`, `z`, `count`, and `a`, while updating `b` based on our new calculation.

Output State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `l`, `r` is an integer such that `l` ≤ `r`, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x`, `y` is an integer such that `x` ≤ `y`, `z` is equal to `y // x`, `count` is 0, `i` is now 1, `a` is equal to `x`, `b` is equal to `z * x`.**
