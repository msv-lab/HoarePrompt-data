You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Today on Informatics class Nastya learned about GCD and LCM (see links below). Nastya is very intelligent, so she solved all the tasks momentarily and now suggests you to solve one of them as well.

We define a pair of integers (a, b) good, if GCD(a, b) = x and LCM(a, b) = y, where GCD(a, b) denotes the greatest common divisor of a and b, and LCM(a, b) denotes the least common multiple of a and b.

You are given two integers x and y. You are to find the number of good pairs of integers (a, b) such that l ≤ a, b ≤ r. Note that pairs (a, b) and (b, a) are considered different if a ≠ b.


-----Input-----

The only line contains four integers l, r, x, y (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

In the only line print the only integer — the answer for the problem.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 2 1 2

Output
2

Input
1 12 1 12

Output
4

Input
50 100 3 30

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example there are two suitable good pairs of integers (a, b): (1, 2) and (2, 1).

In the second example there are four suitable good pairs of integers (a, b): (1, 12), (12, 1), (3, 4) and (4, 3).

In the third example there are good pairs of integers, for example, (3, 30), but none of them fits the condition l ≤ a, b ≤ r.
Program:
```
(l, r, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
count = 0
for a in range(l, r + 1):
    for b in range(a, r + 1):
        if func_1(a, b) == x and func_2(a, b) == y:
            count += 1
print(count)

def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the program based on the provided problem description, let’s analyze the code against the requirements.

The task is to find the number of good pairs (a, b) such that:
- GCD(a, b) = x
- LCM(a, b) = y
- l ≤ a, b ≤ r
- Pairs (a, b) and (b, a) are counted separately if a ≠ b 

### Analysis of the program:
1. **Input Handling**: The program takes four integers as input, which is correct based on the problem statement.
2. **Loop Structure**: The program iterates through `a` from `l` to `r` and `b` from `a` to `r`, thus ensuring all pairs (a, b) with `a ≤ b` are considered first, which is reasonable. It counts pairs where `a` and `b` are the same once.
3. **GCD and LCM Calculation**: The functions `func_1` and `func_2` properly calculate GCD and LCM, respectively.
4. **Logic for Counting**: The program counts valid pairs (a, b) that meet the GCD and LCM conditions but only counts pairs (a, b) where `a ≤ b`. This means that for distinct pairs (a != b), only one of them gets counted.

### Problematic Cases:
The problems arise when:
- **b can potentially be less than a**: The program does not check pairs (b, a) when `a != b`. Thus, if both a and b satisfy the condition, the second pair isn't counted unless it's the same (which is a limitation).
- **GCD and LCM relationship**: With the properties of GCD and LCM, a valid pair must satisfy the equation `x * y = a * b`. Thus, for any valid pair `(a, b)` derived from `x` and `y`, we should also confirm that `y` is a multiple of `x`. 

### Counterexample:
- Let's take `l = 1`, `r = 6`, `x = 2`, `y = 6`.
- The pairs `(2, 6)` and `(6, 2)` yield GCD of 2 and LCM of 6, both of which should be counted, resulting in 2 valid pairs.
- However, the counting logic will only register one of those pairs since it iterates `b` starting from `a`, which is a flaw in the logic leading to potential incorrect counts.

### Conclusion:
Based on this analysis, the provided program can miss valid counts for distinct pairs and does not adequately represent the relationship between x and y as set conditions for valid outputs.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
(l, r, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
count = 0
for a in range(l, r + 1):
    for b in range(a, r + 1):
        if func_1(a, b) == x and func_2(a, b) == y:
            count += 1
print(count)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers greater than 0.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`, `b` is 0. If `b` was initially greater than 0, the loop executed at least once, with `a` and `b` being updated to the earlier values as per the modulus operation. If `b` was initially 0, the loop wouldn't execute and `a` remains unchanged.
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`, which remains unchanged as `b` is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, both greater than 0, and computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. It correctly handles the case where `b` is initially greater than 0, ensuring that at least one iteration of the loop is executed. The function will always return the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b` after the loop terminates when `b` becomes 0.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that a > 0, b > 0, and GCD(a, b) divides both a and b.
def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)
    #The program returns the product of a and b divided by func_1(a, b), where GCD(a, b) divides both a and b.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns the product of `a` and `b` divided by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, as computed by `func_1(a, b)`. This effectively calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`. There are no checks for the validity of `a` and `b` within the function itself, but it assumes they are positive integers.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
