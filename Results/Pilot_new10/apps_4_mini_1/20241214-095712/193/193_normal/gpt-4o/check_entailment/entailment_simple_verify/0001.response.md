The original assessment argues that the program does not adequately ensure that the non-degenerate triangle properties hold throughout the edge case scenarios, particularly when `x` and `y` are close together, and thus the formula used could yield incorrect results in certain situations.

The annotated version confirms that the input constraints are properly established, indicating that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100000`. However, it remains silent on whether the progression of modifications adheres to the rules of triangle properties during the transformation from `x` to `y`.

Given that the algorithm's formula `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2` could lead to situations where the triangle becomes degenerate or non-valid due to improper reductions, this concern is effectively supported by the edge case analysis in the original assessment. 

Thus, while the annotated code indicates input is always valid, it doesn't counter the correctness concerns raised regarding the logic used in the program. The original assessment's conclusion that the program can yield incorrect outputs remains valid.

Final: **False**
