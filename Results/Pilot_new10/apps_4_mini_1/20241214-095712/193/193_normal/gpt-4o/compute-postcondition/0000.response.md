The values of `x` and `y` are updated based on the input provided but still adhere to the constraints defined initially (3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100000). Therefore, both `x` and `y` will have values determined by the user's input. 

Output State: **3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100000; `x` is an input integer; `y` is an input integer.**
