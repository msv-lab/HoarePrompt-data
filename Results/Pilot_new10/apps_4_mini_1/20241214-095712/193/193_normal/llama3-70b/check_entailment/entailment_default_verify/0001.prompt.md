You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Memory is now interested in the de-evolution of objects, specifically triangles. He starts with an equilateral triangle of side length x, and he wishes to perform operations to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length y.

In a single second, he can modify the length of a single side of the current triangle such that it remains a non-degenerate triangle (triangle of positive area). At any moment of time, the length of each side should be integer.

What is the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y?


-----Input-----

The first and only line contains two integers x and y (3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100 000) — the starting and ending equilateral triangle side lengths respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y if he starts with the equilateral triangle of side length x.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 3

Output
4

Input
8 5

Output
3

Input
22 4

Output
6



-----Note-----

In the first sample test, Memory starts with an equilateral triangle of side length 6 and wants one of side length 3. Denote a triangle with sides a, b, and c as (a, b, c). Then, Memory can do $(6,6,6) \rightarrow(6,6,3) \rightarrow(6,4,3) \rightarrow(3,4,3) \rightarrow(3,3,3)$.

In the second sample test, Memory can do $(8,8,8) \rightarrow(8,8,5) \rightarrow(8,5,5) \rightarrow(5,5,5)$.

In the third sample test, Memory can do: $(22,22,22) \rightarrow(7,22,22) \rightarrow(7,22,16) \rightarrow(7,10,16) \rightarrow(7,10,4) \rightarrow$

$(7,4,4) \rightarrow(4,4,4)$.
Program:
```
def func():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    print(abs(x - y))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program only calculates the absolute difference between `x` and `y`, which is incorrect according to the problem description. The task requires the program to determine the minimum number of seconds needed to modify the triangle from side length `x` to side length `y` while ensuring that the triangle remains non-degenerate (meaning, at all times, the lengths of the sides must be positive and form a valid triangle).

Here is a simple counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

Consider the input:
```
4 3
```

Following the problem's requirement, the sequence of triangles could be represented as:
1. Starting with (4, 4, 4).
2. Change one side to 3. Now we have (4, 4, 3).
3. Change the next side from 4 to 3. Now we have (4, 3, 3).
4. Finally, change the last side from 4 to 3. Now we have (3, 3, 3).

This requires a total of 3 seconds to achieve the desired result, while the program would output `1` (the absolute difference between 4 and 3), which is incorrect. 

The program does not account for multiple steps needed to maintain the conditions outlined in the problem, so it fails to give the correct answer in general.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts two integers `x` and `y` from user input, where `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, and prints the absolute difference between `x` and `y`. It does not return any value. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
