After analyzing the program, the problem description, the original assessment, and the provided annotated version, I have arrived at the following conclusions:

1. **Area Calculation Logic**: The program checks if the area calculated by `nm % k` is non-zero to determine if a valid integer area can be formed. If `nm % k` is not zero, it correctly outputs "NO". However, this check, while necessary, may not be sufficient on its own to determine whether three points can indeed form a triangle of the desired area.

2. **Points Generation Logic**: The subsequent logic tries to generate triangle points based on the values returned from `func_3`. However, the condition `if abs(n1 * m) >= g:` is vague and not guaranteed to ensure that the points (0, 0), (0, n1 * m // g), and (m1 * m // g, 0) lie within the bounds [0, n] and [0, m]. This lack of assurance can lead to finding points outside the problem constraints.

3. **Function Implementations**: The functions for calculating GCD and generating values based on BÃ©zout's identity appear to operate correctly, but their outputs may not directly address the needs of the problem.

4. **Determining Validity of Points**: The essential logic to validate whether the points lie within the defined bounds after calculations does not exist. This gap in the program can easily lead to producing invalid (out-of-bounds) point coordinates, thus failing to meet the problem requirements.

In summary, the original assessment stating the program's correctness is **False** is supported by the flaws in the triangle points generation logic. The assumption that the output points must always be valid cannot be justified solely based on the functions used. There is an evident logical gap between calculating potential points and ensuring they meet the problem's constraints.

Final: **False**
