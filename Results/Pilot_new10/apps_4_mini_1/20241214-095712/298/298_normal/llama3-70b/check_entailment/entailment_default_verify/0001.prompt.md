You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has got three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$. He'd like to find three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, such that $0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n$, $0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m$ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

Help Vasya! Find such points (if it's possible). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The single line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\le n, m \le 10^9$, $2 \le k \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

If there are no such points, print "NO".

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. The next three lines should contain integers $x_i, y_i$ — coordinates of the points, one point per line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 3

Output
YES
1 0
2 3
4 1

Input
4 4 7

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example area of the triangle should be equal to $\frac{nm}{k} = 4$. The triangle mentioned in the output is pictured below:  [Image] 

In the second example there is no triangle with area $\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{16}{7}$.
Program:
```
import math

(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
if n * m % k:
    print('NO')
    exit()
(n1, m1, g) = func_3(n, m)
if abs(n1 * m) >= g:
    print('YES')
    print(0, 0)
    print(0, n1 * m // g)
    print(m1 * m // g, 0)
else:
    print('NO')

def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

def func_2(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return (1, 0)
    else:
        (x, y) = func_2(b, a % b)
        return (y, x - a // b * y)

def func_3(a, b):
    (x, y) = func_2(a, b)
    return (x, y, x * a + y * b)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly meet the requirements of the problem description. 

Here is a potential case where the program fails:

Let's consider the input:
```
n = 1, m = 1, k = 2
```
Calculating the area requirement:
```
Area = nm/k = 1*1/2 = 0.5
```
A triangle cannot have an area of 0.5 using integer coordinates, and the points generated by the program would not satisfy this condition as they will always produce integer areas. 

In the condition `if n * m % k:`, the program fails to correctly determine when it is impossible to form a triangle with the necessary area. It only checks whether the product `n * m` is divisible by `k`, which is not a sufficient condition. 

Thus, since there exists an input where the program does not produce the expected output, the correctness of the program is determined to be false.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts two positive integers, `a` and `b`, and returns the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b`. If `b` is initially zero, the function will return `a` as the gcd immediately. The function utilizes the Euclidean algorithm to compute the gcd, ensuring that the result reflects the correct mathematical definition of gcd for the provided inputs. 

Output hint for function_2: The function accepts two integers `a` and `b` (with the constraint that `b` cannot be zero) and returns the tuple (1, 0) when `b` is zero, facilitating the base case for recursion. Otherwise, it computes the Extended Euclidean Algorithm by recursively calling itself with new values of `b` and `a % b`, ultimately returning a tuple consisting of the second value from this recursive call and the calculation `x - (a // b * y)`, which represents the coefficients for `a` and `b` that satisfy Bézout's identity. The provided function has the potential edge case of being called with `b` equal to zero; however, this case is not applicable due to the precondition stated in the comment. 

Output hint for function_3: The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b` (both greater than or equal to 1), and returns a tuple containing the outputs from `func_2(a, b)` and the result of the expression `x * a + y * b`, where `x` and `y` are the outputs of `func_2(a, b)`. It assumes that `func_2` is defined and returns two values. The functionality does not include any handling for possible exceptions that `func_2` might raise, which could occur if `func_2` does not behave as expected. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
