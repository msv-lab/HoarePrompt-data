Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 <= `n` <= 10^9), `m` is an integer (1 <= `m` <= 10^9), `k` is an integer (2 <= `k` <= 10^9), `area` is calculated as `n * m / k` (which is an integer) such that `area` is greater than 0; the output 'YES' has been printed, '0 0' has been printed, `2 * area` is greater than `n`, and the current value of `m` is greater than or equal to `2 * area`.***
