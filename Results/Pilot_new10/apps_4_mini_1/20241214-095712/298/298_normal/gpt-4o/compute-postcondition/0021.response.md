Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 <= `n` <= 10^9), `m` is an integer (1 <= `m` <= 10^9), `k` is an integer (2 <= `k` <= 10^9), and `area` is calculated as `n * m / k` which is greater than 0. If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`, the printed output is '1 0'. Otherwise, the printed output is `0 m // 2`.***
