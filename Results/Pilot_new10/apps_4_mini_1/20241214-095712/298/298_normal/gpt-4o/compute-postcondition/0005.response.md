The line `area = int(area)` converts the value of `area` to an integer type. However, since `area` is already specified to be calculated as `n * m / k` and is confirmed to be an integer, this operation does not change the value of `area`. The states of the other variables are not affected, so they retain their original conditions.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 <= `n` <= 10^9), `m` is an integer (1 <= `m` <= 10^9), `k` is an integer (2 <= `k` <= 10^9), and `area` remains calculated as `n * m / k` (which is an integer).**
