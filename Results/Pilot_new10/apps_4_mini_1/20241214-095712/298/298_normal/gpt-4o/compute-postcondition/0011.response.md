Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 <= `n` <= 10^9), `m` is an integer (1 <= `m` <= 10^9), `k` is an integer (2 <= `k` <= 10^9), `area` is calculated as `n * m / k` (which is an integer) and is greater than 0; the output 'YES' has been printed, '0 0' has been printed. The current value of `area` is such that `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`.***
