The code snippet provided prints out the string '0 1', which does not affect any of the state variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, and `area`). The printed output does not modify the values of these variables. Therefore, all the variable values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 <= `n` <= 10^9), `m` is an integer (1 <= `m` <= 10^9), `k` is an integer (2 <= `k` <= 10^9), `area` is an integer greater than 0, `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, printed output is '0 1'**.
