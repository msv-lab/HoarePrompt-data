The `print` statement outputs the string `'1 0'`, which does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, or `area`. The values of these variables remain unchanged, and the output simply displays '1 0' to the console. Therefore, the output state remains as previously defined.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 <= `n` <= 10^9), `m` is an integer (1 <= `m` <= 10^9), `k` is an integer (2 <= `k` <= 10^9), `area` is calculated as `n * m / k` which is greater than 0, printed output is '1 0'.**
