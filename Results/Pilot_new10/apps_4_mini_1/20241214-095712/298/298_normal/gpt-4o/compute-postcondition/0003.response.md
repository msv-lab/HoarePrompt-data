The `print('NO')` statement outputs the string `'NO'` to the console but does not affect any variable's value or state. Therefore, the states of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 <= `n` <= 10^9), `m` is an integer (1 <= `m` <= 10^9), `k` is an integer (2 <= `k` <= 10^9), and `area` is calculated as `n * m / k`, where the current value of `area` is not an integer, indicating that `area` has a fractional component. The output 'NO' is printed to the console.**
