Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are integers within specified ranges. If `area` is not an integer, indicating a fractional component, 'NO' is printed. If `area` is equal to 0, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, the output is '0 1'. If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`, the output is '1 0'. If `2 * area` is greater than both `n` and `m`, the output is '0 m // 2'.***
