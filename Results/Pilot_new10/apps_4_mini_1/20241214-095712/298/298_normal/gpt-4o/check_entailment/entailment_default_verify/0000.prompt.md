You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has got three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$. He'd like to find three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, such that $0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n$, $0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m$ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

Help Vasya! Find such points (if it's possible). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The single line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\le n, m \le 10^9$, $2 \le k \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

If there are no such points, print "NO".

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. The next three lines should contain integers $x_i, y_i$ â€” coordinates of the points, one point per line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 3

Output
YES
1 0
2 3
4 1

Input
4 4 7

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example area of the triangle should be equal to $\frac{nm}{k} = 4$. The triangle mentioned in the output is pictured below:  [Image] 

In the second example there is no triangle with area $\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{16}{7}$.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    area = n * m / k
    if area != int(area):
        print('NO')
    else:
        area = int(area)
        if area == 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            print('0 0')
            if 2 * area <= n:
                print(f'{2 * area} 1')
                print(f'0 1')
            elif 2 * area <= m:
                print(f'1 {2 * area}')
                print(f'1 0')
            else:
                print(f'{n} {m // 2}')
                print(f'0 {m // 2}')


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program in relation to the problem description, let's analyze its logic step by step.

### Summary of Task:
The program should find three integer points such that the area of the triangle formed by these points equals \(\frac{nm}{k}\), subject to certain constraints. 

### Breakdown of the Program:
1. It reads the inputs \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\).
2. It calculates the area needed as \(n \times m / k\) and checks if this area is an integer. If it's not an integer, it prints "NO".
3. If the calculated area is zero, it also prints "NO".
4. It attempts to find integer coordinates that yield the desired area. The three conditions present in the logic involve checking if \(2 \times \text{area}\) is less than or equal to \(n\) or \(m\), leading into respective points being printed.

### Key Edge Cases:
- **When \( n \) or \( m \) is too small relative to \( k \)**: If \(k\) is such that \( \frac{nm}{k} \) is not achievable or leads to insufficient dimensions for any triangle. For instance:
  - If \(n = 1\), \(m = 1\), and \(k = 2\), the area calculated would be \( \frac{1 \times 1}{2} = 0.5 \), which is not an integer and should return "NO". This case is caught correctly.
  
- **Valid integer area check**: If \(k = 2\) with larger \(n\) and \(m\), it should be noted: For larger valid inputs, the checks for positions rely on the expected conditions but may fail if there's a mistake dealing with integer ranges. 

### Failure Case:
The point that can potentially lead to complications is in coordinate calculation:
- The conditions checking \(2 \times \text{area}\) against \(n\) or \(m\) could fail to check all edge cases adequately. For example, if you set \( (n,m,k) = (10,10,3) \):
  - The area becomes \( \frac{10 \times 10}{3} = \frac{100}{3} \), which is not an integer. However, the code structure may not explicitly manage all integer results effectively.
  
- Additionally, there are multiple edge cases existing in how the coordinates \( (x_2, y_2) \) and \( (x_3, y_3) \) are calculated. If the triangle sides assume certain positions that yield negative or out of bound coordinates, that should also yield a "NO".

### Conclusion:
The program risks incorrectly handling cases where the criteria do not yield proper integer coordinates for the points. There might be configurations of inputs that lead to invalid configurations not considered in the logic.

Thus, after identifying potential failing edge cases and assessing logical gaps:

Correctness: **False**. 

The provided program does not cover all scenarios as per the problem statement's requirements.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` provided through input. It computes the area based on the formula `area = n * m / k`. If the area is not an integer or if it is zero, the function prints 'NO'. If the area is a positive integer, it prints 'YES' and two coordinates based on the value of `2 * area`: if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, it outputs '0 1'; if it's less than or equal to `m`, it outputs '1 0'; otherwise, it outputs '0 m // 2' along with the maximum values of `n` and `m` that fit the criteria. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
