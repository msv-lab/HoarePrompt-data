Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly handle the requirement that the area of the triangle formed by the points must be equal to \( \frac{nm}{k} \). The crux of the issue lies in how the program determines the points and whether they indeed form a triangle of the required area.

1. When calculating the area, the code checks if `area != int(area)`, which is a necessary check but can lead to incorrect conclusions about the reachability of certain areas based on integer vs non-integer divisions.
2. The triangles generated using the conditions provided (`if 2 * area <= n` and `elif 2 * area <= m`) rely on a specific alignment of points and may not necessarily yield the correct area for cases where `2 * area` exceeds both dimensions effectively.
3. The code defaults to printing coordinates based on arbitrary divisions of `n` and `m`, but it does not guarantee that the formed triangle based on these points will always yield the area \( \frac{nm}{k} \). 

For instance, if \( n = 4 \), \( m = 3 \), and \( k = 7 \), the area to form is \( \frac{12}{7} \), which the code would misinterpret based on integer checks and outputs without ensuring the points properly yield the triangle area.

Therefore, the program is incomplete and incorrect for several potential inputs due to its reliance on certain conditions without verifying that they fulfill the triangle area requirement.
