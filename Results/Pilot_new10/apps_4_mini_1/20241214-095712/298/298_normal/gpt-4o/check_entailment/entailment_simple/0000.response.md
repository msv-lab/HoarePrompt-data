To determine the correctness of the provided Python program in relation to the problem description, we need to analyze the requirements laid out in the problem and the logic within the program.

### Problem Requirements
1. Given three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, the program must check if it is possible to find three integer points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) such that:
   - \(0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n\)
   - \(0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m\)
   - The area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to \(\frac{nm}{k}\).

2. If such points exist, it must print "YES" followed by the coordinates of the points. If no such points can be found, it should print "NO".

### Program Analysis
- The program calculates the area as `area = n * m / k` and checks if this area is an integer. If not, it outputs "NO".
- If `area` is 0, based on the problem statement, while technically this case will occur because \(k \ge 2\), it is logically consistent for cases where the triangle cannot be formed, so it outputs "NO".
- After confirming `area` is non-zero and an integer, it attempts to generate three points based on the calculated area:
  - If `2 * area <= n`, it creates points such that the first point is at `(0, 0)`, the second at `(2 * area, 1)`, and the third at `(0, 1)`.
  - If `2 * area <= m`, points are created at `(1, 2 * area)`, `(1, 0)`, etc.
  - If the above conditions are not met, it defaults to using points near the edges of the bounding box defined by `n` and `m`.

### Observations
1. The program only returns "YES" or "NO" after thoroughly checking if a suitable area can be achieved.
2. The strategies for creating the triangle fulfill the geometric requirements by providing points in permissible ranges.
3. The points generated will comply with the triangle area formula, considering the order and values of the vertices.

### Conclusion
The program effectively implements the requirements of the problem statement and covers the cases where a solution is impossible by outputting "NO". In other instances, it constructs a valid triangle based on the prescribed area, outputting the correct coordinates.

Given that the program adheres strictly to the conditions of the problem description and accurately generates valid outputs based on the inputs, we can conclude:

Correctness: **True**
