Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly meet the requirements of the problem description. 

Here is a potential case where the program fails:

Let's consider the input:
```
n = 1, m = 1, k = 2
```
Calculating the area requirement:
```
Area = nm/k = 1*1/2 = 0.5
```
A triangle cannot have an area of 0.5 using integer coordinates, and the points generated by the program would not satisfy this condition as they will always produce integer areas. 

In the condition `if n * m % k:`, the program fails to correctly determine when it is impossible to form a triangle with the necessary area. It only checks whether the product `n * m` is divisible by `k`, which is not a sufficient condition. 

Thus, since there exists an input where the program does not produce the expected output, the correctness of the program is determined to be false.
