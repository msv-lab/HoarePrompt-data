The `print` statement outputs the value calculated by the expression `2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2`. The bit length of `n` gives the number of bits required to represent `n` in binary, and subtracting 1 gives the index of the highest bit that is set. Multiplying by 2 and adding 2 gives the final result.

Since `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\), its bit length will be between 1 and 30 because \(2^{30} = 1073741824\) is the smallest power of 2 greater than \(10^9\). 

The overall state of `n` remains unchanged, and the printed result is determined by its specific value. However, as the task does not specify the exact value of `n`, let's express the output in general terms.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9; the printed output is `2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2`.**
