The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an integer input. Since `n` was originally a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\), after this operation `n` now holds the new input value. The output state retains information that `n` is now equal to this input integer within the allowed bounds.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9**
