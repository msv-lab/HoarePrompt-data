The function `func` does not take any parameters. The only constraint mentioned is that `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9. However, since there are no parameters defined in the function signature, it is likely that `n` is utilized in a different way, possibly as a global variable or input from another source outside this function.

Given that there is no specific output or behavior described, it is unclear what the function returns or performs. Since we need to focus on the provided information and the structure given for describing functionality, we can summarize as follows:

Functionality: **The function does not take any parameters; its behavior and return values cannot be determined based on the provided information.**
