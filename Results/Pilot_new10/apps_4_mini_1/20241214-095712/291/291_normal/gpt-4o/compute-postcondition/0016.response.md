Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (where 1 <= n <= 10^9) and calculates the minimum number of segments needed based on possible values of `a` from 1 to the integer square root of `n`. For each value of `a`, it computes the corresponding value of `b`, determining the number of segments required, and returns the minimum segments needed across all iterations. **
