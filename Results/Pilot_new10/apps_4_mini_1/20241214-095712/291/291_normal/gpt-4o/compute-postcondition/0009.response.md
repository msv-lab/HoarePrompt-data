According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`, as well as the computation of `int(math.sqrt(n))`. For the loop to execute again, `a` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(n))`.

At the end of the last iteration, the states are as follows:
- `n` must be at least 4,
- `a` is 2.

Thus, for the loop to be executed one more time, we need to determine what the value of `int(math.sqrt(n))` will be. 

If `n` is 4, then `int(math.sqrt(n))` is 2, and since `a` is currently 2, it will increment to 3 in the next iteration, making it exceed `int(math.sqrt(n))`. If `n` is 5, `int(math.sqrt(n))` is also 2, and `a` will increment to 3 in the next iteration, also exceeding `int(math.sqrt(n))`.

Therefore, in the next loop iteration, we need `a` to be 3. However, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 9 (which gives `int(math.sqrt(9)) = 3`).

So, summarizing:
- `n` must be at least 9 for `int(math.sqrt(n))` to be at least 3.
- `a` will be 3.

State: **`n` must be at least 9; `min_segments_needed` is either 8 for `n` = 4 or 10 for `n` = 5; `a` is 3; `b` is either 2 for `n` = 4 or 3 for `n` = 5; `segments_needed` is 8 for `n` = 4 or 10 for `n` = 5.**
