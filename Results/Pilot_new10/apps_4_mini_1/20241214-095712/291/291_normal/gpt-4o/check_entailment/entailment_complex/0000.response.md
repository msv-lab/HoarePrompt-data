Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements a solution to the problem of determining the minimum number of segments that Sofia must draw with a ruler to create `n` squares. Here's a step-by-step breakdown explaining why the program is correct according to the problem description:

1. **Understanding the Square Requirement**: Each square requires 4 segments. However, if squares can share segments with previously drawn squares, the goal is to minimize the total number of initial segments drawn with a ruler.

2. **Variables and Logic**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` uses `a` and calculates `b` such that both `a` (the horizontal count) and `b` (the vertical count) multiplied together are at least `n`. 
   - The relation `b = (n + a - 1) // a` is an efficient way of computing the minimum number of vertical segments needed for a given number of horizontal segments (`a`), without actually exceeding `n`.

3. **Segment Calculation**:
   - For each combination of `a` (from 1 to the square root of `n`, limiting unnecessary iterations) and the corresponding `b`, the segments needed are calculated with the formula `segments_needed = 2 * (a + b)`. This accounts for the horizontal and vertical segments required.
   
4. **Finding the Minimum**:
   - The program iteratively checks each value of `a`, finds the corresponding `b`, and keeps track of the minimum segments needed across all possible values. The final result is the least number of segments that will need to be drawn with a ruler.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The implementation iterates only up to the square root of `n`, which maintains efficiency even for larger values of `n` (up to \(10^9\)).

6. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints the minimum segments needed, which aligns perfectly with the expected output from the problem description.

In conclusion, the program efficiently calculates the minimum segments Sofia needs to draw and adheres to the constraints and requirements stated in the problem description. Thus, it accomplishes the intended task correctly.
