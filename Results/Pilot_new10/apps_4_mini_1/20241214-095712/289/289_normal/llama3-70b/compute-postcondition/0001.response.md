`n.bit_length()` returns the number of bits required to represent the integer `n` in binary, excluding the sign and leading zeros. Since `n` is an integer in the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `n.bit_length()` will yield a value between 2 and 60. The result of `n.bit_length() - 1` gives the number of bits required to represent `n` minus one.

The states of the other variables are not affected after executing the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the input integer in the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, and the output result is `n.bit_length() - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer in the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; output result is `n.bit_length() - 1`.**
