Functionality: ** The function prompts the user to input an integer `n`, representing the number of players in a tournament with a valid range of 2 to 10^18. It then calculates and prints the bit length of `n` minus one, which effectively returns one less than the number of bits required to represent `n` in binary. The function does not handle invalid inputs or cases where `n` falls outside the specified range.**
