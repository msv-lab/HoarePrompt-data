To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the provided code and see how it aligns with the requirement to find the maximum number of games the winner can play.

The core logic given in the program is:

```python
print(n.bit_length() - 1)
```

### Understanding the Problem:
1. In a knockout tournament with `n` players, the goal is to find the maximum number of games the eventual winner can participate in.
2. The matches are structured such that players can only face each other if their number of games played differs by at most one.

### Analyzing the Code:
The method `.bit_length()` returns the number of bits required to represent `n` in binary. For instance:
- `n = 2` (binary `10`) → `bit_length() = 2` → `2 - 1 = 1`
- `n = 3` (binary `11`) → `bit_length() = 2` → `2 - 1 = 1`
- `n = 4` (binary `100`) → `bit_length() = 3` → `3 - 1 = 2`
- `n = 10` (binary `1010`) → `bit_length() = 4` → `4 - 1 = 3`

From this logic, we can deduct that:
- For `n = 2`: Winner plays 1 game (Correct)
- For `n = 3`: Winner plays 2 games (Incorrect; the expected answer based on the examples) 
- For `n = 4`: Winner plays 2 games (Correct)
- For `n = 10`: Winner can only play 4 games (Correct)

### Finding a Counterexample:
The code should output the number of games based on the rules of match pairing involving `n` players. Upon checking the output for `n=3`, we found the expected output should be 2, but the program incorrectly gives us `1`.

**Counterexample found:**
For `n = 3`, the expected result is `2`, but the program outputs `1`.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the program behavior against the problem description, we conclude that the program does not handle all input cases correctly.

Correctness: **False**
