You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Mishka is decorating the Christmas tree. He has got three garlands, and all of them will be put on the tree. After that Mishka will switch these garlands on.

When a garland is switched on, it periodically changes its state — sometimes it is lit, sometimes not. Formally, if i-th garland is switched on during x-th second, then it is lit only during seconds x, x + k_{i}, x + 2k_{i}, x + 3k_{i} and so on.

Mishka wants to switch on the garlands in such a way that during each second after switching the garlands on there would be at least one lit garland. Formally, Mishka wants to choose three integers x_1, x_2 and x_3 (not necessarily distinct) so that he will switch on the first garland during x_1-th second, the second one — during x_2-th second, and the third one — during x_3-th second, respectively, and during each second starting from max(x_1, x_2, x_3) at least one garland will be lit.

Help Mishka by telling him if it is possible to do this!


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers k_1, k_2 and k_3 (1 ≤ k_{i} ≤ 1500) — time intervals of the garlands.


-----Output-----

If Mishka can choose moments of time to switch on the garlands in such a way that each second after switching the garlands on at least one garland will be lit, print YES.

Otherwise, print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 2 3

Output
YES

Input
4 2 3

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example Mishka can choose x_1 = 1, x_2 = 2, x_3 = 1. The first garland will be lit during seconds 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., the second — 2, 4, 6, 8, ..., which already cover all the seconds after the 2-nd one. It doesn't even matter what x_3 is chosen. Our choice will lead third to be lit during seconds 1, 4, 7, 10, ..., though.

In the second example there is no way to choose such moments of time, there always be some seconds when no garland is lit.
Program:
```
import math

def func():
    (k1, k2, k3) = map(int, input().split())
    gcd_k1_k2 = math.gcd(k1, k2)
    gcd_all = math.gcd(gcd_k1_k2, k3)
    if gcd_all == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: To analyze the correctness of the provided program, let's break down the problem description and understand its requirements.

Mishka aims to ensure that at least one of the three garlands is lit at each second after switching them on. This boils down to choosing three integers \( x_1, x_2, \) and \( x_3 \) for the three garlands such that the combined lit times of the garlands overlap in a way that there are no gaps where all garlands are off.

The program computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the time intervals \( k_1, k_2, \) and \( k_3 \). It prints "YES" if the GCD is 1 and "NO" otherwise.

### Analysis of the Program:
- If the GCD of the time intervals is 1, it means that there is a way to choose \( x_1, x_2, \) and \( x_3 \) such that the lit times of the garlands can cover all seconds without any gaps.
- If the GCD is greater than 1, then there exist intervals in which the garlands cannot overlap perfectly, leading to some seconds where none are lit.

### Testing Edge Cases:
1. **Example Input**: \( 1, 1, 1 \)
   - GCD is 1 -> Output should be "YES". The program correctly identifies that at least one garland is lit.
   
2. **Example Input**: \( 2, 4, 6 \)
   - GCD is 2 -> Output should be "NO". The program results in "NO", which is correct as every second will have gaps.

3. **Example Input**: \( 3, 5, 7 \)
   - GCD is 1 -> Output should be "YES". The program would print "YES", indicating proper coverage.

4. **Example Input**: \( 6, 8, 10 \)
   - GCD is 2 -> Output should be "NO". The program's output here matches the expectation.

### Conclusion:
Every example provided in the problem description and the additional scenarios validated demonstrate that this approach is correct. Since there are values that can create overlap based on parameter choice, and it correctly identifies when coverage is not possible, there are no flaws detected.

Therefore, based on the above reasoning and verification with test cases:
Correctness: **True**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts three integers `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` through user input. It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of these integers and checks if they are pairwise coprime. If the GCD of all three integers is 1, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. There are no parameters passed to the function, and the only output is the result of the GCD check. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
