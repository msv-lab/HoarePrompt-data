Correctness: **False**

The provided program checks whether the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three garland time intervals `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` is 1. If it is, the program outputs 'YES', suggesting that it is possible to ensure at least one garland is lit at each second. However, this logic is flawed and does not align with the problem description.

The key points from the problem description state that Mishka can choose the moments to turn on the garlands in such a way that there is at least one garland lit at every second after the maximum of the three chosen switch-on times. The actual requirement depends on ensuring that the intervals can overlap correctly rather than simply assessing coprimeness via the GCD.

For example:
- With the intervals (4, 2, 3), the GCD is 1, suggesting the intervals are coprime. However, even though they are coprime, a choice of moments such as `x1 = 1`, `x2 = 1`, and `x3 = 1` will lead to periods without any garland lit after some seconds (specifically, at second 5, there's no lit garland).

The program fails to account for configurations like the one above where despite having a GCD of 1, a sequence of seconds could inevitably go unlit due to how intervals interplay. Such cases are counterexamples to the program's logic and demonstrate that it can falsely assert that it's always possible to have at least one garland lit at every second.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the requirements described in the problem statement.
