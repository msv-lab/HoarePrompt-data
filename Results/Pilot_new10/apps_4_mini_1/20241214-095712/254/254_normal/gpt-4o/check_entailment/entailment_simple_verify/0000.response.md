Based on the problem description, the program's purpose is to determine if at least one garland is always lit after being switched on, given their time intervals. The original assessment correctly identified that the program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the garlands' intervals and uses that to decide if itâ€™s possible to switch them on without gaps.

The annotated version reinforces the original assessment by clearly stating the conditions under which the outputs 'YES' or 'NO' are determined based on the GCD. It systematically concludes that if the GCD of the intervals \( k1, k2, k3 \) is 1, the garlands can overlap sufficiently to ensure that at least one is lit at every second. Conversely, a GCD greater than 1 signifies that there will be intervals with no garlands lit, thus justifying the output 'NO'.

Every piece of information aligns with the logic applied in the original assessment, and it is consistent with the annotated states provided in the code. The function's implementation coherently matches the problem's requirements.

Thus, since the program satisfies the problem's conditions and the original assessment accurately reflects this, I maintain the correctness judgment.

Final: **True**
