According to the code, the `while` loop can execute as long as `b` is non-zero (true). Right before the loop, `b` is an integer representing a time interval, but its specific value is not provided. For the loop to execute at least once, `b` must be greater than 0. Since `a` and `c` are not factors in the condition of the loop, they do not need to be adjusted. 

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we can just state that `b` needs to be greater than 0. 

State: **a is an integer, b must be greater than 0, c is an integer**
