The function accepts two integers `a` and `b`, and it returns the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the two numbers. If `b` is 0 at the start, the function returns `a` directly without entering the loop, otherwise it computes the gcd using the Euclidean algorithm. This means that it correctly identifies cases where `b` is 0 and returns `a` as the gcd without any changes.
