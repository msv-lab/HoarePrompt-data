To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we first need to analyze both.

**Problem Description Recap:**
Mishka wants to activate three garlands with time intervals \(k_1\), \(k_2\), and \(k_3\) such that there is at least one garland lit during every second after the maximum of the times \(x_1\), \(x_2\), and \(x_3\) when the garlands are turned on. 

This translates to ensuring that the time intervals can cover every sequential second once they are started. The condition essentially boils down to checking if the least common multiple (LCM) of the three intervals is correctly calculated and that it is divisible by each interval, indicating that they collectively cover every second after a certain point.

**Annotated Program Analysis:**
1. **Input Handling:** The program reads three integers which represent the interval times of the garlands.
2. **LCM Calculation:** 
   - It attempts to calculate the LCM of \(k_1\), \(k_2\), and \(k_3\) using their greatest common divisors (GCD). This is done using a helper function `func_1` which implements the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the GCD.
   - The formula uses the relationship: \( \text{lcm}(x, y) = \frac{x \cdot y}{\text{gcd}(x, y)} \).
   - However, the way LCM is calculated here appears incorrect. It should iterate pairwise through all three variables to compute the LCM correctly, while this implementation makes assumptions that can lead to inaccuracies.

3. **Result Condition:** After calculating `lcm`, the program checks if it is divisible by \(k_1\), \(k_2\), and \(k_3\). If it is, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

**Assessing the Correctness:**
- The use of LCM is correct in trying to determine if all garlands can light up continuously. However, the calculation of `lcm` in the program is flawed as it does not handle the LCM of three numbers accurately.
- The key point to note is that even if the input intervals allow for covering all seconds when activated, the incorrect calculation of LCM may lead to misleading results. For example, for inputs like \(4, 2, 3\), the program can incorrectly conclude that they cannot light all seconds even though they can be arranged properly.

**Final Conclusion:**
Due to the flawed LCM calculation and the fact that this can lead to incorrect outputs, the program does not implement the requirements set forth in the problem description correctly and comprehensively for all input cases.

Thus, we conclude that the correctness of the program is not guaranteed.

Correctness: **False**
