The original assessment states that the program's correctness is **False** because it fails to guarantee that at least one garland will be lit during each second after the maximum switched-on time. The assessment offers a rationale by illustrating a specific counter-example with the input (4, 2, 3), where the calculations result in a misleading output of "YES" despite the existence of unlit seconds after the maximum.

The annotated version of the code explains the process involved in calculating the least common multiple (LCM) and the condition checks, specifically emphasizing the mathematical validation via the greatest common divisor (GCD) through the `func_1` function. However, the annotations fail to address that the fundamental logic based on LCM divisibility is insufficient to ensure continuous lighting according to the problem description.

Even though the function calculates the GCD correctly and the LCM computation is implemented accurately, the approach taken does not satisfy the requirement that at least one garland needs to be lit during every second post-switching.

The programâ€™s condition checks focusing solely on LCM divisibility by each garland's interval do not effectively verify that every second after the maximum switching time will have at least one garland lit. Thus, it misleads the logic presented in the problem scenario.

Given the breakdown of the reasoning aligning with both the original assessment and the annotations:

- The first garland lights every 4 seconds,
- The second every 2 seconds,
- The third every 3 seconds,
ensuring a grand total of seconds where none of these intervals guarantees illumination for every possible second creates a contradiction to meeting the stated requirement of the task.

Hence, due to the sustained issue in the program's logical flow in fulfilling the problem description, we can confidently uphold the original assessment.

Final: **False**
