The original assessment stated that the program's logic was flawed, specifically in its use of the least common multiple (LCM) to determine if it's possible for at least one garland to be lit at any given second after the switching moments. This assessment pointed out that merely checking the divisibility of the LCM by the intervals does not ensure that all seconds are covered by at least one lit garland. 

Upon evaluating the annotated version of the code and its logical flow, it seems that the program calculates the LCM correctly and verifies the conditions based on it. However, the core issue remains: even if the LCM is divisible by k1, k2, and k3, this does not guarantee that at every second there will be a lit garland after the chosen moments. The counter-example provided in the original assessment illustrates this flaw effectively.

Thus, the original assessment is accurate. The condition checked (LCM divisibility) is not sufficient for the problem's requirement, which demands that at least one garland must be lit at every second after the selected switching times.

Final: **False**
