To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze both the problem description and the implementation logic.

**Problem Description:**
The task is to switch on three garlands such that after switching them on, at least one garland is lit during every second. The garlands are lit based on their time intervals (`k1`, `k2`, and `k3`), meaning they light up at multiples of their respective intervals.

**Implementation Analysis:**
1. The program reads three integers representing the intervals of the garlands.
2. It computes the least common multiple (LCM) of the three intervals using the product of intervals divided by the greatest common divisor (GCD) for pairs.
3. The program then checks if the LCM is divisible by each interval (`k1`, `k2`, and `k3`). If it is, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

**Potential Issue:**
The current logic relies on the condition that the LCM of the three intervals must be divisible by each interval, implying there are no seconds in between that can be dark. However, **this does not guarantee light coverage from the maximum `x1`, `x2`, or `x3`**, because the LCM could simply be aligning the on/off patterns without actually covering every second continuously.

For example, consider the case:
- Input: `3 4 5`
- Calculate LCM: The LCM of 3, 4, and 5 is 60. 
- However, if you switch on:
  - `x1 = 1` for `k1`, lights at: 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, ...
  - `x2 = 1` for `k2`, lights at: 1, 5, 9, 13, ...
  - `x3 = 1` for `k3`, lights at: 1, 6, 11, 16, ...
  
From second 3 to second 5, there's no light, exposing a gap.

Since the logic about checking LCM doesn't enforce that every second is covered after the max start time is flawed in this case, it reveals a logical error.

**Conclusion:**
The program does not guarantee that there is at least one lit garland at every second after the maximum start time of the garlands as per the problem description, and thus it fails for certain inputs.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program correctly finds the LCM, but its conditional checks do not adequately ensure that after the maximum start time, every subsequent second will have at least one garland lit, leading to gaps in coverage.
