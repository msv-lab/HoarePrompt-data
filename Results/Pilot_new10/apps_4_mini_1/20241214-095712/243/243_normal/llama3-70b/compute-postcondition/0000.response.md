`m` is reassigned to the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts a new integer input. Given the initial state that `m` is an integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, the output state will reflect this change but will not contain the exact new value of `m` since it is derived from user input. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`m` is an integer derived from an input value, such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000.**
