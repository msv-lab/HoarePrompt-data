Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it can execute an infinite number of times and does not depend on any conditions to continue. Therefore, the program state at the end of the previous iteration can be repeated without any modifications.

State: **`m` is an integer derived from an input value such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `count` is 2; `n` is 1**
