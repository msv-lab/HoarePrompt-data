The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is an integer derived from an input value such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `count` is 2; `n` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
