The value of `n` is 1. The expression `n // 5` evaluates to 0 since 1 divided by 5 is 0. The append operation is performed on `ans`, which results in adding the value of `n` to the list. Since the initial list `ans` is empty, after this operation, it will contain the single element [1]. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 1, `count` is greater than 5, `ans` is [1]**
