The code `ans.append(n)` appends the value of `n`, which is currently 2, to the list `ans`. The initial state indicates that `ans` is originally `[1]`. Therefore, after the execution of the code, the value of `ans` will now be updated to `[1, 2]`. 

The other variables, `count` and the value of `n`, remain unaffected by this operation. The state of `n` remains the same, and since `count` was already defined to be greater than 5, it remains as is.

Output State: **`n` is 2, `count` is greater than 5, `ans` is [1, 2]**
