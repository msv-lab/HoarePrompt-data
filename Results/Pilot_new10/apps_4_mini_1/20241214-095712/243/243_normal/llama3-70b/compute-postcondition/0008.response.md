According to the code, this is a `while True` loop, which means it will continue to execute indefinitely without any condition that would stop it. Therefore, there are no necessary adjustments to the states for the loop to execute one more time; it can proceed as it is.

State: **`m` is an integer derived from an input value, such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `count` is 1; `n` is 1.**
