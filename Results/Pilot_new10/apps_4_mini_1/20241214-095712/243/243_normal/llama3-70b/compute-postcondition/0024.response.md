The initial state has `n` assigned the value 1 and `count` is greater than 5. The list `ans` contains the value [1]. The execution of the code `n += 1` increments the value of `n` by 1. 

The previous value of `n` is 1, so after the execution of the code, `n` will be 2. The other variables, `count` and `ans`, are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is 2, `count` is greater than 5, `ans` is [1].

Output State: **`n` is 2, `count` is greater than 5, `ans` is [1]**
