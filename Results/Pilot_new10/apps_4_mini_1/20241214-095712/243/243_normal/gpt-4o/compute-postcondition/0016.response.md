To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we look at the condition of the `while` loop:

```
while func_1(left) == m:
```

The loop will continue executing as long as `func_1(left)` is equal to `m`. From the given program state:

- `m` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 100,000.
- `left` has been decremented by 1, which suggests it started at a larger value and has now decreased.
  
The function `func_1(left)` should return a value equal to `m` for the loop to execute again. Since `left` has just been decremented, we need to ensure `func_1(left)` still evaluates to `m`.

Since we don't know the functional behavior of `func_1`, we can assert that:

- For the loop to execute once more, `func_1(left)` must continue to return `m`, which implies that `left` should not have crossed whatever threshold leads `func_1(left)` to yield a result different from `m`.

Given that `left` has already been decreased by 1, we can state the adjustments needed without knowing the exact behavior of `func_1`. The critical point is that the relationship between `left` and the output of `func_1` must hold. 

Thus, we should state the need for `func_1(left)` to equal `m`, and since `left` is now one less, we must emphasize this state requirement.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` is 0; `high` is 5 * (`m` + 1); `result` is an empty list; `mid` is (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2; `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`; and `func_1(left)` must equal `m`**
