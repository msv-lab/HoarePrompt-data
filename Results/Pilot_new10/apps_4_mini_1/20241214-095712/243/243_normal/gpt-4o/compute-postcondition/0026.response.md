To determine whether the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition specified in the `while` loop, which is `func_1(right) == m`. 

At the end of the previous iteration:

- `right` has been incremented by 1. 
- `func_1(right)` is still equal to `m`, indicating that the loop was able to execute with this value of `right`.
- However, `left` has been decreased to a value such that `func_1(left)` is no longer equal to `m`. This means that this change in `left` does not affect the condition of the loop directly but shows that the function behaves differently for values less than `left`.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need `func_1(right + 1)` to also equal `m`. Since we know that `func_1(right)` equals `m`, we cannot make assumptions about what happens at `right + 1`. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute again, we need to guarantee that `func_1(right + 1)` equals `m`.

We need to modify the state as follows:

1. `right` needs to increment to `right + 1`, but we cannot confirm the state of `func_1(right + 1)` from the information provided.
2. We can state that since `func_1(right)` equals `m`, the state must still hold for `right + 1` as well.

Hence, we need to express that `func_1(right + 1)` must equal `m` to ensure further execution of the loop. 

State: **`left` is decreased to a value such that `func_1(left)` is no longer equal to `m`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000, `low` is 0, `high` is 5 * (`m` + 1), `result` is an empty list, `mid` is (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2, `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`, `func_1(right + 1)` must equal `m`.**
