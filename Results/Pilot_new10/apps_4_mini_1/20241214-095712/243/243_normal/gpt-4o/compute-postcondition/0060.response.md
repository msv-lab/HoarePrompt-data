The variable `mid` is assigned the value of the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high` divided by 2. Since `low` is less than or equal to `high`, the value of `mid` will be an integer that is the midpoint between `low` and `high`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is less than or equal to `high`, and `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`.

Output State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`**.
