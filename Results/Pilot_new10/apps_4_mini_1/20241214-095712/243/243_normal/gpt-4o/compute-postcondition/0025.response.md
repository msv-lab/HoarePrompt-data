The value of `right` is incremented by 1. The conditions regarding `func_1(right)` being equal to `m` remain valid. The other variables retain their previous states as they were not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`left` is decreased to a value such that `func_1(left)` is no longer equal to `m`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000, `low` is 0, `high` is 5 * (`m` + 1), `result` is an empty list, `mid` is (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2, `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`, `right` is incremented by 1, and `func_1(right)` is still equal to `m`.**
