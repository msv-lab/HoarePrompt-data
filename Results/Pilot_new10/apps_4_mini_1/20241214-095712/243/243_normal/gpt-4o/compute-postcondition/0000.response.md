The provided code snippet is descriptive and outlines a process to find all integers `n` such that `n!` (n factorial) has exactly `m` trailing zeros. However, this code does not update any variables or produce a value as its output—it's more of a textual description of an algorithm or process.

Given the initial state where `m` is a positive integer in the range [1, 100,000], the primary variable of interest, `m`, remains unchanged as the snippet merely states a task without employing any operations that modify variables.

Therefore, the output state retains the initial information regarding `m` but does not change or introduce any new state for other variables.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000**
