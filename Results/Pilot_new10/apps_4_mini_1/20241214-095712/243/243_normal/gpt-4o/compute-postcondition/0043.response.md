The value of `left` is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged and no other conditions affect the `low`, `high`, `mid`, `zeroes`, `result`, or the condition that `func_1(left) == m` and `left >= 1`. 

Output State: **`low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list; `left` is decreased by 1 such that `func_1(left) == m` and `left >= 1`.**
