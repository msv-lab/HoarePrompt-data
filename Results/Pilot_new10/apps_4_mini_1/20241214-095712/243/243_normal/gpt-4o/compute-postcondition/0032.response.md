Postcondition: ***`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000. If the current value of `zeroes` is less than `m`, `low` is updated to (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2 + 1, while `high` remains 5 * (`m` + 1), and `result` is an empty list. If `zeroes` is greater than `m`, `high` is updated to (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2 - 1 while `zeroes` remains greater than or equal to `m`. If `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`, `left` is adjusted until `func_1(left)` is no longer equal to `m`, and `right` is incremented until `func_1(right)` is no longer equal to `m`, while `result` contains a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1.***
