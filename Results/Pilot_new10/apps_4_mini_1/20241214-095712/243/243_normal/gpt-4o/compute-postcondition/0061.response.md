The variable `zeroes` is assigned the value returned by the function `func_1(mid)`, where `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`. The value of `mid` can be explicitly calculated given the values of `low` and `high`. Since `zeroes` is defined as the return value of `func_1(mid)`, its particular value will depend on the implementation of `func_1` and the specific input value of `mid`. However, this does not affect the relationship between `low` and `high`.

Output State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`**.
