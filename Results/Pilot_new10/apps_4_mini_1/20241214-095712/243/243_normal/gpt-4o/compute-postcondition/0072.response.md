Output State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`; `mid` remains equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list; `left` is equal to `(low + high) // 2 - k` where `k` is the number of times the loop executed, and `func_1(left)` is equal to m. The loop must have executed at least `k` times, during which `left` was decremented from `(low + high) // 2` to `(low + high) // 2 - k`.**
