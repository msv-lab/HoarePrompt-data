The variable `low` is assigned the value of `mid + 1`. The value of `mid` is currently `(low + high) // 2`, which is an integer average of `low` and `high`. The condition `low must be less than or equal to high` still holds true after the operation, but `low` is now incremented by 1. Other variables (`high`, `mid`, `zeroes`) remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`low` is now equal to `(low + high) // 2 + 1`, `high` remains unchanged, and the condition `low must be less than or equal to high` still holds.**
