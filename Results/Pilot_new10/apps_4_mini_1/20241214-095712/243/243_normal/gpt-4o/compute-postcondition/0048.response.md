According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `func_1(right) == m`. Right before the loop, `right` is equal to `mid + 1`. Since it is stated that `func_1(left) != m`, we need to ensure that `func_1(right)` must also equal `m` for the loop to execute at least once. 

Thus, we need to adjust the state of `right` such that when `func_1` is called with `right`, it returns `m`. Additionally, we also need to ensure that the conditions given for `low`, `high`, `mid`, and `left` are maintained properly, meaning the state of `left` should remain such that it aligns with the given condition of initially being at least `1 + number_of_iterations_executed`. 

Since `right` must satisfy `func_1(right) == m`, we don't need to adjust that condition as the actual comparison depends on the implementation of `func_1` rather than modifying variable states. We also know that `left` is such that `func_1(left) != m`, but we do not have the specific implementation details of `func_1` to dictate a new range or specific value.

Therefore, we have to ensure `right` is modified such that the result of `func_1(right)` will be `m`. The other states do not need modification but are contextual to ensuring `right` is in an appropriate range.

State: **`left` is such that `func_1(left) != m`, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`, `result` is an empty list, `right` must be such that `func_1(right) == m`, and the initial value of `left` was at least `1 + number_of_iterations_executed`.**
