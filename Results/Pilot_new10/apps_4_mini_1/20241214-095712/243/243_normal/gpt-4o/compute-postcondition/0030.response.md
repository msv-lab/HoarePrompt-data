Output State: **`left` is decreased to a value such that `func_1(left)` is no longer equal to `m`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000, `low` is 0, `high` is 5 * (`m` + 1), `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, `mid` is (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2, `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`, `right` is incremented past the point where `func_1(right)` equals `m`, and `func_1(right)` is no longer equal to `m`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
