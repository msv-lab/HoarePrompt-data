The code generates a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`. Given that `left` is a value such that `func_1(left)` is no longer equal to `m`, `result` will now contain all integers in that range. The variable `result` will be updated with this new list.

In this case:
- `left` is known to be less than `right` since `right` is incremented past the point where `func_1(right)` equals `m`.

Therefore, the output would reflect the values for `result`, which will be a list of integers starting from `left + 1` up to `right - 1`.

Output State: **`left` is decreased to a value such that `func_1(left)` is no longer equal to `m`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000, `low` is 0, `high` is 5 * (`m` + 1), `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, `mid` is (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2, `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`, `right` is incremented past the point where `func_1(right)` equals `m`, and `func_1(right)` is no longer equal to `m`.**
