The code `break` does not change the values of any variables but terminates the current loop. Consequently, the execution exits to the following statement after the loop.

Output State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` remains equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`, `result` is a list containing integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, `left` is equal to `(low + high) // 2 - k`, `func_1(left)` is equal to `m`, `func_1(right)` equals `m`, `func_1(right + 1)` equals `m`, and `right` is equal to the original value of `right` plus the number of times the loop executed, and we break out of the most internal loop.**
