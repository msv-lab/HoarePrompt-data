To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state so that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition of the loop: `while func_1(right) == m:`.

1. We know that in order for the `while` loop to execute, the expression `func_1(right)` must be equal to `m`. This means that the current value of `right` should produce a result from the function `func_1` that matches `m`.
   
2. From the provided state, we know the following:
   - `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
   - `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`.
   - The value of `zeroes` is the return value from `func_1(mid)`, but this particular value does not directly impact the condition of our while loop.
   - `result` is an empty list, which is also not impacting the condition of the `while` loop directly.
   - `left` is equal to `(low + high) // 2 - k`, which also does not directly influence the loop condition.
   - `func_1(left)` equals `m`, but again, the relevant condition here is that `func_1(right)` must equal `m` for the loop to iterate.

3. Currently, we do not know if `func_1(right) == m` is true or false. However, to ensure the loop can execute the first time, we need the condition `func_1(right) == m` to be satisfied. Therefore, we can deduce that:
   - We should either ensure `right` is adjusted such that `func_1(right)` results in the value `m`, or we need to redefine `m` based on what `func_1(right)` currently returns.

Since we want to guarantee that the loop can execute, we can state the following requirement for `m` and `right`:

State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` remains equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`, `result` is an empty list, `left` is equal to `(low + high) // 2 - k`, `func_1(left)` is equal to `m`, and `func_1(right)` must equal m.**
