Output State: **`left` is such that `func_1(left) != m`, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`, `result` is a list containing the elements from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, `right` is such that `func_1(right) != m`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
