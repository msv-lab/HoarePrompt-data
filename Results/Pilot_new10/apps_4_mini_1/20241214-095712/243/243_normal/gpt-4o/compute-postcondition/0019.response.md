The operation `left -= 1` decrements the value of `left` by 1. The variable `left` is not specified to have a specific value but must be understood within the context of its previous conditions.

Since `left` must be incremented back to its previous value, we can assume that just before this operation, `left` had a specific value that is now reduced by 1. However, this revised state is not a permanent change because it will be reverted.

The other variables in the initial state (`m`, `low`, `high`, `result`, `mid`, `zeroes`, and the function condition) remain unchanged after this operation.

Thus, since the condition that `left` should be incremented back to its previous value is given, it indicates that the change is temporary.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` is 0; `high` is 5 * (`m` + 1); `result` is an empty list; `mid` is (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2; `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`; `left` is decremented by 1 temporarily, but will be restored to its previous value.**
