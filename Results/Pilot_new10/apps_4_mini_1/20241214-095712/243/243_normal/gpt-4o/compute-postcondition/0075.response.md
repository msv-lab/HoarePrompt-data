The value of `right` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `right` is unknown. Therefore, the state of the other variables is not affected. 

Output State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` remains equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`, `result` is an empty list, `left` is equal to `(low + high) // 2 - k`, `func_1(left)` is equal to `m`, and `func_1(right)` must equal m; `right` is now incremented by 1.**
