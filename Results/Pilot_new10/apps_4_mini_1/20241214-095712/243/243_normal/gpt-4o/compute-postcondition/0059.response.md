According to the loop condition `low <= high`, the loop can execute again as long as the relationship between `low` and `high` remains true. Since the postcondition states that `low` is less than or equal to `high`, it is already suitable for the loop to execute one more time. No adjustments need to be made to the states based on the given conditions.

State: **Postcondition: `low` is less than or equal to `high`.**
