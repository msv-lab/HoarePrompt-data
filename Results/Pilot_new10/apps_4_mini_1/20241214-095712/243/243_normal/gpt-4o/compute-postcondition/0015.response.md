The value of `left` is decremented by 1. The other variables in the state remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects that `left` has been reduced by 1 but retains all other variable conditions.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` is 0; `high` is 5 * (`m` + 1); `result` is an empty list; `mid` is (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2; `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`; `left` has been decremented by 1.**
