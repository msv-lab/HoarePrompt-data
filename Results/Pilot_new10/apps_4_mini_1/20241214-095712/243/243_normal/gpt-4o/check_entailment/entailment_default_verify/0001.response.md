After a detailed analysis of the problem description, program code, original assessment, and output hints, I conclude that the program correctly identifies integers `n` such that `n!` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes.

### Explanation:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   The task is to determine how many positive integers `n` yield a factorial that ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes.

2. **Functionality Breakdown**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` accurately calculates the number of trailing zeroes in `n!` based on the count of the factors of 5, which is correct.
   - The function `func_2(m)` implements a binary search to find the range of integers `n` for which the factorial ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes. If `zeroes == m`, it correctly expands to find all contiguous `n` that meet this condition.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The output provided in the examples aligns with the logic presented in the code, where specified inputs yield correct and expected outputs. 
   - The case of `m = 5` yielding `0` is handled appropriately, as confirmed by checking the factorial values.

4. **Output Hints**: 
   The output hints reinforce the correctness of the `func_1` and `func_2`. They clearly describe how the functions work and confirm that `func_2` will return an empty list when no valid `n` exists, which operates within the expected bounds of the problem.

5. **Assessment Consistency**: 
   The original assessment concluded that the program is correct based on a thorough analysis of the problem constraints, logical flow of both functions, and validation against sample inputs. The assessment properly identifies that the implementation adheres to the problem's requirements.

Given all the evidence, the assertions, and the correct handling of edge cases without deviations from expected outputs, I maintain the original assessment as accurate.

Final: **True**
