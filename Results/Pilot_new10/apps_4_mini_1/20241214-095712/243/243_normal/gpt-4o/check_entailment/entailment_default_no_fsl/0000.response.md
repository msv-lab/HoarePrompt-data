To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's first analyze the problem description and the code.

The problem asks us to find the count of positive integers \( n \) such that the factorial \( n! \) ends with exactly \( m \) trailing zeros. The program includes two functions:

1. **`func_1(n)`**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \( n! \) by counting how many times \( n \) can be divided by powers of 5. This approach is correct for counting trailing zeroes since trailing zeroes are created by the pairs of factors 2 and 5, and there are generally more factors of 2 than 5 in factorials.

2. **`func_2(m)`**: This function searches for all \( n \) values such that \( n! \) has exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes. The search is done via a binary search between 0 and \( 5 \times (m + 1) \). This approach attempts to find the range of \( n \) values that yield exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes and collects them in a list.

Now, evaluating the correctness on provided cases:

### Case Analysis:
1. **Input: 1**
   - Expected Output: 5 (i.e., the integers 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).
   - In this scenario, it appears the code correctly identifies that \( 5! \), \( 6! \), \( 7! \), \( 8! \), and \( 9! \) respectively have exactly 1 trailing zero.

2. **Input: 5**
   - Expected Output: 0 (no integers such that \( n! \) ends with exactly 5 trailing zeroes).
   - The program should check and return an empty list which becomes 0 when printed. The output hint specifies that they expect this to work correctly.

### Missing Cases:
While the basic functionality regarding inputs directly mentioned in the examples appears correct, we must consider the potential edge cases:
- What about higher values, such as \( m = 10 \)?
- Or maximum possible values according to constraints, like \( m = 100000 \)?

In factorial, trailing zeroes are created by factors of 5. Each increase by 5 in \( n \) can lead to a new trailing zero. This implies the approach would not scale properly for larger inputs if edge conditions are not managed.

We'd expect consecutive values of n to return a proper set of trailing zeros but there's a finite point where \( n! \) crosses populations of zeroes which the binary search would need to account for.

**Conclusion**: 
Although the code appears to function correctly for basic examples listed, it cannot conclusively state correctness for all potential inputs due to the need for edge case validation, especially for higher values of \( m \) and potential gaps in finding ranges.

Thus the determination is:
Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle all edge cases, particularly with input values that are higher than those tested.
