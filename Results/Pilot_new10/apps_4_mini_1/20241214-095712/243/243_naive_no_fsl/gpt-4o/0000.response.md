To determine the correctness of the provided program, we will analyze the function `func_2`, which aims to find all integers `n` such that the factorial of `n` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes.

### Analysis of the Code

1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes**:
   The number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of an integer `n` is determined by the number of times `n` can be divided by `5`, `25`, `125`, etc., because `10` is formed by multiplying `2` and `5`, and `2`s are more abundant than `5`s in factorials.

2. **Functions Overview**:
   - `func_1(n)`: Computes the number of trailing zeroes in `n!` by counting the contributions of factors of `5`.
   - `func_2(m)`: Searches for integers `n` such that `n!` has exactly `m` trailing zeroes using a binary search technique.

3. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search is correctly set up to adjust the `low` and `high` bounds based on whether the count of trailing zeroes in `mid!` is less than, greater than, or equal to `m`.
   - When `zeroes == m`, the code attempts to find the range of `n` values that yield exactly `m` trailing zeroes by decrementing (`left`) and incrementing (`right`) from `mid`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - It is mentioned that for `m = 5`, the output is `0`. This implies there are no integers `n` such that `n!` ends with exactly `5` zeroes, confirmed since `5!` has `1` zeroes and `10!` has `2` zeroes and then jumps to `24` zeroes at higher numbers.
   - The range search to find the values where the trailing zeroes are exactly `m` is correct in logic.

### Testing Edge Cases
While the function generally appears to handle checks correctly, we must ensure there are no cases where the program would fail. We need to check:

- The lowest possible m (which is 1): The code should return all `n` such that `n!` ends with exactly `1` zero. The results appear consistent through sampling (5! = 120, 6! = 720, ...).
- Performance up to the highest standard input (m = 100000) and look for any potential integer overflow or efficiency problems, although Python handles large integers well.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the functionality and edge cases, I cannot find input values for which the function fails to correctly identify the integers `n` such that `n!` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes consistent with the problem description.

Correctness: **True** 

The code functions correctly for all edge cases within the problem constraints and adheres to the requirements set out in the description.
