The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the current loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 2,000,000,000; `count_zeros` is equal to `k`; `to_remove` remains unchanged; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
