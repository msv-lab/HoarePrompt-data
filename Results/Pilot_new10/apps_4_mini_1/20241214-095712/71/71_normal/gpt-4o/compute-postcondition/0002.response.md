The variable `count_zeros` is assigned the value `0`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the execution of this code. 

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 2,000,000,000; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 9; `count_zeros` is 0.**
