`count_zeros` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `count_zeros` was `k`, so after the increment, `count_zeros` becomes `k + 1`. Other variables remain unchanged; hence, the output state reflects the updated value of `count_zeros`.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 2,000,000,000, `digit` is the next digit in the reversed string representation of `n`, `count_zeros` is equal to `k + 1`, `to_remove` remains unchanged**.
