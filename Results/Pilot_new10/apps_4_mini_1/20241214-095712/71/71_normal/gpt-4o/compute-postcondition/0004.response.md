According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop iterates over the string representation of the non-negative integer `n` in reverse order. For the loop to execute, `n` must not be an empty string. Given that `n` is represented as a non-negative integer, the minimal value it can hold is `0`, which is a valid string representation ("0"). When processed as a string, it will have at least one character.

At the end of the last iteration (if the loop gets executed), `digit` will hold the current character being processed from `n`, the loop will start with the last character of `n`, and `count_zeros` and `to_remove` remain unchanged as the loop body is omitted.

Thus, the necessary adjustments to the state are:
- `n` must be a string representing a non-negative integer (which will always be "0" or more based on the constraints).
- `digit` will be initialized as the last character of `n` when the loop starts.

State: **`n` is a string representation of a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 2,000,000,000, `digit` is the last character of n**
