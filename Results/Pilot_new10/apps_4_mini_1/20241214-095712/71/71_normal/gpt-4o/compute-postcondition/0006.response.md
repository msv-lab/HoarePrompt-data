The `count_zeros` variable is incremented by 1. The precondition states that `digit` is currently '0', which implies that it represents a situation where `count_zeros` would be relevant. The other variables remain unaffected, so the final state reflects the increment of `count_zeros` only. 

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 2,000,000,000; `digit` is '0'; `count_zeros` is incremented by 1.**
