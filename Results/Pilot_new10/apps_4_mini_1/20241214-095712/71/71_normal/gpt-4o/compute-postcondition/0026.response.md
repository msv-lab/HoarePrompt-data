Postcondition: ***`count_zeros` is equal to the total number of zeros in `n` up to a maximum of `k`, `to_remove` is equal to the count of non-zero digits encountered before reaching `k` zeros, `n` is still a string representation of the original non-negative integer, and the current value of `count_zeros` is equal to `k`.***
