Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representation of a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 2,000,000,000. If `count_zeros` is equal to `k`, then if `digit` is '0', `count_zeros` is increased to `k + 1` and `to_remove` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `count_zeros` remains equal to `k` and `to_remove` is increased by 1. In both cases, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
