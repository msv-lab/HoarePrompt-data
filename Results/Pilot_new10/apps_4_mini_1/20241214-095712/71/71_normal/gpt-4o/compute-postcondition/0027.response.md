The code snippet prints the current value of `to_remove`. The output does not change any variable states but reflects the value of `to_remove` at the time of execution. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`count_zeros` is equal to the total number of zeros in `n` up to a maximum of `k`, `to_remove` is equal to the count of non-zero digits encountered before reaching `k` zeros, `n` is still a string representation of the original non-negative integer, and `count_zeros` is equal to `k`, and `to_remove` has been printed.**
