The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or the most internal structure we were directly inside, without affecting the other variables. Therefore, the output state remains as is.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 2,000,000,000; if `digit` is '0', then `count_zeros` is equal to `k + 1` and `to_remove` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `count_zeros` is equal to `k` and `to_remove` has been increased by 1; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
