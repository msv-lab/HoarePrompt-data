The value of `w` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `w` is unknown. The condition that `n` must not be divisible by `10` does not affect the execution of the code but remains valid. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must not be divisible by `10`; `w` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` must not be divisible by `10`; `w` is increased by 1**
