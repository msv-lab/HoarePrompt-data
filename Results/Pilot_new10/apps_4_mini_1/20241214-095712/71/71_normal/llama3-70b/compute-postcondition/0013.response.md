The function `func` is described to accept two parameters: `n` and `k`. The parameter `n` is a non-negative integer ranging from 0 to 2,000,000,000 inclusive, and the parameter `k` is a positive integer ranging from 1 to 9 inclusive. However, the output behavior of the function has not been provided, so I will list the parameters accordingly.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `n`, which is a non-negative integer between 0 and 2,000,000,000 inclusive, and a parameter `k`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 9 inclusive.**
