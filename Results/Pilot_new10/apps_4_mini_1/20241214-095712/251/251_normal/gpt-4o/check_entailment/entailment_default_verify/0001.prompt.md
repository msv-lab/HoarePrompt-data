You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: As you know, every birthday party has a cake! This time, Babaei is going to prepare the very special birthday party's cake.

Simple cake is a cylinder of some radius and height. The volume of the simple cake is equal to the volume of corresponding cylinder. Babaei has n simple cakes and he is going to make a special cake placing some cylinders on each other.

However, there are some additional culinary restrictions. The cakes are numbered in such a way that the cake number i can be placed only on the table or on some cake number j where j < i. Moreover, in order to impress friends Babaei will put the cake i on top of the cake j only if the volume of the cake i is strictly greater than the volume of the cake j.

Babaei wants to prepare a birthday cake that has a maximum possible total volume. Help him find this value.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of simple cakes Babaei has.

Each of the following n lines contains two integers r_{i} and h_{i} (1 ≤ r_{i}, h_{i} ≤ 10 000), giving the radius and height of the i-th cake.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum volume of the cake that Babaei can make. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 6}.

Namely: let's assume that your answer is a, and the answer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct, if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1, b)} \leq 10^{-6}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
2
100 30
40 10

Output
942477.796077000

Input
4
1 1
9 7
1 4
10 7

Output
3983.539484752



-----Note-----

In first sample, the optimal way is to choose the cake number 1.

In second sample, the way to get the maximum volume is to use cakes with indices 1, 2 and 4.
Program:
```
import sys
import math

input = sys.stdin.read
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

def func_1(n, cakes):
    volumes = [math.pi * r * r * h for (r, h) in cakes]
    dp = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = volumes[i]
        for j in range(i):
            if volumes[j] < volumes[i]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + volumes[i])
    return max(dp)

def func_2():
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    cakes = [(int(data[2 * i + 1]), int(data[2 * i + 2])) for i in range(n)]
    result = func_1(n, cakes)
    print(f'{result:.6f}')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program has a logical flaw in how it handles the stacking of cakes. The key restrictions as per the problem are:

1. Cake i can be placed on top of cake j only if j < i.
2. Volume of cake i must be strictly greater than the volume of cake j.

The logic used in `func_1` mistakenly allows cakes to be stacked based purely on their volumes without obeying the order of indices strictly. This means if cake `i` and cake `j` have the same volume, `func_1` might erroneously consider stacking them when, according to problem rules, this should not happen.

### Test Case that Fails
Consider the following potentially valid input:

```
3
2 1
3 1
2 2
```

The computed volumes are:
- Cake 1: \( \pi \cdot 2^2 \cdot 1 = 4\pi \)
- Cake 2: \( \pi \cdot 3^2 \cdot 1 = 9\pi \)
- Cake 3: \( \pi \cdot 2^2 \cdot 2 = 8\pi \)

Following the stacking rules, the maximum valid stacking is:
- Cake 1 (4pi) and Cake 2 (9pi) can be placed directly as Cake 1 can sit under Cake 2.
- Cake 3 (8pi) cannot be placed on Cake 2 (9pi) and can only sit on Cake 1 (4pi).

In the correct implementation, we should not consider at index `j` where `j < i` if `volumes[j]` is not less than `volumes[i]`.

However, if we consider the resulting volumes from code, the program may mishandle combinations leading to outputs that do not align with the strict criteria of stacking, especially among cakes with equal volumes.

Thus, there are scenarios with overlapping volumes that the DP approach fails to correctly respect the stacking rules leading to incorrect calculations. Hence, the logic that allows summing volumes without strict compliance to the rules results in incorrect total maximum volume calculations. 

Therefore, due to this reasoning, the output fails to guarantee correctness for all possible cases under provided conditions.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of tuples `cakes`, where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the radius and height of each cake. It calculates the volume of each cake and returns the maximum sum of volumes from valid sequences of cakes such that the volume of each cake included in the sequence is greater than the previous one. If no valid sequences exist, it will still return the maximum volume from individual cakes. 

Output hint for function_2: The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of tuples representing the radius and height of `n` cakes, then it processes these inputs via another function `func_1` and prints the result. However, it does not account for any potential input errors or details regarding the functionality of `func_1`. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
