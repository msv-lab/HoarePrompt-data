The code assigns the value of `volumes[i]` to `dp[i]`. Since `i` is assigned the value of `n`, the value of `dp[n]` will be set to the value of `volumes[n]`. Thus, the precondition remains the same except for the updated value of `dp[i]`. 

Given that `n` is a positive integer within the range from 1 to 100,000, it indicates that `i` will also take on the value of `n`. The state of `dp` at `i` (which is `n`) will reflect the value of `volumes[n]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `i` is `n`; `dp[n]` is equal to `volumes[n]`.**
