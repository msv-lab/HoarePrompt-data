The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n` and `cakes`. Parameter `n` is a positive integer, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, representing the number of cakes. The parameter `cakes` is a list of tuples, each tuple containing two integers (r_i, h_i), where 1 ≤ r_i, h_i ≤ 10,000 represent the radius and height of the i-th cake, respectively. 

After executing the function body, it processes these inputs, but based on the given output specifications, we need to focus on the return values.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of tuples `cakes`, where each tuple contains the radius and height of respective cakes, and returns an output based on the processed information from these inputs.**
