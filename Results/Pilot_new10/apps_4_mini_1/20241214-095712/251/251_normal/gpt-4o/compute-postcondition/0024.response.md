According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and the current value of `i`. The loop iterates from `j = 0` to `j = i - 1`, which means it will execute as long as `j` is less than `i`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n`, and `j` is currently 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must increment. The loop will execute a total of `i` times, which means the next value of `j` will be 2.

Since `i` is `n` and `j` has to be less than `i` (which is `n`), the condition for the loop to execute one more time is that `j` must be less than `n`. Currently, `j` is 1, thus it will next increment to 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `i` is `n`, and `j` is 2.**
