According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `i`. Since `i` is equal to `n`, and given that `n` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 100000 \), `i` is guaranteed to be at least 1. Therefore, the loop will execute starting with `j` initialized to 0.

The state after analyzing the provided information should indicate that `j` must be initialized to 0, and `i` is equal to `n`, which is between 1 and 100000. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `i` is `n`, `j` is 0**
