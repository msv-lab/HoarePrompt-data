`data` is assigned the value of `input().split()`, which implies that it will hold the list of strings obtained from splitting the input based on whitespace. The variable `n`, which represents a positive integer, remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are also unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` remains a positive integer in the range (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000) and `data` is a list of strings containing the split input values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), `data` is a list of strings containing the split input values.**
