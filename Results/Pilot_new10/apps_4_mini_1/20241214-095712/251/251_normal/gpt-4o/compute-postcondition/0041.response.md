Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `dp` is a list where each `dp[i]` contains the maximum sum of volumes achievable from valid sequences ending at index `i`, based on the criteria that `volumes[j] < volumes[i]` for all indices `j` less than `i`. If no valid sequences exist for a specific index, `dp[i]` remains equal to `volumes[i]`.**
