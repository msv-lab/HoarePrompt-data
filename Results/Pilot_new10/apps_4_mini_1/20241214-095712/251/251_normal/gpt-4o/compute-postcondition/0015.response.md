According to the code, the loop iterates for values of `i` from 0 to `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` will be one less than `n`, specifically `i` is `n-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `n`. Since `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to continue executing, the current value of `i` being `n-1` means the loop cannot execute again unless `n` is increased.

Because `n` is a positive integer and must be at least `1`, `n` does not need to be adjusted lower. The loop can only continue if `i` is less than `n`, thus, at the next state, `i` is `n` and no need to change `n`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `i` is `n`**
