The function `func_2` reads input data where the first element is a positive integer `n` and the following elements represent tuples containing the radius and height of `n` cakes. It constructs a list of these tuples and then calls another function `func_1` providing it with `n` and the list of cakes as arguments. Finally, the result from `func_1` is printed formatted to six decimal places. 

However, the actual implementation does not specify what `func_1` does or how it processes the inputs. Importantly, `func_2` does not handle any potential errors related to input parsing or the output formatting beyond calling `func_1`, which means there could be edge cases involving invalid input data or unexpected results from `func_1` that are not addressed.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of tuples representing the radius and height of `n` cakes, then it processes these inputs via another function `func_1` and prints the result. However, it does not account for any potential input errors or details regarding the functionality of `func_1`. **
