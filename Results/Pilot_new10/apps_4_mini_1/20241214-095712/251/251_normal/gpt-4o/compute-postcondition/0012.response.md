The value of `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + volumes[i]`. The values of `i` and `j` do not change, and they indicate the respective indices for the `dp` array and `volumes` array. Since `i` is at least 3 and `j` is 2, we know `j` is within bounds for the `dp` array.

However, we do not have specific initial values for `dp[i]`, `dp[j]`, or `volumes[i]`, so we cannot determine the exact final values for these variables. Nevertheless, the formula indicates a comparison and possible reassignment specifically for `dp[i]`.

Thus, we can summarize the output state while indicating the updates to `dp[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `i` is at least 3, `j` is 2, and `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + volumes[i]`.**
