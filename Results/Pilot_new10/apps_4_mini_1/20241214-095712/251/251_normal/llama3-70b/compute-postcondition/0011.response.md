Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `cakes` is a list containing `n` tuples where each tuple is of the form `(volume, r_i, h_i)` with `volume` calculated as `math.pi * r_i * r_i * h_i` for each cake corresponding to the input values of `r_i` and `h_i`, and `_` takes values from 0 to n-1 during iterations.**
