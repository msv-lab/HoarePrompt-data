The variable `dp` is assigned a list of zeros with a length equal to `n`, which is a positive integer in the range of 1 to 100,000. The previous state of variables remains unchanged except for `dp`, which now holds a list of floats. Specifically, `dp` will be a list consisting of `n` elements, all initialized to `0.0`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `cakes` is a list of `n` tuples sorted in descending order by volume, `dp` is a list of `n` floats initialized to 0.0**.
