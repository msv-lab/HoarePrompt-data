The value of `r` and `h` is assigned through the input parsing operation `map(int, input().split())`. Since `r` and `h` were previously input integers, their specific values will be set depending on the user input provided at runtime, so they will now become specific integer values while `_` remains as `n-1` and `cakes` is unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `cakes` is a list containing the newly added tuple `(math.pi * r * r * h, r, h)`, `_` is `n-1`, `r` is an input integer, `h` is an input integer**
