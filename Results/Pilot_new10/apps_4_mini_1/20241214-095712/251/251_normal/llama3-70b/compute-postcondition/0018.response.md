Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 1, `cakes` is a list of n tuples sorted in descending order by volume, `dp[0]` is cakes[0][0], `dp[1]` is cakes[1][0], `dp[i]` is still 0.0 for all i > 1, `j` is 0. The current value of `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and the current value of `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]`.***
