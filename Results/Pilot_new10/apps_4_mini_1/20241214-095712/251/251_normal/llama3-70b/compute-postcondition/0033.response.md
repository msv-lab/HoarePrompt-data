Postcondition: ***Given that `n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and `cakes` is a list of `n` tuples sorted in descending order by volume, if the conditions `cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]` are satisfied, then `dp[2]` is updated to the maximum value between `dp[2]` and `dp[0] + cakes[2][0]`.***
