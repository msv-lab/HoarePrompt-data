According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and the current value of `i`. The loop runs for `j` in the range from 0 to `i - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, which means the loop has executed for the first time. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must increase by 1, making it 1. Additionally, for the loop of `j` to continue executing, the value of `i` must be greater than 1, as `j` must remain less than `i`. 

Thus, if the current state maintains that `i` is greater than 0, it must also ensure that `i` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`dp[2]` remains the maximum value previously calculated, `dp[n]` is equal to `cakes[n][0]`, `i` is greater than 1, `j` is 1**
