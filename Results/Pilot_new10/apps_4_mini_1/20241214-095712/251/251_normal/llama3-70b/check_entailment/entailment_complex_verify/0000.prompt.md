You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: As you know, every birthday party has a cake! This time, Babaei is going to prepare the very special birthday party's cake.

Simple cake is a cylinder of some radius and height. The volume of the simple cake is equal to the volume of corresponding cylinder. Babaei has n simple cakes and he is going to make a special cake placing some cylinders on each other.

However, there are some additional culinary restrictions. The cakes are numbered in such a way that the cake number i can be placed only on the table or on some cake number j where j < i. Moreover, in order to impress friends Babaei will put the cake i on top of the cake j only if the volume of the cake i is strictly greater than the volume of the cake j.

Babaei wants to prepare a birthday cake that has a maximum possible total volume. Help him find this value.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of simple cakes Babaei has.

Each of the following n lines contains two integers r_{i} and h_{i} (1 ≤ r_{i}, h_{i} ≤ 10 000), giving the radius and height of the i-th cake.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum volume of the cake that Babaei can make. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 6}.

Namely: let's assume that your answer is a, and the answer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct, if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1, b)} \leq 10^{-6}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
2
100 30
40 10

Output
942477.796077000

Input
4
1 1
9 7
1 4
10 7

Output
3983.539484752



-----Note-----

In first sample, the optimal way is to choose the cake number 1.

In second sample, the way to get the maximum volume is to use cakes with indices 1, 2 and 4.
Program:
```
import math

def func():
    n = int(input())
    cakes = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (r, h) = map(int, input().split())
        cakes.append((math.pi * r * r * h, r, h))
    cakes.sort(reverse=True)
    dp = [0.0] * n
    dp[0] = cakes[0][0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        dp[i] = cakes[i][0]
        for j in range(i):
            if cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1] and cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + cakes[i][0])
    print(dp[-1])


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program according to the problem description, we will analyze the code to see if it correctly calculates the maximum total volume of cakes that can be stacked based on the given conditions.

The program performs the following actions:

1. Reads the number of cakes and their dimensions (radius and height).
2. Calculates the volume of each cake as \( \text{volume} = \pi \times r^2 \times h \) and stores it along with its radius and height in a list.
3. Sorts the list of cakes based on their volumes in descending order.
4. Initializes a dynamic programming (DP) array to store the maximum potential volume for stacking cakes.
5. Iterates through each cake and checks if it can be placed on top of another cake based on the restrictions (the volume must be strictly greater).
6. Calculates the maximum volume obtainable by checking every possible way to stack the cakes.

Now, we should check for any potential cases where this logic might fail, particularly with respect to the restrictions that a cake can only be placed on another cake if it has both a smaller radius and height (not just volume).

Here's a potential case to test:

### Test Case
Input:
```
3
3 3
4 3
3 4
```
Expected Output: 
- The volumes of the cakes will be:
  - Cake 1: \( \pi \times 3^2 \times 3 = 27\pi \)
  - Cake 2: \( \pi \times 4^2 \times 3 = 48\pi \)
  - Cake 3: \( \pi \times 3^2 \times 4 = 36\pi \)

- The stacking logic indicates:
  - Cake 1 cannot be placed on Cake 2 (as volume is not strictly greater).
  - Cake 2 can sit on nothing as no cake has strictly greater volume.
  - Cake 3 cannot be placed on Cake 1 since both radius and height restrictions are not satisfied (both radius and height of Cake 3 aren't smaller than Cake 1).

The maximum total volume would therefore be just Cake 2’s volume since the other cakes cannot be used for stacking.

### Issue with Implementation
The cakes get sorted and the DP mechanism is supposed to find the maximum stacking volume. 
- However, the condition `if cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1] and cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]:` restricts the placement based solely on dimensions, which may overlook optimal additional volume gains available through some arrangements. Specifically, it can yield a configuration that brings a volume smaller than anticipated.

Given these analyses, there arises a flaw in understanding where Cake 3 potentially could have stacked with sufficient configurations not being adequately calculated.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000); for each cake, r_i and h_i are integers representing the radius and height of the i-th cake, respectively, with 1 ≤ r_i, h_i ≤ 10000.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    cakes = []
    for _ in range(n):
        r, h = map(int, input().split())
        
        cakes.append((math.pi * r * r * h, r, h))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `cakes` is a list containing `n` tuples where each tuple is of the form `(volume, r_i, h_i)` with `volume` calculated as `math.pi * r_i * r_i * h_i` for each cake corresponding to the input values of `r_i` and `h_i`, and `_` takes values from 0 to n-1 during iterations.
    cakes.sort(reverse=True)
    dp = [0.0] * n
    dp[0] = cakes[0][0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        dp[i] = cakes[i][0]
        
        for j in range(i):
            if cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1] and cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + cakes[i][0])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `dp` is a list containing the maximum possible values calculated based on the conditions of the loop for each corresponding cake index, where `dp[i]` represents the maximum value obtainable using the cakes that satisfy the given conditions, `cakes` is a list of `n` tuples sorted in descending order by volume, and if no valid preceding cakes are found for a particular `i`, `dp[i]` retains its initial value `cakes[i][0]`. If `n` is 1, then `dp` will simply contain the value of `cakes[0][0]`.
    print(dp[-1])
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a positive integer `n`, then accepts `n` pairs of integers representing the radius and height of cakes. It calculates the volume for each cake and stores the volumes along with their dimensions in a list. The function then determines the maximum possible volume obtainable by stacking cakes, where a cake can only be placed on top of another if both its radius and height are smaller than those of the cake below it. Finally, it prints the maximum achievable volume using these rules. No values are returned from the function.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
