The variable `cards` is assigned a list of integers obtained from input, specifically, a number of integers equal to the value of `n`. The value of `n` remains unchanged and is an even integer between 2 and 100. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

The outcome is that `cards` will contain `n` integers based on the input provided during execution. 

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100; `cards` is a list of `n` integers obtained from input.**
