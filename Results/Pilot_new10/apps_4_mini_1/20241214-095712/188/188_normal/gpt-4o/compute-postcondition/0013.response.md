Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100; `cards` is a list of `n` integers obtained from input; `count` is a Counter object representing the occurrences of each integer in `cards`; and `unique_numbers` is a list of unique integers from `cards` sorted by their occurrences in ascending order. If the length of `unique_numbers` is less than 2, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if the length of `unique_numbers` is 2 or more, and the counts of the last and second to last unique numbers in `unique_numbers` are both equal to `n // 2`, then 'YES' is printed along with the last and second to last unique numbers; if not, 'NO' is printed.***
