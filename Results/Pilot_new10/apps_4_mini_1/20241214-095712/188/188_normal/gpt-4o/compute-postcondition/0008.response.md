The code snippet executes a print statement that outputs 'YES', which indicates a confirmation or validation. The execution of this code does not modify any of the variables or conditions in the initial state. Therefore, the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100; `cards` is a list of `n` integers obtained from input; `count` is a Counter object representing the occurrences of each integer in `cards`; `unique_numbers` is a list of unique integers from `cards` sorted by their occurrences in ascending order, with a length of 2 or more; the current counts of the last and second to last unique numbers in `unique_numbers` are both equal to `n // 2`, and 'YES' has been printed.**
