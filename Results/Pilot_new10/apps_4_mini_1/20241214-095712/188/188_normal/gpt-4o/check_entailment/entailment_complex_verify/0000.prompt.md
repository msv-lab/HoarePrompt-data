You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Petya and Vasya decided to play a game. They have n cards (n is an even number). A single integer is written on each card.

Before the game Petya will choose an integer and after that Vasya will choose another integer (different from the number that Petya chose). During the game each player takes all the cards with number he chose. For example, if Petya chose number 5 before the game he will take all cards on which 5 is written and if Vasya chose number 10 before the game he will take all cards on which 10 is written.

The game is considered fair if Petya and Vasya can take all n cards, and the number of cards each player gets is the same.

Determine whether Petya and Vasya can choose integer numbers before the game so that the game is fair. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) — number of cards. It is guaranteed that n is an even number.

The following n lines contain a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (one integer per line, 1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100) — numbers written on the n cards.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible for Petya and Vasya to choose numbers in such a way that the game will be fair, print "NO" (without quotes) in the first line. In this case you should not print anything more.

In the other case print "YES" (without quotes) in the first line. In the second line print two distinct integers — number that Petya should choose and the number that Vasya should choose to make the game fair. If there are several solutions, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
4
11
27
27
11

Output
YES
11 27

Input
2
6
6

Output
NO

Input
6
10
20
30
20
10
20

Output
NO

Input
6
1
1
2
2
3
3

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example the game will be fair if, for example, Petya chooses number 11, and Vasya chooses number 27. Then the will take all cards — Petya will take cards 1 and 4, and Vasya will take cards 2 and 3. Thus, each of them will take exactly two cards.

In the second example fair game is impossible because the numbers written on the cards are equal, but the numbers that Petya and Vasya should choose should be distinct.

In the third example it is impossible to take all cards. Petya and Vasya can take at most five cards — for example, Petya can choose number 10 and Vasya can choose number 20. But for the game to be fair it is necessary to take 6 cards.
Program:
```
from collections import Counter

def func():
    n = int(input())
    cards = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    count = Counter(cards)
    unique_numbers = sorted(count.keys(), key=lambda x: count[x])
    if len(unique_numbers) < 2:
        print('NO')
    elif count[unique_numbers[-1]] == n // 2 and count[unique_numbers[-2]] == n // 2:
        print('YES')
        print(unique_numbers[-1], unique_numbers[-2])
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the implementation:

1. The program first reads the total number of cards `n` and then collects the values on those cards.
2. It uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each number on the cards.
3. It sorts the unique card values based on their counts.
4. The program checks if there are at least 2 unique numbers:
   - If fewer than 2 unique numbers exist, it correctly prints "NO", as both players cannot choose distinct cards.
5. The program then checks if the two most frequent unique numbers both appear exactly `n // 2` times:
   - If they do, it prints "YES" and these two numbers for a fair game.
   - If the condition is not met, it prints "NO".

Now, let's consider some edge cases:

### Edge Case Testing

1. **All Cards the Same Number:**
   Input:
   ```
   2
   5
   5
   ```
   Expected Output: `NO`
   Actual Output: `NO` ✅ (Correct behavior)

2. **Two Distinct Numbers, But Not Equal Counts:**
   Input:
   ```
   4
   1
   1
   2
   2
   ```
   Expected Output: `YES` (but counts are 2 and 2)
   Actual Output: `YES 1 2` ✅ (Correct behavior)

3. **More Than Two Distinct Numbers:**
   Input:
   ```
   4
   1
   1
   2
   3
   ```
   Expected Output: `NO` (Since they can't pick two numbers to satisfy the equality condition)
   Actual Output: `NO` ✅ (Correct behavior)

4. **Valid Pair: Check if the Program Chooses the Right Cards:**
   Input:
   ```
   6
   1
   1
   2
   2
   3
   3
   ```
   Expected Output: `NO`
   Actual Output: `NO` ✅ (Correct behavior)

5. **Large Distinct Cards:**
   Input:
   ```
   6
   10
   20
   30
   20
   10
   20
   ```
   Expected Output: `NO`
   Actual Output: `NO` ✅ (Correct behavior)

### Conclusion

After running through several edge cases, it appears that the program is handling various scenarios correctly, particularly ensuring that if there are two numbers they must have exactly equal counts and both be able to match half of `n`. However, the logic does not accommodate for cases where unique numbers don’t exactly fulfill the count of n/2 even if there are more than two distinct numbers.

Thus, the logic fails in a situation where no two numbers can indeed be chosen to fill the count condition.

For example:
- If there are numbers `1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4`, the output should be `NO` but it might not reach that condition.

Overall, since the code does not cover all potential failing cases, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

The implementation may not accurately determine the ability to divide the cards evenly in cases of non-uniform distributions.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
from collections import Counter

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an even integer between 2 and 100, and the subsequent n integers are between 1 and 100, representing the numbers written on the n cards.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    cards = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    count = Counter(cards)
    unique_numbers = sorted(count.keys(), key=lambda x: count[x])
    if (len(unique_numbers) < 2) :
        print('NO')
    else :
        if (count[unique_numbers[-1]] == n // 2 and count[unique_numbers[-2]] == n // 2) :
            print('YES')
            print(unique_numbers[-1], unique_numbers[-2])
        else :
            print('NO')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100; `cards` is a list of `n` integers obtained from input; `count` is a Counter object representing the occurrences of each integer in `cards`; `unique_numbers` is a list of unique integers from `cards` sorted by their occurrences in ascending order, with a length of 2 or more. If both the counts of the last and second to last unique numbers in `unique_numbers` are equal to `n // 2`, then 'YES' is printed, followed by the last unique number and the second to last unique number from `unique_numbers`. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100; `cards` is a list of `n` integers obtained from input; `count` is a Counter object representing the occurrences of each integer in `cards`; and `unique_numbers` is a list of unique integers from `cards` sorted by their occurrences in ascending order. If the length of `unique_numbers` is less than 2, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if the length of `unique_numbers` is 2 or more, and the counts of the last and second to last unique numbers in `unique_numbers` are both equal to `n // 2`, then 'YES' is printed along with the last and second to last unique numbers; if not, 'NO' is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an even integer `n` (with a value between 2 and 100) representing the number of cards, followed by `n` integers (each between 1 and 100) that represent the values on those cards. It checks if there are at least two unique card values and counts their occurrences using a Counter. If the last two unique numbers have the same count equal to `n // 2`, it prints 'YES' along with those two numbers. If there are fewer than two unique numbers or the conditions on the counts are not met, it prints 'NO'.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
