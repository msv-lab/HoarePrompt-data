Given the initial state, the code snippet `d[i] += 1` will increment the value at index `i` in the list `d` by 1. The variable `i` represents the second integer in the list `a`, which contains `n` integers. The value of `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100. 

Since `i` is the second integer of the list `a`, we have `a[1]`, and thus `d[i]` references an index based on the value of that second integer.

1. We note that `d[i]` increases by 1.
2. The states of `n` and `i` remain unchanged except for the modification of `d[i]`.

The output state will reflect that `d[i]` has been incremented, which is the only change.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer in the range 2 to 100, `i` is the second integer in the list `a`, `d[i]` is incremented by 1**.
