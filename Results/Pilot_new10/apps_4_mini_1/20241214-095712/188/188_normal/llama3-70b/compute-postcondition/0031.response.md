The variable `c` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `c` is 0, so after the execution of the code, the new value of `c` will be 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer in the range 2 to 100, `d` contains at least 1 key, `c` is 1, `a1` is equal to `i`, `a2` is -1, `i` is the first key in `d`, and the value of `d[i]` is equal to `n // 2. The current value of `c` is 1.**
