The variable `d` at index `i` is assigned the value `1`. The variable `i`, which represents the third integer in the list `a`, is not affected by this assignment. The only variable that is updated is `d[i]` which now holds the value `1`. All other initial conditions remain intact.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer in the range 2 to 100; `i` is the third integer in the list `a`; `a` is a list containing `n` integers; `d[i]` is 1.**
