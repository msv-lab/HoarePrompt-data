The variable `a2` is assigned the value of `i`, which is the next key in the dictionary `d`. The initial values of `n`, `c`, `a1`, and `d` remain unaffected, so we will include all the initial information except for `a2` which will be updated to the value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer in the range 2 to 100, `d` contains at least 1 more key, `c` is 0, `a1` remains as it is, `a2` is the next key in `d`, `i` is the next key in `d`.**
