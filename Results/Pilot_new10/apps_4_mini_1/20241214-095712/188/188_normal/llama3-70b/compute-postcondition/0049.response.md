Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer in the range 2 to 100. If `c` is 0, then `c` is set to 1, `a1` is updated to the next key in `d`, `a2` is also updated to the next value in `d`, and `i` is the next key in `d`. Otherwise, `c` remains 0, `a1` stays the same, `a2` is updated to the next value in `d`, `i` is the next key in `d`, and we exit the most internal loop or if statement.***
