The value of `c` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `c` was 0, so after executing `c += 1`, the new value of `c` will be 1. The other variables `n`, `d`, `a1`, and `a2` remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an even integer in the range 2 to 100, `d` contains at least 1 more key, `c` is 1, `a1` is the value of `i`, `a2` remains as it is, `i` is the next key in `d`.**
