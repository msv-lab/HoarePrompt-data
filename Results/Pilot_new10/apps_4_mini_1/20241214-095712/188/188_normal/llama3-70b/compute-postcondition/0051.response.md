Output State: **`n` is an even integer in the range 2 to 100, `d` contains all unique integers from the list `a`, `c` indicates the number of integers in `d` that have a count equal to `n // 2` (0, 1, or 2), `a1` is the first key in `d` for which the count equals `n // 2` (or remains -1 if none), `a2` is the second key in `d` for which the count equals `n // 2` (or remains -1 if fewer than two exist). If `c` is 0, then neither `a1` nor `a2` is set to any key in `d`; if `c` is 1, then `a1` has a value from `d` while `a2` remains -1; if `c` is 2, then both `a1` and `a2` contain keys from `d`.**
