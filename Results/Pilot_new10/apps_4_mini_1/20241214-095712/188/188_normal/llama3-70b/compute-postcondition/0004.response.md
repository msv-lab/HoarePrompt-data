According to the code, the loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `n`. Given that `n` is an even integer in the range 2 to 100 and `i` is currently 0, the loop can indeed execute again. After the last iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next loop iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be 1 in the next iteration, and the condition `i < n` must hold true.

State: **`n` is an even integer in the range 2 to 100, `i` is 1, `a` has a new integer element appended from input**
