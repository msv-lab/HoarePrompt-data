The `print(a1, a2)` statement outputs the values of `a1` and `a2`. The initial state indicates that `a1` is the first key in `d` for which the count equals `n // 2`, and `a2` is the second key in `d` for which the count equals `n // 2`. Since this line does not change any variable values, we maintain the initial state except for the output that occurs.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer in the range 2 to 100; `d` contains all unique integers from the list `a`; `c` indicates the number of integers in `d` that have a count equal to `n // 2`; `a1` is the first key in `d` for which the count equals `n // 2`; `a2` is the second key in `d` for which the count equals `n // 2` and the values of `a1` and `a2` have been printed.**
