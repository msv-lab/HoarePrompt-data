Since `a` is not defined in the initial state, we will include it in the output state as well. 

`a` is updated by appending a new value that is an integer obtained from user input. The integer is not specified in the initial state, therefore we treat it as a generic input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer in the range 2 to 100, `i` is 0, `a` has a new integer element appended from input.**
