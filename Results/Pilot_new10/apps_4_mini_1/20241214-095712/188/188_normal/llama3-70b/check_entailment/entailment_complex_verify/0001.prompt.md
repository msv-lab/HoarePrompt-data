You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Petya and Vasya decided to play a game. They have n cards (n is an even number). A single integer is written on each card.

Before the game Petya will choose an integer and after that Vasya will choose another integer (different from the number that Petya chose). During the game each player takes all the cards with number he chose. For example, if Petya chose number 5 before the game he will take all cards on which 5 is written and if Vasya chose number 10 before the game he will take all cards on which 10 is written.

The game is considered fair if Petya and Vasya can take all n cards, and the number of cards each player gets is the same.

Determine whether Petya and Vasya can choose integer numbers before the game so that the game is fair. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) — number of cards. It is guaranteed that n is an even number.

The following n lines contain a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (one integer per line, 1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100) — numbers written on the n cards.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible for Petya and Vasya to choose numbers in such a way that the game will be fair, print "NO" (without quotes) in the first line. In this case you should not print anything more.

In the other case print "YES" (without quotes) in the first line. In the second line print two distinct integers — number that Petya should choose and the number that Vasya should choose to make the game fair. If there are several solutions, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
4
11
27
27
11

Output
YES
11 27

Input
2
6
6

Output
NO

Input
6
10
20
30
20
10
20

Output
NO

Input
6
1
1
2
2
3
3

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example the game will be fair if, for example, Petya chooses number 11, and Vasya chooses number 27. Then the will take all cards — Petya will take cards 1 and 4, and Vasya will take cards 2 and 3. Thus, each of them will take exactly two cards.

In the second example fair game is impossible because the numbers written on the cards are equal, but the numbers that Petya and Vasya should choose should be distinct.

In the third example it is impossible to take all cards. Petya and Vasya can take at most five cards — for example, Petya can choose number 10 and Vasya can choose number 20. But for the game to be fair it is necessary to take 6 cards.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = []
    for i in range(n):
        a.append(int(input()))
    d = {}
    for i in a:
        if i in d:
            d[i] += 1
        else:
            d[i] = 1
    c = 0
    (a1, a2) = (-1, -1)
    for i in d:
        if d[i] == n // 2:
            if c == 0:
                a1 = i
                c += 1
            else:
                a2 = i
                break
    if a1 != -1 and a2 != -1:
        print('YES')
        print(a1, a2)
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program attempts to determine if Petya and Vasya can play a fair game based on the integers on the cards. However, the program fails to correctly handle all potential cases as described. 

For example, consider the input:

```
4
1
1
2
2
```

In this scenario, the numbers on the cards are not distinct, but the program outputs "YES" and returns the integers 1 and 2. This is incorrect because although each player could choose a number, Petya would take two cards with the number 1 and Vasya would take two cards with the number 2, resulting in a fair division of cards. However, it does not account for the fact that the numbers chosen should be distinct and should allow for a total of `n` cards to be taken.

Another problematic case is:

```
4
3
3
3
3
```

Here, there are only one unique number on the cards, and the code will also incorrectly return "NO" when it should, in fact, be collected in a definitive check whether two distinct numbers exist. 

Instead of only checking for pairs of cards with exactly `n/2` occurrences, the program needs to ensure there are exactly two distinct numbers on the cards in order to print "YES" along with those numbers. 

Thus, since the program does not handle cases correctly and produces incorrect outputs for valid inputs, it fails to meet the problem's requirements.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an even integer in the range 2 to 100, and the input consists of n integers each in the range 1 to 100 representing the numbers on the cards.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = []
    for i in range(n):
        a.append(int(input()))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an even integer in the range 2 to 100, `i` is `n-1`, `a` is a list containing `n` integers from input.
    d = {}
    for i in a:
        if i in d:
            d[i] += 1
        else:
            d[i] = 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an even integer in the range 2 to 100, `d` is a dictionary that contains the count of each unique integer from the list `a`, and `a` is a list containing `n` integers.
    c = 0
    a1, a2 = -1, -1
    for i in d:
        if d[i] == n // 2:
            if c == 0:
                a1 = i
                c += 1
            else:
                a2 = i
                break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an even integer in the range 2 to 100, `d` contains all unique integers from the list `a`, `c` indicates the number of integers in `d` that have a count equal to `n // 2` (0, 1, or 2), `a1` is the first key in `d` for which the count equals `n // 2` (or remains -1 if none), `a2` is the second key in `d` for which the count equals `n // 2` (or remains -1 if fewer than two exist). If `c` is 0, then neither `a1` nor `a2` is set to any key in `d`; if `c` is 1, then `a1` has a value from `d` while `a2` remains -1; if `c` is 2, then both `a1` and `a2` contain keys from `d`.
    if (a1 != -1 and a2 != -1) :
        print('YES')
        print(a1, a2)
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an even integer in the range 2 to 100. If both `a1` and `a2` are not -1, the values of `a1` and `a2` have been printed. Otherwise, if either `a1` or `a2` is -1 (or both), 'NO' has been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an even integer `n` (ranging from 2 to 100) which indicates the number of card values to be read. It then reads `n` integers (each in the range from 1 to 100), counts the occurrences of each unique integer, and looks for exactly two distinct numbers that appear `n // 2` times. If such two numbers are found, it prints 'YES' followed by the two numbers. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. If fewer than two numbers meet the requirement, the function does not return or display any information about those numbers.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
