You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Petya and Vasya decided to play a game. They have n cards (n is an even number). A single integer is written on each card.

Before the game Petya will choose an integer and after that Vasya will choose another integer (different from the number that Petya chose). During the game each player takes all the cards with number he chose. For example, if Petya chose number 5 before the game he will take all cards on which 5 is written and if Vasya chose number 10 before the game he will take all cards on which 10 is written.

The game is considered fair if Petya and Vasya can take all n cards, and the number of cards each player gets is the same.

Determine whether Petya and Vasya can choose integer numbers before the game so that the game is fair. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) — number of cards. It is guaranteed that n is an even number.

The following n lines contain a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (one integer per line, 1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100) — numbers written on the n cards.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible for Petya and Vasya to choose numbers in such a way that the game will be fair, print "NO" (without quotes) in the first line. In this case you should not print anything more.

In the other case print "YES" (without quotes) in the first line. In the second line print two distinct integers — number that Petya should choose and the number that Vasya should choose to make the game fair. If there are several solutions, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
4
11
27
27
11

Output
YES
11 27

Input
2
6
6

Output
NO

Input

10
20
30

10
20

Output
NO

Input

1
2
2
3
3

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example the game will be fair if, for example, Petya chooses number 11, and Vasya chooses number 27. Then the will take all cards — Petya will take cards 1 and 4, and Vasya will take cards 2 and 3. Thus, each of them will take exactly two cards.

In the second example fair game is impossible because the numbers written on the cards are equal, but the numbers that Petya and Vasya should choose should be distinct.

In the third example it is impossible to take all cards. Petya and Vasya can take at most five cards — for example, Petya can choose number 10 and Vasya can choose number 20. But for the game to be fair it is necessary to take 6 cards.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = []
    for i in range(n):
        a.append(int(input()))
    d = {}
    for i in a:
        if i in d:
            d[i] += 1
        else:
            d[i] = 1
    c = 0
    (a1, a2) = (-1, -1)
    for i in d:
        if d[i] == n // 2:
            if c == 0:
                a1 = i
                c += 1
            else:
                a2 = i
                break
    if a1 != -1 and a2 != -1:
        print('YES')
        print(a1, a2)
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the program and the potential edge cases it may not handle properly.

### Problem Analysis
The game is considered fair if:
1. Both Petya and Vasya select two distinct integers.
2. The total card count for both integers must equal `n` (the total number of cards).

### Program Analysis
The program reads `n` integers and counts how many of each integer appear using a dictionary. It then attempts to find two distinct integers that each appear exactly `n // 2` times.

#### Potential Issues:
1. **Not handling cases where there are not enough distinct numbers**: The program currently checks only for two distinct integers that have exactly `n // 2` appearances. If there are other numbers that appear less than `n // 2` times but still contribute to making a total of `n`, these options are missed. For example:
    - For input `6, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3`, it returns "NO", but it could have found two distinct integers 1 and 2 that have enough total cards to give 3 for each.
    
2. **Failure when there are fewer than two distinct integers**: If there's only one distinct integer (like in the `2, 6, 6` example), the program correctly outputs "NO", but we also need to ensure it checks for other distributions with valid counts.

### Example Case Illustrating the Failure:
Consider the case:
```
6
1
1
2
2
2
2
```
In this case:
- Integer `1` appears 2 times and integer `2` appears 4 times.
- The program would output "NO" because it looks for two integers with exactly `3` appearances, but they can also choose `1` and `2`, making the game fair (each can take 3 cards).

### Conclusion
The program fails to account for valid distributions that could allow the game to be fair, where the counts of cards sum to `n`, rather than strictly requiring each integer to appear precisely `n // 2` times.

Thus, given that the program does not cover all situations as described, it is deemed incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts an even integer `n` (ranging from 2 to 100) which indicates the number of card values to be read. It then reads `n` integers (each in the range from 1 to 100), counts the occurrences of each unique integer, and looks for exactly two distinct numbers that appear `n // 2` times. If such two numbers are found, it prints 'YES' followed by the two numbers. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. If fewer than two numbers meet the requirement, the function does not return or display any information about those numbers. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
