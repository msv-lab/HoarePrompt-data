To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program in relation to the described problem, we need to analyze the program's functionality and compare it with the requirements outlined in the problem description.

### Key Requirements from the Problem Description:
1. Petya and Vasya need to select two distinct integers such that:
   - They can take all `n` cards.
   - The number of cards each player receives is the same.

### Analysis of the Annotated Program:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `n`, followed by `n` integers representing the numbers on the cards, which is correct according to the requirements.

2. **Frequency Counting**:
   - The program uses a dictionary `d` to count how many times each number appears on the cards. This is a crucial step because the fairness of the game depends on how many times the chosen numbers appear.

3. **Determining Valid Choices**:
   - The program then looks for exactly two distinct numbers in the dictionary that appear `n / 2` times each. 
   - If it finds:
      - Two such numbers, it prints "YES" followed by those two numbers.
      - Fewer than two, it prints "NO". This corresponds to the requirement that both players must have distinct numbers and equal quantities of cards.

### Correctness Verification:
- The program correctly identifies when it is possible for Petya and Vasya to choose two distinct numbers that allow them to take all `n` cards and divide them evenly.
- The conditions checked (i.e., the frequency of the numbers being equal to `n / 2`) ensure that they can split the cards evenly.

### Conclusion:
The program covers all aspects of the problem description and does so effectively. It ensures fairness (equal division) while also validating that the chosen numbers are distinct and encompass all cards in play.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
