The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most immediate loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ind` is 0; `f` is True; `i` is 0; the character at index `i` of `s` is not '['; and the character at index `i` of `s` is ':' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
