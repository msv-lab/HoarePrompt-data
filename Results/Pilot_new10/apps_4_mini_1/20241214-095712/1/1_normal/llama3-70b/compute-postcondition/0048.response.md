Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length between 1 and 500,000; `n` is at least 1; `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of ':' or -1; `f` is either True or False; `i` is at least 1. If `s[i]` is equal to ':' and `f` is True, then `bind` is set equal to `i`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[i]` is not equal to ':', the program proceeds without changing the state of `bind`, `f`, `ind`, or any other variables.***
