Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length between 1 and 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ind` is -1 if `s[i]` is '[', otherwise `ind` is 0; `f` is True in both cases; `i` is 0. If `s[i]` is '[', then the character at index `i` is '[', while if `s[i]` is ':', execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
