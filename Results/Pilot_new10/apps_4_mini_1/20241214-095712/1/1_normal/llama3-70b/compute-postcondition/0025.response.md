The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or the most internal structure we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500,000, `n` is the length of `s`, `f` is True, `ind` is 2, `i` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
