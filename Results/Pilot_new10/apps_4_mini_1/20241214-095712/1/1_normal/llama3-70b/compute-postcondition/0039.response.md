The execution of the `break` statement will terminate the nearest enclosing loop. Therefore, while the values of the variables do not change, we indicate that we exit the loop or if statement in which we were executing the break.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 500,000; `n` is at least 1; `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of ':' or -1; `f` is True; `i` is at least 1; `bind` is equal to `i`; the character at index `i` in `s` is not ']', and the character at index `i` in `s` is ':' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
