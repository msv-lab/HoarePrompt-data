The operation `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. The initial values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the only change in the output state is the updated value of `ans`.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 500,000, `n` is the length of `s`, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of ':' following the first '[', `f` is True if at least one ']' was found in the string, `bind` is the index of the first ':' found after the last ']', `i` is `ind + 2`, `bind` must be greater than `ind + 2`, `ans` is increased by 1**.
