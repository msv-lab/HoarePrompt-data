Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length between 1 and 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of ':' following the first '[' in `s` and is not -1; `f` is True if at least one ']' was found in the string; `bind` is the index of the first ':' found after the last ']' and is not -1 if such ':' exists. If `ind` is greater than or equal to `bind`, the printed value is -1. Otherwise, `ans` is equal to 4 plus the number of '|' characters found in the substring `s[ind + 1:bind]` if the loop executes, and remains 4 if the loop does not execute; the value of `ans` has been printed.***
