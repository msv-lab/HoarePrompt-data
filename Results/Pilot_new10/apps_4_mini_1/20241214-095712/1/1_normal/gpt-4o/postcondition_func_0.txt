The function accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters along with the characters `[`, `]`, `:`, and `|`. It searches for the first occurrence of `[` and the last occurrence of `]` in the string. If either bracket is missing, or if the order is invalid (i.e., `[` appears after `]`), it prints `-1`. It then looks for the first `:` after the `[` and the last `:` before the `]`. If these colons are not found, or if the order is invalid, it again prints `-1`. If valid colons are found, it counts the number of `|` characters between these two colons and prints the result as `4 + pipe_count`. If no valid structure is found, it will print `-1`. The function does not handle unexpected characters and relies on the structure of `s` being specifically in line with its expectations.
