The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and specific characters, `n` is the length of `s` which is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `ind` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
