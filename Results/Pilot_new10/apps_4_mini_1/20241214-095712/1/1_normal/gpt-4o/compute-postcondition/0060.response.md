According to the code, the loop iterates while `i` is greater than or equal to `ind`. It will execute one more time if `i` remains greater than or equal to `ind` after the current iteration. The `range(bind - 1, ind, -1)` indicates that the loop starts from `bind - 1` and decrements `i` until it reaches `ind`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value that has been decremented from the previous value, so we need to adjust `i` for the current iteration. Assuming that the last value of `i` was such that `i` is equal to `ind`, at the end of the previous iteration, `s[i]` was checked, and if it is not equal to ':', then this would allow the loop to execute one more time with `i` equal to `ind - 1`.

We also need to check the values of `bind` and `ind` to ensure that the loop can still run. The `bind` must be greater than or equal to `ind` for the loop to execute.

State: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and specific characters, `bind` is greater than or equal to `ind`, `i` is `ind - 1`**
