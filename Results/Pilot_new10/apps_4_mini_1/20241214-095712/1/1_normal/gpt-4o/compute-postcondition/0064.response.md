Output State: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and specific characters, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[' in `s`, `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of ']' in `s' which is greater than `ind + 1`, `end_colon` is the index of the first occurrence of ':' after `ind` and before `bind`, which can be -1 if no colon exists; `i` will be less than or equal to `ind` but greater than or equal to `bind - 1` after all iterations. If `end_colon` is updated, it is set to the index of the colon, otherwise it remains -1. The loop will execute at least once only if there is at least one character ':' between `ind` and `bind`.**
