Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and specific characters, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[', `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of ']' which is greater than `ind + 1`, `end_colon` is the index of the first occurrence of ':' after `ind` and before `bind`, `start_colon` is the index of the first occurrence of ':' before `end_colon`, `start_colon` is less than `end_colon`, and `i` is `start_colon + 1 + 1`. If `s[i]` is '|', then `pipe_count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `pipe_count` remains unchanged.***
