The variable `end_colon` is assigned the value of `i`. Since `i` is defined as `bind - 1`, the value of `end_colon` will equal `bind - 1`. Thus, `end_colon` takes on a specific value based on the value of `bind`. The other variables retain their previous binding, while `end_colon` is established. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and specific characters, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[' in `s`, `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of ']' in `s` which is greater than `ind + 1`, `i` is `bind - 1`, `start_colon` is the index of the first occurrence of ':' after `ind` and before `bind`, which must exist, and `end_colon` is `bind - 1`. 

Output State: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and specific characters, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[' in `s`, `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of ']' in `s` which is greater than `ind + 1`, `i` is `bind - 1`, `start_colon` is the index of the first occurrence of ':' after `ind` and before `bind`, which must exist, and `end_colon` is `bind - 1`.**
