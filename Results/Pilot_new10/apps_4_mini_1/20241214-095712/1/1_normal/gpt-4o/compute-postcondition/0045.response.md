According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `bind`, and `ind`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `bind`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `ind + 2`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, which means `i` will become `ind + 3`. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, `bind` must be greater than `ind + 3`.

State: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and specific characters; `n` is greater than or equal to 0; `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[' in `s`; `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of ']' in `s' which is greater than `ind + 2`; `i` is `ind + 3`**
