The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and specific characters; `n` is greater than or equal to 0; `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[' in `s`; `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of ']' in `s' which is greater than `ind + 2`; `i` is `ind + 2`; `start_colon` is `ind + 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
