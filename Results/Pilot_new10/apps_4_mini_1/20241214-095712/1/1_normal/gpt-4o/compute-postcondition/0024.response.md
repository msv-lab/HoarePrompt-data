The value of `bind` is assigned the value of `i`. Since `i` is equal to `n - 2`, the new value of `bind` will also be `n - 2`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and specific characters, `n` must be greater than 1, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[', `bind` is equal to `n - 2`, and `i` is equal to `n - 2`.

Output State: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and specific characters, `n` must be greater than 1, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[', `bind` is equal to `n - 2`, `i` is equal to `n - 2**.
