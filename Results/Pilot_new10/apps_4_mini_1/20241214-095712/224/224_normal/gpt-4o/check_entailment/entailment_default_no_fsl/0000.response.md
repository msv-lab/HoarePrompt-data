Correctness: **False**

The provided program is intended to calculate the number of permutations \( p \) of integers \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \) such that \( f(p) \) is equal to \( f_{max}(n) \). However, the implementation appears to misinterpret the requirements of the problem.

1. The function `func_1(n - 1, MOD)` is called when \( n > 2 \), which computes the factorial of \( n-1 \). However, the maximum value \( f_{max}(n) \) and the conditions under which certain permutations yield certain values of \( f(p) \) are not considered correctly. 

2. Given the examples provided:
   - For \( n = 2 \), there is only one permutation, and it returns 1 which is correct.
   - For \( n = 3 \), the output returned is 4, which, based on the example provided, is also correct. But we have no indication that the computation is generalizable for \( n = 6 \) as correct.

3. The main issue arises when trying to derive the function \( f(p) \) and its statistical distribution among permutations. The program computes only a factorial and does not account for specific structures of permutations that yield the maximum.

4. For instance, for \( n = 4 \) or larger, the program might yield incorrect results because simply computing \( (n-1)! \) does not capture the distinct arrangements leading to a maximum number of different GCD values \( f(p) \).

In summary, since the provided implementation does not fully adhere to the problem's requirements and could yield incorrect outputs for different values of \( n \) (especially as it grows larger), the correctness of the program is indeed incomplete, leading to a conclusion of False.
