Final: **False**

The original assessment accurately points out the deficiencies in the program. While the program calculates the factorial of \( n - 1 \) correctly through the function `func_1`, it fails to address the primary requirement of the problem: counting the permutations that yield the maximum value of \( f(p) \). The logic for determining \( f_{max}(n) \) and counting the permutations that achieve this maximum is entirely absent in the implementation.

Output hints confirm that `func_1` only computes the factorial modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) and does not contribute to solving the problem as a whole. Thus, the assessment that the program's logic is incomplete and does not satisfy the given problem description is valid.

Therefore, the final assessment remains as stated: the program does not correctly implement the specifications of the problem, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
