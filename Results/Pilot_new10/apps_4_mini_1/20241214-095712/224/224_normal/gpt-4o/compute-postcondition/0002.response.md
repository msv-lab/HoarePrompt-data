The code `result = result * i % mod` updates the value of `result`. The previous value of `result` is 1 and the value of `i` is 2. The computation for `result` will be as follows:

- Previous value of `result` = 1
- Value of `i` = 2
- Value of `mod` = 10^9 + 7

Calculating the new value of `result`:
```
result = (1 * 2) % (10^9 + 7) = 2
```

The states of the other variables `n` and `mod` remain unchanged. Thus, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6; `mod` is equal to 10^9 + 7; `result` is 2; `i` is 2**
