According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the limit set by `n`. In this case, the loop iterates starting from 2 up to and including `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, which means we are currently about to execute the body of the loop for the first time.

After the first iteration, the `i` variable will be incremented. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than or equal to `n`. Since `i` starts at 2, it will be incremented to 3 for the next iteration.

For the loop to execute again, `n` should be at least 3, because `i` will be 3 after the increment.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^6; `mod` is equal to 10^9 + 7; `result` is 2; `i` is 3**
