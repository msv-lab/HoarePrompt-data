According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is greater than 0. The `for j in range(f_max_n, 0, -1)` means that `j` starts from `f_max_n` and decreases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 1. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` would have been 1 when the loop executed for the last time (since `j` progresses from `f_max_n` down to 1). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `f_max_n` must be at least 1 which is already satisfied as per the given state.

So, after the current iteration, `j` will decrement from 1 to 0, meaning the loop will finish its execution. The next time the loop could execute (if it were to start again) would be when `j` is still initialized at `f_max_n`, which has not been modified.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6; `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `MOD` is 1000000007; `dp[0]` is 1; `dp[1]` is 1; `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]`, and after modulo, `dp[j]` is equal to `(dp[j] + dp[j - 1]) % MOD; j is 0**
