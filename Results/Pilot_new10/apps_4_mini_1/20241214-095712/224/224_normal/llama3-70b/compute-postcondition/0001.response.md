The code initializes a list `dp` with a length of `f_max_n + 1`, where all elements are set to 0. The initial state of the variables remains unchanged, but the value of `dp` is now defined as a list of zeros with a length equal to `f_max_n + 1`. Since `f_max_n` is a non-negative integer such that `f_max_n <= n`, the length of the `dp` array will be at least 1 and at most `n + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `f_max_n` is a non-negative integer such that f_max_n <= n, `MOD` is 1000000007, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `f_max_n + 1`.**
