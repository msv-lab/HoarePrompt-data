The variable `dp` is a list of zeros with length `f_max_n + 1`. The line `dp[0] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the first element of the list `dp`. 

Since `dp[0]` is changed from `0` to `1`, the other elements of the list remain `0`.

Thus, the output state will reflect the updated value of `dp[0]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `f_max_n` is a non-negative integer such that f_max_n <= n, `MOD` is 1000000007, `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is 1 and `dp[1]` to `dp[f_max_n]` are all 0.**
