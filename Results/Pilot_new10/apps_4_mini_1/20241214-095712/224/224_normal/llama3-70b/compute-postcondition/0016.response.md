The code `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]` updates the value of `dp[j]` by adding the value of `dp[j - 1]` to it. The variable `j` is initially set to `f_max_n`. Given that `dp[0]` is 1 and `dp[1]` is also 1, the state of `dp` will change based on the values contained within it.

The output will reflect that `dp[j]` has increased by the value of `dp[j - 1]`, meaning the specific values of these indices are updated.

The precondition state about `n`, `f_max_n`, `MOD`, as well as `dp[0]` and `dp[1]` remain valid. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6; `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `MOD` is 1000000007; `dp[0]` is 1; `dp[1]` is 1; `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j]` + `dp[j - 1]` where `j` is `f_max_n`.**
