The code `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]` impacts the `dp` list at the index `j`. Given that `j` is `f_max_n - 1`, we are updating the value of `dp[f_max_n - 1]` by adding `dp[f_max_n - 2]` to it.

From the initial state, we know:
- `dp[0]` is 1
- `dp[1]` to `dp[f_max_n]` are all 0
- Thus, `dp[j]` where `j` is `f_max_n - 1` is currently 0, and `dp[j - 1]` which is `dp[f_max_n - 2]` is also 0 (since all `dp` values from 1 to `f_max_n` are 0).

When the operation is performed:
- `dp[j]` (i.e., `dp[f_max_n - 1]`) becomes `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]`, which is `0 + 0 = 0`.

No variables change their values other than `dp[j]`.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as before, reflecting that:
- `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6
- `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1
- `MOD` is 1000000007
- `dp[0]` is 1
- `dp[1]` to `dp[f_max_n]` are all 0
- `i` is 1
- `j` is `f_max_n - 1`
- `dp[j]` remains 0 (as it was before)

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[1]` to `dp[f_max_n]` are all 0, `i` is 1, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[j]` remains 0.**
