According to the code, the for loop will execute if the variable `f_max_n` is greater than 0. The current states indicate that `f_max_n` must be at least 1 for the loop to be valid since the loop is iterating from `f_max_n` down to 1. The loop can execute under these conditions, so no additional adjustments are necessary to `n`, `MOD`, or `dp` in context of directly affecting the loop execution. However, at the start of the loop, `j` must reflect the current value it is initialized with during the first iteration, which is `f_max_n` at this point.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` to `dp[f_max_n]` will contain the cumulative sums based on the dynamic programming relation, `i` is 2, `j` is `f_max_n`**
