Initial State: `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^6, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[1]` retains its initial value, `dp[f_max_n]` is updated to `dp[f_max_n] + dp[f_max_n - 1] % MOD`, `i` is `n + 1`, and `j` is `f_max_n - 1`

```
dp[j] += dp[j - 1]
```

Now, please think step by step: The line of code `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]` updates the value of `dp[j]` by adding the value of `dp[j - 1]` to it. The previous values of `dp[j]` is not specified, but regardless, the execution modifies `dp[j]`. The values of other variables such as `n`, `f_max_n`, `MOD`, `i`, and `dp[0]`, `dp[1]` remain unchanged, while `dp[j]` will now reflect the new sum.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^6, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[1]` retains its initial value, `dp[f_max_n]` is updated to `dp[f_max_n] + dp[f_max_n - 1] % MOD`, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`, and `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]`.**
