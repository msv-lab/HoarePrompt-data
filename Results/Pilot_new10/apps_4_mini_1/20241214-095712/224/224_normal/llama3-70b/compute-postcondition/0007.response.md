According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j`, which takes values starting from `f_max_n` and reduces to 1. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `f_max_n`, and the loop is about to decrement `j` by 1 for the next iteration. 

Since `j` starts at `f_max_n` and decrementing `j` will lead to `j` being `f_max_n - 1`, the new state for the next iteration requires that `j` is now set to `f_max_n - 1`. The state of other variables, including `n`, `f_max_n`, `MOD`, and `dp`, remains unchanged as they do not depend directly on this iteration of the loop.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is 1 and `dp[1]` to `dp[f_max_n]` are all 0, `i` is 1, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`, and `dp[j]` remains 0**
