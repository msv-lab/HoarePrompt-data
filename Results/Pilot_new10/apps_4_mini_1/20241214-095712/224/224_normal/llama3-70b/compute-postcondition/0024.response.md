To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we analyze the loop operation closely. The loop iterates `f_max_n` times in reverse from `f_max_n` down to 1, updating the `dp` array using the previously defined values.

Every iteration of the loop modifies `dp[j]` using the formula:
```python
dp[j] += dp[j - 1]
dp[j] %= MOD
```

The key points are:
- The loop modifies each `dp[j]` for `j` from `f_max_n` down to 1.
- After all iterations, `dp[j]` for any `j` will contain the cumulative sum of values from the original `dp` values based on previous values in the array.

Now, we summarize the values after all iterations:
- `n` remains a positive integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^6 \).
- `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1; thus, the loop will always execute at least once when `f_max_n` is at least 1.
- `MOD` is 1000000007, applied to all updates of `dp[j]`.
- The values `dp[0]` and `dp[1]` remain as they are: `dp[0]` is 1 and `dp[1]` is also unchanged relative to its initial setup.
- The rest of the `dp` array (`dp[2]` to `dp[f_max_n]`) accumulates values based on the updates from previous indices, effectively capturing combinations based on prior computed states in the dynamic programming relation.

Final output state:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6; `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `MOD` is 1000000007; `dp[0]` is 1; `dp[1]` retains its value from initial state; `dp[j]` for `j` from `2` to `f_max_n` contains the cumulative sums based on prior `dp` values updated in accordance with the loop.**
