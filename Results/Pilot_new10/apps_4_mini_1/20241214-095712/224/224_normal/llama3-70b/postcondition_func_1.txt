The function accepts an integer `n`, where `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and returns the maximum value obtained from calling another function `func_1` with parameters `res` (which starts at 0) and each integer from 1 to `n`. The function does not handle cases where `func_1` might behave unexpectedly or return non-integer values, potentially affecting the comparison and assignment to `res`.
