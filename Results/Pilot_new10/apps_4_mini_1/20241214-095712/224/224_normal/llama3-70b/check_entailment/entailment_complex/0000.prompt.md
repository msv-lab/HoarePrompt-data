You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Let's define a function $f(p)$ on a permutation $p$ as follows. Let $g_i$ be the greatest common divisor (GCD) of elements $p_1$, $p_2$, ..., $p_i$ (in other words, it is the GCD of the prefix of length $i$). Then $f(p)$ is the number of distinct elements among $g_1$, $g_2$, ..., $g_n$.

Let $f_{max}(n)$ be the maximum value of $f(p)$ among all permutations $p$ of integers $1$, $2$, ..., $n$.

Given an integers $n$, count the number of permutations $p$ of integers $1$, $2$, ..., $n$, such that $f(p)$ is equal to $f_{max}(n)$. Since the answer may be large, print the remainder of its division by $1000\,000\,007 = 10^9 + 7$.


-----Input-----

The only line contains the integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^6$) — the length of the permutations.


-----Output-----

The only line should contain your answer modulo $10^9+7$.

-----Note-----

Consider the second example: these are the permutations of length $3$:  $[1,2,3]$, $f(p)=1$.  $[1,3,2]$, $f(p)=1$.  $[2,1,3]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[2,3,1]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[3,1,2]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[3,2,1]$, $f(p)=2$. 

The maximum value $f_{max}(3) = 2$, and there are $4$ permutations $p$ such that $f(p)=2$.
Annotated Functions:
n = int(input())
f_max_n = func_2(n)
print(func_3(n, f_max_n))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`, `b` is 0.
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`, where `b` is 0, which means the GCD is `a` itself.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. If `b` is 0, it returns `a` itself. If both `a` and `b` are 0, the function will enter an infinite loop, as the while condition will not be satisfied, resulting in indefinite execution. The function effectively uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the GCD.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than or equal to 2.
def func_2(n):
    res = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        res = max(res, func_1(res, i))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `res` is equal to the maximum value obtained from calling `func_1` for each integer from 1 to `n`, `i` is `n`, and `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2.
    return res
    #The program returns res, which is the maximum value obtained from calling func_1 for each integer from 1 to n, where n is an integer greater than or equal to 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n`, where `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and returns the maximum value obtained from calling another function `func_1` with parameters `res` (which starts at 0) and each integer from 1 to `n`. The function does not handle cases where `func_1` might behave unexpectedly or return non-integer values, potentially affecting the comparison and assignment to `res`.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, and f_max_n is a non-negative integer such that f_max_n <= n.
def func_3(n, f_max_n):
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
    dp = [0] * (f_max_n + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(f_max_n, 0, -1):
            dp[j] += dp[j - 1]
            dp[j] %= MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6; `f_max_n` is a non-negative integer such that f_max_n >= 1; `MOD` is 1000000007; `dp[0]` is 1; `dp[1]` is `n`; for `j` from `2` to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` contains the cumulative sums based on the dynamic programming relation.
    return dp[f_max_n]
    #The program returns the cumulative sum at index f_max_n in the dp array, which is computed based on the dynamic programming relation and contains the cumulative sums with initial values dp[0] = 1 and dp[1] = n for positive integer n such that 2 <= n <= 10^6.
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where 2 <= n <= 10^6) and a non-negative integer `f_max_n` (where f_max_n >= 1). It computes cumulative sums based on a dynamic programming approach and returns the cumulative sum at index `f_max_n` in the `dp` array. The initial condition guarantees that `dp[0]` is 1 and `dp[1]` is initialized to `n`. This allows the function to compute values of `dp[j]` based on previous calculations, providing the result for various values of `f_max_n` as required. The code does not handle cases where `f_max_n` is 0, as it should yield 1 based on the initialization of `dp`.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
