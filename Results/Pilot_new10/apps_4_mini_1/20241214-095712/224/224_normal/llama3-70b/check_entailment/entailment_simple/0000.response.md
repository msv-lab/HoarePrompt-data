To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

1. **Understanding `f(p)` and `f_max(n)`**:
   - `f(p)` counts the number of distinct GCD values of the prefixes of a permutation `p` of integers from 1 to `n`.
   - `f_max(n)` is the maximum value of `f(p)` among all permutations of integers from 1 to `n`.

2. **Analyzing the Functions**:

   - **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
     - This function computes the GCD of `a` and `b`. This part is necessary for calculating `f(p)` as we need to know the GCD of prefixes.

   - **Function `func_2(n)`**:
     - This function iterates through each integer `i` from 1 to `n`, calling `func_1` to compute the GCD of `res` (initialized to 0) and each `i`.
     - This results in `res` being the maximum GCD value from the calculations, which does not relate directly to counting permutations or distinct GCD values of prefixes but rather just tracks the maximum value of GCD from numbers 1 to `n`.
     - However, `res` should represent the maximum distinct values, but it merely gives the maximum GCD which is not the same as counting distinct GCDs across the permutations.

   - **Function `func_3(n, f_max_n)`**:
     - This function uses a dynamic programming approach to compute the result based on the maximum number of distinct prefixes GCDs. However, the logic in updating the `dp` array does not correctly implement counting the ways to arrange numbers to ensure `f(p) = f_max(n)`.
     - It tries to build combinations, but without properly defining the valid arrangements based on the distinct GCDs counted from the permutations.

3. **Logical Flow**:
   - The main issue is that `func_2` does not correctly compute the distinct GCD values necessary to fully implement the problem description. It only computes the maximum GCD, not the number of distinct GCDs from any permutation.
   - Additionally, `func_3` uses a logic that is not aligned with the required counting of permutations where `f(p) = f_max(n)`, making it incorrect.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The logic of determining the maximum GCD does not equate to the maximum number of distinct GCD values across permutations. The program fails to do what the problem description specifies regarding both calculating `f_max(n)` and counting the permutations where `f(p) = f_max(n)`.

Given these analyses, the program does not satisfy the requirements of the problem description and thus is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
