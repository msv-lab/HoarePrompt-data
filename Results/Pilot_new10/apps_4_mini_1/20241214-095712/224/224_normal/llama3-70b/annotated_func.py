#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`, `b` is 0.
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`, where `b` is 0, which means the GCD is `a` itself.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. If `b` is 0, it returns `a` itself. If both `a` and `b` are 0, the function will enter an infinite loop, as the while condition will not be satisfied, resulting in indefinite execution. The function effectively uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the GCD.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than or equal to 2.
def func_2(n):
    res = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        res = max(res, func_1(res, i))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `res` is equal to the maximum value obtained from calling `func_1` for each integer from 1 to `n`, `i` is `n`, and `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2.
    return res
    #The program returns res, which is the maximum value obtained from calling func_1 for each integer from 1 to n, where n is an integer greater than or equal to 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n`, where `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and returns the maximum value obtained from calling another function `func_1` with parameters `res` (which starts at 0) and each integer from 1 to `n`. The function does not handle cases where `func_1` might behave unexpectedly or return non-integer values, potentially affecting the comparison and assignment to `res`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, and f_max_n is a non-negative integer such that f_max_n <= n.
def func_3(n, f_max_n):
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
    dp = [0] * (f_max_n + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(f_max_n, 0, -1):
            dp[j] += dp[j - 1]
            dp[j] %= MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6; `f_max_n` is a non-negative integer such that f_max_n >= 1; `MOD` is 1000000007; `dp[0]` is 1; `dp[1]` is `n`; for `j` from `2` to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` contains the cumulative sums based on the dynamic programming relation.
    return dp[f_max_n]
    #The program returns the cumulative sum at index f_max_n in the dp array, which is computed based on the dynamic programming relation and contains the cumulative sums with initial values dp[0] = 1 and dp[1] = n for positive integer n such that 2 <= n <= 10^6.
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where 2 <= n <= 10^6) and a non-negative integer `f_max_n` (where f_max_n >= 1). It computes cumulative sums based on a dynamic programming approach and returns the cumulative sum at index `f_max_n` in the `dp` array. The initial condition guarantees that `dp[0]` is 1 and `dp[1]` is initialized to `n`. This allows the function to compute values of `dp[j]` based on previous calculations, providing the result for various values of `f_max_n` as required. The code does not handle cases where `f_max_n` is 0, as it should yield 1 based on the initialization of `dp`.
