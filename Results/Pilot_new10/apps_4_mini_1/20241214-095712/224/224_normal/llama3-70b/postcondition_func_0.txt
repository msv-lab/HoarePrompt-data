The function accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. If `b` is 0, it returns `a` itself. If both `a` and `b` are 0, the function will enter an infinite loop, as the while condition will not be satisfied, resulting in indefinite execution. The function effectively uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the GCD.
