Correctness: **False**.

The program fails to consider the case when the number of friends `k` is greater than or equal to the number of colors in the balloons. In that case, even if a color appears multiple times, Kefa can still distribute them without upsetting his friends. For example, if `n = 4` (the number of balloons) and `k = 4` (the number of friends) with balloons arranged as `aaaa`, the output should be `YES` since each friend can get one balloon, but the program would incorrectly determine that there is a problem due to its logic only checking if the maximum count of any single color is less than or equal to `k`. 

Thus, the program does not handle this edge case correctly.
