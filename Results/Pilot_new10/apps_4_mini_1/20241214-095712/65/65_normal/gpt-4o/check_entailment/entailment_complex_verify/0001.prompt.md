You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One day Kefa found n baloons. For convenience, we denote color of i-th baloon as s_{i} — lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet. Also Kefa has k friends. Friend will be upset, If he get two baloons of the same color. Kefa want to give out all baloons to his friends. Help Kefa to find out, can he give out all his baloons, such that no one of his friens will be upset — print «YES», if he can, and «NO», otherwise. Note, that Kefa's friend will not upset, if he doesn't get baloons at all.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 100) — the number of baloons and friends.

Next line contains string s — colors of baloons.


-----Output-----

Answer to the task — «YES» or «NO» in a single line.

You can choose the case (lower or upper) for each letter arbitrary.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2
aabb

Output
YES

Input
6 3
aacaab

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first sample Kefa can give 1-st and 3-rd baloon to the first friend, and 2-nd and 4-th to the second.

In the second sample Kefa needs to give to all his friends baloons of color a, but one baloon will stay, thats why answer is «NO».
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    color_count = {}
    for color in s:
        if color in color_count:
            color_count[color] += 1
        else:
            color_count[color] = 1
    can_distribute = True
    for count in color_count.values():
        if count > k:
            can_distribute = False
            break
    if can_distribute:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to evaluate if it correctly handles all potential cases for distributing balloons to Kefa's friends without upsetting them.

1. **Understanding the Logic:**
   - The program takes input for the number of balloons (`n`) and the number of friends (`k`).
   - It then counts the occurrences of each color of balloons.
   - The program checks if any color appears more times than the number of friends (`k`).
   - If a color appears more than `k` times, he cannot give them out without upsetting at least one friend, and it prints "NO".
   - If all colors appear `k` times or less, it prints "YES".

2. **Edge Case Analysis:**
   - Consider `n = 1` and `k = 1`. If we have one balloon of color 'a', the output "YES" is expected since one balloon can go to one friend.
   - Consider `n = 2` and `k = 1`. If we have two balloons of color 'a', the output should be "NO", as both balloons cannot go to the one friend without upsetting them.
   - If `n > k` but all colors are unique, say `n = 100`, `k = 10` with the input string "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz... (repeated)", the output correctly should be "NO" as some colors would exceed the distribution capacity per friend.

3. **Critical Missing Logic:**
   - The program does not check if the total number of unique colors exceeds the number of friends. For example:
     - If there are 10 unique colors and 9 friends, the output should be "YES" because each friend can get one balloon of different color.
     - If there are 10 unique colors and only 1 friend, the program will incorrectly output "NO" even though the distribution is possible (allcolors to one friend).

**Test Cases:**
- Input `n = 10, k = 5, s = "abcdefghij"`. 
- Correct output should be "YES" since each friend can take two different ones.

Thus, since the program fails to account for situations with unique colors surpassing the number of friends and can lead to incorrect conclusions about the possibility of distribution, it demonstrates that the program is indeed flawed.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of baloons (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), k is an integer representing the number of friends (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), and s is a string of lowercase letters representing the colors of the baloons with a length of n.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    color_count = {}
    for color in s:
        if color in color_count:
            color_count[color] += 1
        else:
            color_count[color] = 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer representing the number of balloons, `k` is an integer representing the number of friends, `s` is a string of length at most `n` where each character represents the color of a balloon, `color_count` is a dictionary with unique colors from string `s` as keys and their corresponding counts as values. If `s` is an empty string, then `color_count` remains an empty dictionary.
    can_distribute = True
    for count in color_count.values():
        if count > k:
            can_distribute = False
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a string of length at most `n`, `color_count` can contain zero or more entries, `can_distribute` is False if any value in `color_count` is greater than `k`, otherwise `can_distribute` remains True.
    if can_distribute :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` and `k` are integers, `s` is a string of length at most `n`, and `color_count` can contain zero or more entries. If `can_distribute` is True, the output is 'YES'. Otherwise, if `can_distribute` is False, the output is 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), and a string `s` of lowercase letters representing the colors of `n` balloons. It counts the occurrences of each color in `s` and checks whether it is possible to evenly distribute the balloons among `k` friends, given that no friend should receive more balloons of the same color than available. The function prints 'YES' if distribution is possible and 'NO' otherwise. It assumes that no input validation is performed on the values of `n` and `k`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
