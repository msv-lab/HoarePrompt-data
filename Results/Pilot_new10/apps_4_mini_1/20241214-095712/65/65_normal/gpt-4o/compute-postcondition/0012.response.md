Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer representing the number of balloons, `k` is an integer representing the number of friends, `s` is a string with at least 1 character, `color` is the second character of `s`. If `color` exists in `color_count`, then `color_count[color]` is updated to its previous value + 1. If `color` does not exist in `color_count`, then `color_count` is updated with `color` as a key, and its value is set to 1.***
