The function accepts two integer inputs, `n` (the number of balloons) and `k` (the number of friends), followed by a string `s` representing the colors of the balloons. It counts the occurrences of each color and determines the maximum count of any single color. If this maximum count is less than or equal to the number of friends `k`, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return a value; it only outputs the result directly.
