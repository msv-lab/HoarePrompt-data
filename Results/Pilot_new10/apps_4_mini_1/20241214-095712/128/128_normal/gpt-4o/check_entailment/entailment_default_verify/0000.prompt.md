You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Summer holidays! Someone is going on trips, someone is visiting grandparents, but someone is trying to get a part-time job. This summer Noora decided that she wants to earn some money, and took a job in a shop as an assistant.

Shop, where Noora is working, has a plan on the following n days. For each day sales manager knows exactly, that in i-th day k_{i} products will be put up for sale and exactly l_{i} clients will come to the shop that day. Also, the manager is sure, that everyone, who comes to the shop, buys exactly one product or, if there aren't any left, leaves the shop without buying anything. Moreover, due to the short shelf-life of the products, manager established the following rule: if some part of the products left on the shelves at the end of the day, that products aren't kept on the next day and are sent to the dump.

For advertising purposes manager offered to start a sell-out in the shop. He asked Noora to choose any f days from n next for sell-outs. On each of f chosen days the number of products were put up for sale would be doubled. Thus, if on i-th day shop planned to put up for sale k_{i} products and Noora has chosen this day for sell-out, shelves of the shop would keep 2·k_{i} products. Consequently, there is an opportunity to sell two times more products on days of sell-out.

Noora's task is to choose f days to maximize total number of sold products. She asks you to help her with such a difficult problem.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and f (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ f ≤ n) denoting the number of days in shop's plan and the number of days that Noora has to choose for sell-out.

Each line of the following n subsequent lines contains two integers k_{i}, l_{i} (0 ≤ k_{i}, l_{i} ≤ 10^9) denoting the number of products on the shelves of the shop on the i-th day and the number of clients that will come to the shop on i-th day.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer denoting the maximal number of products that shop can sell.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2
2 1
3 5
2 3
1 5

Output
10
Input
4 1
0 2
0 3
3 5
0 6

Output
5


-----Note-----

In the first example we can choose days with numbers 2 and 4 for sell-out. In this case new numbers of products for sale would be equal to [2, 6, 2, 2] respectively. So on the first day shop will sell 1 product, on the second — 5, on the third — 2, on the fourth — 2. In total 1 + 5 + 2 + 2 = 10 product units.

In the second example it is possible to sell 5 products, if you choose third day for sell-out.
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
f = int(data[1])
days = [(int(data[2 + 2 * i]), int(data[3 + 2 * i])) for i in range(n)]
result = func_1(n, f, days)
print(result)

def func_1(n, f, days):
    regular_sales = []
    potential_sales_increase = []
    for (k, l) in days:
        regular_sales.append(min(k, l))
        potential_sales_increase.append(min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l))
    total_sales = sum(regular_sales)
    potential_sales_increase.sort(reverse=True)
    total_sales += sum(potential_sales_increase[:f])
    return total_sales


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to check if it properly implements the logic for maximizing sales given the constraints.

The program reads the number of days `n`, the number of selected sell-out days `f`, and for each day, the number of products `k_i` and clients `l_i`. The core of the logic is to determine how many products can be sold normally and the potential increase in sales if a sell-out is chosen on that day.

By analyzing the function `func_1`, we see the following steps:

1. **Normal Sales Calculation:** For each day, the actual sales are calculated as the minimum between `k_i` (products available) and `l_i` (clients arriving).
   
2. **Potential Sales Increase Calculation:** For each day, if it's chosen for a sell-out, the potential extra sales are calculated as the difference between the potential maximum sales (2 * k_i, capped at l_i) and the actual sales.

3. **Total Sales Calculation:** The total sales are computed by summing the normal sales and the largest f potential increases from selling out on the f days.

While this implementation seems correct superficially, we can find a critical edge case:

### Potential Edge Case:
- **Test with Zero Products and Clients:** Consider a scenario with no products (`k_i = 0`) and clients (`l_i = 0`):
  ```
  Input:
  1 1
  0 0
  ```
  - Expected output: `0` (no sales can occur)
  - The function, when called, would lead to `regular_sales = [0]` and `potential_sales_increase = [0]`. The total remains `0`, which is correct for this specific case.
  
- However, if we had multiple days with no products but clients:
  ```
  Input:
  2 1
  0 2
  0 3
  ```
  - The expected output is `0` (since clients can't buy anything), but the function calculates:
    - `regular_sales = [0, 0]`
    - `potential_sales_increase = [0, 0]`
    - Again, totals to `0`, which is still correct, but doesn't capture potential logic issues if additional complexity were involved.

### Core Logic Flaw:
Despite providing potentially correct answers with the analyzed inputs, we note that the initial `min(2 * k, l)` in `potential_sales_increase`, while functional, may not handle cases well if implementations were more complex or adjacent to sales maximums due to product constraints.

### Unhandled Complex Input Case:
Testing the implementation with various combinations of products and clients yields only zero sales if products aren't available. Thus, while we haven't found a direct failure to meet business logic as stipulated by the problem's constraints and expectations, the implementation lacks a nuanced approach that could handle more complicated scenarios around sell-out days efficiently.

With the above considerations in mind, where the functionality remains somewhat limited despite working examples, we assess:
Correctness: **True**.

The program passes basic tests, but might require deeper testing against edge cases in larger configurations of `k_i` and `l_i` versus choices of `f`. However, based on the scenarios tried, the logic adheres to the expectations.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of days, a non-negative integer `f` representing the number of days selected for potential sales increase, and a list of tuples `days` where each tuple contains two non-negative integers. It calculates the total sales by summing up the minimum of products available and clients for each day (regular sales) and adds the top `f` potential sales increases (calculated as the difference between the potential double sales and the regular sales) to the total. The function returns this total sales value. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
