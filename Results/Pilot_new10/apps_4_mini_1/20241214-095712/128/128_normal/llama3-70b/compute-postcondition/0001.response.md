The variable `days` is initialized as an empty list, but this does not affect the existing values of other variables like `n` and `f`, which remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `f` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ f ≤ n), and `days` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `f` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ f ≤ n), `days` is an empty list**.
