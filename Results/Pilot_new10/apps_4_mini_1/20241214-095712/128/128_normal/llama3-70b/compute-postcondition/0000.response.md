The code is setting the values for `n` and `f` based on user input, with `n` representing the number of days (a positive integer between 1 and 100,000) and `f` representing the number of days chosen for sell-out (a non-negative integer that can be equal to or less than `n`). The variables `k_i` and `l_i` remain unaffected during this code execution. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `f` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ f ≤ n); k_i and l_i remain non-negative integers (0 ≤ k_i, l_i ≤ 10^9) for each day i.**
