According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n`. The loop will run as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, thus `i` will become 1. 

Since `n` is a positive integer and must be greater than `i` for the loop to run again, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` is sorted in descending order, `_` is `n - 1`, `sold` is set to `0 + min(days[0][0] * 2, days[0][1])`, and `i` is 1**
