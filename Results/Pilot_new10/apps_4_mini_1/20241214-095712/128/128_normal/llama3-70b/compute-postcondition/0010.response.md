The code appends the tuple `(k, l)` to the list `days`. The previous values of `n`, `f`, `days`, and `_` remain unchanged, while `days` is updated to include the new tuple. Since `k` and `l` are input integers, their specific values are not known at this point. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` is the previous contents plus the tuple `(k, l)`, `_` is 2, `k` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer.**
