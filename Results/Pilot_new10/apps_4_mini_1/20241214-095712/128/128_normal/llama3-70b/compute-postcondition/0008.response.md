According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `n`, which indicates how many times the loop should run. The variable `_` is used to track the current iteration of the loop.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, indicating that the loop can execute again if `_` is less than `n`. Since `_` is currently 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented to 2. Thus, we also need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 to allow for another iteration.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:
- `_` becomes 2
- `n` must be greater than 1

Additionally, since `days` has been appended with a new tuple `(k, l)`, it retains its previous content along with the newly added tuple.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` is a list with the previous contents plus the tuple `(k, l)`, `_` is 2, `k` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer.**
