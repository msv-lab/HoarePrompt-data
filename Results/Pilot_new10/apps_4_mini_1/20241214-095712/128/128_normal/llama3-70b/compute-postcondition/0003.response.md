The variables `k` and `l` are assigned the values obtained from the input, where `input().split()` separates the input into two parts and `map(int, ...)` converts them into integers. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer**.
