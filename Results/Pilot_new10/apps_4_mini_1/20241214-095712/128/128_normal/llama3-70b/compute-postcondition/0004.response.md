The code appends a tuple `(k, l)` to the `days` list. The values of `k` and `l` are input integers, and since no condition is provided that modifies the values of other variables, they remain unchanged. The `days` list transitions from being empty to containing one element, which is the tuple `(k, l)`.

Therefore, the output state is: 
`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` is now a list containing the tuple `(k, l)`, `_` is 0, `k` is an input integer, and `l` is an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` is now a list containing the tuple `(k, l)`, `_` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer**.
