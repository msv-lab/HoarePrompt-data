Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` is sorted in descending order, `_` is `n - 1`, and `sold` is equal to the sum of the minimums based on the logic defined in the loop: for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`, if `i < f`, `sold` increments by `min(days[i][0] * 2, days[i][1])`; otherwise, it increments by `min(days[i][0], days[i][1])`.**
