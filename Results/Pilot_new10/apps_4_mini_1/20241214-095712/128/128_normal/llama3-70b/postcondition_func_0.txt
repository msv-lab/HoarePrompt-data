The function accepts input representing the number of days (`n`) and the number of days chosen for sell-out (`f`), as well as the number of products available (`k_i`) and the number of clients (`l_i`) for each day. It then calculates and prints the total number of products sold based on these inputs. For the first `f` days, it allows doubling the available products when calculating the sold amount, while for the remaining days, it uses the actual available products. It assumes valid input will be provided as specified, but it does not ensure any edge case handling for improper input values.
