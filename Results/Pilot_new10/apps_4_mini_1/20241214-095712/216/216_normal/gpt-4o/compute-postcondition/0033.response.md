The variable `max_count` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `current_count`. The previous state indicates `max_count` holds the maximum count of unique lowercase letters found in any segment of string `s`. The variable `current_count` reflects either 0 (if the last character was uppercase) or the number of unique lowercase letters in the final segment of `s` (if the last character was lowercase). 

Since no specific values for `max_count` and `current_count` were provided, we express the output state in terms of them.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `s` is the input string consisting of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters, `max_count` is the maximum of its previous value and `current_count`, `current_set` is empty, `current_count` is 0 or the number of unique lowercase letters in the final segment of `s.**
