Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `s` is a non-empty string consisting of characters. If `char` is a lowercase letter and not in `current_set`, then `current_set` includes all previously processed lowercase letters plus `char`, `current_count` becomes either 3 or 1, and `max_count` is either 0 or 1 while at least one character remains in `s`. If `char` is not a lowercase letter, then `current_set` is empty, `current_count` is 0, and `max_count` can be either 1 or 2, with at least one character still left in `s`.***
