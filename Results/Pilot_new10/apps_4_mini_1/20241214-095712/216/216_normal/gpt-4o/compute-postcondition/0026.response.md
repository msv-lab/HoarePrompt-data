The variable `current_count` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `current_count` can be either 2 or 0. After the increment, the possible new values of `current_count` will be 3 (if the initial value was 2) or 1 (if the initial value was 0). The states of the other variables are not affected, so the Output State will reflect these changes.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `s` is a non-empty string consisting of characters, `current_set` now includes all previously processed lowercase letters plus `char`, `current_count` is either 3 or 1, and `max_count` is either 0 or 1, and there is at least one character left in `s`.**
