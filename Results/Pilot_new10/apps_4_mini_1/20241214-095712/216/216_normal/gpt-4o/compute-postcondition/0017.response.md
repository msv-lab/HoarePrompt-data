`current_set` is modified by adding `char` to it. Since `char` is an element from the string `s`, it will now be included in `current_set`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `s` is a non-empty string consisting of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters, `char` is the next character in the string `s`, `current_set` includes `char` (and the previously included characters), `current_count` is 1, and `max_count` remains 0 when the loop executes again.
