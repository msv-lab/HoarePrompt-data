The variable `current_count` is assigned the value 0. The initial values of other variables (`n`, `s`, `max_count`, and `current_set`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged values while updating `current_count`.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `s` is an input string consisting only of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters, `max_count` is 0, `current_set` is an empty set, `current_count` is 0.**
