In the given code snippet, `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where the input is expected to be an integer. The variable `n` initially holds a positive integer value between 1 and 200, representing the length of the string `s`.

The impact of the code is that `n` will be updated based on what the user inputs. However, since we don't know the specific input provided, we can only say that `n` will be some new integer value determined by the user's input, still adhering to the constraint (1 ≤ n ≤ 200).

The variable `s` remains unaffected as there are no operations concerning it in the provided code.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `s` is a string consisting only of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters**
