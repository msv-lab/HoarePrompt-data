The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) and a string `s` consisting of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters. It calculates the maximum number of unique lowercase letters found in contiguous segments of the string `s` that are terminated by uppercase letters, and prints that maximum count. If the string consists entirely of uppercase letters, the output will be 0. If the string consists entirely of lowercase letters, the maximum count will equal the total number of unique lowercase letters in the string. The function does not handle invalid inputs, such as non-integer values for `n` or strings longer than `n`.
