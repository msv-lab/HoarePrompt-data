The variable `s` is assigned a new string value from the input. The length of `s` will now match the newly input value of `n`, which remains in the specified range of 1 to 200. The state of the variable `n` is still valid, indicating that it is an input integer within that range. The previous value of `s` will be replaced with the input value.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 200; `s` is a string consisting of only lowercase and uppercase Latin letters with a length equal to the new input value of `n`.**
