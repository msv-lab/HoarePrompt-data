The code snippet provided is a simple print statement that outputs a dash character (`-`). This operation does not affect or change any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output remains consistent with the precondition as none of the conditions or variable values are altered.

Output State: **`x` is equal to `min_upvotes`, `y` is an integer from the range 0 to 100, `z` is an integer from the range 0 to 100, `max_upvotes` is equal to `min_upvotes + z`, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`, current value of `max_upvotes` is less than `min_downvotes`, and '-' has been printed.**
