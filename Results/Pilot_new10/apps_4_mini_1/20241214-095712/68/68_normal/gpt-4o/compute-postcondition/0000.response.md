The variables `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned values based on the input given to `map(int, input().split())`, which processes three integers separated by spaces. Since the initial state indicates that `x`, `y`, and `z` can hold any integer values within the range from 0 to 100, the values of these variables will now reflect the input provided.

The output state will include the new integer values of `x`, `y`, and `z` that have been input, while ensuring that all other information about the conditions remains valid.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, `z` are integers equal to the three input integers from the range 0 to 100**.
