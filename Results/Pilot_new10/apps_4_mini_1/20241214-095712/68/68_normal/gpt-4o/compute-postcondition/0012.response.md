Postcondition: ***`x` is equal to `min_upvotes`, `y` is an integer from the range 0 to 100, `z` is an integer from the range 0 to 100, `max_upvotes` is equal to `min_upvotes + z`, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, and `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`. If `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes`, then `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes`, and '+' has been printed. Otherwise, `max_downvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_upvotes`.***
