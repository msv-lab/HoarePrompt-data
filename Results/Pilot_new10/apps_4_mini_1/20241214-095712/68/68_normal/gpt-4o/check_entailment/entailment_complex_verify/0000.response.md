Final: **True** 

The original assessment accurately evaluated the correctness of the program against the problem description. The logic in the program correctly determines the outcomes based on the comparisons of the minimum and maximum potential votes, appropriately handling all input scenarios as required by the problem statement. The annotated version of the code confirms that the state of the variables and the flow of the comparisons align with the expected outputs for all possible cases. Thus, the assessment that the implementation correctly adheres to the voting scenario logic holds true.
