You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Nauuo is a girl who loves writing comments.

One day, she posted a comment on Codeforces, wondering whether she would get upvotes or downvotes.

It's known that there were $x$ persons who would upvote, $y$ persons who would downvote, and there were also another $z$ persons who would vote, but you don't know whether they would upvote or downvote. Note that each of the $x+y+z$ people would vote exactly one time.

There are three different results: if there are more people upvote than downvote, the result will be "+"; if there are more people downvote than upvote, the result will be "-"; otherwise the result will be "0".

Because of the $z$ unknown persons, the result may be uncertain (i.e. there are more than one possible results). More formally, the result is uncertain if and only if there exist two different situations of how the $z$ persons vote, that the results are different in the two situations.

Tell Nauuo the result or report that the result is uncertain.


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers $x$, $y$, $z$ ($0\le x,y,z\le100$), corresponding to the number of persons who would upvote, downvote or unknown.


-----Output-----

If there is only one possible result, print the result : "+", "-" or "0".

Otherwise, print "?" to report that the result is uncertain.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 7 0

Output
-
Input
2 0 1

Output
+
Input
1 1 0

Output
0
Input
0 0 1

Output
?


-----Note-----

In the first example, Nauuo would definitely get three upvotes and seven downvotes, so the only possible result is "-".

In the second example, no matter the person unknown downvotes or upvotes, Nauuo would get more upvotes than downvotes. So the only possible result is "+".

In the third example, Nauuo would definitely get one upvote and one downvote, so the only possible result is "0".

In the fourth example, if the only one person upvoted, the result would be "+", otherwise, the result would be "-". There are two possible results, so the result is uncertain.
Program:
```
def func():
    (x, y, z) = map(int, input().split())
    min_upvotes = x
    max_upvotes = x + z
    min_downvotes = y
    max_downvotes = y + z
    if max_upvotes < min_downvotes:
        print('-')
    elif max_downvotes < min_upvotes:
        print('+')
    else:
        print('?')


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the given program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic and any edge cases that could lead to incorrect outcomes based on how the votes can be counted.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Input Variables:**
   - `x`: the number of guaranteed upvotes.
   - `y`: the number of guaranteed downvotes.
   - `z`: the number of unknown votes that could be upvotes or downvotes.

2. **Output Requirements:**
   - If guaranteed upvotes exceed downvotes regardless of the unknown votes, output "+".
   - If guaranteed downvotes exceed upvotes regardless of the unknown votes, output "-".
   - If guaranteed upvotes equal downvotes regardless of the unknown votes, output "0".
   - If the result is uncertain (i.e., depending on the unknown votes, upvotes could be greater, less, or equal to downvotes), output "?".

### Analysis of the Code

The code provided operates as follows:
- It calculates the minimum and maximum possible upvotes (`min_upvotes` and `max_upvotes`).
- It also calculates the minimum and maximum possible downvotes (`min_downvotes` and `max_downvotes`).
- It then checks the conditions to print either "-", "+", or "?" based on the relationships between these values.

### Edge Case Examination

Let's consider the case when `x`, `y`, and `z` are all at their minimum and maximum values: 

- **Case `(0, 0, 1)`**:
    - Minimum Upvotes = 0
    - Maximum Upvotes = 0 + 1 = 1
    - Minimum Downvotes = 0
    - Maximum Downvotes = 0 + 1 = 1
    - Here, the maximum upvotes (1) could be greater than, equal to, or less than the downvotes (0 or 1). As a result, the expected output is "?".
  
The code correctly identifies this scenario as uncertain by giving output "?".

### Additional Edge Cases
- **Case `(1, 0, 1)`**:
    - Minimum Upvotes = 1
    - Maximum Upvotes = 1 + 1 = 2
    - Minimum Downvotes = 0
    - Maximum Downvotes = 0 + 1 = 1
    - Here, regardless of how the unknown vote votes, the condition will always favor upvotes, so the expected output is "+".
  
The code guarantees this outcome as well.

- **Case `(3, 7, 0)`**:
    - Clearly produces the output "-" since there are definitively more downvotes compared to upvotes.

By analyzing these cases exhaustively, we find that input conditions do yield the expected outputs consistently.

### Conclusion

There are no scenarios where the code deviates from the expected outputs according to the problem description, including all critical edge cases. Thus, we can confirm the correctness of the implementation.

Correctness: **True**. 

The given implementation correctly handles the voting scenarios as outlined in the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x, y, and z are integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100.
def func():
    x, y, z = map(int, input().split())
    min_upvotes = x
    max_upvotes = x + z
    min_downvotes = y
    max_downvotes = y + z
    if (max_upvotes < min_downvotes) :
        print('-')
    else :
        if (max_downvotes < min_upvotes) :
            print('+')
        else :
            print('?')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`x` is equal to `min_upvotes`, `y` is an integer from the range 0 to 100, `z` is an integer from the range 0 to 100, `max_upvotes` is equal to `min_upvotes + z`, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, and `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`. If `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes`, then `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes`, and '+' has been printed. Otherwise, `max_downvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_upvotes`.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`x` is equal to `min_upvotes`, `y` is an integer from the range 0 to 100, `z` is an integer from the range 0 to 100, if `max_upvotes` (which equals `min_upvotes + z`) is less than `min_downvotes` (which equals `y`), then '-' has been printed. Otherwise, `max_downvotes` (equal to `y + z`) is evaluated; if `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes`, then '-' has been printed again, but if not, either '+' is printed or `max_downvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_upvotes`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three integers x, y, and z (with values ranging from 0 to 100) as input arguments. It calculates the minimum and maximum possible upvotes and downvotes based on these values. It then evaluates these calculated values and prints '-' if the maximum possible upvotes are less than the minimum possible downvotes, '+' if the maximum possible downvotes are less than the minimum possible upvotes, or '?' if neither condition is met, indicating that overlaps exist between the possible upvotes and downvotes.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
