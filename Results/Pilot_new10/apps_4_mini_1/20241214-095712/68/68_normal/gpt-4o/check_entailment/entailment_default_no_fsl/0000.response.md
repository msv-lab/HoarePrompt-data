Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle all possible cases correctly. Specifically, it fails in the scenario where there are exactly equal upvotes and downvotes, and votes from the unknown category could affect the outcome. 

For example, consider the input `0 0 1`. In this case:

- The minimum upvotes = 0
- The maximum upvotes = 0 + 1 = 1
- The minimum downvotes = 0
- The maximum downvotes = 0 + 1 = 1

With `z = 1`, there are two possible outcomes:
1. If the unknown voter upvotes, the result is `+`.
2. If the unknown voter downvotes, the result is `-`.

The program should output `?` for this case to indicate that the result is uncertain due to the presence of the unknown vote. However, the current logic of the program does not explicitly handle this scenario, potentially leading to incorrect results for this type of input.

Since the program fails to provide the correct output for this case (and potentially others), it is deemed incorrect.
