Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, `z` are integers input by the user such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100. If `x` is greater than `y + z`, then `x` is confirmed to be greater than the sum of `y` and `z`. Otherwise, if `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`, and `x` is less than `y`, the value of `x` remains unchanged. If `x` is equal to `y`, then if `z` is 0, `x` remains equal to `y` and `z` is 0; otherwise, `z` is greater than 0 while both `x` and `y` remain equal. If `x` is not equal to `y`, then `x` satisfies the conditions of being less than or equal to `y + z`, greater than or equal to `y`, and not equal to `y`.***
