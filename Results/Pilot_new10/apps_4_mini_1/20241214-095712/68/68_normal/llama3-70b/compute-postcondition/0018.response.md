The function `func` accepts three parameters: `x`, `y`, and `z`. Each of these parameters is an integer constrained such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. However, there is no output specified for the function, so the functionality remains unclear. Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot determine the return value of the function. 

Functionality: **The function accepts three integer parameters x, y, and z, each constrained between 0 and 100, but the return value is not specified.**
