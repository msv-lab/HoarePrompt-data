You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a directed graph consisting of n vertices and m edges (each edge is directed, so it can be traversed in only one direction). You are allowed to remove at most one edge from it.

Can you make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge from it? A directed graph is called acyclic iff it doesn't contain any cycle (a non-empty path that starts and ends in the same vertex).


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 500, 1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)) — the number of vertices and the number of edges, respectively.

Then m lines follow. Each line contains two integers u and v denoting a directed edge going from vertex u to vertex v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v). Each ordered pair (u, v) is listed at most once (there is at most one directed edge from u to v).


-----Output-----

If it is possible to make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge, print YES. Otherwise, print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1

Output
YES

Input
5 6
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1
2 1
4 5

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example you can remove edge $2 \rightarrow 3$, and the graph becomes acyclic.

In the second example you have to remove at least two edges (for example, $2 \rightarrow 1$ and $2 \rightarrow 3$) in order to make the graph acyclic.
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
m = int(data[1])
edges = [(int(data[i]), int(data[i + 1])) for i in range(2, len(data), 2)]
result = func_1(n, m, edges)
print(result)

def func_1(n, m, edges):
    from collections import defaultdict, deque

    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        graph[u].append(v)
    if not has_cycle(graph):
        return 'YES'
    for (u, v) in edges:
        graph[u].remove(v)
        if not has_cycle(graph):
            return 'YES'
        graph[u].append(v)
    return 'NO'

def has_cycle(graph):
    in_degree = {i: 0 for i in range(1, n + 1)}
    for u in graph:
        for v in graph[u]:
            in_degree[v] += 1
    queue = deque([node for node in in_degree if in_degree[node] == 0])
    count = 0
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        count += 1
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            in_degree[neighbor] -= 1
            if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:
                queue.append(neighbor)
    return count != n


```
Original Assessment: To determine if the provided program meets the requirements of the problem description, we can analyze the code step by step.

1. The program reads the number of vertices (`n`) and edges (`m`), as well as the edges of the directed graph.
2. It constructs a graph using a `defaultdict` of lists to represent the adjacency list.
3. It checks if the initial graph has a cycle using the `has_cycle` function. If there is no cycle, it immediately returns "YES".
4. It iterates through each edge and temporarily removes it, checking again if the graph is acyclic after the removal.
5. If removing the edge makes the graph acyclic, it returns "YES". If none of the edge removals result in an acyclic graph, it returns "NO".
6. The `has_cycle` function calculates the in-degree for each vertex and uses Kahn's algorithm to determine if there is a cycle in the directed graph.

While the general logic seems correct at first glance, there is a critical point to analyze: When removing edges, the function relies on the assumption that removing an edge will definitely allow for finding an acyclic configuration if at least one exists. However, the checking process of re-adding the edge and running the cycle check again can overlook certain configurations, potentially leading to inaccuracies.

Let's consider a specific example where the code might fail:

### Example:
Suppose we have a graph with the following edges:
- 1 → 2
- 2 → 3
- 3 → 1 (a cycle here)

And an additional edge:
- 4 → 1 (not part of the cycle)

In this case, upon removing 3 → 1, we still have a cycle formed by 1 → 2 → 3. If we only check individual edges one at a time, we might remove one edge but still be left with a cycle from another edge combination.

Given that the program may not check all combinations effectively, and the current implementation uses simple edge removal and re-checking, it could lead the algorithm to return "YES" even when the graph remains cyclic, depending on the input configuration and potentially missing an edge necessary for a correct answer.

### Conclusion:
Since there are test cases where the logic fails to produce the correct result, the program's correctness is not guaranteed for all configurations of directed graphs.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, and `edges`, where `n` is the number of vertices, `m` is the number of directed edges between these vertices, and `edges` represents the graph's edges. The function checks if the directed graph, represented by these edges, contains a cycle. If there are no cycles, it returns 'YES'. If a cycle is detected, it checks each edge one by one, removing it temporarily to see if the removal makes the graph acyclic. If removing any edge allows the graph to be acyclic, it returns 'YES'. If none of the edges can be removed to eliminate cycles, the function returns 'NO'. The edge cases include handling graphs near the minimum size of vertices and maximum size of edges, and considering that input edges may contain valid or invalid relationships. 

Output hint for function_2: The function accepts a dictionary representing a directed graph, counts the number of vertices that have been processed by performing a breadth-first search starting from nodes with no incoming edges, and returns `True` if not all vertices can be reached (indicating the presence of a cycle), or `False` if all vertices are reachable (indicating no cycle). 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
