You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a directed graph consisting of n vertices and m edges (each edge is directed, so it can be traversed in only one direction). You are allowed to remove at most one edge from it.

Can you make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge from it? A directed graph is called acyclic iff it doesn't contain any cycle (a non-empty path that starts and ends in the same vertex).


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 500, 1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)) — the number of vertices and the number of edges, respectively.

Then m lines follow. Each line contains two integers u and v denoting a directed edge going from vertex u to vertex v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v). Each ordered pair (u, v) is listed at most once (there is at most one directed edge from u to v).


-----Output-----

If it is possible to make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge, print YES. Otherwise, print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1

Output
YES

Input
5 6
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1
2 1
4 5

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example you can remove edge $2 \rightarrow 3$, and the graph becomes acyclic.

In the second example you have to remove at least two edges (for example, $2 \rightarrow 1$ and $2 \rightarrow 3$) in order to make the graph acyclic.
Annotated Functions:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
m = int(data[1])
edges = [(int(data[i]), int(data[i + 1])) for i in range(2, len(data), 2)]
result = func_1(n, m, edges)
print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), m is an integer representing the number of edges (1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)), and edges is a list of tuples where each tuple (u, v) consists of two integers representing a directed edge from vertex u to vertex v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v).
def func_1(n, m, edges):
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        graph[u].append(v)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)), `edges` is a list of tuples that contains `m` tuples, `graph` contains `m` directed edges indicating the connections (u → v) defined in `edges`
    if (not has_cycle(graph)) :
        return 'YES'
        #The program returns 'YES', indicating a successful condition or state related to the directed graph represented by `edges` without any cycles.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)), `edges` is a list of tuples that contains `m` tuples, `graph` contains `m` directed edges indicating the connections (u → v) defined in `edges`, and the graph represented by `edges` has at least one cycle.
    for (u, v) in edges:
        graph[u].remove(v)
        
        if not has_cycle(graph):
            return 'YES'
        
        graph[u].append(v)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)), `edges` is a list of tuples that contains the original edges, `graph` is the original graph with the same directed edges indicating the connections from `edges`, and the graph contains at least one cycle.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO' indicating that a specific condition (likely related to the presence of cycles or graph properties) has not been met, based on the information provided in the initial state.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, and `edges`, where `n` is the number of vertices, `m` is the number of directed edges between these vertices, and `edges` represents the graph's edges. The function checks if the directed graph, represented by these edges, contains a cycle. If there are no cycles, it returns 'YES'. If a cycle is detected, it checks each edge one by one, removing it temporarily to see if the removal makes the graph acyclic. If removing any edge allows the graph to be acyclic, it returns 'YES'. If none of the edges can be removed to eliminate cycles, the function returns 'NO'. The edge cases include handling graphs near the minimum size of vertices and maximum size of edges, and considering that input edges may contain valid or invalid relationships.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: graph is a dictionary where keys are integers representing vertices (from 1 to n) and values are lists of integers representing directed edges to other vertices; n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 500.
def has_cycle(graph):
    in_degree = {i: (0) for i in range(1, n + 1)}
    for u in graph:
        for v in graph[u]:
            in_degree[v] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key has a value representing the total number of incoming edges for each vertex based on the edges in `graph`, `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to n, and every vertex in `graph` has its outgoing edges properly accounted for in the corresponding values of `in_degree`.
    queue = deque([node for node in in_degree if in_degree[node] == 0])
    count = 0
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        
        count += 1
        
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            in_degree[neighbor] -= 1
            if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:
                queue.append(neighbor)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `in_degree` contains updated values for each vertex in the graph, `queue` is empty as all reachable nodes have been processed, `count` equals the total number of nodes that were initially in `queue` plus any neighbors added during execution that had their in-degree reduced to 0, and all nodes previously in `queue` have been processed.
    return count != n
    #The program returns whether the count of processed nodes is not equal to n
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a dictionary representing a directed graph, counts the number of vertices that have been processed by performing a breadth-first search starting from nodes with no incoming edges, and returns `True` if not all vertices can be reached (indicating the presence of a cycle), or `False` if all vertices are reachable (indicating no cycle).




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
