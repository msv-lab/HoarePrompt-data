In the provided code snippet, the line `in_degree[v] += 1` increments the value of `in_degree` at the key `v` by 1. The prior state indicates that all keys in `in_degree` are initialized to 0, except for key `v`, which has a value of 1.

Now, since `v` is defined as the second vertex in `graph[1]`, after executing the code:
- The value of `in_degree[v]`, which was 1, will now become 2 because of the increment operation.

The other variables remain unchanged:
- `graph` remains a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n`.
- The `in_degree` values for keys other than `v` continue to be 0, and the value for key `u` is not directly impacted by this operation.

Thus, after evaluating the changes, the Output State is:
Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary with keys 1 to n, `in_degree` values are 0 for all keys except `v`, which is now 2, `u` is 1, and `v` must be the second vertex in `graph[1]**
