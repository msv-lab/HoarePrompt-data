The variable `queue` is assigned a deque containing all nodes from `in_degree` that have an incoming edge count of 0. This means that `queue` will include all keys (vertices) in `in_degree` for which the value is 0. The dictionary values for `in_degree` remain unchanged, while `queue` now contains a specific collection of nodes. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `in_degree` remains a dictionary with the total number of incoming edges for each vertex, and `queue` is now a deque containing nodes from `in_degree` with a value of 0.

Output State: **`in_degree` is a dictionary with all keys representing vertices and their corresponding incoming edge counts, `queue` is a deque containing nodes from `in_degree` where `in_degree[node] == 0`**.
