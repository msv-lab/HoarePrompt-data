To determine the necessary states for the for loop to execute, we need to consider the variables involved. The loop iterates over the vertices in `graph[u]`. The execution of the loop relies on the following factors:

1. **Existence of `u` in `graph`:** For the loop to execute, `u` must be a key in the `graph` dictionary. If `u` is not a key in `graph`, the loop will not execute at all.

2. **Presence of edges/vertices in `graph[u]`:** If `u` is a key in `graph`, we must ensure that `graph[u]` is not empty. The loop will only execute if there are elements in the list or collection indexed by `u`.

Therefore, the adjustments we need to make for the loop to run are:

- Ensure that `u` is a key in `graph`.
- Ensure that `graph[u]` contains at least one vertex.

Since these conditions have not been explicitly stated in the initial state, we can summarize the required state modifications as follows:

State: **`in_degree` of each vertex remains the same, `u` is a valid key in graph, `graph[u]` must have at least 1 vertex**
