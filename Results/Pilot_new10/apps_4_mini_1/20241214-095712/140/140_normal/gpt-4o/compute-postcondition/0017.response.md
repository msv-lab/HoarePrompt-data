According to the code, the loop iterates over each key in the `graph`. The loop will execute once for each vertex present in the `graph`. At the end of the last iteration, `u` is still 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `u` should be updated to the next key in the `graph`. Since `graph` has key 2 and `u` has not been modified to point to the next vertex, we need to consider that `u` should move to the next vertex in the `graph`.

Since the loop iterates over all keys in `graph` and `u` remains 2, we need to ensure that `u` is updated to the next key in the `graph` after the current iteration.

State: **`in_degree` of each vertex remains the same, `u` is the next key in the graph, `graph` contains the next vertex key after 2**
