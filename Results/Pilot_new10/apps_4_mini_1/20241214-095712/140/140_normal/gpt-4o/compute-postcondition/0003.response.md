In the given code, `in_degree[v]` is incremented by 1. This means that the value of `in_degree[v]` will change from its previous value (which was initially 0) to 1. The value of `v` is the first vertex in `graph[1]`, which means it is a specific vertex within the graph structure.

All other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the Output State will include the updated value of `in_degree[v]` and maintain the conditions for `graph`, `in_degree`, `u`, and `v`.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary with keys 1 to n, `in_degree` values are 0 for all keys except `v`, which is 1, `u` is 1, and `v` is the first vertex in `graph[1]**
