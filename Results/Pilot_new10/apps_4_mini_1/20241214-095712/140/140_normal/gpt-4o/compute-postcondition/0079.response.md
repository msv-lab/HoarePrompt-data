Output State: **`in_degree` contains updated values for each vertex in the graph, `queue` is empty as all reachable nodes have been processed, `count` equals the total number of nodes that were initially in `queue` plus any neighbors added during execution that had their in-degree reduced to 0, and all nodes previously in `queue` have been processed.**
