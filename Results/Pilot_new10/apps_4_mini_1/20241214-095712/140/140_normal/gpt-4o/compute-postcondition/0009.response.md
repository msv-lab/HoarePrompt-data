According to the code, the loop iterates over the keys in the `graph` dictionary. The loop will execute as long as there are keys in `graph`. At the end of the last iteration, `u` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `u` will be updated to the next key in the `graph`. Since `graph` has keys ranging from 1 to n, `u` would increment to the next available key.

Therefore, we need to know the current state of the keys in `graph`: if `u` is currently at 1 and there are keys up to `n`, the value for `u` should now be considered to be the next key (which is 2) for the loop to execute again. 

Thus, assuming `u` was the first key and we are moving to the second key for the next iteration, the state would change accordingly.

State: **`graph` is a dictionary with keys 1 to n, `in_degree` reflects the in-degrees of all vertices based on the edges from vertex 1, `u` is 2**
