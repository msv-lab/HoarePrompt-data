Postcondition: ***`node` is an integer representing the current node, `graph` is a list of tuples where `graph[node]` has at least 1 neighbor, `visited` includes `node`, `rec_stack` includes `node`, and `neighbor` is the first element of `graph[node]`, which is not in `visited`. The function `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` has been called and returned true.***
