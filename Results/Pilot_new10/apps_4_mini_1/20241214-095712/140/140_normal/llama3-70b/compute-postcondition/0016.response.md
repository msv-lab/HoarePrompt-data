Postcondition: ***`node` is an integer representing the current node, `neighbor` is the next unvisited neighbor, and `graph[node]` must have at least one more neighbor to iterate over. If `rec_stack[neighbor]` is True, the function returns True, indicating that there is at least one more neighbor to iterate over in `graph[node]`. If `rec_stack[neighbor]` is False, there is no specific return value.***
