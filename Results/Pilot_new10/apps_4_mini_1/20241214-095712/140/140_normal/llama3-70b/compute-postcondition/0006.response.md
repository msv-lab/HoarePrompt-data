Postcondition: ***`node` is an integer representing the current node, `graph` is a list of tuples where `graph[node]` has at least 1 neighbor, `visited` includes `node`, `rec_stack` includes `node`, `neighbor` is the first element of `graph[node]`, and `neighbor` is not in `visited`. The function `func_1` returned false for `neighbor`, indicating that a cycle was not detected from this neighbor.***
