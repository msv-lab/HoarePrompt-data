Postcondition: ***`node` is the current node, `neighbor` is the next unvisited neighbor in `graph[node]`. If `rec_stack[neighbor]` is True, the program returns True, indicating a successful condition or state within the context of the graph traversal involving `node` and its `neighbor`. If `rec_stack[neighbor]` is False, then the program does not return any value.***
