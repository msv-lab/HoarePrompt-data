Postcondition: ***`node` is the current node and `neighbor` is the next unvisited neighbor in `graph[node]`. If `neighbor` is not visited, and `func_1` returns True for `neighbor`, it indicates a successful condition related to the current node and its unvisited neighbor. If `func_1` does not return True, no additional action is taken. If `neighbor` is visited, and `rec_stack[neighbor]` is True, the function returns True, indicating a successful state within the graph traversal. If `rec_stack[neighbor]` is False, no return value is produced.***
