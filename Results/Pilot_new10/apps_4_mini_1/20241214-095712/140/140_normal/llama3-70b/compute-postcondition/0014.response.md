Postcondition: ***`node` is an integer representing the current node, `neighbor` is the next unvisited neighbor, and `graph[node]` must have at least one more neighbor to iterate over. If `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` returns True, it indicates that the current node has one or more unvisited neighbors in the graph.***
