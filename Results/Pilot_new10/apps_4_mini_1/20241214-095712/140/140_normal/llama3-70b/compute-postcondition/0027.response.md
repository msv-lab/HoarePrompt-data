The function `func_1` accepts the following parameters: `node`, `graph`, `visited`, and `rec_stack`. The parameter `node` is an integer representing the current node in the graph. The parameter `graph` is a list of tuples, where each tuple (u, v) represents a directed edge from vertex u to vertex v. The parameter `visited` is a set of integers representing the visited nodes, and `rec_stack` is a set of integers representing the nodes currently in the recursion stack.

The function returns values based on various cases:

- Case 1: The function returns True, indicating that it was executed successfully for the neighbor of the current node in the graph, and it has been visited.
- Case 2: The function returns True, indicating that there is a valid path from the current node to its neighbor in the graph, and that the neighbor is present in the visited set and is currently in the recursion stack.
- Case 3: The function returns True, indicating that the current node has one or more unvisited neighbors in the graph.
- Case 4: The function returns True, indicating that there is at least one more neighbor to iterate over in `graph[node]`.
- Case 5: The function returns True, indicating a successful condition related to the current node and its unvisited neighbor in the graph.
- Case 6: The function returns True, indicating a successful condition or state within the context of the graph traversal involving `node` and its neighbor.
- Case 7: The function returns False.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept the parameters `node`, `graph`, `visited`, and `rec_stack`, and it performs various checks while traversing the graph, returning True or False based on the traversal conditions and states. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `node`, `graph`, `visited`, and `rec_stack`, and it returns True or False based on the conditions related to graph traversal involving the current node and its neighbors.**
