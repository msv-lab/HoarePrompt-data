You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a directed graph consisting of n vertices and m edges (each edge is directed, so it can be traversed in only one direction). You are allowed to remove at most one edge from it.

Can you make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge from it? A directed graph is called acyclic iff it doesn't contain any cycle (a non-empty path that starts and ends in the same vertex).


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 500, 1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)) — the number of vertices and the number of edges, respectively.

Then m lines follow. Each line contains two integers u and v denoting a directed edge going from vertex u to vertex v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v). Each ordered pair (u, v) is listed at most once (there is at most one directed edge from u to v).


-----Output-----

If it is possible to make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge, print YES. Otherwise, print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1

Output
YES

Input
5 6
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1
2 1
4 5

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example you can remove edge $2 \rightarrow 3$, and the graph becomes acyclic.

In the second example you have to remove at least two edges (for example, $2 \rightarrow 1$ and $2 \rightarrow 3$) in order to make the graph acyclic.
Program:
```
(n, m) = map(int, input().split())
graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
for _ in range(m):
    (u, v) = map(int, input().split())
    graph[u].append(v)
visited = [False] * (n + 1)
rec_stack = [False] * (n + 1)
has_cycle = False
for node in range(1, n + 1):
    if not visited[node]:
        if func_1(node, graph, visited, rec_stack):
            has_cycle = True
            break
if has_cycle:
    print('NO')
else:
    print('YES')

def func_1(node, graph, visited, rec_stack):
    visited[node] = True
    rec_stack[node] = True
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        if not visited[neighbor]:
            if func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack):
                return True
        elif rec_stack[neighbor]:
            return True
    rec_stack[node] = False
    return False


```
Original Assessment: The provided program is intended to determine if a directed graph can be made acyclic by removing at most one edge. The algorithm first checks if the graph contains a cycle, and if it does, it concludes that it's impossible to make the graph acyclic by removing just one edge, outputting "NO". Otherwise, it outputs "YES". However, this approach is flawed because it doesn't adequately check for cases where removing a single edge may eliminate a cycle. 

Here's a potential case where the program would fail:

Consider a graph with the following edges:

```
3 3
1 2
2 3
3 1
```

This forms a cycle (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1). The program checks for any cycle and finds one. It then outputs "NO". However, you can clearly remove the edge `(3, 1)` to break the cycle and make the graph acyclic. 

Therefore, the program improperly concludes that it is not possible to make the graph acyclic by removing at most one edge, which is incorrect. 

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts an integer `node`, a list of tuples `graph` representing directed edges, a set `visited` to track visited nodes, and a set `rec_stack` to monitor nodes currently in the recursion stack. It returns True if a cycle is detected in the directed graph; otherwise, it returns False. The function performs a depth-first search to explore the graph and checks for cycles by determining if a node is revisited while still in the recursion stack. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
