The variable `total_x` is assigned the value of the sum of all integers in the list `x`. The initial state specifies that `x` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer is within the range of 0 to 1000. Therefore, the value of `total_x` will be the sum of these integers. The values of `n` and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `x` is a list of `n` integers derived from input, where each integer `x_i` is in the range 0 <= `x_i` <= 1000; `y` is now a list of `n` integers derived from input, where each integer `y_i` is in the range 0 <= `y_i` <= 1000; `total_x` is the sum of the integers in `x`.**
