The variable `total_y` is assigned the value of `sum(y)`, which calculates the total sum of all integers in the list `y`. The previous state of `y` is that it contains `n` integers, each within the range of 0 to 1000. The overall states of the other variables remain unchanged, except for `total_y`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `x` is a list of `n` integers derived from input, where each integer `x_i` is in the range 0 <= `x_i` <= 1000; `y` is now a list of `n` integers derived from input, where each integer `y_i` is in the range 0 <= `y_i` <= 1000; `total_x` is the sum of the integers in `x`; `total_y` is the sum of the integers in `y`.**
