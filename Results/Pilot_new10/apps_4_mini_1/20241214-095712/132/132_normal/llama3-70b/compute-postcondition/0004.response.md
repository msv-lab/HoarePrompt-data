The code executes a print statement which does not change any variables or their values. The output is simply a string printed to the console. Therefore, the state of `n`, `x`, and `y` remains unaltered. 

Output State: **`n` is the input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `x` is a list of `n` integers derived from the input where each integer satisfies 0 <= `x[i]` <= 1000; `y` is a list of `n` integers derived from input, each satisfying 0 <= `y[i]` <= 1000. The sum of the integers in `x` is not equal to the sum of the integers in `y`; the output is 'No'.**
