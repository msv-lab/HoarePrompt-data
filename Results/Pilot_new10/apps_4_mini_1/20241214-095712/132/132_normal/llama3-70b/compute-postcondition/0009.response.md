The code snippet simply prints the string 'Yes'. It does not modify any variables or their values. The states of the variables remain unchanged, but the output of the print statement indicates that the condition regarding the equality of lists `x` and `y` is satisfied.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `x` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, where each integer satisfies 0 <= `x[i]` <= 1000; `y` is also sorted in ascending order and has `n` integers derived from input, each satisfying 0 <= `y[i]` <= 1000; the sum of the elements in `x` is equal to the sum of the elements in `y`; the list `x` is equal to the list `y`; the output is 'Yes'.**
