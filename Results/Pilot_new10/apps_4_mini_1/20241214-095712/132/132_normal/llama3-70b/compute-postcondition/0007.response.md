The `sort()` method is called on the list `y`, which reorders its elements in ascending order. Since `y` is derived from input, it may initially be in any order, but after executing the `sort()` method, it will be sorted in ascending order. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `x` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, where each integer satisfies 0 <= `x[i]` <= 1000; `y` is now sorted in ascending order and still has `n` integers derived from input, each satisfying 0 <= `y[i]` <= 1000; the sum of the elements in `x` is equal to the sum of the elements in `y`.**
