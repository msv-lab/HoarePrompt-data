Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50) and two lists of `n` integers (`x` and `y`), where each integer in `x` and `y` is within the range 0 to 1000. It checks if the sums of the integers in `x` and `y` are equal. If the sums are not equal, it prints 'No'. If the sums are equal, it sorts both lists and checks if the sorted lists are identical; it prints 'Yes' if they are the same and 'No' if they are not. The function has no return value but prints the result based on the comparisons. **
