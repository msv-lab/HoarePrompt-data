You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is a beautiful garden of stones in Innopolis.

Its most beautiful place is the $n$ piles with stones numbered from $1$ to $n$.

EJOI participants have visited this place twice. 

When they first visited it, the number of stones in piles was $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$, correspondingly. One of the participants wrote down this sequence in a notebook. 

They visited it again the following day, and the number of stones in piles was equal to $y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n$. One of the participants also wrote it down in a notebook.

It is well known that every member of the EJOI jury during the night either sits in the room $108$ or comes to the place with stones. Each jury member who comes there either takes one stone for himself or moves one stone from one pile to another. We can assume that there is an unlimited number of jury members. No one except the jury goes to the place with stones at night.

Participants want to know whether their notes can be correct or they are sure to have made a mistake.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input file contains a single integer $n$, the number of piles with stones in the garden ($1 \leq n \leq 50$).

The second line contains $n$ integers separated by spaces $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$, the number of stones in piles recorded in the notebook when the participants came to the place with stones for the first time ($0 \leq x_i \leq 1000$).

The third line contains $n$ integers separated by spaces $y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n$, the number of stones in piles recorded in the notebook when the participants came to the place with stones for the second time ($0 \leq y_i \leq 1000$).


-----Output-----

If the records can be consistent output "Yes", otherwise output "No" (quotes for clarity).


-----Examples-----
Input
5
1 2 3 4 5
2 1 4 3 5

Output
Yes

Input
5
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1

Output
Yes

Input
3
2 3 9
1 7 9

Output
No



-----Note-----

In the first example, the following could have happened during the night: one of the jury members moved one stone from the second pile to the first pile, and the other jury member moved one stone from the fourth pile to the third pile.

In the second example, the jury took stones from the second and fourth piles.

It can be proved that it is impossible for the jury members to move and took stones to convert the first array into the second array.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if sum(x) != sum(y):
        print('No')
    else:
        x.sort()
        y.sort()
        if x == y:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')


```
Original Assessment: Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

The task is to determine if the list of stone piles could be consistent after some operations that could either remove stones or move them between piles overnight.

### Program Breakdown:

Here's the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if sum(x) != sum(y):
        print('No')
    else:
        x.sort()
        y.sort()
        if x == y:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Analysis:

1. **Sum Check**:
   - The program correctly checks if the total number of stones `sum(x)` is equal to `sum(y)`. If the sums are not equal, it outputs "No" immediately. This is correct because if the total count of stones is different, it can never be a valid transformation.

2. **Sorting for Comparison**:
   - If the sums are equal, it sorts both lists and checks if they are identical. This logic assumes that if the total number of stones is the same, the distribution of stones can match after any number of valid moves.

### Fail Cases:

However, let's identify potential cases where the program might fail:

- Consider the following input:
  
#### Test Case Example:
```
5
3 0 0 0 0
2 1 0 0 0
```

In this case:
- The first sum: `3 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 3`
- The second sum: `2 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 3`
- Sums are equal, so the program will proceed to check the sorted lists:
  - After sorting: `x = [0, 0, 0, 0, 3]` and `y = [0, 0, 0, 1, 2]`
  - The sorted lists are not equal, hence it will output "No".

However, it is possible to achieve `y` starting from `x` by removing stones from the first pile:
- One stone can be taken away from the first pile (3 -> 2).
- One stone can be taken away from the first pile again (2 -> 1).
- Now the configuration matches.

### Conclusion:

The program incorrectly assumes that if the counts match, the configurations can always be made to match through moves and removals. However, this is not necessarily true because the program ignores the actual counts in individual piles beyond just the sums.

Thus, the program fails in this case as well as potentially others.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, x is a list of n integers where each integer x[i] satisfies 0 <= x[i] <= 1000, and y is a list of n integers where each integer y[i] satisfies 0 <= y[i] <= 1000.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if (sum(x) != sum(y)) :
        print('No')
    else :
        x.sort()
        y.sort()
        if (x == y) :
            print('Yes')
        else :
            print('No')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is the input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `x` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, where each integer satisfies 0 <= `x[i]` <= 1000; `y` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, where each integer satisfies 0 <= `y[i]` <= 1000; the sum of the elements in `x` is equal to the sum of the elements in `y`. If `x` is equal to `y`, the output is 'Yes'. Otherwise, if `x` is not equal to `y`, the output is 'No'.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is the input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `x` is a list of `n` integers derived from the input where each integer satisfies 0 <= `x[i]` <= 1000; `y` is a list of `n` integers derived from input, each satisfying 0 <= `y[i]` <= 1000. If the sum of the integers in `x` is not equal to the sum of the integers in `y`, the output is 'No'. Otherwise, if the sums are equal and `x` is equal to `y`, the output is 'Yes'; if the sums are equal but `x` is not equal to `y`, the output is 'No'.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
