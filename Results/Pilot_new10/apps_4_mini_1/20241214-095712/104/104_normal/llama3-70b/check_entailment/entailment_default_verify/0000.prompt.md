You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: JATC and his friend Giraffe are currently in their room, solving some problems. Giraffe has written on the board an array $a_1$, $a_2$, ..., $a_n$ of integers, such that $1 \le a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n \le 10^3$, and then went to the bathroom.

JATC decided to prank his friend by erasing some consecutive elements in the array. Since he doesn't want for the prank to go too far, he will only erase in a way, such that Giraffe can still restore the array using the information from the remaining elements. Because Giraffe has created the array, he's also aware that it's an increasing array and all the elements are integers in the range $[1, 10^3]$.

JATC wonders what is the greatest number of elements he can erase?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 100$) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_i$ ($1 \le a_1<a_2<\dots<a_n \le 10^3$) — the array written by Giraffe.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the maximum number of consecutive elements in the array that JATC can erase.

If it is impossible to erase even a single element, print $0$.


-----Examples-----
Input
6
1 3 4 5 6 9

Output
2
Input
3
998 999 1000

Output
2
Input
5
1 2 3 4 5

Output
4


-----Note-----

In the first example, JATC can erase the third and fourth elements, leaving the array $[1, 3, \_, \_, 6, 9]$. As you can see, there is only one way to fill in the blanks.

In the second example, JATC can erase the second and the third elements. The array will become $[998, \_, \_]$. Because all the elements are less than or equal to $1000$, the array is still can be restored. Note, that he can't erase the first $2$ elements.

In the third example, JATC can erase the first $4$ elements. Since all the elements are greater than or equal to $1$, Giraffe can still restore the array. Note, that he can't erase the last $4$ elements.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_erase = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            if all((a[k] - a[i] == k - i for k in range(i, j))):
                max_erase = max(max_erase, j - i - 1)
    print(max_erase)


```
Original Assessment: Let's analyze the provided program and its logic against the problem description.

The problem states that we want to determine the maximum number of consecutive elements from a strictly increasing array that can be erased while still allowing the original array to be restored.

### Program Logic:
1. The program takes an integer `n` as input, which is the number of elements in the array.
2. It reads the array of integers and initializes `max_erase` to track the maximum number of elements that can be erased.
3. It uses two nested loops:
    - The outer loop iterates through all possible starting indices `i`.
    - The inner loop iterates through possible ending indices `j`.
4. For each pair of indices `(i, j)`, it checks if the subsequence from `i` to `j` maintains a consistent difference from `a[i]`. If this condition holds true, it calculates how many elements are in that segment and potentially updates `max_erase`.

### Edge Cases:
- One important edge case to consider is when `n` equals `1`. The function should return `0` since you can't erase any elements.
- When the array contains elements that allow more items to be removed because the gaps between are larger than `1`, the check `a[k] - a[i] == k - i` must accurately reflect that.

### Identifying Flaws:
The main concern arises in the inner logic check: `all((a[k] - a[i] == k - i for k in range(i, j)))`. This is meant to confirm that the consecutive numbers can be erased. However, this can fail in scenarios where there are multiple allowed ways, especially for longer gaps or at the ends of the array.

#### Example to consider:
For instance, consider the array `[1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9]`:
- The program correctly identifies that `3` and `4` can be removed. 
- Now, consider an array like `[1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 10]`:
- The program may not adequately account for the optimal removal of `3`, `4`, and `7`, incorrectly determining that fewer elements can be removed.

### Conclusion:
Since the program might miscalculate scenarios with more complex gaps in values, the logic fails to cover certain edge cases completely. The logic is not robust enough to deal with non-consecutive removals that still allow for restoration capabilities based on the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) and a list `a` of `n` integers (1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000), and calculates the length of the longest segment of contiguous elements in `a` such that each element in the segment has the same difference with its index as the first element. It prints the maximum length of segments found that satisfy this condition minus one. If no segments satisfying the condition exist, it will print 0. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
