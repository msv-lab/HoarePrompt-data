The variable `max_erase` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `j - i - 1`. With `i` being `2` and `j` being `5`, the calculation simplifies to `j - i - 1 = 5 - 2 - 1 = 2`. Since `max_erase` could be `max_erase` (the maximum length found previously) or `2`, we update `max_erase` to whichever value is greater.

The values of `i`, `j`, `n`, or any other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state retains all information except for the updated value of `max_erase`.

Output State: **`max_erase` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, `n` must be at least 5**
