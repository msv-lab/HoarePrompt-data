The expression `max_erase = max(max_erase, j - i - 1)` calculates the maximum between the current value of `max_erase` and the result of `j - i - 1`. The previous values are `i` is 1, `j` is 2, so `j - i - 1` equals `2 - 1 - 1`, which results in `0`. Therefore, `max_erase` will either remain the same if it is greater than or equal to `0`, or it will be updated to `0` if it is less than `0`.

Given that `max_erase` is stated to be the maximum value found and can only remain the same or increase to `0`, it will still hold its maximum value or update to `0`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`max_erase` is either its previous maximum value or is updated to 0; `n` must be greater than or equal to 3; `i` is 1; `j` is 2.**
