To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to examine the starting values of `i` and `n` in relation to the range specified in the for loop statement.

Given:
- The loop iterates over the range from `i + 1` to `n + 1`. With the current values:
  - `i` is 0
  - `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100

Calculating the range:
- With `i = 0`, the loop starts at `i + 1`, which is `1`.
- The loop endpoint is `n + 1`, which means the loop can execute as long as `n` is at least `1`.

Now, we must ensure that the loop can execute:
- If `n` is at least `1`, the calculated range will be from `1` to `n + 1`, which will at least include the number `1`. 
- Thus, `j` will start at `1` if `n` is `1` and will execute at least once (for the minimum valid case).

The states of `i` and `n` currently ensure that the loop can execute. Therefore, the adjustment needed is primarily that `n` must satisfy the condition of being at least `1`. 

No other state modifications are required; specifically, `j` will be `1` during its first iteration of the loop.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` starts at 1**
