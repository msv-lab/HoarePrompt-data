According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. Specifically, the loop iterates over the range starting from `i + 1` to `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is currently 1, and `n` remains greater than or equal to 2. 

In the last iteration, `j` would have taken a value starting from `2` since the range is from `i + 1` which is `1 + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must take a value of `3` (which is the next integer in the range). However, `j` can only take values as long as `n + 1` is greater than `j`. 

This means for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than or equal to `3`.

State: **`max_erase` is the maximum value found, either remaining the same or increasing to 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 2**
