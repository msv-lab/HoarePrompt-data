According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop is set up to execute for values of `j` starting from `i + 1` (which is 2 since `i` is 1) and going up to `n + 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 3, which means `j` can take values starting from 2 up to at least 4 (if `n` is exactly 3, then `j` can only go up to 3).

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time:
- The current value of `j` is 2 (starting point for the loop).
- For the loop to run one more time, `n` must be greater than 2 (which it is since `n` is â‰¥ 3), allowing `j` to increment to 3 for the next iteration.

As `j` is currently 2 in the last iteration, the next value will be 3.

State: **`max_erase` is either its previous maximum value or updated to 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 3**
