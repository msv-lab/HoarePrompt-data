The variable `max_erase` is updated to be the maximum value between its previous value and the expression `j - i - 1`. The values of `i` and `j` are given as `1` and `3`, respectively. Therefore, the expression evaluates to `3 - 1 - 1 = 1`. The value of `n` is stated to be greater than or equal to `3`, but it does not affect the calculation of `max_erase`. 

Since `max_erase` can either remain the same if it is greater than or equal to `1`, or it gets updated to `1` if it was less than `1`. The output state reflects that all preconditions remain valid except for the updated `max_erase`. 

Output State: **`max_erase` is either its previous maximum value or updated to be at least 1; `n` is greater than or equal to 3; `i` is 1; `j` is 3.**
