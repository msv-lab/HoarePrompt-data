Postcondition: ***`max_erase` is the maximum value found, either remaining the same or increasing to 0. If the difference condition holds true for the values of `a` at indices `i` and `j`, where `i` is 1 and `j` is 2, then the block is executed under that condition. `n` remains greater than or equal to 2.***
