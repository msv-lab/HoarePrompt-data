The variable `max_erase` is updated based on the maximum value between its current value and the result of the expression `j - i - 1`. The previous state indicates that `i` is 0 and `j` starts at 1, thus the expression `j - i - 1` evaluates to `1 - 0 - 1`, which equals 0. 

Given that `max_erase` is updated to the maximum of its current value and 0, the output state does not provide information about whether `max_erase` changed, as its previous value is not specified. However, the other variables `n`, `i`, `j`, and the described condition remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `max_erase` is updated to max(`max_erase`, 0)**
