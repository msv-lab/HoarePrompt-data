In the provided code, the variable `max_erase` is assigned the maximum of its current value and the expression `j - i - 1`. Given the initial state where `i` is `0`, and `j` is `2`, we can calculate `j - i - 1` as follows:

1. Since `j` is `2` and `i` is `0`, the expression becomes:
   \[
   j - i - 1 = 2 - 0 - 1 = 1
   \]

2. The value of `max_erase` is updated to be the maximum of its current value (which is not specified, but we assume it has a valid initial value prior to this code execution) and `1`. 

Since `max_erase` could be any value, but we know it's being compared to `1`, we can summarize the state after this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State will retain all unchanged variables and reflect the update to `max_erase` based on the comparison.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `max_erase` is max(current `max_erase`, 1)**
