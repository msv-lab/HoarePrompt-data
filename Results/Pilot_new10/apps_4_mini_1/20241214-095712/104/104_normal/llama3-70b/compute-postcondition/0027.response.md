According to the code, the loop can execute again for `i` if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. Also, since `n` can be greater than or equal to 2, it must still be satisfied that `n` is greater than 2 for the loop to continue after this iteration.

State: **`max_erase` is the maximum length of segments satisfying the condition found in `a`, `i` is 2, `j` is `n + 1`, and `n` must be greater than 2.**
