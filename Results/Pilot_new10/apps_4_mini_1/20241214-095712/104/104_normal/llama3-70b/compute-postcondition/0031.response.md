Postcondition: ***`max_erase` is the maximum length of segments satisfying the condition found in `a`, and since `i` is 2, `j` is 3, and `n` is at least 3, if all elements `a[k]` for `k` in the range from `i` to `j-1` satisfy the condition that `a[k] - a[i]` equals `k - i`, `max_erase` is updated to max(`max_erase`, 0). Otherwise, `max_erase` remains unchanged.***
