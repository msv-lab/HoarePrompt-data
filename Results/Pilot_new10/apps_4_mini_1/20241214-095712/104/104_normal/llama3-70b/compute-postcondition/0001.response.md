Given the initial state:

- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100
- `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000

The code snippet provided is:

```
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
```

Now, analyzing the impact:

- The code replaces the previous value of `a` with a new list of integers obtained from user input, which is processed through `map(int, input().split())`. This means `a` could be set to a list of integers provided by the user, and it must still respect the constraints that were set for `a` originally since all the integers entered must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 1000, and they must be in strictly increasing order with `n` elements.

The value of `n` does not change directly, but it does relate to how many integers are inputted. If the user inputs `n` integers, this holds true as `n` is defined based on the size of the list `a`.

Thus, after code execution, we can still assert that:

- `n` remains the same integer between 1 and 100.
- `a` will contain exactly `n` integers that meet the specified constraints.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers acquired from user input such that 1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000**
