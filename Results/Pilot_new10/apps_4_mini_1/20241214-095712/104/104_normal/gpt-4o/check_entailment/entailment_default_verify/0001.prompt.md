You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: JATC and his friend Giraffe are currently in their room, solving some problems. Giraffe has written on the board an array $a_1$, $a_2$, ..., $a_n$ of integers, such that $1 \le a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n \le 10^3$, and then went to the bathroom.

JATC decided to prank his friend by erasing some consecutive elements in the array. Since he doesn't want for the prank to go too far, he will only erase in a way, such that Giraffe can still restore the array using the information from the remaining elements. Because Giraffe has created the array, he's also aware that it's an increasing array and all the elements are integers in the range $[1, 10^3]$.

JATC wonders what is the greatest number of elements he can erase?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 100$) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_i$ ($1 \le a_1<a_2<\dots<a_n \le 10^3$) — the array written by Giraffe.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the maximum number of consecutive elements in the array that JATC can erase.

If it is impossible to erase even a single element, print $0$.


-----Examples-----
Input
6
1 3 4 5 6 9

Output
2
Input
3
998 999 1000

Output
2
Input
5
1 2 3 4 5

Output
4


-----Note-----

In the first example, JATC can erase the third and fourth elements, leaving the array $[1, 3, \_, \_, 6, 9]$. As you can see, there is only one way to fill in the blanks.

In the second example, JATC can erase the second and the third elements. The array will become $[998, \_, \_]$. Because all the elements are less than or equal to $1000$, the array is still can be restored. Note, that he can't erase the first $2$ elements.

In the third example, JATC can erase the first $4$ elements. Since all the elements are greater than or equal to $1$, Giraffe can still restore the array. Note, that he can't erase the last $4$ elements.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_erase = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_erase = max(max_erase, a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1)
    print(max_erase)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly account for all potential cases as outlined in the problem description. Specifically, it only calculates the maximum number of consecutive elements that can be erased based on the gaps between the elements, which does not account for the constraints that some elements must remain to ensure the array can be restored.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
1 2 3 4
```
According to the problem description, JATC can erase 4 elements leaving behind no elements, but the program will output `0` because it calculates the maximum erase based on gaps only. However, it should return 4, as Giraffe can restore the array by knowing that the values are bounded between 1 and 4.

Moreover, in any input where the array elements are sequential (e.g., `1, 2, 3, 4` or `5, 6, 7, 8`), the program will incorrectly report that no elements can be erased while still having enough information to restore the array because it fails to account for the fact that if the first or last elements are removed, restoration can still occur as long as too many contiguous elements are not removed from the ends.

Thus, the program has failed to handle edge cases that the problem statement mentions, confirming it is not correct for all cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts an integer `n`, where `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) indicates the number of elements in an array, followed by `n` strictly increasing integers (1 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 1000). It then calculates the maximum number of integers that can be erased between consecutive elements in the array and prints this value. If `n` is 1, the function will return 0 since there are no pairs of elements to compare. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
