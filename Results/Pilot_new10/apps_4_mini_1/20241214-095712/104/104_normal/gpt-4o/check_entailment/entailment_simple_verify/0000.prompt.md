You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: JATC and his friend Giraffe are currently in their room, solving some problems. Giraffe has written on the board an array $a_1$, $a_2$, ..., $a_n$ of integers, such that $1 \le a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n \le 10^3$, and then went to the bathroom.

JATC decided to prank his friend by erasing some consecutive elements in the array. Since he doesn't want for the prank to go too far, he will only erase in a way, such that Giraffe can still restore the array using the information from the remaining elements. Because Giraffe has created the array, he's also aware that it's an increasing array and all the elements are integers in the range $[1, 10^3]$.

JATC wonders what is the greatest number of elements he can erase?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 100$) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_i$ ($1 \le a_1<a_2<\dots<a_n \le 10^3$) — the array written by Giraffe.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the maximum number of consecutive elements in the array that JATC can erase.

If it is impossible to erase even a single element, print $0$.


-----Examples-----
Input
6
1 3 4 5 6 9

Output
2
Input
3
998 999 1000

Output
2
Input
5
1 2 3 4 5

Output
4


-----Note-----

In the first example, JATC can erase the third and fourth elements, leaving the array $[1, 3, \_, \_, 6, 9]$. As you can see, there is only one way to fill in the blanks.

In the second example, JATC can erase the second and the third elements. The array will become $[998, \_, \_]$. Because all the elements are less than or equal to $1000$, the array is still can be restored. Note, that he can't erase the first $2$ elements.

In the third example, JATC can erase the first $4$ elements. Since all the elements are greater than or equal to $1$, Giraffe can still restore the array. Note, that he can't erase the last $4$ elements.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_erase = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_erase = max(max_erase, a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1)
    print(max_erase)


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the given program, we need to check if it accurately determines the maximum number of consecutive elements that can be erased while still allowing the reconstruction of the array based on the remaining elements.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. The program correctly reads the number of elements `n` and the list `a` as input.
2. It initializes `max_erase` to `0` and then iterates through the list from the second element to the last.
3. During the iteration, it calculates the number of elements that can be erased between each pair of adjacent elements, specifically `a[i] - a[i-1] - 1`, which gives the space available between the elements.
4. The maximum of these values is then assigned to `max_erase`.
5. Finally, it prints `max_erase`.

### Edge Cases:
- If `n` is `1`: In this case, since the array contains only one element, you cannot erase any elements, and the expected output should be `0`.
- If the array is composed of consecutive numbers (like `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`): The program should return `4` since you can erase all but the last element.
- If there is a significant gap between two elements (like `[1, 3]`): The program should correctly identify that you can erase `1` element.

### Testing Edge Cases:
- Case where `n = 1`, input is `1`:
  - Expected output: `0` (Since we cannot erase the only element).
  - The program returns `0` because there are no adjacent pairs to calculate the gap.

- Case where elements are increasing without gaps, for example, `5, 6, 7, 8, 9`:
  - Expected output: `4` (You can erase all but the last).
  - The program correctly computes this.

- Case where there are gaps like `2, 6`:
  - Expected output: `3` (You can only erase `3` elements between `2` and `6`).
  - The program will accurately reflect this.

- Test with two adjacent elements (for example, `1, 2`):
  - Expected output: `0`, as we cannot erase any elements between `1` and `2`.
  - The algorithm would output `0`, which is correct since you cannot erase any elements.

### Conclusion:
After testing various scenarios and edge cases, the program handles all tested inputs appropriately according to the problem description. Therefore, there is no case found where the program fails to meet the requirements.

Correctness: **True**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) indicating the number of elements in the array, followed by n integers a_i (1 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 1000) representing a strictly increasing array.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_erase = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_erase = max(max_erase, a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `a` is a list of integers; `max_erase` is the maximum value of `a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1` for all `i` in the range from 1 to `n - 1`.
    print(max_erase)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
