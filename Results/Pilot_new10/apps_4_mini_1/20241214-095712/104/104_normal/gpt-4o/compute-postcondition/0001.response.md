The variable `a` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the result of `input().split()`. The `input` function accepts a space-separated string of integers, which are then converted to integers and put into the list `a`. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it still indicates the number of elements in the array, and the array `a_i` is not modified. Therefore, the output state reflects the new variable `a`, which is now a list of integers corresponding to the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the space-separated input values.**
