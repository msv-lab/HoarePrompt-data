The code `max_erase = 0` initializes the variable `max_erase` and assigns it the value of 0. The initial value of `max_erase` is undefined prior to this code. The variables `n` and `a` remain unchanged during this execution, since the code does not impact them.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the space-separated input values; `max_erase` is 0.**
