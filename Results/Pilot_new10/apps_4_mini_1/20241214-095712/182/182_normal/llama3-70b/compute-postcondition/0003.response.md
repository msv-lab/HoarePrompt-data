The `print(0)` statement outputs the value `0`, but it does not change any variable in the current state. The precondition remains unchanged, and the output is simply the printed value. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an input integer normalized to `x % 360` resulting in a value between 0 and 359. The current value of `x` is 0.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer normalized to `x % 360` resulting in a value between 0 and 359; the current value of `x` is 0, and printed value is 0.**
