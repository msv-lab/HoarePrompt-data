The expression `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4` calculates the result based on the value of `x`, which is normalized to be between 0 and 359 and is not equal to 0. The arithmetic operations will adjust the value of `x` and categorize it into one of the four possible results based on the range in which it falls.

1. `x + 90 - 1` results in `x + 89`. Given `x` falls between 0 and 359, `x + 89` will range from 89 to 448.
2. `// 90` performs floor division by 90, which will yield:
   - If `x + 89` is between 89 and 179, it will give 0.
   - If `x + 89` is between 180 and 269, it will give 1.
   - If `x + 89` is between 270 and 359, it will give 2.
   - If `x + 89` is between 360 and 449, it will give 3.
3. Finally, the result will be taken modulo 4 which will stay the same, as the division result is at most 3.

The potential outputs can thus be categorized as follows based on `x`:
- If `x` is in the range 0 to 89, the output is 0.
- If `x` is in the range 90 to 179, the output is 1.
- If `x` is in the range 180 to 269, the output is 2.
- If `x` is in the range 270 to 359, the output is 3.

Since `x` is not equal to 0, we exclude the case where `x` is 0. 

Output State: **`x` is the input integer normalized to `x % 360`, resulting in a value between 0 and 359, and the printed output is either 0, 1, 2, or 3 depending on the range of `x`.**
