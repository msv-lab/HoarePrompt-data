The variable `normalized_angle` is defined as `x % 360`. Since `x` is an integer representing the camera rotation angle in degrees set to an input integer value, `normalized_angle` will also be an integer between 0 and 359, inclusive.

The code calculates `turns` using the formula `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4`. The expression `360 - normalized_angle` is guaranteed to be in the range of 1 to 360. Dividing this value by 90 gives an integer result which will then be taken modulo 4, resulting in `turns` being one of the values {0, 1, 2, 3}.

The initial values of the variables are retained, but `turns` will now hold a new integer value based on the calculations described.

Output State: **`x` is an integer representing the camera rotation angle, `normalized_angle` is equal to `x % 360`, and `turns` is calculated as `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4`.**
