The original assessment states that the program is incorrect due to its failure to handle cases where the provided angle is not a multiple of 90 degrees. This is highlighted with the example of the angle `-60`, which results in the normalized angle `300`, leading to an incorrect output of `0` when the expected output is `3`.

Upon examining the provided annotated code, the program calculates the normalized angle and then computes the required number of 90-degree clockwise turns. However, it reduces the problem to simply looking for the total amount to turn based on the modulo operation and does not account for the actual deviation from vertical in cases where the normalized angle is not a simple multiple of 90 degrees. This directly aligns with the original assessment's reasoning regarding incomplete handling of the input conditions.

The function's output logic doesn't satisfy the requirement of minimizing deviation from vertical for some inputs, particularly negative angles that are not multiples of 90.

Since the annotated version corroborates the original assessment indicating that the implementation does not properly address the necessary computation for minimizing turns based on the provided rotation, the conclusion regarding the program's correctness remains unchanged.

Final: **False**
