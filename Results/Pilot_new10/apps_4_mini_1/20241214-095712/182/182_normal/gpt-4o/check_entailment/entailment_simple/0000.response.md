Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description. Specifically, it does not account for negative angles and their corresponding clockwise rotation properly.

### Explanation of Issues:
1. **Normalization Logic**: The code uses `normalized_angle = x % 360`, which adjusts the angle within the range of 0 to 359 degrees. However, for negative angles, this does not accurately represent the effective clockwise rotation since it could yield an angle that is not reflecting the desired minimum deviation from vertical.
  
2. **Calculation of Turns**: 
   - The line `turns = (360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4` calculates the number of 90-degree clockwise rotations needed based on the normalized angle. However, this does not correctly account for the scenario where the angle is negative or not in the range of 0 to 180 degrees (which is relevant for computing the minimum deviation).
   - For example, if `x` is -60, the `normalized_angle` becomes 300 after applying modulo 360. Then the expression computes turns as if trying to correct a deviation of 300 degrees, which doesn't lead to the actual necessary turns and does not produce the right result based on the provided output for the test scenarios.

### Missing Cases:
- The program assumes that simply adjusting using modulo will always give the right count of necessary clockwise turns, but it neglects the need to evaluate the minimum deviation in all configurations (especially for counter-clockwise angles). It also should compute possibilities based on both negative and positive angles accurately.

### Conclusion:
Thus, the program fails to meet the problem requirements in calculating the minimum turns effectively and does not handle negative rotations properly. Hence, it returns incorrect outputs for certain angles, such as -60.
