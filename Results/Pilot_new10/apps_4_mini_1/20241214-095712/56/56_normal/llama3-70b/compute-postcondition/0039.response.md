Functionality: ** The function accepts two positive integers `n` (where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\)) and `k` (where \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{5}\)). It checks if `n` is smaller than `k` and in that case, it prints 'No'. If `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, it attempts to find the highest set bits from `n` and adds them to a list `a`. If the length of `a` is less than `k`, it prints 'No'. If the length of `a` is greater than or equal to `k`, it sorts `a` in descending order, prints 'Yes', followed by the first `k` elements of `a` as space-separated values. **
