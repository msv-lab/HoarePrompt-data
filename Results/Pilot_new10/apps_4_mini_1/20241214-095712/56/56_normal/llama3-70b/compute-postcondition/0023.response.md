The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is increased by 1; `x` is equal to `n.bit_length() - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
