The statement `print('No')` outputs the string 'No' to the console, but it does not change any of the variables or their states. The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, and `k` remain unchanged as the output is purely a print operation. 

Output State: **`n` is non-negative, `i` is the total number of iterations executed, `a` contains values corresponding to the highest set bits encountered during each iteration, `k` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5, and the current length of `a` is less than `k`.**
