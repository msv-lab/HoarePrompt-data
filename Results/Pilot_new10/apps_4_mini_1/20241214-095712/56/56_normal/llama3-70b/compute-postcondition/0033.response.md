The list `a` is sorted in reverse order, meaning that its elements are rearranged to be in descending order. The length of `a` remains `k`, and the values will be sorted based on their current values. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is non-negative, `i` is the total number of iterations executed, `a` contains the first `k` values corresponding to the highest set bits encountered during each iteration and is now sorted in descending order, `k` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5, and the length of `a` is equal to `k`.**
