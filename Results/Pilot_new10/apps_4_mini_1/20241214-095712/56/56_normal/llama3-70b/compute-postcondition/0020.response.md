The variable `i` is incremented by 1. The initial state does not provide us with the previous value of `i`, but it indicates that `n` is greater than 2 and has been decreased by 2. This decrement does not affect the other variables, only increasing `i` by 1 affects `i` directly.

Output State: **`k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is increased by 1.**
