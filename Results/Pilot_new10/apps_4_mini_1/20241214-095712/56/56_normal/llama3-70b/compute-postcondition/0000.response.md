The variables `n` and `k` are assigned values from user input, where the input consists of two integers separated by a space. Since `n` must remain a positive integer in the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\) and `k` must be a positive integer in the range \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{5}\), the new values will be specific integers that fit within these ranges.

However, the exact new values for `n` and `k` cannot be determined in advance because they depend on the input entered by the user. Therefore, we will refer to them generally as `input integer n` and `input integer k`.

Since the states of the other variables are not affected by this code snippet, they remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5**.
