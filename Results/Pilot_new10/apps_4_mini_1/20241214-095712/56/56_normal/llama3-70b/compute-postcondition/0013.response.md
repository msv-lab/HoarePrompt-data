The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown, and the variable `n` has been modified to `n - 2`. The state of `k` remains unchanged within its bounds. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5, `n` is an integer modified to `n - 2`, and `i` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5, `n` is an integer modified to `n - 2`, and `i` is increased by 1.**
