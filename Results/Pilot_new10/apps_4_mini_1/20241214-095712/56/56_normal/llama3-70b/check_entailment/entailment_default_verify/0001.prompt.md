You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Jamie is preparing a Codeforces round. He has got an idea for a problem, but does not know how to solve it. Help him write a solution to the following problem:

Find k integers such that the sum of two to the power of each number equals to the number n and the largest integer in the answer is as small as possible. As there may be multiple answers, you are asked to output the lexicographically largest one. 

To be more clear, consider all integer sequence with length k (a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k}) with $\sum_{i = 1}^{k} 2^{a_{i}} = n$. Give a value $y = \operatorname{max}_{1 \leq i \leq k} a_{i}$ to each sequence. Among all sequence(s) that have the minimum y value, output the one that is the lexicographically largest.

For definitions of powers and lexicographical order see notes.


-----Input-----

The first line consists of two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5) — the required sum and the length of the sequence.


-----Output-----

Output "No" (without quotes) in a single line if there does not exist such sequence. Otherwise, output "Yes" (without quotes) in the first line, and k numbers separated by space in the second line — the required sequence.

It is guaranteed that the integers in the answer sequence fit the range [ - 10^18, 10^18].


-----Examples-----
Input
23 5

Output
Yes
3 3 2 1 0 

Input
13 2

Output
No

Input
1 2

Output
Yes
-1 -1 



-----Note-----

Sample 1:

2^3 + 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0 = 8 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 23

Answers like (3, 3, 2, 0, 1) or (0, 1, 2, 3, 3) are not lexicographically largest.

Answers like (4, 1, 1, 1, 0) do not have the minimum y value.

Sample 2:

It can be shown there does not exist a sequence with length 2.

Sample 3:

$2^{-1} + 2^{-1} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1$

Powers of 2:

If x > 0, then 2^{x} = 2·2·2·...·2 (x times).

If x = 0, then 2^{x} = 1.

If x < 0, then $2^{x} = \frac{1}{2^{-x}}$.

Lexicographical order:

Given two different sequences of the same length, (a_1, a_2, ... , a_{k}) and (b_1, b_2, ... , b_{k}), the first one is smaller than the second one for the lexicographical order, if and only if a_{i} < b_{i}, for the first i where a_{i} and b_{i} differ.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if n < k:
        print('No')
    else:
        a = []
        i = 0
        while n > 0:
            x = n.bit_length() - 1
            if x <= i:
                break
            a.append(x)
            n -= 2 ** x
            i += 1
        if len(a) < k:
            print('No')
        else:
            a = a[:k]
            a.sort(reverse=True)
            print('Yes')
            print(' '.join(map(str, a)))


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided Python program in relation to the problem description, we need to analyze the logic presented in the code and check it against possible edge cases and constraints mentioned.

**Analysis of the Code:**
1. The program reads two integers `n` and `k`.
2. It first checks if `n < k`, which would imply that it's impossible to express `n` as a sum of `k` powers of two since the minimum power (considering non-negative powers) would be `1` (2^0) multiplied by `k`, leading to values of at least `k`.
3. Then, it initializes an empty list `a` and attempts to find powers of two that can sum to `n` using a `while` loop. The method to determine the largest power of two is derived from using `n.bit_length() - 1`, which finds the bit position of the highest bit set in `n`.
4. If `len(a) < k`, it prints "No", indicating that it could not find enough components to meet the requirement of having length `k`.
5. Otherwise, it sorts and prints the result as required.

**Edge Cases:**
- The program seems to handle cases where `n < k` correctly.
- However, there are potential issues when `n` can yield valid possibilities with powers of two but in counts less than `k`, particularly with negative powers or distributing powers unevenly.

**Potential Issues:**
1. Consider the case when `n = 1` and `k = 2`. The answer is supposed to be "Yes" with `-1 -1`, which the code will output as "No", as it doesn't account for negative powers specifically. Instead, `2^{-1} + 2^{-1} = 1`, which is valid, but the logic in the code restricts to non-negative integers in the array `a`.
   
2. Similarly, for `n = 3` and `k = 2`, the sequence `(1, 1)` or `(-1, 3)` should be a valid output but would fail for the current implementation because it only progressively adds positive powers of two.

In conclusion, the code logic fails to cover scenarios where `n` can indeed be represented by less-than-conventional methods, especially when valid combinations involve negative powers or selections that sum up to `n` in more complex distributions.

**Correctness: False**

The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly based on the problem description, particularly for cases where negative powers would be necessary. An example input like `1 2` where the program should find the valid sequence `-1 -1` results in "No".

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts two positive integers `n` (where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\)) and `k` (where \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{5}\)). It checks if `n` is smaller than `k` and in that case, it prints 'No'. If `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, it attempts to find the highest set bits from `n` and adds them to a list `a`. If the length of `a` is less than `k`, it prints 'No'. If the length of `a` is greater than or equal to `k`, it sorts `a` in descending order, prints 'Yes', followed by the first `k` elements of `a` as space-separated values. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
