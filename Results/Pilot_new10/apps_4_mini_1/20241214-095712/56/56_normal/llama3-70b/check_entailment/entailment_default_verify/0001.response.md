Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because it identifies a critical flaw in the program's logic. The program does not account for scenarios where negative powers of two are needed to reach the required sum `n` with exactly `k` integers. Specifically, it fails to handle cases like `n = 1` and `k = 2`, where valid outputs such as `-1 -1` should exist, but the program outputs "No". The analysis highlights the insufficiency of the current logic in capturing all valid combinations, confirming that the program does not fully meet the problem description's requirements. Therefore, the final correctness of the program is indeed False.
