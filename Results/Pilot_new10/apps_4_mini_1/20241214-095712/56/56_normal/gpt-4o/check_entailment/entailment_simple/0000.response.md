Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description as required.

### Explanation of the Issues:
1. **Handling of the Outputs:**
   - The program returns "No" if `k` is greater than `n` or if the number of set bits in `n` is more than `k`. This part is correct. However, it does not check the requirements of producing a lexicographically largest sequence correctly when `len(bits)` is equal to `k`.

2. **Lexicographic Order:**
   - The lexicographical order needs to be based on the indices of powers of 2 chosen such that the largest integer is minimized. The program does not address situations where the difference between the number of set bits and `k` needs to be filled appropriately with powers of 2. Decrementing the smallest bit does not guarantee that the result is lexicographically largest or maintains minimal `max(bit indices)` condition.

3. **Negative Exponents:**
   - The problem description allows for negative exponents (which represent fractions), yet this program does not effectively handle that case, especially not returning lexicographically larger sequences that might include such negative values when `k` is larger than the count of set bits but `k` is mathematically feasible (as shown in the example 1).

4. **Handling of Special Cases:**
   - The case where `k` could be greater than the number of distinct powers of 2 present in `n` (and requires filling in with smaller powers) is not addressed appropriately. For instance, in situations where `n` can be expressed with duplicate larger powers (and still respects the original powers of 2), the subsequents may lower the lexicographical order.

### Conclusion:
The function does not correctly account for all scenarios specified in the problem description, particularly around lexicographical order and including negative powers. Thus, the program cannot be deemed correct in fulfilling the requirements of the problem.
