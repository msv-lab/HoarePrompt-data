The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 10^18, and `k` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 10^5. 

After executing the function body, the function will evaluate the value of `k` relative to `n` and the bit positions of `n`. 

- If `k` is greater than `n`, the function returns 'No'.
- If certain conditions are met, the function may also return 'No'.
- If neither of the above conditions apply, the function returns 'Yes' followed by the indices of set bits in `n`, formatted as a space-separated string.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two parameters: a positive integer `n`, and a positive integer `k`, returning either 'No' in certain cases or 'Yes' followed by the indices of the set bits in `n`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` and `k`, returns 'No' if `k` > `n`, or under certain conditions, and returns 'Yes' followed by the indices of set bits in `n` if none of the previous conditions are met.**
