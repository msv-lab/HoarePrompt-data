The variable `bits` is assigned an empty list, meaning it is initialized but does not hold any values yet. The initial conditions for `n` and `k` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5, and `k` is less than or equal to `n`; `bits` is an empty list.**
