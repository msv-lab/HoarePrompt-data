The variable `smallest` is assigned the value from `bits.pop()`, which means it receives the last element from the list `bits` and removes that element from the list. Since `len(bits)` must be less than `k - 1`, it indicates that the list `bits` has at least one element present before the operation, ensuring that the pop operation can occur without errors. The values of `n` and `k` remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5; `k` is less than or equal to `n`; `len(bits)` must be less than `k - 1; smallest` is the last element removed from the list `bits`.**
