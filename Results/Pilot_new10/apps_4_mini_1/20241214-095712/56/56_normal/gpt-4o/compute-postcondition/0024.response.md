In the given code, `bits.append(smallest - 1)` appends the value of `smallest - 1` to the list `bits`. The variable `smallest` was previously defined as the last element that was removed from `bits`, and after this operation, the length of `bits` is increased by 1, as one new element is added.

Since `smallest` is defined, we take it into account to determine what value will be added to `bits`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, and `len(bits)`) are not directly affected by this operation, but we maintain their values as described in the initial state while updating the length of `bits`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5; `k` is less than or equal to `n`; `len(bits)` is now equal to the previous length + 1; `smallest` is the last element that was removed from `bits`; `bits` now includes `smallest - 1` as an additional element.**
