According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the length of `bits` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `len(bits)` is equal to the previous length + 1. This implies that `len(bits)` has increased by 1 and is now greater than or equal to 1. Since `k` is between 1 and 100,000, and `k` is less than or equal to `n`, we need to determine if `len(bits)` can still be less than `k`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `len(bits)` must be less than `k`. Given that `len(bits)` is equal to the previous length + 1, that means the previous length must have been less than \( k - 1 \) before this iteration for the loop to execute again.

Thus, we need to adjust the state based on the requirement that `len(bits)` must be less than `k`. Therefore, at the end of the iteration, we can conclude that the previous length of `len(bits)` can be expressed in relation to `k`:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5; `k` is less than or equal to `n`; `len(bits)` must be less than `k - 1`.**
