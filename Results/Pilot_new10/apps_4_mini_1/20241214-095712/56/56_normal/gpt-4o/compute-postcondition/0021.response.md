The `bits` list now has an updated element appended to it. The value that is appended to `bits` is `smallest - 1`, where `smallest` is the last element removed from `bits`. Since `smallest` is a known value, `smallest - 1` will also be a specific integer value. The other variables and conditions provided remain unchanged: `n` and `k` are still within their specified ranges and constraints, and `len(bits)` remains less than `k` after the addition.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5; `k` is less than or equal to `n`; `len(bits)` is less than or equal to `k`; `smallest` is the value of the last element removed from `bits`; `bits` now includes an element that is `smallest - 1`, and `len(bits)` has increased by 1.**
