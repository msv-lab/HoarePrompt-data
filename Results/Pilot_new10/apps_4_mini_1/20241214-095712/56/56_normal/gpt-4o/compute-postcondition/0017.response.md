Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5, `k` is less than or equal to `n`, and `bits` is a list of indices of the set bits in the binary representation of `n`, ranging from 0 to 60. The length of `bits` is less than or equal to `k`.***
