The variable `smallest` is assigned the value of the last element removed from the list `bits` using the `pop()` method. Since it is stated that `len(bits)` must be less than `k` and `k` is a positive integer less than or equal to `n`, we can infer that `bits` must have a length that is at least equal to `len(bits)` when `smallest` is popped, but after this operation, the length of `bits` will reduce by 1. 

The other variables `n` and `k` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5; `k` is less than or equal to `n`; `len(bits)` must be less than `k`; `smallest` is the last element that was removed from `bits`, `len(bits)` is now reduced by 1.**
