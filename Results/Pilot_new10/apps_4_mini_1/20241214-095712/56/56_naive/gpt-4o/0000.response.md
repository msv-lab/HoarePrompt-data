To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the constraints and implementation of the function `func_1`.

**Problem Breakdown:**

The program is supposed to generate a sequence of `k` integers such that the sum of \( 2^{a_i} \) equals `n`, while also ensuring that the maximum integer in the result sequence is minimized, and that the sequence is lexicographically largest among all valid sequences.

**Validation of the Code Logic:**

1. It first checks if `k > n`, returning "No" if true because it is impossible to create a valid sequence in such a case since the minimum sum with `k` non-negative terms (when they are all zeros) is `k * 2^0 = k`.

2. It collects the powers of two corresponding to bits set in `n` into the list `bits`.

3. If the length of `bits` is greater than `k`, it returns "No" since we cannot build a sequence with `k` elements out of fewer than `k` unique bits.

4. The subsequent `while` loop expands the number of elements in `bits` until it reaches `k` by taking the smallest bit and creating two instances of `smallest - 1`, thus preserving the lexicographical order.

5. Finally, the sequence is sorted in descending order and printed.

**Potential Edge Cases:**

- If `k` is 1 and `n` is 0, it should return "Yes" and the output should be [0]. The check for bits will yield an empty list but through the bit expansion process, `[-1]` would be created incorrectly, which is contrary to the expected behavior.
  
- When `n` is a power of 2 and `k > 1`, there is a question if it's possible to sum to `n` with more than one bit.

**Conclusion:**

Upon evaluating the code, it appears that it does not properly handle the case where the bit representation may require negative integers. More importantly, it completely misses the case where when `k` is greater than the number of bits representing `n`, and if any additional required numbers create a sum that cannot be achieved with purely non-negative integers.

For example, for the input:

- `n = 1`, `k = 2`, it would incorrectly produce "Yes" with output `[-1, -1]`, while conceptually, it should state "No" since with k = 2 we can't use just 2^(-1).

Thus, the program does not work correctly in all cases. 

Correctness: **False**.
