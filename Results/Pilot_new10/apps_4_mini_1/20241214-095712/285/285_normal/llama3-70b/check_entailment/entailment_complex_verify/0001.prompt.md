You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Kolya is developing an economy simulator game. His most favourite part of the development process is in-game testing. Once he was entertained by the testing so much, that he found out his game-coin score become equal to 0.

Kolya remembers that at the beginning of the game his game-coin score was equal to n and that he have bought only some houses (for 1 234 567 game-coins each), cars (for 123 456 game-coins each) and computers (for 1 234 game-coins each).

Kolya is now interested, whether he could have spent all of his initial n game-coins buying only houses, cars and computers or there is a bug in the game. Formally, is there a triple of non-negative integers a, b and c such that a × 1 234 567 + b × 123 456 + c × 1 234 = n?

Please help Kolya answer this question.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — Kolya's initial game-coin score.


-----Output-----

Print "YES" (without quotes) if it's possible that Kolya spent all of his initial n coins buying only houses, cars and computers. Otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
1359257

Output
YES
Input
17851817

Output
NO


-----Note-----

In the first sample, one of the possible solutions is to buy one house, one car and one computer, spending 1 234 567 + 123 456 + 1234 = 1 359 257 game-coins in total.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for a in range(n // 1234567 + 1):
        for b in range((n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1):
            c = (n - a * 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234
            if a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234 == n:
                print('YES')
                exit()
    print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements a nested loop to check for non-negative integer combinations of houses, cars, and computers that sum up to the given game-coin score `n`. 

### Explanation:
1. **Range for `a`**: The outer loop iterates through possible counts of houses (`a`). The range is `n // 1234567 + 1`, which ensures `a` can take all possible values that could contribute to the total without exceeding `n`.
  
2. **Range for `b`**: The inner loop iterates through possible counts of cars (`b`). The calculation `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1` ensures `b` can take all possible values after accounting for the coins spent on the houses (`a`).

3. **Calculation for `c`**: It computes the count of computers (`c`) using the remaining coins after accounting for houses and cars: `c = (n - a * 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234`. The condition checks whether this subtraction leads to a valid configuration that matches `n`.

4. **Output**: As soon as it finds any combination that fits (`a`, `b`, `c` producing a total exactly equal to `n`), it prints "YES" and exits. If no combination is found after all iterations, it prints "NO".

### Edge Cases:
- The program properly handles even where `n` is equal to the smallest amounts of houses, cars, or computers until it reaches the maximum limit of `n` (up to `10^9`).
- It also correctly handles the case when `n` is exactly zero, allowing for the possibility of not buying any items.

Thus, after analyzing the logic and structure, there isn't an input case where the program would fail to provide the correct output as per the problem description. Therefore, the implementation is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for a in range(n // 1234567 + 1):
        for b in range((n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1):
            c = (n - a * 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234
            if a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234 == n:
                print('YES')
                exit()
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is the maximum number of times it can contribute to the sum without exceeding `n`, `b` is the maximum number of times it can contribute after considering the contributions of `a`, and `c` is the maximum number of times it can contribute after considering the contributions of both `a` and `b`, with  `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234` either equal to or less than `n`. If there is no combination of `a`, `b`, and `c` that satisfies the equation, then no output will be printed and the loop will finish without executing the print statement.
    print('NO')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and prompts the user to input a positive integer `n` (where 1 <= n <= 10^9). It attempts to find non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c` such that the equation `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234 = n` holds true. If such integers exist, it prints 'YES' and exits the function. If no valid combination is found after exhausting all possibilities, it prints 'NO'.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
