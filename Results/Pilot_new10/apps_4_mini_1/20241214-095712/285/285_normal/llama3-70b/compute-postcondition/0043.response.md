Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1234567, with `a` at least 1, `b` derived from (n - (prev_a + 1) * 1234567) // 123456, and `c` calculated as (n - a * 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234. If the expression `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234` equals `n`, then 'YES' has been printed and the program has exited.***
