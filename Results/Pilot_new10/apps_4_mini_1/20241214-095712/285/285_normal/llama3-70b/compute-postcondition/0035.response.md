Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1234567; `b` is the next integer greater than `b_current`, which is less than or equal to `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1`; `c` is equal to `(n - a * 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234`. If `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234` equals `n`, then 'YES' has been printed.***
