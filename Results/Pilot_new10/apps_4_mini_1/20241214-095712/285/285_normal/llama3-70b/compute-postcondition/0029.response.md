The code snippet contains the command `exit()`, which immediately terminates the program. This means that while the calculations involving `b` and `c` are structured to occur before the program exits, they do not take effect since no further actions can be taken after the exit. Consequently, the variable values retain their state before any modifications could potentially occur, and the program does not produce any returnable values.

As such, the existing conditions for `n`, `b`, and `c` are still valid and the program simply exits without making any modifications to these variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1234567; `b` is updated to `b + 1`; `c` is calculated as (n - a * 1234567 - (b + 1) * 123456) // 1234; printed output 'YES' and then exits.**
