The variable `c` is assigned the value of the expression `(n - a * 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234`. Since `a` and `b` are both initialized to 0, the expression simplifies to `c = (n - 0 - 0) // 1234`, which further simplifies to `c = n // 1234`. The value of `n` remains a positive integer. Therefore, the other variables are not affected, and we can state the new value of `c` in terms of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `a` is 0; `b` is 0; `c` is equal to `n // 1234`.**
