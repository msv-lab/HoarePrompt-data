Postcondition: ***`n` is at least `1234567`, `remaining_after_houses` is non-negative, `car_cost` is greater than 0, `b` is 0, and `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses`. The remaining_after_cars is not divisible by `computer_cost` (i.e., `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost != 0`)***
