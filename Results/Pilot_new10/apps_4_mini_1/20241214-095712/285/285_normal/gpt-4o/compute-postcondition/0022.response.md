To evaluate the code snippet provided, we will analyze how it impacts the existing variables based on their initial states.

Starting with the initial state:
- `n` is at least `1358023`
- `remaining_after_houses` is greater than or equal to `123456`
- `b` is `0`

Now, let's examine the code:
```
remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost
```

Here, `b` is `0`, which means the expression `b * car_cost` equals `0`. Thus, the calculation simplifies to:
```
remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - 0
```
This yields:
```
remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses
```

**Updated Variables:**
- `remaining_after_cars` is now equal to `remaining_after_houses`.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `remaining_after_houses`, and `b`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is at least `1358023`, `remaining_after_houses` is greater than or equal to `123456`, `b` is 0, `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses`.**
