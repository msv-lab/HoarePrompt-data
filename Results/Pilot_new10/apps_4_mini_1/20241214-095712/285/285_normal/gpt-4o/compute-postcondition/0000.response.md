The variable `house_cost` is assigned the fixed value of `1234567`. The value of `n` remains unchanged in this operation, retaining its condition that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. Therefore, `house_cost` is now defined with a specific value, while the condition for `n` remains valid.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `house_cost` is 1234567**
