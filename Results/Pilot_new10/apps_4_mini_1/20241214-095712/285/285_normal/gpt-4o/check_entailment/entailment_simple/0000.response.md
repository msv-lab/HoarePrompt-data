The provided program is intended to determine if Kolya could have spent all his initial game-coins buying a combination of houses, cars, and computers, based on their respective costs. The logic implemented in the function `func_1` checks this by iterating over the number of houses he could buy and then checking for each possible number of cars, whether the remaining coins can be completely spent on computers.

### Breakdown of the Program Logic

1. **Inputs and Initialization**: 
   - The user inputs an integer `n`, which represents Kolya's initial game-coin score.

2. **Cost Constants**: The costs of the items are defined:
   - `house_cost` = 1,234,567
   - `car_cost` = 123,456
   - `computer_cost` = 1,234

3. **Iteration for Houses**:
   - The outer loop iterates over the possible number of houses (`a`), from 0 up to the maximum number he could afford with `n`.

4. **Remaining Coins After Houses**:
   - After calculating how many coins are remaining after spending on houses, the program checks how many cars (`b`) can be bought with the remaining coins.

5. **Divisibility Check for Computers**:
   - For each combination of houses and cars, the program checks if the remaining coins can be fully used to buy computers by checking if `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0`.

6. **Return Values**:
   - If a valid combination is found where the condition holds true, it returns 'YES', indicating that it is possible to spend exactly `n` coins. If after all possibilities no valid combination is found, it returns 'NO'.

### Correctness Evaluation

The program systematically checks all combinations of purchasing houses and cars while ensuring that the remaining coins can be utilized to purchase computers. This corresponds precisely to the requirements specified in the problem description, which asks whether there exists a non-negative integer solution to the equation given the constraints on coin usage.

1. **Exhaustive Search**: The loops effectively cover all non-negative integer combinations for houses and cars, checking the necessary condition for computers at each iteration.

2. **Output Consistency**: The output of 'YES' or 'NO' aligns with the problem's expectations, providing a response that indicates the feasibility of the spending logic.

### Conclusion

Since the program adheres strictly to the rules and conditions outlined in the problem description, checking all possible combinations in an efficient manner, we conclude that the program is indeed correct.

Correctness: **True**
