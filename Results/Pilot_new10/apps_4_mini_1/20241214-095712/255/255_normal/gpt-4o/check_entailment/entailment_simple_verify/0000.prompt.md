You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters. You may apply some operations to this string: in one operation you can delete some contiguous substring of this string, if all letters in the substring you delete are equal. For example, after deleting substring bbbb from string abbbbaccdd we get the string aaccdd.

Calculate the minimum number of operations to delete the whole string $s$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 500$) — the length of string $s$.

The second line contains the string $s$ ($|s| = n$) consisting of lowercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the minimal number of operation to delete string $s$.


-----Examples-----
Input

abaca

Output

Input

abcddcba

Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    operations = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[i - 1]:
            operations += 1
    print(operations)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the problem and the code.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to delete the entire string consisting of lowercase Latin letters by removing contiguous substrings where all letters in that substring are the same. The goal is to calculate the minimum number of such operations needed to delete the string completely.

### Analysis of the Program:
Here's the provided program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    operations = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[i - 1]:
            operations += 1
    print(operations)
```

### Functionality of the Program:
1. The program reads an integer n (length of the string) and then the string s.
2. It initializes a counter `operations` to 1.
3. It iterates through the string from the second character to the end.
4. Each time it encounters a character that is different from the previous character, it increases the `operations` counter by 1.
5. Finally, it prints the total count of operations.

### Identifying Potential Issues:
The program essentially counts the transitions (changes) between different characters in the string and assumes that each change represents a necessary operation. However, this approach does not fully grasp the nature of deletions that can happen.

**Counterexample:**
Consider the case where the input string has consecutive blocks of the same character, like `aaaabbbbcccc`. 

- The expected minimum operations to remove the string would be 3:
    1. First, delete "aaaa".
    2. Second, delete "bbbb".
    3. Finally, delete "cccc".
  
- However, with the provided program:
    - The transitions would be counted as follows:
        - From `a` to `b` and from `b` to `c`, leading to an operation count of 3.
    
However, if we had a more complex case, like `aaabbcc`, the expected moves could vary based on contiguous deletions possible, which the program's simple counting fails to consider, leading it to misunderstand how to minimize operations correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program doesn't handle all potential cases correctly. It counts character transitions, concluding an incorrect minimum operation count without considering the ability to delete larger same-character blocks, thus leading to an incorrect result.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 500, and s is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    operations = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[i - 1]:
            operations += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 1 and 500; `s` is a string of length equal to `n`; `operations` is 1 plus the number of transitions between consecutive characters in `s`. If `n` is 1, `operations` remains 1.
    print(operations)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
