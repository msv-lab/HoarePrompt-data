You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters. You may apply some operations to this string: in one operation you can delete some contiguous substring of this string, if all letters in the substring you delete are equal. For example, after deleting substring bbbb from string abbbbaccdd we get the string aaccdd.

Calculate the minimum number of operations to delete the whole string $s$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 500$) — the length of string $s$.

The second line contains the string $s$ ($|s| = n$) consisting of lowercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the minimal number of operation to delete string $s$.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
abaca

Output
3
Input
8
abcddcba

Output

Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    operations = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[i - 1]:
            operations += 1
    print(operations)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the requirements first:

The task is to calculate the minimum number of operations required to delete an entire string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. An operation consists of removing a contiguous substring where all characters are the same.

Now, reviewing the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    operations = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[i - 1]:
            operations += 1
    print(operations)
```

### Analysis:
1. The program initializes `operations` to 1, which suggests there's at least one operation needed (some substring must be removed).
2. It then iterates over the string from the second character to the end, checking if the current character differs from the previous character. For every difference, it increments `operations`.
3. Finally, it prints the number of operations.

### Problem with the Implementation:
The logic used in the program does not correctly reflect the minimum operations needed to remove the entire string as specified in the problem description. The key issues are as follows:

- The program assumes that every time there is a change from one character to the next, a new operation is required, which is incorrect. There may be cases where removing contiguous characters can allow multiple sections of the string to be cleared in fewer operations.
- For instance, consider the input string `"aaabaaa"`. The provided program would count 4 operations (3 for 'a' to 'b', and then back to 'a'). However, ideally, you can perform 1 operation to remove the first three 'a's and then another to remove the last three 'a's.

### Counterexample:
Take the string `s = "aaabbaaa"`. According to the program:
- It counts as 5 operations by the same logic.
- However, the correct minimum operation would be 3 (removing `aaa`, `bb`, and then `aaa`).

### Conclusion:
Since the program can produce incorrect outputs in specific cases, the correctness of the program does not hold for all possible inputs.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It counts and prints the number of segments in `s`, where a segment is defined as a continuous sequence of the same character interrupted by a different character. If `n` is 1, it returns 1 since there is only one segment. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
