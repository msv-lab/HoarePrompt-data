The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It counts and prints the number of segments in `s`, where a segment is defined as a continuous sequence of the same character interrupted by a different character. If `n` is 1, it returns 1 since there is only one segment.
