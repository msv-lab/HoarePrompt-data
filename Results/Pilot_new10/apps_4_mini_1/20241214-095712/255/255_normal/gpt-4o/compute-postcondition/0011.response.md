The value of `operations` is incremented by 1. Since the initial conditions state that `operations` is either 2 or 3 depending on whether `s[2]` is not equal to `s[1]`, after the increment, `operations` will be either 3 or 4. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `s` is a string of length equal to `n`, `operations` is either 3 or 4, `i` is 2**
