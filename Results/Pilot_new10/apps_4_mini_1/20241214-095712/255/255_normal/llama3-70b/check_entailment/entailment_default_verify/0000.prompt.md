You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters. You may apply some operations to this string: in one operation you can delete some contiguous substring of this string, if all letters in the substring you delete are equal. For example, after deleting substring bbbb from string abbbbaccdd we get the string aaccdd.

Calculate the minimum number of operations to delete the whole string $s$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 500$) — the length of string $s$.

The second line contains the string $s$ ($|s| = n$) consisting of lowercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the minimal number of operation to delete string $s$.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
abaca

Output
3
Input
8
abcddcba

Output
4
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    ans = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[i - 1]:
            ans += 1
    print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the provided program against the problem description, we analyze how the program computes the minimum number of operations required to delete the entire string.

The operation allowed is deleting a contiguous substring of equal letters, and the goal is to determine how many operations are needed to entirely remove the string.

Let's look at the logic of the program:

1. The program starts by reading the string length `n` and the string `s`.
2. It initializes `ans` to 1, which suggests that at least one operation is needed.
3. It iterates over the string from the second character to the end. For each character, it checks if the current character differs from the previous one. If they differ, it increments `ans`.

### Evaluation of the Logic

The approach taken by the program fundamentally counts distinct segments where letters change, which incorrectly correlates to the number of operations needed to delete substrings.

### Issue Identification:

The program does not consider that:
- If a substring with equal letters occurs consecutively, it can be removed in one operation.
- The approach misses cases where multiple operations could be consolidated into fewer operations because it counts transitions without appropriately grouping equal character segments.

### Counterexamples:

Consider the string `aaaaabbbcc`:
- The correct operation count should be 3:
    - One operation for deleting all `a`s (`aaaaa`),
    - One operation for deleting all `b`s (`bbb`),
    - One operation for deleting all `c`s (`cc`).

The program would count the segments (5 `a`s, then 3 `b`s, then 2 `c`s) and thus would return `3` (as it would count 3 operations), which is actually correct for this case.

However, if we take `s = "abcaaac"`:
- The correct number of operations to delete would be 3.
    1. Remove `abc` (first operation, removing distinct characters individually).
    2. Then `aaa` (second operation).
    3. Then the last `c` (third operation).

The program incorrectly returns `4`, since it counts the distinct transitions incorrectly.

### Conclusion:

Thus the output of the function does not match the required description in multiple scenarios.

Correctness: **False**. 

The function does not correctly implement the logic to achieve the desired outcome in every case. For instance, it fails for a string like "abcaaac".

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 500) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It counts and prints the number of distinct consecutive character sequences in `s`. If all characters are the same, it will return 1, as there are no transitions. The function does not return any value but directly prints the result. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
