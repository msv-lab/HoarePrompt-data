According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop executes when `n` is at least 2 because `range(1, n)` produces numbers starting from 1 up to (but not including) `n`. 

Since `n` is an integer input within the range 1 to 500, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1. Additionally, when the loop starts, the variable `i` will be initialized to 1.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `n` is greater than 1 and that `i` will begin with the value of 1.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `s` is a string of length `n`, `ans` is 1, `i` is 1**
