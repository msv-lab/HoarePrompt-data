To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the requirements first:

The task is to calculate the minimum number of operations required to delete an entire string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. An operation consists of removing a contiguous substring where all characters are the same.

Now, reviewing the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    operations = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[i - 1]:
            operations += 1
    print(operations)
```

### Analysis:
1. The program initializes `operations` to 1, which suggests there's at least one operation needed (some substring must be removed).
2. It then iterates over the string from the second character to the end, checking if the current character differs from the previous character. For every difference, it increments `operations`.
3. Finally, it prints the number of operations.

### Problem with the Implementation:
The logic used in the program does not correctly reflect the minimum operations needed to remove the entire string as specified in the problem description. The key issues are as follows:

- The program assumes that every time there is a change from one character to the next, a new operation is required, which is incorrect. There may be cases where removing contiguous characters can allow multiple sections of the string to be cleared in fewer operations.
- For instance, consider the input string `"aaabaaa"`. The provided program would count 4 operations (3 for 'a' to 'b', and then back to 'a'). However, ideally, you can perform 1 operation to remove the first three 'a's and then another to remove the last three 'a's.

### Counterexample:
Take the string `s = "aaabbaaa"`. According to the program:
- It counts as 5 operations by the same logic.
- However, the correct minimum operation would be 3 (removing `aaa`, `bb`, and then `aaa`).

### Conclusion:
Since the program can produce incorrect outputs in specific cases, the correctness of the program does not hold for all possible inputs.

Correctness: **False**
