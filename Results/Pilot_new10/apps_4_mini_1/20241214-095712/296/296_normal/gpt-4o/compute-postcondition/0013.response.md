The code snippet `divisors.append(n // i)` adds the result of the expression `n // i` to the list `divisors`. The variable `n` is a positive integer satisfying `n >= 3`, and `i` is defined as one greater than `i_last`, so `i = i_last + 1`. The expression `n // i` will yield an integer result since `n` is a positive integer and `i` is also a positive integer.

After executing the code:
- The list `divisors` will now contain the integer value of `n // i`, in addition to any previously existing values within it.

The information provided in the initial state is still valid, with the only change being the addition of a new value to the `divisors` list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 3`, `i` is `i_last + 1`, `int(math.sqrt(n)) >= i`, `divisors` now includes the current value of `i` and the new value `n // i`.**
