The value of `divisors` is updated by appending the result of `n // i` to it. `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, and `i` is defined as `i_last + 2`. As a result, the expression `n // i` will be a non-negative integer due to the conditions on `n` and `i`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 3`; `i` is `i_last + 2`; `int(math.sqrt(n)) >= i_last + 2; divisors` now includes the value of `n // i`.**
