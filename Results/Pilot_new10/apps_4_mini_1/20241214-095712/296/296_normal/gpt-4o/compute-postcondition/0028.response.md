The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\). After executing the function body, if `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns 'NO'. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3 but has no divisors found, it also returns 'NO'. If divisors of `n` are found, the function returns 'YES', along with the value of `k` (the count of divisors of `n` greater than or equal to 2) and a list of these divisors formatted as '1 d' for each divisor `d`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return information about the divisors of `n`, indicating whether any divisors were found and providing the count and list of valid divisors if they exist.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns 'NO' if `n` is less than or equal to 2 or if no divisors of `n` greater than or equal to 3 are found. It returns 'YES', the count of valid divisors, and the formatted list of these divisors if they exist.**
