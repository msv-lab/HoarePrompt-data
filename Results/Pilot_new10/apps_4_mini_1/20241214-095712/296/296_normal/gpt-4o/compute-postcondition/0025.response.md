The variable `k` is assigned the value of the length of the list `divisors`. Since `divisors` contains all divisors of `n` that are greater than or equal to 2, and it is guaranteed that `divisors` is not empty, `k` will be a positive integer representing how many such divisors exist. The states of other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`divisors` contains all divisors of `n` greater than or equal to 2, `n` is a positive integer such that `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is a positive integer equal to the length of `divisors`.**
