You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a positive integer $n$.

Find a sequence of fractions $\frac{a_i}{b_i}$, $i = 1 \ldots k$ (where $a_i$ and $b_i$ are positive integers) for some $k$ such that:

$$ \begin{cases} \text{$b_i$ divides $n$, $1 < b_i < n$ for $i = 1 \ldots k$} \\ \text{$1 \le a_i < b_i$ for $i = 1 \ldots k$} \\ \text{$\sum\limits_{i=1}^k \frac{a_i}{b_i} = 1 - \frac{1}{n}$} \end{cases} $$


-----Input-----

The input consists of a single integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

In the first line print "YES" if there exists such a sequence of fractions or "NO" otherwise.

If there exists such a sequence, next lines should contain a description of the sequence in the following format.

The second line should contain integer $k$ ($1 \le k \le 100\,000$) — the number of elements in the sequence. It is guaranteed that if such a sequence exists, then there exists a sequence of length at most $100\,000$.

Next $k$ lines should contain fractions of the sequence with two integers $a_i$ and $b_i$ on each line.


-----Examples-----
Input
2

Output
NO

Input
6

Output
YES
2
1 2
1 3



-----Note-----

In the second example there is a sequence $\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}$ such that $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = 1 - \frac{1}{6}$.
Program:
```
import math

n = int(input().strip())
result = func_1(n)
print(result)

def func_1(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return 'NO'
    divisors = []
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i != n // i:
                divisors.append(n // i)
    if not divisors:
        return 'NO'
    k = len(divisors)
    fractions = [(1, d) for d in divisors]
    return f'YES\n{k}\n' + '\n'.join((f'{a} {b}' for (a, b) in fractions))


```
Original Assessment: To analyze the correctness of the provided program concerning the given problem description, we need to verify whether it correctly finds fractions \( \frac{a_i}{b_i} \) such that:

1. \( b_i \) divides \( n \), \( 1 < b_i < n \)
2. \( 1 \le a_i < b_i \)
3. The sum \( \sum \frac{a_i}{b_i} = 1 - \frac{1}{n} \)

Here's the program provided:

```python
import math

n = int(input().strip())
result = func_1(n)
print(result)

def func_1(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return 'NO'
    divisors = []
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i != n // i:
                divisors.append(n // i)
    if not divisors:
        return 'NO'
    k = len(divisors)
    fractions = [(1, d) for d in divisors]
    return f'YES\n{k}\n' + '\n'.join((f'{a} {b}' for (a, b) in fractions))
```

### Testing the program:

1. **Case when \( n = 2 \)**:
   - The output is "NO", which is correct because there are no divisors \( b_i \) that meet the \( 1 < b_i < n \) condition.

2. **Case when \( n = 3 \)**:
   - The program will output "NO" because the only divisor is 3, which does not satisfy \( 1 < b_i < 3 \).

3. **Case when \( n = 4 \)**:
   - The divisors would be 2. The program outputs:
     ```
     YES
     1
     1 2
     ```
   - This is correct, and \( \frac{1}{2} = 1 - \frac{1}{4} \).

4. **Case when \( n = 5 \)**:
   - The output is "NO", which is correct since 5 is prime and the only divisor is 5 itself.

5. **Case when \( n = 6 \)**:
   - The program finds the divisors [2, 3] and outputs:
     ```
     YES
     2
     1 2
     1 3
     ```
   - \( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{3}{6} = 1 - \frac{1}{6} \) which is correct.

### Problematic Case:

- **Case when \( n = 12 \)**:
   - Divisors would be [2, 3, 4, 6]. 
   - The program will output:
     ```
     YES
     4
     1 2
     1 3
     1 4
     1 6
     ```
   - However, the correct sum should equal \( 1 - \frac{1}{12} = \frac{11}{12} \), and \( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{6} = 1\), which is incorrect.

Since there are cases where the output does not meet the requirements of the problem description, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
n = int(input().strip())
result = func_1(n)
print(result)

import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9.
def func_1(n):
    if (n <= 2) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO' since the current value of n is less than or equal to 2.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9, and `n` is greater than 2.
    divisors = []
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i != n // i:
                divisors.append(n // i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `divisors` contains all divisors of `n` greater than or equal to 2, and `n` is a positive integer such that `n` is greater than or equal to 3. If no divisors are found, `divisors` remains an empty list.
    if (not divisors) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO', indicating that no divisors of the positive integer n, which is greater than or equal to 3, have been found.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`divisors` contains all divisors of `n` greater than or equal to 2, and `n` is a positive integer such that `n` is greater than or equal to 3. `divisors` is not an empty list, meaning at least one divisor of `n` greater than or equal to 2 exists.
    k = len(divisors)
    fractions = [(1, d) for d in divisors]
    return f'YES\n{k}\n' + '\n'.join(f'{a} {b}' for a, b in fractions)
    #The program returns 'YES', the value of k, which is the length of divisors (the number of divisors of n greater than or equal to 2), and the list of fractions formatted as '1 d' for each divisor d in divisors.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
