        #The program returns 'NO' since the current value of n is less than or equal to 2.

        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `divisors` contains all divisors of `n` greater than or equal to 2, and `n` is a positive integer such that `n` is greater than or equal to 3. If no divisors are found, `divisors` remains an empty list.
    if (not divisors) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO', indicating that no divisors of the positive integer n, which is greater than or equal to 3, have been found.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`divisors` contains all divisors of `n` greater than or equal to 2, and `n` is a positive integer such that `n` is greater than or equal to 3. `divisors` is not an empty list, meaning at least one divisor of `n` greater than or equal to 2 exists.
    k = len(divisors)
    fractions = [(1, d) for d in divisors]
    return f'YES\n{k}\n' + '\n'.join(f'{a} {b}' for a, b in fractions)
    #The program returns 'YES', the value of k, which is the length of divisors (the number of divisors of n greater than or equal to 2), and the list of fractions formatted as '1 d' for each divisor d in divisors.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n`. It returns 'NO' if `n` is less than or equal to 2. If `n` is greater than 2 and has no divisors (meaning it is prime), it returns 'NO'. If divisors exist, it returns 'YES', the count of these divisors, and a list of fractions formatted as '1 d' for each divisor `d` of `n`. This means that if `n` is a prime number, it will still return 'NO' instead of returning an empty list indicating no valid fractions. The function does not directly handle the case of `n` being a prime number in the annotations, which is a potential missing point.
