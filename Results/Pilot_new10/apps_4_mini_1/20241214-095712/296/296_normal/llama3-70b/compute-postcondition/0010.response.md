The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters as its signature suggests it takes no arguments. However, it operates under the constraint that there is a positive integer `n` such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\) which may be implied as a global variable or as a precondition for the function operation. 

Since there is no return value specified in the outputs provided, we cannot ascertain any specific result from the function. Therefore, the functionality of the function is indeterminate based on the provided information.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters, and the return value is not specified, making its functionality indeterminate.**
