Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the required logic for generating the sequence of fractions that satisfy the given conditions.

1. For any integer `n` greater than 2, the program always outputs "YES" and only provides the fractions `1/(n // 2)` and `1/n`. However, there are no checks in place to ensure that the fractions formed meet the conditions outlined in the problem description, specifically that `b_i` divides `n`, `1 < b_i < n`, and `1 â‰¤ a_i < b_i`.

2. If we analyze the case for `n = 4`, the program outputs:
   ```
   YES
   2
   1 2
   1 4
   ```
   Here, the fractions are:
   - `1/2` (valid as `b_1` divides `4` and is between `1` and `4`)
   - `1/4` (not valid because `b_2` does not satisfy `1 < b_2 < n`)
   The result of `1/2 + 1/4` is `3/4`, which does not equal `1 - 1/4`.

3. Additionally, there are cases where no valid sequence of fractions can be formed (e.g., `n = 3`). The output for `n = 3` should be "NO", but given the existing implementation, it should malfunction or provide incomplete answers.

Therefore, the presence of situations like these demonstrates that the program fails to adhere to the problem description for all potential inputs, resulting in the final classification of correctness as **False**.
