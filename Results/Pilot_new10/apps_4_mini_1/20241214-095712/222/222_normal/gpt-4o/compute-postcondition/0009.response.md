`positions` is updated by appending the value of `i` to it. The current value of `i` is `4 * k + 3`, and thus it is appended to the list `positions`, which initially was `[1, 2 * k + 2]`. After the append operation, `positions` will become `[1, 2 * k + 2, 4 * k + 3]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` must be at least `4 * k + 3`, `positions` is [1, 2 * k + 2, 4 * k + 3], `i` is equal to `4 * k + 3`**
