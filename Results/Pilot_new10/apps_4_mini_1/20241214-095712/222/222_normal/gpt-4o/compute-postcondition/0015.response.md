Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of skewers and a non-negative integer `k` indicating how many skewers are turned over from each side in one action. It generates a list of positions based on the formula starting from 1 and increasing by `2 * k + 1` until the next position exceeds `n`. It prints the count of positions and the positions themselves. The function does not return a value; it only outputs results to the console. Additionally, it does not return `0` or `2 * k + 1` as stated in the annotations, and it lacks functionality for handling cases where `k` is greater than or equal to `n`.**
