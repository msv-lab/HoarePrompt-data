The code `positions.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `positions`. Since `i` is currently 1, this means that 1 will be added to the `positions` list. The initial state of `positions` was an empty list, so after the execution, `positions` will contain the value [1]. The variables `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `k` is a non-negative integer (0 <= k <= min(n-1, 1000)), `positions` is [1], `i` is 1**
