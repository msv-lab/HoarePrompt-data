The statement `positions.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the end of the `positions` list. The previous conditions state that `positions` starts as `[1]`, and `i` is defined as `1 + (2 * k + 1)`, simplifying to `2 * k + 2`.

So, the value of `i` is a specific value of `2 * k + 2`. As a result, after executing the code, the `positions` list will now contain the value of `i` appended to it.

Thus, the output state will reflect the updated `positions` list and the values of `n`, `k`, and `i`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least `2 * k + 2`, `k` is a non-negative integer (0 <= k <= min(n-1, 1000)), `positions` is [1, 2 * k + 2], `i` is equal to `2 * k + 2`**
