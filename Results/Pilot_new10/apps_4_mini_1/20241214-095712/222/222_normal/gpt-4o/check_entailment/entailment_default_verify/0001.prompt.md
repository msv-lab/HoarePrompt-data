You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Long story short, shashlik is Miroslav's favorite food. Shashlik is prepared on several skewers simultaneously. There are two states for each skewer: initial and turned over.

This time Miroslav laid out $n$ skewers parallel to each other, and enumerated them with consecutive integers from $1$ to $n$ in order from left to right. For better cooking, he puts them quite close to each other, so when he turns skewer number $i$, it leads to turning $k$ closest skewers from each side of the skewer $i$, that is, skewers number $i - k$, $i - k + 1$, ..., $i - 1$, $i + 1$, ..., $i + k - 1$, $i + k$ (if they exist). 

For example, let $n = 6$ and $k = 1$. When Miroslav turns skewer number $3$, then skewers with numbers $2$, $3$, and $4$ will come up turned over. If after that he turns skewer number $1$, then skewers number $1$, $3$, and $4$ will be turned over, while skewer number $2$ will be in the initial position (because it is turned again).

As we said before, the art of cooking requires perfect timing, so Miroslav wants to turn over all $n$ skewers with the minimal possible number of actions. For example, for the above example $n = 6$ and $k = 1$, two turnings are sufficient: he can turn over skewers number $2$ and $5$.

Help Miroslav turn over all $n$ skewers.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \leq n \leq 1000$, $0 \leq k \leq 1000$) — the number of skewers and the number of skewers from each side that are turned in one step.


-----Output-----

The first line should contain integer $l$ — the minimum number of actions needed by Miroslav to turn over all $n$ skewers. After than print $l$ integers from $1$ to $n$ denoting the number of the skewer that is to be turned over at the corresponding step.


-----Examples-----
Input
7 2

Output
2
1 6 

Input
5 1

Output
2
1 4 



-----Note-----

In the first example the first operation turns over skewers $1$, $2$ and $3$, the second operation turns over skewers $4$, $5$, $6$ and $7$.

In the second example it is also correct to turn over skewers $2$ and $5$, but turning skewers $2$ and $4$, or $1$ and $5$ are incorrect solutions because the skewer $3$ is in the initial state after these operations.
Program:
```
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
func_1(n, k)

def func_1(n, k):
    positions = []
    i = 1
    while i <= n:
        positions.append(i)
        i += 2 * k + 1
    print(len(positions))
    print(' '.join(map(str, positions)))


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze it step by step.

The program appears to implement a function that decides how many skewer turns Miroslav needs to make in order to cover all skewers, using the logic of turning a skewer and affecting the surrounding ones based on the value of \( k \).

### Program Examination

1. **Input Handling**: 
   The first line of input reads two integers \( n \) (number of skewers) and \( k \) (the range of skewers turned over per action).

2. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes an empty list called `positions` to store the skewers that will be turned.
   - It starts at skewer `1` and keeps adding skewers to the `positions` list while incrementing `i` by \( 2k + 1 \) for each turn. The reasoning behind this is that when you turn skewer `i`, it affects \( k \) skewers on both sides, hence covering \( 2k + 1 \) skewers total.

3. **Output**: 
   The program prints the total number of turning actions needed (length of `positions`) followed by the skewers that should be turned.

### Example Check

Let's consider a few edge cases:

- **Case 1**: \( n = 1 \), \( k = 0 \)
   - Expected output: 1 (only skewer 1 needs to be turned)
   - Current output: 
     ```
     1
     1
     ```
   This is valid.

- **Case 2**: \( n = 6 \), \( k = 1 \)
   - Expected output: 2 (turn skewer 2 and skewer 5)
   - Current output of the function will be:
     - Positions would be [1, 4] (turning skewer 1 covers skewers 1, 2, 3; turning skewer 4 covers 4, 5, 6)
     - Expected output: 
       ```
       2
       1 4
       ```
   This does not fully turn over skewers 2 and 3. The correct sequence should ensure that all skewers are flipped. Thus, it is incorrect.

- **Case 3**: \( n = 7 \), \( k = 2 \)
   - Expected output: 2 turns (turn skewer 3 and skewer 6).
   - But the function will turn skewers [1, 5], which will leave skewers 2, 3, 4 and those around skewer 6 unturned.

The implementation fails to find the minimum turns needed for various \( n \) and \( k \) values, particularly for the situation when `k` is non-zero and \( n \) is not structured as a multiple of \( 2k + 1 \).

### Conclusion

The function does not correctly cover all potential skewers for all possible values of \( k \) and \( n \). Therefore, it can produce incorrect results where skewers are left unturned after the minimal actions are taken.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of skewers and a non-negative integer `k` indicating how many skewers are turned over from each side in one action. It generates a list of positions based on the formula starting from 1 and increasing by `2 * k + 1` until the next position exceeds `n`. It prints the count of positions and the positions themselves. The function does not return a value; it only outputs results to the console. Additionally, it does not return `0` or `2 * k + 1` as stated in the annotations, and it lacks functionality for handling cases where `k` is greater than or equal to `n`. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
