You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Long story short, shashlik is Miroslav's favorite food. Shashlik is prepared on several skewers simultaneously. There are two states for each skewer: initial and turned over.

This time Miroslav laid out $n$ skewers parallel to each other, and enumerated them with consecutive integers from $1$ to $n$ in order from left to right. For better cooking, he puts them quite close to each other, so when he turns skewer number $i$, it leads to turning $k$ closest skewers from each side of the skewer $i$, that is, skewers number $i - k$, $i - k + 1$, ..., $i - 1$, $i + 1$, ..., $i + k - 1$, $i + k$ (if they exist). 

For example, let $n = 6$ and $k = 1$. When Miroslav turns skewer number $3$, then skewers with numbers $2$, $3$, and $4$ will come up turned over. If after that he turns skewer number $1$, then skewers number $1$, $3$, and $4$ will be turned over, while skewer number $2$ will be in the initial position (because it is turned again).

As we said before, the art of cooking requires perfect timing, so Miroslav wants to turn over all $n$ skewers with the minimal possible number of actions. For example, for the above example $n = 6$ and $k = 1$, two turnings are sufficient: he can turn over skewers number $2$ and $5$.

Help Miroslav turn over all $n$ skewers.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \leq n \leq 1000$, $0 \leq k \leq 1000$) — the number of skewers and the number of skewers from each side that are turned in one step.


-----Output-----

The first line should contain integer $l$ — the minimum number of actions needed by Miroslav to turn over all $n$ skewers. After than print $l$ integers from $1$ to $n$ denoting the number of the skewer that is to be turned over at the corresponding step.


-----Examples-----
Input
7 2

Output
2
1 6 

Input
5 1

Output
2
1 4 



-----Note-----

In the first example the first operation turns over skewers $1$, $2$ and $3$, the second operation turns over skewers $4$, $5$, $6$ and $7$.

In the second example it is also correct to turn over skewers $2$ and $5$, but turning skewers $2$ and $4$, or $1$ and $5$ are incorrect solutions because the skewer $3$ is in the initial state after these operations.
Program:
```
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
func_1(n, k)

def func_1(n, k):
    positions = []
    i = 1
    while i <= n:
        positions.append(i)
        i += 2 * k + 1
    print(len(positions))
    print(' '.join(map(str, positions)))


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

The problem asks for the minimum number of skewer turning actions needed to turn all skewers from `1` to `n`, considering that turning skewer `i` affects `k` skewers to the left and `k` skewers to the right. 

The provided program works as follows:
1. It reads the input values `n` (number of skewers) and `k` (number of skewers affected on each side when one is turned).
2. Inside `func_1`, it initializes an empty list `positions` to store the indices of the skewers that will be turned.
3. It uses a loop to increment the index `i` by `2 * k + 1` for each iteration, and appends `i` to the list `positions` as long as `i` is within bounds (i.e., `i <= n`).
4. Finally, it prints the count of positions and the respective skewer indices in `positions`.

Let's consider some examples:

1. For `n = 7` and `k = 2`:
   - Expected output: Turn skewer `1` (affects `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`) and then `6` (affects `5, 6, 7`), done in `2` operations.
   - Actual output from the program: It will turn `1` and `6`, resulting in the desired output. 

2. For `n = 5` and `k = 1`:
   - Expected output: Turn over skewer `1` (affects `1, 2, 3`) and then `4` (affects `4, 5`), done in `2` operations.
   - Actual output from the program: It will also print `1` and `4`, also resulting in the desired output.

Now, let’s consider a case where the program might fail:
- If `k = 0`, turning any skewer only affects itself. Thus, to turn all skewers, Miroslav would need to turn each skewer individually.
   - For `n = 4` and `k = 0`, the expected output is:
     - Turn `1` (affects `1`), `2` (affects `2`), `3` (affects `3`), and `4` (affects `4`) → 4 operations in total, with outputs `1, 2, 3, 4`.
   - However, the program incorrectly computes that only `positions.append(i)` is sufficient, producing indices `1` and `3` with `2` operations instead, missing to turn skewers `2` and `4`.

Given this case where the program fails, we conclude that it does not fulfill the requirement for every potential case, specifically when `k = 0`.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
func_1(n, k)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000) representing the number of skewers, and k is a non-negative integer (0 <= k <= min(n-1, 1000)) representing the number of skewers turned over from each side in one action.
def func_1(n, k):
    positions = []
    i = 1
    while i <= n:
        positions.append(i)
        
        i += 2 * k + 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `positions` contains m values which are `1, 1 + (2 * k + 1), 1 + 2 * (2 * k + 1), ..., 1 + (m - 1) * (2 * k + 1)` where `1 + m * (2 * k + 1) > n`, `i` is `1 + m * (2 * k + 1)`, and there are `m` iterations where `m` is the largest integer such that `1 + m * (2 * k + 1) <= n`.
    print(len(positions))
    print(' '.join(map(str, positions)))


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
