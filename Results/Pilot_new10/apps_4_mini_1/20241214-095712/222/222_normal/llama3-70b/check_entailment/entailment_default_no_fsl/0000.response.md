Correctness: **False**

The program does not accurately handle the requirements of the problem description. 

Let's consider how the program is supposed to work as per the problem statement. Miroslav can turn over a skewer `i`, and this action affects `k` skewers on either side of `i` as well, meaning that when he turns skewer `i`, skewers in the range from `i - k` to `i + k` (if they exist) also get turned over.

The core problem is that the logic implemented in the program for calculating the number of actions (`l`) and the skewers to turn may not produce a valid sequence for all cases of `n` and `k`.

For example, let's take the case with `n = 5` and `k = 2`:
- According to the logic of the program, it would compute `l` as:
  ```python
  l = (5 + 2) // (2 * 2 + 1) => (7 // 5) => 1
  ```
- The program would then select only the first skewer:
  ```python
  res = [1]
  ```
  
However, when skewer 1 is turned, it will only turn skewers 1, 2, 3, and leave skewers 4 and 5 unturned. The optimal strategy here would actually require turning either skewer 1 and skewer 4 or any other combination that ensures all are turned.

The output hints don't provide enough context for various values of `n` and `k`, particularly for edge cases where the choice of which skewer to turn could lead to unturned skewers, which the program does not address.

Thus, the program fails to guarantee correctness for all inputs specified in the problem description.
