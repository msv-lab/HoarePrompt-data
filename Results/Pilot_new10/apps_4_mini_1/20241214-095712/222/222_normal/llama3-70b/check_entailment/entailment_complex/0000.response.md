The provided program appears to misrepresent the problem description and doesn't account for various possible scenarios.

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to turn over all skewers, with each skewer turning over itself and 'k' skewers from each side. This means that turning a single skewer affects multiple skewers around it.

2. **Analysis of the Function**:
   - The function calculates `l`, which is the minimum number of actions needed as `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`. This formula indeed represents the number of groups of skewers that need to be turned over, but its resultant values may not ensure that all skewers are turned over correctly in all configurations/edge cases.
   - The initialized list `res` attempts to store indices of the skewers to turn based on the formula `(i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1)`. While this can give starting points for some cases, it does not guarantee coverage for all indices between 1 and n in all scenarios, especially when `k` is zero or close to `n`.

3. **Counter-examples**:
   - For small values of `n` and specific values of `k`, it's possible that the calculated indices do not provide the necessary coverage to turn over all skewers. For example, with `n=5` and `k=0`, the program will output 5, which means it will suggest turning the first skewer only, thus missing others if they are not turned.
   - Specifically, if `k` equals zero, turning a single skewer only affects that skewer, and the algorithm fails to account properly for such cases, leading to situations where skewer(s) may remain untouched.

In conclusion, the program does not handle all edge cases and configurations described in the problem statement effectively.

Correctness: **False**.
