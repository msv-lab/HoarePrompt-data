You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Long story short, shashlik is Miroslav's favorite food. Shashlik is prepared on several skewers simultaneously. There are two states for each skewer: initial and turned over.

This time Miroslav laid out $n$ skewers parallel to each other, and enumerated them with consecutive integers from $1$ to $n$ in order from left to right. For better cooking, he puts them quite close to each other, so when he turns skewer number $i$, it leads to turning $k$ closest skewers from each side of the skewer $i$, that is, skewers number $i - k$, $i - k + 1$, ..., $i - 1$, $i + 1$, ..., $i + k - 1$, $i + k$ (if they exist). 

For example, let $n = 6$ and $k = 1$. When Miroslav turns skewer number $3$, then skewers with numbers $2$, $3$, and $4$ will come up turned over. If after that he turns skewer number $1$, then skewers number $1$, $3$, and $4$ will be turned over, while skewer number $2$ will be in the initial position (because it is turned again).

As we said before, the art of cooking requires perfect timing, so Miroslav wants to turn over all $n$ skewers with the minimal possible number of actions. For example, for the above example $n = 6$ and $k = 1$, two turnings are sufficient: he can turn over skewers number $2$ and $5$.

Help Miroslav turn over all $n$ skewers.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \leq n \leq 1000$, $0 \leq k \leq 1000$) — the number of skewers and the number of skewers from each side that are turned in one step.


-----Output-----

The first line should contain integer $l$ — the minimum number of actions needed by Miroslav to turn over all $n$ skewers. After than print $l$ integers from $1$ to $n$ denoting the number of the skewer that is to be turned over at the corresponding step.


-----Examples-----
Input
7 2

Output
2
1 6 

Input
5 1

Output
2
1 4 



-----Note-----

In the first example the first operation turns over skewers $1$, $2$ and $3$, the second operation turns over skewers $4$, $5$, $6$ and $7$.

In the second example it is also correct to turn over skewers $2$ and $5$, but turning skewers $2$ and $4$, or $1$ and $5$ are incorrect solutions because the skewer $3$ is in the initial state after these operations.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    l = (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)
    res = []
    for i in range(l):
        res.append(i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1)
    print(l)
    print(' '.join(map(str, res)))


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze how the program intends to turn all skewers while considering the impact of the turning mechanism defined by $k$.

The program calculates the minimum number of turns required with the formula:
```python
l = (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)
```
Then, it creates a result list that represents which skewers are turned over by iterating `l` times and appending the skewer number being turned over (which is calculated as `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`).

Let's dissect any potential pitfalls:

1. **Understanding the Turning Logic**:
    - When turning skewer `i`, skewers from `i - k` to `i + k` (if they exist) are affected. This means that the effective range of skewers impacted by one turn is `i-k, ..., i, ..., i+k`.
  
2. **Potential Issues**:
    - If `k` is `0`, turning skewer `i` will only affect skewer `i` itself. The program should ensure that skewers are turned sequentially, which means it needs to choose a skewer that minimizes gaps where skewers are not turned over.
    - If `k` is large enough such that `2k + 1` is greater than `n`, one turn would cover all skewers.

3. **Case Analysis**:
   - For the input where `n = 1` and `k = 0`:
        - Expected output: There is only one skewer, which would require exactly 1 action to turn it over.
        - Calculation by the program: `l = (1 + 0 - 1) // (0 * 2 + 1)` results in `l = 1`, and `res` will contain `[1]`.
        - This is correct.

   - For the input where `n = 5` and `k = 1`:
        - Expected output: It can turn skewers 1 and 4 which will invert all (1, 2, 3) and (4, 5).
        - Calculation by the program: `l = (5 + 1 - 1) // (1 * 2 + 1)` gives `l = 2`, and `res` will be `[1, 4]`.
        - This is correct.

   - For `n = 7`, `k = 2`:
        - Expected output: One efficient choice could be to turn skewer 1 and skewer 5.
        - Calculation: `l = (7 + 2 - 1) // (2 * 2 + 1)`, results in `l = 2`, and `res` will be `[1, 6]`.
        - This is correct.

4. **Edge Cases** Thus validating that the core logic calculates with minimal adjustments required.

After careful evaluation, the program appears to handle all potential scenarios related to the turning of skewers correctly as prescribed by the problem description.

Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of actions needed and identifies which skewers should be turned to ensure all skewers are affected as described in the problem.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts two integers, `n` and `k`, input via standard input, where `1 <= n <= 1000` and `0 <= k <= 1000`. It calculates the integer `l` as the ceiling of `(n + k) / (k * 2 + 1)` and generates a list of length `l`, where each element is calculated based on the formula `(i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1)`. It then prints the value of `l` and the elements of the list `res` as space-separated values. This function does not handle cases where the inputs might violate the specified bounds or provide any type of error feedback for invalid inputs. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
