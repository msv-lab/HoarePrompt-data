To determine if the annotated Python program correctly addresses the problem description, we need to analyze both the requirements laid out in the description and the logic implemented in the program.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. There are `n` skewers indexed from `1` to `n`.
2. When skewer `i` is turned over, it affects `k` skewers on both sides as well as skewer `i` itself.
3. The goal is to turn all skewers over using the minimum number of actions.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: It reads two integers, `n` and `k`.
2. **Calculation of Actions (`l`)**: The program computes the minimum number of actions required to turn over all skewers using the formula `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`. This formula effectively groups skewers that can be turned over with each action.
   - The value `k * 2 + 1` represents the total number of skewers affected by each action (the skewer itself and `k` skewers on each side).
   - `l` is calculated as the total number of groups of skewers that can be turned over in minimal actions.
3. **Generating Indices**: The program constructs a list `res` that holds the starting indices of each group of skewers to turn over. It does this by incrementally adding the width of the affected range.

### Key Condition to Check:
- The indices generated by the program must cover all skewers from `1` to `n` when turned over.

### Example Walkthrough:
Taking the input `n = 7`, `k = 2`:
- The calculation for `l` would be `(7 + 2 - 1) // (2 * 2 + 1) = 2`.
- The indices generated would be:
  - For `i = 0`: `1` (turns skewer numbers `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`).
  - For `i = 1`: `6` (turns skewer numbers `5`, `6`, `7`).

This indeed covers all skewers.

### Edge Cases:
1. **When `k = 0`**: Each skewer can only turn itself, requiring `n` operations, but the program would correctly calculate `l = n`.
2. **When `k` exceeds `n`**: The program will still work because `(k * 2 + 1)` will be larger than `n` resulting in `l = 1`, turning over all skewers in one go, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The logic correctly computes the number of minimal operations to turn all skewers properly, and the generated list fulfills the requirement by ensuring every skewer is included in the turning action. It adheres to the problemâ€™s conditions under all stipulated constraints.

Thus, the correctness of the program based on the problem description is:

Correctness: **True**
