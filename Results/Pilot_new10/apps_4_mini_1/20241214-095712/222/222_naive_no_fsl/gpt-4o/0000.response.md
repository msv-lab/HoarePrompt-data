To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze it step by step.

The program appears to implement a function that decides how many skewer turns Miroslav needs to make in order to cover all skewers, using the logic of turning a skewer and affecting the surrounding ones based on the value of \( k \).

### Program Examination

1. **Input Handling**: 
   The first line of input reads two integers \( n \) (number of skewers) and \( k \) (the range of skewers turned over per action).

2. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes an empty list called `positions` to store the skewers that will be turned.
   - It starts at skewer `1` and keeps adding skewers to the `positions` list while incrementing `i` by \( 2k + 1 \) for each turn. The reasoning behind this is that when you turn skewer `i`, it affects \( k \) skewers on both sides, hence covering \( 2k + 1 \) skewers total.

3. **Output**: 
   The program prints the total number of turning actions needed (length of `positions`) followed by the skewers that should be turned.

### Example Check

Let's consider a few edge cases:

- **Case 1**: \( n = 1 \), \( k = 0 \)
   - Expected output: 1 (only skewer 1 needs to be turned)
   - Current output: 
     ```
     1
     1
     ```
   This is valid.

- **Case 2**: \( n = 6 \), \( k = 1 \)
   - Expected output: 2 (turn skewer 2 and skewer 5)
   - Current output of the function will be:
     - Positions would be [1, 4] (turning skewer 1 covers skewers 1, 2, 3; turning skewer 4 covers 4, 5, 6)
     - Expected output: 
       ```
       2
       1 4
       ```
   This does not fully turn over skewers 2 and 3. The correct sequence should ensure that all skewers are flipped. Thus, it is incorrect.

- **Case 3**: \( n = 7 \), \( k = 2 \)
   - Expected output: 2 turns (turn skewer 3 and skewer 6).
   - But the function will turn skewers [1, 5], which will leave skewers 2, 3, 4 and those around skewer 6 unturned.

The implementation fails to find the minimum turns needed for various \( n \) and \( k \) values, particularly for the situation when `k` is non-zero and \( n \) is not structured as a multiple of \( 2k + 1 \).

### Conclusion

The function does not correctly cover all potential skewers for all possible values of \( k \) and \( n \). Therefore, it can produce incorrect results where skewers are left unturned after the minimal actions are taken.

Correctness: **False**
