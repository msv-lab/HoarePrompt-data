Given the initial state where `s` is a positive integer such that \( 2 \leq s \leq 10^{12} \), `x` is a non-negative integer such that \( 0 \leq x \leq 10^{12} \), and `a` is equal to `b ^ x`, let's analyze the impact of the code:

The line `b = a ^ x` means `b` is assigned the value of `a` XORed with `x`. Since `a` is `b ^ x`, we can substitute this into the expression for `b`:

1. `b` is calculated as `b = (b ^ x) ^ x`. 
2. By the properties of the XOR operation, we know that `x ^ x = 0`, which implies that `b = b ^ 0` (i.e., `b` remains unchanged).

Thus, `b` retains its original value, and the relationship defined by `a` (which is still equal to `b ^ x`) continues to hold true.

Now, there's no change in the values of `s`, `x`, or `a`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: **`s` is a positive integer such that 2 <= s <= 10^12, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x <= 10^12, `a` is equal to `b ^ x`, `b` remains unchanged as `b`.**
