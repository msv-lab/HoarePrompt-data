You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Two positive integers a and b have a sum of s and a bitwise XOR of x. How many possible values are there for the ordered pair (a, b)?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers s and x (2 ≤ s ≤ 10^12, 0 ≤ x ≤ 10^12), the sum and bitwise xor of the pair of positive integers, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, the number of solutions to the given conditions. If no solutions exist, print 0.


-----Examples-----
Input
9 5

Output
4

Input
3 3

Output
2

Input
5 2

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first sample, we have the following solutions: (2, 7), (3, 6), (6, 3), (7, 2).

In the second sample, the only solutions are (1, 2) and (2, 1).
Program:
```
def func():
    a = b ^ x
    b = a ^ x


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic necessary to solve the problem as described. The task requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that a + b = s and a ^ b = x. 

The current implementation does not compute the values of a and b based on the given sum s and XOR x; instead, it tries to derive them incorrectly using bitwise operations without focusing on the problem requirements. 

For example, if we take the input `s = 9` and `x = 5`, the correct logic involves the following steps:

1. Verify whether x is greater than s. If so, there are no valid pairs since XOR cannot exceed the sum.
2. Calculate two values: `a + b = s` and `a ^ b = x`. From these, derive the conditions for (a, b).
3. The derivation shows that (s - x) must be non-negative and even for valid (a, b) pairs.

However, the function as written does not perform these checks and computations, making it incorrect according to the requirements of the problem description. 

As an example, the input `s = 9` and `x = 5` should yield 4 valid pairs (2, 7), (3, 6), (6, 3), (7, 2), but the provided program does not approach the problem correctly to produce this result.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function does not accept any parameters nor does it return any defined output. It seems to perform bitwise operations on two variables `a` and `b` using a non-defined variable `x`, but without any provided logic for parameter input or result output, the purpose is ambiguous. There are no checks for the conditions specified in the annotations, and the lack of return value means the function ultimately yields no result or state back to the caller. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
