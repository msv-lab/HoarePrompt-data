#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a positive integer such that 2 <= s <= 10^12, x is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x <= 10^12, and s must be greater than x for valid pairs (a, b) to exist.
def func():
    a = b ^ x
    b = a ^ x
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters nor does it return any defined output. It seems to perform bitwise operations on two variables `a` and `b` using a non-defined variable `x`, but without any provided logic for parameter input or result output, the purpose is ambiguous. There are no checks for the conditions specified in the annotations, and the lack of return value means the function ultimately yields no result or state back to the caller.
