The code will assign new values to `s` and `x` based on the user's input. However, since the specific values of `s` and `x` are not provided, it is understood that both variables will take on new integer values from the input. Therefore, their earlier ranges will apply after the code is executed.

The impact of the code on the program is:
- `s` is updated to a new non-negative integer input.
- `x` is updated to a new non-negative integer input.

The valid range constraints for `s` and `x` will still hold, but specific values will change based on user input.

Output State: **`s` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ s ≤ 10^12; `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ x ≤ 10^12; `s` is a new input integer; `x` is a new input integer.**
