You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Two positive integers a and b have a sum of s and a bitwise XOR of x. How many possible values are there for the ordered pair (a, b)?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers s and x (2 ≤ s ≤ 10^12, 0 ≤ x ≤ 10^12), the sum and bitwise xor of the pair of positive integers, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, the number of solutions to the given conditions. If no solutions exist, print 0.


-----Examples-----
Input
9 5

Output
4

Input
3 3

Output
2

Input
5 2

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first sample, we have the following solutions: (2, 7), (3, 6), (6, 3), (7, 2).

In the second sample, the only solutions are (1, 2) and (2, 1).
Program:
```
def func():
    (s, x) = map(int, input().split())
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, s):
        b = s - a
        if a ^ b == x:
            count += 1
    print(count)


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze if the program successfully counts the valid ordered pairs (a, b) such that:

1. **a + b = s**
2. **a ^ b = x**

**Analyzing the Logic:**
1. The program uses a loop that generates each possible value of `a` from 1 to `s - 1`, calculates `b` as `s - a`, and checks if `a ^ b` equals `x`.
2. It counts valid pairs and prints the count at the end.

**Potential Issues:**
- The solution only checks pairs without considering whether they are positive integers or adhering to the constraints implied by the XOR operation.
- There are specific mathematical conditions based on the properties of sum and bitwise XOR that the program does not address:
  - If `x > s`, there are no solutions because the maximum `x` for two positive integers that sum to `s` cannot exceed `s`.
  - If `(s - x) % 2 != 0`, there can't be a pair of positive integers (a, b) that meets both conditions. This is because the sum of two integers and their XOR must yield evenness in their composition.

**Examples to Consider:**
1. **Case 1:** Input (9, 5)
   - Expected output: 4
   - The program accurately checks pairs and provides the correct answer.

2. **Case 2:** Input (3, 3)
   - Expected output: 2
   - The program again accurately provides the correct answer.

3. **Edge Case:** Input (5, 2)
   - Expected output: 0
   - The program will check and output the number of pairs accurately providing 0.

**Issue Found:**
- **Input Case:** (10, 5)
  - Expected output is to find pairs like (5, 5) but also verifying the program: the program will actually output 0, as it does not check positivity and the constraints imposed by XOR implicitly.

The conditions related to sum (`s`) and XOR (`x`) are not fully captured by the loop.

Thus, there are uncovered scenarios where the program will not provide expected results, indicating it's incorrect.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ s ≤ 10^12, and x is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ x ≤ 10^12.
def func():
    s, x = map(int, input().split())
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, s):
        b = s - a
        
        if a ^ b == x:
            count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `s` ≤ 10^12, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^12, `count` is the number of pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 ≤ a < s`, `b = s - a`, and `a ^ b = x`
    print(count)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers `s` (2 ≤ s ≤ 10^12) and `x` (0 ≤ x ≤ 10^12) from user input, and counts the number of pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 ≤ a < s`, `b = s - a`, and `a XOR b = x`. It then prints the count of such pairs. The function does not return a value.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
