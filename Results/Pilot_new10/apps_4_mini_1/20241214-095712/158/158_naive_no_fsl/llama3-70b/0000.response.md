To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic implemented in the code.

The program takes in three integers representing the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`). The requirement is to maintain the ratio of fruits in the compote as follows:
- 1 lemon
- 2 apples
- 4 pears

The program calculates how many complete sets of this ratio can be formed based on the available fruits with the line:
```python
min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
```
This line efficiently determines the maximum number of lemons that can be used to form the sets based on the availability of apples and pears.

Then it computes the total number of fruits used based on the ratio:
```python
print(min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4)
```
This simplifies to:
- `min_lemon` for lemons
- `2 * min_lemon` for apples
- `4 * min_lemon` for pears

Thus, the final output is the total number of fruits that can be utilized to form the compote.

Now, let's consider edge cases:

1. If `a`, `b`, and `c` do not allow any complete ratio to be formed, the output should be `0`. For example:
   - Input: `1`, `1`, `1` (only 1 of each fruit)
   - Output: `0` (not enough apples and pears)

The program correctly handles this case.
2. If `a`, `b`, and `c` are all perfectly matched to ratios. For instance:
   - Input: `4`, `8`, `16` (4 lemons, 8 apples, 16 pears)
   - Output: `4 + 8 + 16 = 28` (correct).

Given the provided examples in the problem description, they all adhere to the expected output logic defined by the input values provided.

After evaluating the logic, no counterexample was found where the program fails to satisfy the conditions laid out in the problem description. 

Thus, based on the analysis, we conclude:

Correctness: **True**
