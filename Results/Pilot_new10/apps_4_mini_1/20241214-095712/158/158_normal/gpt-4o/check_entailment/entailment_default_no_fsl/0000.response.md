Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It checks the quantities of lemons, apples, and pears (a, b, and c respectively) and calculates how many complete sets of fruits can be used to form the compote based on the required ratio of 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears.

Here's a breakdown of how it works:
1. It reads the inputs for the number of lemons (a), apples (b), and pears (c).
2. It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be included in the compote by using the minimum of:
   - The available lemons `a`,
   - The number of apples divided by 2 (since 2 apples are needed for each lemon),
   - The number of pears divided by 4 (since 4 pears are needed for each lemon).
3. It computes the total number of fruits (lemons, apples, and pears) that can be used based on the maximum valid lemons calculated.
4. Finally, it prints the total count.

The key logic here is correctly implemented with:
- No edge cases overlooked (since any scenario where fruits do not meet the required ratio results in a max_lemons of 0).
- The program will return the expected outputs as demonstrated in the problem examples:
  - For input `(2, 5, 7)`, it outputs `7`.
  - For input `(4, 7, 13)`, it outputs `21`.
  - For input `(2, 3, 2)`, it outputs `0`.

Since the code adheres to the problem requirements and handles all valid input cases correctly, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
