Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly follows the problem description and accurately computes the maximum total number of fruits Nikolay can use to make the compote based on the specified ratio of lemons to apples to pears (1:2:4).

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input values for lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`), all of which are expected to be positive integers between 1 and 1000, as specified in the problem description.

2. **Calculating Maximum Lemons**: The calculation `max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)` ensures that the program finds the maximum number of lemons that can be used based on the available apples and pears. This line of code considers:
   - The number of lemons `a` available,
   - The number of apples divided by 2 (since 2 apples are required for each lemon),
   - The number of pears divided by 4 (since 4 pears are required for each lemon).
   Therefore, it guarantees that the resources are not exceeded.

3. **Calculating Total Fruits**: The calculation of `total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4` correctly computes the total number of fruits used in the compote based on the number of lemons used. The formula follows the specified ratios exactly.

4. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the total number of fruits, which matches the requirement to output the maximum total from which Nikolay can cook the compote.

Considering these points, the program adheres to the problem description and correctly handles the scenarios outlined in the examples. Thus, it efficiently determines the total number of fruits based on the given constraints.
