The function `func` does not have any parameters. Given that there are constraints mentioned for `a`, `b`, and `c`, it implies these values are somehow managed within the function; however, they are not passed as arguments. Therefore, we cannot specify how these values are set or interact with the function. Consequently, since there are no input parameters and no clearly stated return values based on the given constraints, the functionality of the function cannot be accurately described.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and has no defined return value based on the given constraints.**
