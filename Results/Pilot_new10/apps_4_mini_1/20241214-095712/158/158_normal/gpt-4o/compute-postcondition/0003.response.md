The variable `max_lemons` is assigned the value of the minimum among the three expressions: `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. Here, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, and `c` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `c` ≤ 1000. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is an input positive integer, `b` is an input positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `c` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `c` ≤ 1000, `max_lemons` is equal to min(a, b // 2, c // 4)**
