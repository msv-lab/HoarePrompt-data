To calculate the value of `total_fruits`, we first need to determine the value of `max_lemons` based on the initial state.

1. `max_lemons` is calculated as `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`. Given that `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers, we will find `max_lemons` as the minimum of these values.
2. Then, `total_fruits` is assigned the value of `max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`, simplifying to `max_lemons * (1 + 2 + 4)`, which equals `max_lemons * 7`.

The states of the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `max_lemons` remain valid. 

The output state would be updated accordingly, including the new value for `total_fruits` based on the calculated value of `max_lemons`.

Output State: **`a` is an input positive integer, `b` is an input positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `c` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `c` ≤ 1000, `max_lemons` is equal to min(a, b // 2, c // 4), and `total_fruits` is equal to `max_lemons * 7`.**
