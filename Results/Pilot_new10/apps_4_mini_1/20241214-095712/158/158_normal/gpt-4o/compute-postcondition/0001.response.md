The value of `b` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts a user input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables `a` and `c` remain unchanged. Since `b` is stated to be a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, it is now updated with an input that conforms to this condition.

Output State: **`a` is an input positive integer, `b` is an input positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `c` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `c` ≤ 1000.**
