`c` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous value of `c` is unknown but is still bound by the constraint that it must remain a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `c` ≤ 1000. Other variables (`a` and `b`) remain unaffected.

Output State: **`a` is an input positive integer, `b` is an input positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `c` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `c` ≤ 1000.**
