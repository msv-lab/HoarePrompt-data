The variable `c` is assigned the value from `int(input())`, where `input` takes a user input (which must be a positive integer between 1 and 1000, as indicated) and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of the other variables, `a` and `b`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state updates only `c`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer (1 â‰¤ `b` â‰¤ 1000), `c` is an input integer**.
