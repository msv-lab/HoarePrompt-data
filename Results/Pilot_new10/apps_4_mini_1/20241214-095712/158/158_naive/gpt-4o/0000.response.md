Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay can use to make the compote based on the specified ratio of 1 lemon: 2 apples: 4 pears.

- It first reads the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`) from the input.
- Then, it determines the maximum number of lemons that can be used, which is limited by:
  1. The number of lemons available (`a`).
  2. The number of apples available divided by 2 (`b // 2`), since each lemon requires 2 apples.
  3. The number of pears available divided by 4 (`c // 4`), since each lemon requires 4 pears.
  
- The program then calculates the total number of fruits by multiplying the maximum number of lemons used by the corresponding ratio (1 for lemons, 2 for apples, and 4 for pears).

This logic correctly handles all valid inputs as described and efficiently checks for the conditions needed to determine if enough fruits are available to make the compote. Additionally, it accounts for the case where there aren't enough fruits to make even one compote, returning 0 in such cases. Therefore, the program behaves as expected for all specified scenarios.
