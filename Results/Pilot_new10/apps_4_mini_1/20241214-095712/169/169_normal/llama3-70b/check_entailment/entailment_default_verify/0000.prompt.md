You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has a pile, that consists of some number of stones. $n$ times he either took one stone from the pile or added one stone to the pile. The pile was non-empty before each operation of taking one stone from the pile.

You are given $n$ operations which Vasya has made. Find the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after making these operations.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one positive integer $n$ — the number of operations, that have been made by Vasya ($1 \leq n \leq 100$).

The next line contains the string $s$, consisting of $n$ symbols, equal to "-" (without quotes) or "+" (without quotes). If Vasya took the stone on $i$-th operation, $s_i$ is equal to "-" (without quotes), if added, $s_i$ is equal to "+" (without quotes).


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after these $n$ operations.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
---

Output
0
Input
4
++++

Output
4
Input
2
-+

Output
1
Input
5
++-++

Output
3


-----Note-----

In the first test, if Vasya had $3$ stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $0$. It is impossible to have less number of piles, so the answer is $0$. Please notice, that the number of stones at the beginning can't be less, than $3$, because in this case, Vasya won't be able to take a stone on some operation (the pile will be empty).

In the second test, if Vasya had $0$ stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $4$. It is impossible to have less number of piles because after making $4$ operations the number of stones in the pile increases on $4$ stones. So, the answer is $4$.

In the third test, if Vasya had $1$ stone in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $1$. It can be proved, that it is impossible to have less number of stones after making the operations.

In the fourth test, if Vasya had $0$ stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $3$.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    minus_count = s.count('-')
    plus_count = s.count('+')
    if minus_count > plus_count:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(plus_count - minus_count)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program for the given problem description, let's analyze the logic behind the program.

The problem states:
- We want to find the minimal possible number of stones in a pile after a series of "+" (adding one stone) and "-" (taking one stone) operations.
- The critical point is that Vasya cannot take a stone from an empty pile, meaning the number of "-" operations cannot exceed the number of "+" operations that occur before it.

The provided program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    minus_count = s.count('-')
    plus_count = s.count('+')
    if minus_count > plus_count:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(plus_count - minus_count)
```

**Logic Analysis:**
1. `minus_count` counts the number of "-" operations, and `plus_count` counts the number of "+" operations.
2. The program checks if `minus_count` is greater than `plus_count`. If it is, it prints `0`, assuming that all "-" operations can't be executed if there aren't enough preceding "+" operations. This logically holds because if there are more takes than adds, it's impossible to carry out operations as stated in the problem; hence the pile should not go below zero.
3. If `minus_count` is less than or equal to `plus_count`, it simply outputs `plus_count - minus_count`, which calculates the number of stones in the pile as the result.

**Edge Cases:**
- If the input is `2` for n and the string `--`, the program would print `0`, which is correct since having that many takes directly after starting is not valid.
- If the input is `1` for n and the string `+` or `-`, it will also correctly assess the state of the pile.
- However, there's a subtle edge case where if the program does not handle the scenario where we might need negative initialization. For example, upon receiving `n = 5` and `s = "++---"`, the logic here would say we can subtract three when we can only subtract two. The program does not accumulate the required starting stones to ensure all "-" can be translated properly.

**Conclusion:**
Upon considering this reasoning, the program isn't accounting properly for the situation where the minus operations should be limited by the actual sequence of operations, especially when there are fewer additions than required bases for subtractions.

Thus, after analyzing the potential faults:
Correctness: **False**. 

A specific case where the program fails: 
For input `5` and string `--+++`, the function will print `1`, but it should have been initiated with at least `2` stones to compensate for the operations which results in a logical error.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) and a string `s` of length `n` containing only the characters '-' and '+'. It counts the occurrences of each character and prints `0` if there are more '-' characters than '+' characters. If there are more or an equal number of '+' characters than '-', it prints the difference between the counts of '+' and '-'. The function does not return any value; it solely prints results based on the input string. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
