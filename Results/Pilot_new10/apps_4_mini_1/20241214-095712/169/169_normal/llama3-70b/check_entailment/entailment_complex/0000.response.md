To determine the correctness of the program, let's analyze it in relation to the problem description.

### Problem Description Summary:
1. **Input**: `n` operations, represented as a string `s` containing `n` characters `+` (adding a stone) and `-` (taking a stone).
2. **Output**: The minimal number of stones left after performing these operations, starting from an optimal non-negative initial count of stones.

### Expected Calculation:
- When analyzing `s`, we need to count the operations:
   - `minus_count`: the number of stones taken (`-`)
   - `plus_count`: the number of stones added (`+`)
- The program should output the minimal possible number of stones remaining after all operations.

The rules for determining the result are as follows:
- If the number of `-` operations exceeds the number of `+` operations, we cannot end with a negative stone count, so the output should be `0`.
- If `plus_count` is greater than or equal to `minus_count`, the output should be the difference `plus_count - minus_count`, which gives the minimal non-negative count of stones.

### Code Analysis:
1. The function reads `n` and `s` from input.
2. Counts `minus_count` and `plus_count`.
3. Checks if `minus_count` is greater than `plus_count`:
   - If true, it prints `0`.
   - If false, it prints `plus_count - minus_count`.

### Correctness Check:
- If there are `m` `-` (removals) and `p` `+` (additions):
  - **Case 1**: If `m > p`, there must have been at least `m` stones to start with (to avoid a negative result).
    - Output should be `0`, as indicated by the program.
  - **Case 2**: If `p >= m`, the program correctly outputs `p - m`, which represents the minimum possible stones remaining.

The program correctly consolidates the results based on the basic rules derived from the problem description and adheres to the constraints laid out.

Consequently, the program correctly implements the logic required and adheres to the problem description for all potential cases.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True** 

The program is confirmed to be correct as it properly calculates the minimal possible number of stones left after performing the given operations based on the rules outlined in the problem description.
