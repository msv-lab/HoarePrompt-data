The code snippet `print(0)` outputs the value `0`, but it doesn't modify any variables or states. The previous values of all variables remain unchanged. Hence, the value of `0` is printed, but there are no changes to the state of any variables.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of "-" and "+"; `n` is the length of the input string `s`; `minus_count` is the count of '-' in `s`; `plus_count` is the count of '+' in `s`; `minus_count` is greater than `plus_count`**.
