Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) and a string `s` of length `n` containing only the characters '-' and '+'. It counts the occurrences of each character and prints `0` if there are more '-' characters than '+' characters. If there are more or an equal number of '+' characters than '-', it prints the difference between the counts of '+' and '-'. The function does not return any value; it solely prints results based on the input string. **
