The variable `plus_count` is assigned the value of `s.count('+')`, which computes the number of occurrences of the character `'+'` in the string `s`. The values of `s`, `n`, and `minus_count` remain unaffected by this line of code. As a result, the output state reflects the new value of `plus_count`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of "-" and "+"; `n` is the length of the input string `s`; `minus_count` is the count of '-' in `s`; `plus_count` is the count of '+' in `s'**.
