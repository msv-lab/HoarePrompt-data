The code outputs the value of `plus_count - minus_count`. Since `minus_count` is less than or equal to `plus_count`, the result of this subtraction will be non-negative. The initial values of the variables are not altered by the `print` statement, but we can express the result. 

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of "-" and "+"; `n` is the length of the input string `s`; `minus_count` is the count of '-' in `s`; `plus_count` is the count of '+' in `s`; the printed value is `plus_count - minus_count` (which is non-negative).**
