Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n`, which represents the number of operations, and a string `s` consisting of `n` characters ('+' and '-') that encode the operations.

2. **Stone Counting Logic**:
   - For every '+' operation, the count of stones is incremented.
   - For every '-' operation, the count of stones is decremented but is ensured not to go below zero using `max(0, stones - 1)`. This aligns with the problem statement that requires the pile to be non-empty before a '-' operation is performed. The logic ensures that if there are not enough stones (i.e., zero stones), it does not allow the count to become negative.

3. **Final Count**: The final value of `stones` after processing all operations provides the minimal possible number of stones left in the pile according to the operations performed. This is congruent with the specification to find the minimal possible number of stones after all operations.

4. **Output Specification**: The program prints the result, which is the calculated number of stones, and this output satisfies the requirement of the problem.

5. **Edge Cases**: 
   - If all operations are '-', the correct output will be `0`, as no negative number of stones is allowed, which this program accomplishes appropriately.
   - If all operations are '+', the output will simply reflect the total number of added stones.
   - If a mixed set of operations is provided, the logic ensures the minimum number of stones is always calculated correctly while adhering to the constraints laid out.

Thus, the program successfully meets all requirements outlined in the problem description and handles all specified cases, validating its correctness.
