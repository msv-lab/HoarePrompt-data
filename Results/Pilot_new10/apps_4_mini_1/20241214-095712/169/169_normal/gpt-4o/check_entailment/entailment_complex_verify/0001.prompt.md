You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has a pile, that consists of some number of stones. $n$ times he either took one stone from the pile or added one stone to the pile. The pile was non-empty before each operation of taking one stone from the pile.

You are given $n$ operations which Vasya has made. Find the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after making these operations.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one positive integer $n$ — the number of operations, that have been made by Vasya ($1 \leq n \leq 100$).

The next line contains the string $s$, consisting of $n$ symbols, equal to "-" (without quotes) or "+" (without quotes). If Vasya took the stone on $i$-th operation, $s_i$ is equal to "-" (without quotes), if added, $s_i$ is equal to "+" (without quotes).


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after these $n$ operations.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
---

Output
0
Input
4
++++

Output
4
Input
2
-+

Output
1
Input
5
++-++

Output
3


-----Note-----

In the first test, if Vasya had $3$ stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $0$. It is impossible to have less number of piles, so the answer is $0$. Please notice, that the number of stones at the beginning can't be less, than $3$, because in this case, Vasya won't be able to take a stone on some operation (the pile will be empty).

In the second test, if Vasya had $0$ stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $4$. It is impossible to have less number of piles because after making $4$ operations the number of stones in the pile increases on $4$ stones. So, the answer is $4$.

In the third test, if Vasya had $1$ stone in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $1$. It can be proved, that it is impossible to have less number of stones after making the operations.

In the fourth test, if Vasya had $0$ stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $3$.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    stones = 0
    for operation in s:
        if operation == '+':
            stones += 1
        elif operation == '-':
            stones = max(0, stones - 1)
    print(stones)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the minimal possible number of stones in the pile after executing the sequence of operations. The key error lies in how the program constructs the logic for the initial number of stones in the pile.

For the operations represented by a string of "+" and "-", the program accepts taking a stone from the pile as long as it can reduce the count of stones to zero but does not account for the requirement that Vasya must start with a sufficient number of stones to not violate the precondition of the task.

Consider the input:
```
3
---
```
In this case, for Vasya to execute three take operations ("---"), he must start with at least three stones; thus, the minimal possible number of stones after performing these operations is 0. 

On the other hand, when the input is:
```
5
++-++
```
The program should return 3 as well, which indeed is correct under its logic, but its logic does not cover all possible scenarios effectively.

For example, consider the operations:
```
2
-+
```
Vasya cannot perform the first operation (taking a stone) unless he starts with at least one stone. However, the program does not compute the starting requisite, and thus reports any case where it decrements the count without checking if it's valid, resulting in an inaccurate starting stone configuration.

If we calculate the expected stones from the precondition of operations:
1. Operations to subtract should not start proceeding unless the initial count is allowed to be deducted appropriately.

Additionally, an edge case example is:
```
1
-
```
In this circumstance, Vasya cannot start with negative stones because he can't take out a stone if there are none present.

Overall, the program fails to ensure that Vasya begins with enough stones to allow all operations punctually, leading to incorrect outputs for multiple edge cases in compliance with the stated rules and problem conditions. 

Therefore, since there are violations of the program's expected conditions, the conclusion is that the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), and s is a string of length n consisting of symbols '+' and '-' only.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    stones = 0
    for operation in s:
        if operation == '+':
            stones += 1
        elif operation == '-':
            stones = max(0, stones - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of symbols '+' and '-' only, `stones` is equal to `max(0, (number of '+' in s) - (number of '-' in s))`.
    print(stones)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where 1 <= n <= 100) and a string `s` of length `n`, consisting of symbols '+' and '-'. It calculates the final number of "stones" by incrementing for each '+' and decrementing for each '-' but ensures that the number of stones does not go below zero. Finally, it prints the result, which corresponds to the maximum of zero and the difference between the counts of '+' and '-' operations.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
