`stones` is increased by 1. The value of `n` is not affected by this operation, and the other variables `s` and `operation` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `stones` has been incremented.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of symbols '+' and '-' only, `stones` is 1, and the current value of `operation` is '+'**.
