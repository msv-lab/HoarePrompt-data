The variable `stones` is initialized to 0. The other variables remain unchanged since they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `s` is a string of length n consisting of symbols '+' and '-' only, `stones` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `s` is a string of length n consisting of symbols '+' and '-' only, `stones` is 0**.
