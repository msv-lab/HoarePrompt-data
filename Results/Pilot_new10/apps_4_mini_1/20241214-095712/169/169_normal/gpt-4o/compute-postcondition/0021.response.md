To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we first need to analyze how the variable `stones` evolves according to the operations performed on it during the iterations of the loop.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100).
   - `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of symbols '+' and '-' only.
   - `stones` starts at 0.

2. **Loop Code Behavior:**
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string `s` (length `n`).
   - For each character:
     - If the character is '+', `stones` is incremented by 1.
     - If the character is '-', `stones` is decremented by 1 but it cannot go below 0 (i.e., it uses `max(0, stones - 1)`).

3. **Final State after all iterations:**
   - After processing all operations in the string `s`, the final value of `stones` will depend on the total number of '+' operations minus the total number of '-' operations, but it cannot be less than 0.
   - Let `plus_count` be the number of '+' in `s`, and `minus_count` be the number of '-' in `s`. Therefore, at the end of the loop, we have:
     - `stones` = `max(0, plus_count - minus_count)`

4. **Necessary Conditions:**
   - The value of `stones` can range from 0 to `n` (as it can only increase up to the number of '+' operations).
   - The string must have been traversed completely, so the output state will include the final count of `stones`, which is determined by the operations in `s`.

Given the conditions and the operations specified:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of symbols '+' and '-' only, `stones` is equal to `max(0, (number of '+' in s) - (number of '-' in s))`.**
