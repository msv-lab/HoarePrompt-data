The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where 1 <= n <= 100) and a string `s` of length `n`, consisting of symbols '+' and '-'. It calculates the final number of "stones" by incrementing for each '+' and decrementing for each '-' but ensures that the number of stones does not go below zero. Finally, it prints the result, which corresponds to the maximum of zero and the difference between the counts of '+' and '-' operations.
