Postcondition: ***`n` is the length of the `trophies` string, `trophies` is a string of 'G' and 'S' characters of length `n`. If the first character of `trophies` is 'G', then `segments` is a list containing the tuple `(0, i - 1)`, where `i` is either the index of the first 'S' in `trophies` or equal to `n` if `trophies` consists entirely of 'G's. If the first character of `trophies` is 'S', then `segments` is an empty list and `i` is 1.***
