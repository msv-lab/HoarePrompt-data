Postcondition: **`n` is the length of the `trophies` string, `trophies` is a string of 'G' and 'S' characters of length `n`. If the first character of `trophies` is 'G', then `segments` is a list containing the tuple `(0, i - 1)`, where `i` is the index of the first 'S' in `trophies` and `i` is less than `n`. If the first character of `trophies` is 'S', then `segments` is an empty list, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. Additionally, the character at index `i` in `trophies` is 'S'.**
