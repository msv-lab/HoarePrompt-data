The code increments `i` by 1. The previous value of `i` was less than `n`, and the character at index `i` in `trophies` was 'G'. After incrementing, the new value of `i` is `i + 1`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than the current `i`, `trophies` is a string of 'G' and 'S' characters of length `n`, the character at index `i - 1` in `trophies` is 'G', `start` is equal to `i - 1`, and `i` is `i + 1`.**
