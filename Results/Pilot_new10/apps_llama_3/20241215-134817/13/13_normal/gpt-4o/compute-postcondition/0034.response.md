The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. The previous value of `i` was such that `n` is greater than `i`, and `i` had been incremented from its previous value, which means `start` is equal to the previous `i - 1`. After incrementing `i`, the new value of `i` is the old value plus 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than the current `i`, `trophies` is a string of 'G' and 'S' characters of length `n`, the character at index `i - 1` in `trophies` must be 'G', `start` is equal to `i - 2`, and `i` is the new incremented value**
