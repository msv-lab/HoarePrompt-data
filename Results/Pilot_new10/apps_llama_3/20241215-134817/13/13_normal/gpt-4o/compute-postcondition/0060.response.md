Postcondition: ***`n` is the length of the `trophies` string, `trophies` is a string of 'G' and 'S' characters of length `n`, `segments` contains tuples representing all sequences of consecutive 'G's in `trophies` and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `prev_start` is the start index of the second sequence of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`, `prev_end` is the end index of the second sequence of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`, `curr_start` is the start index of the third sequence of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`, `curr_end` is the end index of the third sequence of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`. If `curr_start - prev_end` equals 2, then `max_length` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_end - curr_start + 1 + prev_end - prev_start + 1`. Otherwise, `max_length` remains unchanged.***
