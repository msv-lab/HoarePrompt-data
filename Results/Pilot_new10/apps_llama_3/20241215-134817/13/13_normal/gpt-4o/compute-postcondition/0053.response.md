Postcondition: **`n` is the length of the `trophies` string, `trophies` is a string of 'G' and 'S' characters of length `n`, `segments` contains tuples representing all sequences of consecutive 'G's in `trophies` and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `max_length` is the maximum length of consecutive 'G' sequences in `trophies`, initially `prev_start` was the start index of the first sequence of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`, initially `prev_end` was the end index of the first sequence of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`, initially `curr_start` was the start index of the second sequence of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`, initially `curr_end` was the end index of the second sequence of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`. The current value of `curr_start` is 2 more than the current value of `prev_end`.**
