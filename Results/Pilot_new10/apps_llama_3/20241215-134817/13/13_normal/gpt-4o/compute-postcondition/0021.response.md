The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` was less than `n`. The new value of `i` is `i + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

If the first character of `trophies` is 'G', then `segments` was adjusted to reflect the new `i` if necessary. If the first character of `trophies` is 'S', then the original `i` was 2, so the new `i` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is the length of the `trophies` string, `trophies` is a string of 'G' and 'S' characters of length `n`, `trophies` must have a 'G' at index `i - 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, if the first character of `trophies` is 'G' then `segments` is adjusted to reflect the new `i` if necessary, and if the first character of `trophies` is 'S' then the original `i` was 2, so `i` is now 3 and `n` is greater than 2**
