Postcondition: ***`n` is the length of the `trophies` string, `trophies` is a string of 'G' and 'S' characters of length `n`, `segments` contains tuples representing all sequences of consecutive 'G's in `trophies` and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, if `curr_start - prev_end` equals 2, then `max_length` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_end - prev_start + 1`, and `curr_start` is `prev_end + 2`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, with `max_length` keeping its previous value and `curr_start` retaining its original value, `prev_start` was the start index of the first sequence of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`, `prev_end` was the end index of the first sequence of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`, `curr_end` was the end index of the second sequence of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`***.
