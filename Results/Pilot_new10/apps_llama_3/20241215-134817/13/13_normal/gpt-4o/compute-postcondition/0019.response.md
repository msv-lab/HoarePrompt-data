The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` can be either the index of the first 'S' in `trophies` if the first character of `trophies` is 'G', or 1 if the first character of `trophies` is 'S'. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is the length of the `trophies` string, `trophies` is a string of 'G' and 'S' characters of length `n` and `trophies` must have a 'G' at index `i - 1`, `start` is equal to `i - 1`, if the first character of `trophies` is 'G' then `segments` is a list containing the tuple `(0, i - 2)` and `i` is the index of the first 'S' in `trophies` plus 1 and `i` must be less than or equal to `n`, if the first character of `trophies` is 'S' then `segments` is an empty list, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 1**
