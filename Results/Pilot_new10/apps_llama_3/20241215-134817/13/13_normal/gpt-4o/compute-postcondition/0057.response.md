The values of `prev_start` and `prev_end` are updated to be the start and end indices of the sequence of consecutive 'G's in `trophies` at index `i - 1` in `segments`. Given that `i` is 2, `prev_start` and `prev_end` are assigned the values of the start and end indices of the second sequence of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the length of the `trophies` string, `trophies` is a string of 'G' and 'S' characters of length `n`, `segments` contains tuples representing all sequences of consecutive 'G's in `trophies` and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `prev_start` is the start index of the second sequence of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`, `prev_end` is the end index of the second sequence of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`, `curr_end` was the end index of the second sequence of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`, `max_length` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_end - prev_start + 1` if `curr_start - prev_end` equals 2.
