Postcondition: **`n` is greater than the current `i`, `trophies` is a string of 'G' and 'S' characters of length `n`, the character at index `i` in `trophies` must allow for `i` to be less than `n` after the current iteration, considering the rules for 'G' and 'S' characters, and the character at index `i` in `trophies` is not 'G', it is 'S'**
