The variable `start` is assigned the value of `i`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than the current `i`, `trophies` is a string of 'G' and 'S' characters of length `n`, the character at index `i` in `trophies` must allow for `i` to be less than `n` after the current iteration, and `start` is equal to `i`.
