Postcondition: **`n` is the length of the `trophies` string, `trophies` is a string of 'G' and 'S' characters of length `n`, `segments` contains tuples representing all sequences of consecutive 'G's in `trophies` and is not empty, `i` equals `n`, `max_length` is the maximum length of consecutive 'G' sequences in `trophies`, and there is more than one sequence of consecutive 'G's in `trophies` (i.e., `len(segments)` is greater than 1)**
