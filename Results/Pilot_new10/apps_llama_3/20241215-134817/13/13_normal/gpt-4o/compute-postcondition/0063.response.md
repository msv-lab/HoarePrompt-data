The given code line assigns the start and end indices of the fourth sequence of consecutive 'G's in `trophies` to `curr_start` and `curr_end` respectively. 
Given that `i` is 3, and `segments` contains tuples representing all sequences of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`, `curr_start, curr_end = segments[3]`. 

The state of the variables `n`, `trophies`, `segments`, `i`, `prev_start`, `prev_end` are not affected, only `curr_start` and `curr_end` are updated. 

Output State: **`n` is the length of the `trophies` string, `trophies` is a string of 'G' and 'S' characters of length `n`, `segments` contains tuples representing all sequences of consecutive 'G's in `trophies` and must have at least 4 elements, `i` is 3, `prev_start` is the start index of the second sequence of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`, `prev_end` is the end index of the second sequence of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`, `curr_start` is the start index of the fourth sequence of consecutive 'G's in `trophies` which equals `segments[3][0]`, `curr_end` is the end index of the fourth sequence of consecutive 'G's in `trophies` which equals `segments[3][1]`**.
