To calculate the new value of `max_length`, we need to consider the previous values of the affected variables and the given equation.

The equation is: `max_length = max(max_length, curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1)`.

Let's analyze this step by step:

1. `curr_end - curr_start + 1` represents the length of the current sequence of consecutive 'G's.
2. `prev_end - prev_start + 1` represents the length of the previous sequence of consecutive 'G's.
3. The sum `curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1` represents the total length of the current sequence, the previous sequence, and an additional character in between (since the difference between `curr_start` and `prev_end` is not explicitly specified in the equation but is given as 2 in the initial condition).

Given the initial conditions:

- `n` is the length of the `trophies` string.
- `trophies` is a string of 'G' and 'S' characters of length `n`.
- `segments` contains tuples representing all sequences of consecutive 'G's in `trophies` and must have at least 3 elements.
- `i` is 2.
- `prev_start` is the start index of the second sequence of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`.
- `prev_end` is the end index of the second sequence of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`.
- `curr_start` is the start index of the third sequence of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`.
- `curr_end` is the end index of the third sequence of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`.
- `max_length` is the maximum of its previous value and the previous value of `curr_end - prev_start + 1` if the difference between the previous value of `curr_start` and `prev_end` equals 2.

The code updates the value of `max_length` to be the maximum of its current value and the sum of the lengths of the current and previous sequences of 'G's plus one.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `trophies`, `segments`, `i`, `prev_start`, `prev_end`, `curr_start`, `curr_end`) are not affected by this operation.

Thus, the output state is: `n` is the length of the `trophies` string, `trophies` is a string of 'G' and 'S' characters of length `n`, `segments` contains tuples representing all sequences of consecutive 'G's in `trophies` and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `prev_start` is the start index of the second sequence of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`, `prev_end` is the end index of the second sequence of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`, `curr_start` is the start index of the third sequence of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`, `curr_end` is the end index of the third sequence of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`, and `max_length` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_end - curr_start + 1 + prev_end - prev_start + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is the length of the `trophies` string, `trophies` is a string of 'G' and 'S' characters of length `n`, `segments` contains tuples representing all sequences of consecutive 'G's in `trophies` and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `prev_start` is the start index of the second sequence of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`, `prev_end` is the end index of the second sequence of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`, `curr_start` is the start index of the third sequence of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`, `curr_end` is the end index of the third sequence of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`, `max_length` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_end - curr_start + 1 + prev_end - prev_start + 1`**
