Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than the current `i`, `trophies` is a string of 'G' and 'S' characters of length `n`. If `trophies[i]` is 'G', then `i` is the index of the first 'S' encountered starting from the original `i` or equal to `n` if no 'S' is found before `n`, `start` is the original value of `i`, `trophies` retains its initial value, `n` retains its initial value, and `segments` is updated with the tuple `(start, i - 1)`. If `trophies[i]` is 'S', then `i` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `n`, with `n` and `trophies` retaining their initial values.***
