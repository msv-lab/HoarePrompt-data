Postcondition: **`n` is the length of the `trophies` string, `trophies` is a string of 'G' and 'S' characters of length `n`. If the character at index `i` in `trophies` is 'G', then `i` is the index of the first 'S' in `trophies` or `n` if no 'S' is found, `segments` contains the updated list of segments with the additional tuple `(i - 1, i - 1)` or `(n - 1, n - 1)` if 'S' is not found. If the character at index `i` in `trophies` is 'S', then `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, and if the first character of `trophies` is 'G' then `segments` is a list containing the tuple `(0, i - 2)`, otherwise `segments` is an empty list.**
