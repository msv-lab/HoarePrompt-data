The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `trophies`. `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, and `trophies` is a string consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters of length `n`. After executing the function body, the function returns a value based on the following conditions: 
Case_1: The program returns 0. 
Case_2: The program returns the maximum length of consecutive 'G' sequence in the string `trophies`.
Case_3: The program returns the minimum value between the maximum length of consecutive 'G' sequences (including those separated by a single 'S' if they exist) plus one, and the total length of the `trophies` string.
Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept an integer `n` and a string `trophies` of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters, and return a value based on the specified conditions related to the sequence of 'G' characters in the string.
Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, an integer n and a string trophies of length n consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters, and returns a value based on the maximum length of consecutive 'G' sequences and the total length of the trophies string.**
