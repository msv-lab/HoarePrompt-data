The function accepts an integer `n` and a string `trophies` of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters, and returns the minimum value between the maximum length of consecutive 'G' sequences (including those separated by a single 'S' if they exist) plus one, and the total length of the `trophies` string, or 0 if no 'G' sequences are found.
