    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `b` is 0, and `a` is the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`.
    return a
    #The program returns the original value of `a`, which is the absolute value of `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, calculates and returns their Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. It handles cases where `b` is initially zero by returning `a`, and it implicitly produces a positive result for the GCD, regardless of the signs of the input integers. The function does not explicitly handle non-integer inputs or provide absolute values as incorrectly suggested by the annotations.

    return res
    #The program returns the maximum of 0 and all func_1(res, i) for i in range from 1 to n, where n is an integer and 2 <= n <= 10^6
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` between 2 and 10^6, iterates from 1 to `n`, and returns the maximum value obtained by calling `func_1` with the current maximum and the current iteration number, starting with an initial maximum of 0; if `func_1` is not defined or behaves unexpectedly, the function's behavior is undefined

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `f_max_n` is a positive integer, `MOD` is 1000000007, and `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[j]` for `j` from 0 to `f_max_n` holds the `(j + 1)`th Fibonacci number modulo `MOD` if `n` is greater than 0, otherwise `dp[0]` is 1 and all other elements of `dp` are 0.
    return dp[f_max_n]
    #The program returns the (f_max_n + 1)th Fibonacci number modulo 1000000007 if n is greater than 0, otherwise it returns 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the (f_max_n + 1)th Fibonacci number modulo 10^9 + 7 if n is greater than 0, and returns 0 if n is 0, handling potential edge cases through modulo arithmetic.
