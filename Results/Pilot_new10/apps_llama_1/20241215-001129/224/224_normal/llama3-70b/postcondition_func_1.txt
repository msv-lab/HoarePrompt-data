The function accepts an integer `n` between 2 and 10^6, iterates from 1 to `n`, and returns the maximum value obtained by calling `func_1` with the current maximum and the current iteration number, starting with an initial maximum of 0; if `func_1` is not defined or behaves unexpectedly, the function's behavior is undefined
