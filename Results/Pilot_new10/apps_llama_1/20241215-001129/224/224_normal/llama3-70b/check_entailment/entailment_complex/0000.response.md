Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. 

The problem description asks to count the number of permutations `p` of integers `1`, `2`,..., `n`, such that `f(p)` is equal to `f_max(n)`, where `f(p)` is the number of distinct elements among the greatest common divisors of prefixes of `p`. However, the provided code does not correctly calculate `f_max(n)`.

The function `func_2(n)` is supposed to calculate `f_max(n)`, but it does not do so correctly. It calculates the maximum value obtained by calling `func_1` with the current maximum and the current iteration number, starting with an initial maximum of 0. However, this is not the correct way to calculate `f_max(n)`.

To calculate `f_max(n)`, we need to find the maximum value of `f(p)` among all permutations `p` of integers `1`, `2`,..., `n`. The function `func_2(n)` does not consider all possible permutations, and it does not correctly calculate the number of distinct elements among the greatest common divisors of prefixes of each permutation.

Furthermore, the function `func_3(n, f_max_n)` calculates the `(f_max_n + 1)`th Fibonacci number modulo `10^9 + 7`, which is not related to the problem of counting the number of permutations `p` of integers `1`, `2`,..., `n`, such that `f(p)` is equal to `f_max(n)`.

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and it is incorrect.
