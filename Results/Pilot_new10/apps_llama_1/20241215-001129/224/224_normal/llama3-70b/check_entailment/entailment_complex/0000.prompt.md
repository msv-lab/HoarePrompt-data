You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Let's define a function $f(p)$ on a permutation $p$ as follows. Let $g_i$ be the greatest common divisor (GCD) of elements $p_1$, $p_2$, ..., $p_i$ (in other words, it is the GCD of the prefix of length $i$). Then $f(p)$ is the number of distinct elements among $g_1$, $g_2$, ..., $g_n$.

Let $f_{max}(n)$ be the maximum value of $f(p)$ among all permutations $p$ of integers $1$, $2$, ..., $n$.

Given an integers $n$, count the number of permutations $p$ of integers $1$, $2$, ..., $n$, such that $f(p)$ is equal to $f_{max}(n)$. Since the answer may be large, print the remainder of its division by $1000\,000\,007 = 10^9 + 7$.


-----Input-----

The only line contains the integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^6$) — the length of the permutations.


-----Output-----

The only line should contain your answer modulo $10^9+7$.


-----Examples-----

-----Note-----

Consider the second example: these are the permutations of length $3$:  $[1,2,3]$, $f(p)=1$.  $[1,3,2]$, $f(p)=1$.  $[2,1,3]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[2,3,1]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[3,1,2]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[3,2,1]$, $f(p)=2$. 

The maximum value $f_{max}(3) = 2$, and there are $4$ permutations $p$ such that $f(p)=2$.
Annotated Functions:
n = int(input())
f_max_n = func_2(n)
print(func_3(n, f_max_n))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `b` is 0, and `a` is the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`.
    return a
    #The program returns the original value of `a`, which is the absolute value of `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, calculates and returns their Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. It handles cases where `b` is initially zero by returning `a`, and it implicitly produces a positive result for the GCD, regardless of the signs of the input integers. The function does not explicitly handle non-integer inputs or provide absolute values as incorrectly suggested by the annotations.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6
def func_2(n):
    res = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        res = max(res, func_1(res, i))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `res` is the maximum of 0 and all `func_1(res, i)` for `i` in range from 1 to `n`, `i` is equal to `n`.
    return res
    #The program returns the maximum of 0 and all func_1(res, i) for i in range from 1 to n, where n is an integer and 2 <= n <= 10^6
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` between 2 and 10^6, iterates from 1 to `n`, and returns the maximum value obtained by calling `func_1` with the current maximum and the current iteration number, starting with an initial maximum of 0; if `func_1` is not defined or behaves unexpectedly, the function's behavior is undefined

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer, and f_max_n is a positive integer.
def func_3(n, f_max_n):
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
    dp = [0] * (f_max_n + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(f_max_n, 0, -1):
            dp[j] += dp[j - 1]
            dp[j] %= MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `f_max_n` is a positive integer, `MOD` is 1000000007, and `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[j]` for `j` from 0 to `f_max_n` holds the `(j + 1)`th Fibonacci number modulo `MOD` if `n` is greater than 0, otherwise `dp[0]` is 1 and all other elements of `dp` are 0.
    return dp[f_max_n]
    #The program returns the (f_max_n + 1)th Fibonacci number modulo 1000000007 if n is greater than 0, otherwise it returns 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the (f_max_n + 1)th Fibonacci number modulo 10^9 + 7 if n is greater than 0, and returns 0 if n is 0, handling potential edge cases through modulo arithmetic.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
