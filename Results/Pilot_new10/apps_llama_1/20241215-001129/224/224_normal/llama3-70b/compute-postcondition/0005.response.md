The value of `dp[j]` is updated to be the sum of its current value and `dp[j - 1]`. Given that `j` is `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is `dp[f_max_n]`, and `dp[j - 1]` is `dp[f_max_n - 1]`. Initially, `dp[f_max_n]` is 0 and `dp[f_max_n - 1]` is also 0 because all `dp[i]` are 0 for `i` from 1 to `f_max_n`. Therefore, `dp[f_max_n]` becomes 0 + 0 = 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `f_max_n` is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to 1, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` with `dp[0]` = 1 and `dp[i]` = 0 for `i` from 1 to `f_max_n - 1` and `dp[f_max_n]` = 0, `i` is 1, `j` is `f_max_n`**
