According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than the previous `n`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.
State: **`n` is greater than the previous `n` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `f_max_n` is a positive integer, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[j]` for `j` from 0 to `f_max_n` holds the `j + 1`th Fibonacci number modulo `MOD`, `i` is 2, `j` is 1**
