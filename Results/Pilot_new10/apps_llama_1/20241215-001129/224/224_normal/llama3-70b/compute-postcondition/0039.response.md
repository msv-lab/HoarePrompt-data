To determine the functionality of the function `func_3(n, f_max_n)`, let's analyze the given annotated code and return postconditions.

1. **Parameters and Return Type**: The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `f_max_n`, where `n` is a non-negative integer and `f_max_n` is a positive integer. It returns an integer value representing the `(f_max_n + 1)`th Fibonacci number modulo `10^9 + 7` if `n` is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise.

2. **Analysis of the Code**:
    - The code initializes a list `dp` of size `f_max_n + 1` with all elements set to 0, except `dp[0]` which is set to 1. This corresponds to the base case of the Fibonacci sequence where the 0th Fibonacci number is 1 (or sometimes considered as the 1st Fibonacci number in different definitions).
    - It then iterates through a nested loop structure. The outer loop runs from `1` to `n` (inclusive), and for each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop updates the `dp` list in reverse order. This process effectively calculates Fibonacci numbers up to the `(f_max_n + 1)`th Fibonacci number, considering the modulo operation to prevent overflow.
    - The return statement simply returns the value of `dp[f_max_n]`, which, after the loop completes, holds the `(f_max_n + 1)`th Fibonacci number modulo `10^9 + 7`.

3. **Return Postconditions and Potential Edge Cases**:
    - If `n` is greater than 0, the function calculates and returns the `(f_max_n + 1)`th Fibonacci number modulo `10^9 + 7`.
    - If `n` is 0, the function returns `dp[f_max_n]`, which is initially set to 0 before the loop. Since the loop does not execute when `n` is 0, `dp[f_max_n]` remains 0.
    - Potential edge cases include when `f_max_n` is 1, in which case the function should return 1 (since the 2nd Fibonacci number is 1), and when `n` is very large, in which case the function's behavior is determined by the modulo operation to prevent overflow.

4. **Functionality Summary**:
    Given the analysis, the functionality of `func_3(n, f_max_n)` is to calculate and return the `(f_max_n + 1)`th Fibonacci number modulo `10^9 + 7` if `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0, it returns 0. The function handles potential edge cases through the use of modulo arithmetic to prevent overflow for large values of `n` or `f_max_n`.

Functionality: ** The function calculates and returns the (f_max_n + 1)th Fibonacci number modulo 10^9 + 7 if n is greater than 0, and returns 0 if n is 0, handling potential edge cases through modulo arithmetic. **
