The value of `dp[j]` is increased by `dp[j - 1]`. Given that `j` is `f_max_n - 2` and `dp[f_max_n - 2]` is 1, `dp[f_max_n - 2 - 1]` is also 1. Therefore, `dp[f_max_n - 2]` is updated to 1 + 1 = 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than the previous `n`, `f_max_n` is a positive integer and must be greater than 0, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[0]` = 1, `dp[j]` = 1 for `j` from 1 to `f_max_n - 3`, `dp[f_max_n - 2]` = 2, `dp[f_max_n - 1]` = 2, `dp[f_max_n]` = 2, `i` is 1, `j` is `f_max_n - 2**
