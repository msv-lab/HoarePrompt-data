To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop statement and the current state.

The loop statement is `for j in range(f_max_n, 0, -1):`, which means `j` will decrease by 1 in each iteration. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `f_max_n`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be decreased by 1, so `j` becomes `f_max_n - 1`. 

Other variables `n`, `f_max_n`, `MOD`, `dp`, and `i` do not depend on the loop variable `j`, so they remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is greater than the previous `n` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `f_max_n` is a positive integer, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[j]` for `j` from 0 to `f_max_n - 1` holds the `j + 1`th Fibonacci number modulo `MOD`, and `dp[f_max_n]` holds the `(f_max_n + 1)`th Fibonacci number modulo `MOD`, `i` is 2, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`**
