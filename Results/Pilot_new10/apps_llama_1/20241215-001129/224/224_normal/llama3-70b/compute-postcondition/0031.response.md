The code `dp[j] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[j]` by taking the modulus of the current value of `dp[j]` with `MOD`. 

Since `j` is `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[j]` is `dp[f_max_n - 1]`, which holds the `(f_max_n + 1)`th Fibonacci number modulo `MOD`. 

However, the code does not change the fact that `n` is greater than the previous `n` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `f_max_n` is a positive integer, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1`, `i` is 2.

The value of `dp[f_max_n - 1]` is updated to be the `(f_max_n + 1)`th Fibonacci number modulo `MOD` modulo `MOD` again, which is equivalent to the `(f_max_n + 1)`th Fibonacci number modulo `MOD` because `(a mod b) mod b` equals `a mod b`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than the previous `n` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `f_max_n` is a positive integer, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[j]` for `j` from 0 to `f_max_n - 2` holds the `j + 1`th Fibonacci number modulo `MOD`, `dp[f_max_n - 1]` holds the `(f_max_n + 1)`th Fibonacci number modulo `MOD`, `dp[f_max_n]` holds the `(f_max_n + 1)`th Fibonacci number modulo `MOD`, `i` is 2, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than the previous `n` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `f_max_n` is a positive integer, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[j]` for `j` from 0 to `f_max_n - 2` holds the `j + 1`th Fibonacci number modulo `MOD`, `dp[f_max_n - 1]` holds the `(f_max_n + 1)`th Fibonacci number modulo `MOD`, `dp[f_max_n]` holds the `(f_max_n + 1)`th Fibonacci number modulo `MOD`, `i` is 2, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`.**
