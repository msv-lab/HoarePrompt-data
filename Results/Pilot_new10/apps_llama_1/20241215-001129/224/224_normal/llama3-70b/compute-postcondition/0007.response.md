According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `f_max_n`, which is a positive integer and greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must decrease by 1 because the loop iterates in reverse order. So, `j` should be `f_max_n - 1`. Since `j` is now less than `f_max_n`, the loop can execute again if `f_max_n - 1` is greater than 0. Other variables remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `f_max_n` is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to 1, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` with `dp[0]` = 1 and `dp[i]` = 0 for `i` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `i` is 1, `j` is `f_max_n - 1**
