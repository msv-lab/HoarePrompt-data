The value of `dp[j]` is updated by taking the modulus of `dp[j]` with `MOD`. Since `dp[f_max_n]` = 0, `dp[j]` is also 0. When 0 is taken modulo `MOD`, the result is still 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `f_max_n` is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to 1, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` with `dp[0]` = 1 and `dp[i]` = 0 for `i` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `i` is 1, `j` is `f_max_n`**
