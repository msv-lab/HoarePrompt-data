The given code snippet is `dp[j] %= MOD`. The initial state is: `n` is greater than 0, `f_max_n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[0]` = 1 and `dp[i]` = 0 for `i` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[f_max_n - 1]` = `dp[f_max_n - 2]` = 0, `i` is 1, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`.

Since `dp[f_max_n - 1]` is 0 and `j` is `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[j]` is also 0. Therefore, the expression `dp[j] %= MOD` does not change the value of `dp[j]`, because 0 modulo any number is still 0.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `f_max_n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[0]` = 1 and `dp[i]` = 0 for `i` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` = 0, `i` is 1, `j` is `f_max_n - 1**
