The given code defines a constant `MOD` and assigns it the value `10 ** 9 + 7`, which equals `1000000007`. This value is a prime number often used in modular arithmetic, especially in competitive programming.

Given the initial state: `n` is a non-negative integer, and `f_max_n` is a positive integer.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `f_max_n` is a positive integer, `MOD` is `1000000007`**
