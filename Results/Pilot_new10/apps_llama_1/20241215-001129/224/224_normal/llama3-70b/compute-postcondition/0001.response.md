The code initializes a list `dp` of size `f_max_n + 1` with all elements set to 0. The state of the other variables is not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `f_max_n` is a positive integer, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` with all elements set to 0.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `f_max_n` is a positive integer, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` with all elements set to 0**
