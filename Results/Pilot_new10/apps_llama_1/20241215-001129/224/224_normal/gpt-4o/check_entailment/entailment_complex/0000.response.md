Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the problem description. The problem description asks to count the number of permutations `p` of integers `1`, `2`,..., `n`, such that `f(p)` is equal to `f_max(n)`, and print the remainder of its division by `10^9 + 7`.

For `n >= 2`, it can be proven that `f_max(n) = n - 1`. This is because we can construct a permutation `p` with `n - 1` distinct GCDs by starting with the largest number `n`, followed by the remaining numbers in descending order. For example, one such permutation is `[n, n-1, n-2,..., 1]`. The GCDs of the prefixes of this permutation are `n`, `gcd(n, n-1)`, `gcd(n, n-1, n-2)`,..., `1`, which are all distinct.

The number of permutations `p` with `f(p) = f_max(n)` is equal to the number of ways to arrange the numbers `1`, `2`,..., `n` such that the permutation starts with `n` and the remaining numbers are in descending order. This is equivalent to permuting the numbers `1`, `2`,..., `n-1`, which can be done in `(n-1)!` ways.

The program calculates this value by calling the function `func_1(n-1, MOD)`, which returns the factorial of `n-1` modulo `MOD`. The base case `n == 2` is handled separately, where the result is simply `1`.

Therefore, the program correctly calculates the number of permutations `p` with `f(p) = f_max(n)` and prints the remainder of its division by `10^9 + 7`.
