You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Let's define a function $f(p)$ on a permutation $p$ as follows. Let $g_i$ be the greatest common divisor (GCD) of elements $p_1$, $p_2$, ..., $p_i$ (in other words, it is the GCD of the prefix of length $i$). Then $f(p)$ is the number of distinct elements among $g_1$, $g_2$, ..., $g_n$.

Let $f_{max}(n)$ be the maximum value of $f(p)$ among all permutations $p$ of integers $1$, $2$, ..., $n$.

Given an integers $n$, count the number of permutations $p$ of integers $1$, $2$, ..., $n$, such that $f(p)$ is equal to $f_{max}(n)$. Since the answer may be large, print the remainder of its division by $1000\,000\,007 = 10^9 + 7$.


-----Input-----

The only line contains the integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^6$) — the length of the permutations.


-----Output-----

The only line should contain your answer modulo $10^9+7$.


-----Examples-----

-----Note-----

Consider the second example: these are the permutations of length $3$:  $[1,2,3]$, $f(p)=1$.  $[1,3,2]$, $f(p)=1$.  $[2,1,3]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[2,3,1]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[3,1,2]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[3,2,1]$, $f(p)=2$. 

The maximum value $f_{max}(3) = 2$, and there are $4$ permutations $p$ such that $f(p)=2$.
Program:
```
MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
n = int(input())
if n == 2:
    result = 1
else:
    result = func_1(n - 1, MOD)
print(result)

def func_1(n, mod):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result = result * i % mod
    return result


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the number of permutations $p$ such that $f(p)$ is equal to $f_{max}(n)$. It seems to simply calculate the factorial of $n-1$, which is not the correct approach.

For example, when $n = 6$, the program outputs $120$, which is correct, but this is just a coincidence. For smaller values of $n$, the program may also produce correct results, but this does not guarantee that it will work for all $n$.

One potential case where the program may not work correctly is when $n$ is a prime number. In this case, the maximum value of $f(p)$ will be $2$, because the only divisors of $n$ are $1$ and $n$ itself. However, the program does not take this into account and simply calculates the factorial of $n-1$.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to find the maximum value of $f(p)$ for a given $n$, and then count the number of permutations $p$ that achieve this maximum value. This is a more complex task than simply calculating the factorial of $n-1$, and it requires a deeper understanding of the properties of permutations and their greatest common divisors. 

For instance, when $n = 5$, we have a maximum value $f_{max}(5) = 3$. The permutations that achieve this maximum value are those that start with $1$, $2$, and $3$, or those that start with $1$, $3$, and $2$, in any order. There are $3! = 6$ such permutations for each starting sequence, and there are $2$ starting sequences, so the total number of permutations is $2 \cdot 6 = 12$. However, the program would output $24$, which is incorrect. 

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases, and its correctness is **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
n = int(input())
if n == 2:
    result = 1
else:
    result = func_1(n - 1, MOD)
print(result)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, and mod is an integer equal to 10^9 + 7.
def func_1(n, mod):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result = result * i % mod
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `mod` is 10^9 + 7, `result` is the factorial of `n` starting from 2 (2 * 3 *... * n) modulo `mod`, and `i` equals `n`.
    return result
    #The program returns the factorial of `n` (starting from 2) modulo 10^9 + 7, where 2 <= n <= 10^6.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates the factorial of `n` starting from 2 (or returns 1 if `n` is 0 or 1) and returns this value modulo `mod`, for any integer `n` and `mod`, without explicit error checking for the constraints on `n` and `mod`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
