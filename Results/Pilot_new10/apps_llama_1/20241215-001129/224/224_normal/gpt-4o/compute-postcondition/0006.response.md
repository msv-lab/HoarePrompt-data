To calculate the new value of `result`, we multiply the current value of `result` (which is 6) by the value of `i` (which is 4) and then take the modulus of the product with `mod` (which is 10^9 + 7).

First, we calculate the product: 6 * 4 = 24.

Then, we take the modulus of this product with `mod` (10^9 + 7): 24 % (10^9 + 7) = 24.

Since 24 is less than (10^9 + 7), the result of the modulus operation is simply 24.

Therefore, the new value of `result` is 24.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `mod`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 10^6, `mod` is 10^9 + 7, `result` is 24, `i` is 4**
