The variable `res` is decremented by 1. Initially, `res` is 0, so after the decrement, `res` becomes -1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the value of `n` is still 1, `i` is still 1, and the product of `i` squared equals `n` still holds true.

Output State: **`n` is 1, `i` is 1, the product of `i` squared equals `n`, and `res` is -1**
