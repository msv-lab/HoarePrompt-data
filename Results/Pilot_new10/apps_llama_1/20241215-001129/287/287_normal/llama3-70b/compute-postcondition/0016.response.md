Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer that is at least 10, `i` is 3. If `n` is divisible by 3, `res` is 4. Since there is no else part in the code, `n` being not divisible by 3 is not considered in the postcondition of the if part, but based on the precondition, if `n` is not divisible by 3, `res` would be -1 before the if statement. However, since the if condition only updates `res` when `n` is divisible by 3, if `n` is not divisible by 3, `res` remains the same as before the if statement, which is -1 if `n` is not divisible by 3, or it would have been 1 if `n` somehow became not divisible by 3 during the if part which is impossible given the initial conditions. Therefore, the overall postcondition should reflect that `res` is updated to 4 when `n` is divisible by 3, but since there's no else part, and the if part only considers the case when `n` is divisible by 3, we only update `res` in that case. Hence, `res` is either 4 if `n` is divisible by 3 or remains as initially defined for other cases not explicitly updated by the if part, which means `res` could be -1 if `n` is not divisible by 3, given `n`'s initial conditions and the lack of an else part. However, given the structure of the task and the condition that `n` must be at least 10 and the specific conditions around `res`, the main focus is on `n`'s divisibility by 3 to determine `res` as 4 in the if part. Since `res` is defined based on `n`'s divisibility and given `n` is at least 10, and considering the initial definition of `res`, it seems there might be an oversight in directly applying the initial conditions of `res` without the else part explicitly handling the non-divisible case, thus implying `res`'s value for `n` not divisible by 3 remains as per initial conditions before the if statement, which could be -1 or 1 based on divisibility, but since we only have an update for the divisible case, the postcondition summarizes the divisible case directly influenced by the if part.*** 

However, following the initial task to the letter and the examples given to understand the task, it seems like the primary goal is to focus on what the if part directly influences and acknowledge the rest based on the initial conditions provided. 

Given the initial conditions and the examples, a more precise and direct approach to formulate the postcondition based on the divisibility condition directly affected by the if part, and considering the provided examples' formats, the task seems to aim for a concise condition reflecting the outcome of the if part's execution.

Therefore, considering the direct outcome of the if part and focusing on the divisibility by 3 to update `res` as per the task:

Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer at least 10, `i` is 3, if `n` is divisible by 3, then `res` is 4.***
