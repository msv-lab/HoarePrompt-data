Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer that must be at least 1, `i` is 1, and the product of `i` squared equals `n`, meaning the current value of `n` is 1, since `i` is 1 and `i` squared equals `n`. The variable `res` has a value of 0, because `n` is a multiple of `i` is not applicable here as a condition to change `res` to 2 since the if condition specifically checks for `i` squared equals `n`, not just `n` being a multiple of `i`, and there's no previous condition that set `res` to a different value based on this specific scenario.**
