Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem asks to find the number of different weights of splits of a given number `n`. However, the program calculates the number of divisors of `n`, which is not the same thing.

The program uses a loop to iterate from 1 to the square root of `n` and checks if `n` is divisible by each number in this range. If `n` is divisible, it increments the result by 2 (except when `n` is a perfect square, in which case it increments by 1). This is a common approach to calculate the number of divisors of a number.

However, the problem description defines a weight of a split as the number of elements in the split that are equal to the first element. The program does not take this into account and instead focuses on the divisors of `n`.

For example, for `n = 7`, the program will output `4` because `7` has 4 divisors: 1, 7. However, the correct output should be the number of different weights of splits of `7`, which are:

* Weight 1: [7]
* Weight 2: [3, 3, 1]
* Weight 3: [2, 2, 2, 1]
* Weight 7: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Therefore, the correct output for `n = 7` should be `4`, but for a different reason than what the program calculates.

To correctly solve the problem, a different approach is needed, such as generating all possible splits of `n` and calculating the weight of each split.
