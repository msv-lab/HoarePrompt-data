Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. The problem asks to find the number of different weights of splits of a given integer `n`, where a split is a nonincreasing sequence of positive integers that sum up to `n`, and the weight of a split is the number of elements in the split that are equal to the first element.

However, the provided program calculates the total number of divisors of `n`, which is a different task altogether. It iterates through all numbers from 1 to the square root of `n`, checks if `n` is divisible by the current number, and increments the result counter accordingly. This approach has nothing to do with finding the different weights of splits of `n`.

For example, given the input `7`, the program will correctly calculate that `7` has 4 divisors (1, 7), but it will not find the different weights of splits of `7`, which are 1, 2, 3, and 7, as shown in the problem description.

To correctly solve the problem, a different approach would be needed, such as generating all possible splits of `n` and counting the distinct weights. The provided program does not accomplish this task and therefore does not meet the problem description.
