Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
The given program calculates the total number of divisors of `n`, not the number of different weights of its splits. The problem description asks to find the number of different weights of splits of `n`, where a split is a nonincreasing sequence of positive integers that sum up to `n`, and the weight of a split is the number of elements in the split that are equal to the first element.

The program does not address this problem. It simply calculates the number of divisors of `n`, which is not related to the concept of splits and their weights. 

For example, for `n = 7`, the program will output the number of divisors of 7, which is 2 (1 and 7), but the correct output should be 4, which corresponds to the different weights of splits of 7: [7], [3, 3, 1], [2, 2, 2, 1], and [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1].

The output hints also indicate that the function calculates the total number of divisors of `n`, not the number of different weights of its splits, which further confirms that the code does not match the problem description.
