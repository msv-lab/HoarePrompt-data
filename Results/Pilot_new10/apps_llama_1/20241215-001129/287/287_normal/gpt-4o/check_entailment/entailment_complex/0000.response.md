Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description. The problem description asks to find the number of different weights of splits of a given number `n`, where a split is a nonincreasing sequence of positive integers that sum up to `n`, and the weight of a split is the number of elements equal to the first element.

However, the provided program calculates the total number of factors of the input number `n`. This is not related to the concept of splits and their weights as described in the problem description.

For example, if the input is `7`, the program will return `4` because `7` has `4` factors: `1`, `7`. However, according to the problem description, the correct answer is `4` because there are `4` different weights of splits of `7`: `1`, `2`, `3`, and `7`, corresponding to the splits `[7]`, `[3, 3, 1]`, `[2, 2, 2, 1]`, and `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`. But this is just a coincidence, and the program will not work correctly for all inputs.

To correctly solve the problem, a different approach would be needed, such as generating all possible splits of `n` and counting the distinct weights. The current program does not accomplish this task.
