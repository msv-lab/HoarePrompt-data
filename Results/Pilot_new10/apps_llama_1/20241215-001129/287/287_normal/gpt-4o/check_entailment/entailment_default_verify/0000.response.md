Based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment does not make sense. The output hints provided suggest that the function `func_1` is actually calculating the total number of factors of the input number `num`, which is equivalent to finding the number of different weights of its splits.

The key insight here is that the number of different weights of splits of a number `n` is equal to the number of factors of `n`. This is because each factor of `n` can be used to create a split of `n` with a unique weight.

For example, if `n = 12`, the factors of `12` are `1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12`. These factors correspond to the following splits of `12` with unique weights:
- `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` with weight `12`
- `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]` with weight `6`
- `[3, 3, 3, 3]` with weight `4`
- `[4, 4, 4]` with weight `3`
- `[6, 6]` with weight `2`
- `[12]` with weight `1`

Therefore, the number of different weights of splits of `12` is `6`, which is equal to the number of factors of `12`.

The provided code `func_1` calculates the number of factors of `num` correctly, which means it is actually calculating the number of different weights of its splits.

The original assessment claimed that the code was incorrect because it did not generate all possible splits of the number `n` and calculate their weights. However, this is not necessary to solve the problem, as the number of factors of `n` can be used to find the number of different weights of its splits.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided code, I believe that the original assessment was not accurate.

Final: **True**
