You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Let's define a split of $n$ as a nonincreasing sequence of positive integers, the sum of which is $n$. 

For example, the following sequences are splits of $8$: $[4, 4]$, $[3, 3, 2]$, $[2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1]$, $[5, 2, 1]$.

The following sequences aren't splits of $8$: $[1, 7]$, $[5, 4]$, $[11, -3]$, $[1, 1, 4, 1, 1]$.

The weight of a split is the number of elements in the split that are equal to the first element. For example, the weight of the split $[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]$ is $5$, the weight of the split $[5, 5, 3, 3, 3]$ is $2$ and the weight of the split $[9]$ equals $1$.

For a given $n$, find out the number of different weights of its splits.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Output one integer — the answer to the problem.

-----Note-----

In the first sample, there are following possible weights of splits of $7$:

Weight 1: [$\textbf 7$] 

Weight 2: [$\textbf 3$, $\textbf 3$, 1] 

Weight 3: [$\textbf 2$, $\textbf 2$, $\textbf 2$, 1] 

Weight 7: [$\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$]
Program:
```
n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(num):
    count = 0
    i = 1
    while i * i <= num:
        if num % i == 0:
            count += 1
            if i != num // i:
                count += 1
        i += 1
    return count


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The given Python program is attempting to find the number of different weights of splits of a given number n. However, it doesn't actually implement the necessary logic to achieve this.

The program is currently calculating the number of divisors of the input number n, which is not the same as finding the different weights of its splits.

A correct implementation would involve generating all possible splits of the number n and then calculating the weight of each split. The weight of a split is the number of elements in the split that are equal to the first element. The program should then return the number of distinct weights it finds.

For example, given the input 7, the program should find the following splits and their corresponding weights:
- [7] with weight 1
- [3, 3, 1] with weight 2
- [2, 2, 2, 1] with weight 3
- [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] with weight 7

The program should then return 4, which is the number of distinct weights.

However, the given program does not implement this logic and instead calculates the number of divisors of the input number, which is incorrect. Therefore, the correctness of the program is False. 

Here is a correct Python implementation for the problem:

```python
def func_1(num):
    weights = set()
    for i in range(1, num + 1):
        split = []
        remaining = num
        for j in range(i, 0, -1):
            if remaining >= j:
                split.append(j)
                remaining -= j
        if remaining == 0:
            weight = split.count(split[0])
            weights.add(weight)
    return len(weights)

n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))
```

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a positive integer such that 1 <= num <= 10^9.
def func_1(num):
    count = 0
    i = 1
    while i * i <= num:
        if num % i == 0:
            count += 1
            if i != num // i:
                count += 1
        
        i += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `num` is unchanged, `i` is the smallest integer greater than the square root of the original value of `num`, and `count` is the total number of factors of the original value of `num`.
    return count
    #The program returns the total number of factors of the original value of `num`


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
