To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we need to analyze the loop's behavior and how it affects the variables `num`, `count`, and `i`.

The loop continues as long as `i * i <= num`, which means it will keep running until `i` is greater than the square root of `num`. Inside the loop, if `num` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `num % i == 0`), it increments `count` by 1. If `i` is not equal to `num // i` (meaning `i` is not the square root of `num`), it increments `count` again by 1.

Given the initial state and the loop's behavior:
- `num` remains constant throughout the loop because its value does not change inside the loop.
- `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 after each iteration, effectively counting up from 1.
- `count` starts at 0 and is incremented based on the divisibility of `num` by `i`.

Analyzing the provided output states after the loop executes a few times:
- After 1 iteration, `i` is 2, and if `num` is not 1, `count` is 2, indicating that both 1 and `num` itself are counted as factors if `num` is not 1.
- After 2 iterations, `i` is 3, and `count` varies based on whether `num` has factors among the numbers 1, 2, and possibly 3.
- After 3 iterations, `i` is 4, and similar patterns emerge, with `count` increasing based on the factors of `num`.

Considering the loop's termination condition, `i * i <= num`, once `i` exceeds the square root of `num`, the loop ends. Therefore, the final value of `i` will be the smallest integer greater than the square root of `num`.

The `count` variable accumulates the number of factors of `num`. For each factor `i`, if `i` is not the square root of `num`, both `i` and `num // i` are counted, which is why we see `count` sometimes incrementing by 2.

Given these observations, after all iterations of the loop have executed:
- `num` remains unchanged because it's not modified within the loop.
- `i` will be the smallest integer greater than the square root of `num`, as the loop ends when `i * i > num`.
- `count` will hold the total number of factors of `num`, considering that each pair of factors (except when `i` is the square root of `num`) contributes 2 to the count.

Therefore, the output state of the loop, considering the format and the deductions made, is:

Output State: **`num` is unchanged, `i` is the smallest integer greater than the square root of the original value of `num`, and `count` is the total number of factors of the original value of `num`.**
