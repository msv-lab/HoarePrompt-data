The given code snippet assigns the value 1 to the variable `i`. The initial state is that `num` is a positive integer such that 1 <= num <= 10^9, and `count` is 0. 

The value of `num` and `count` does not change, but `i` is assigned the value 1.

Output State: **`num` is a positive integer such that 1 <= num <= 10^9, `count` is 0, `i` is 1**
