The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` is 2, so the new value of `i` is 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Since `num` is at least 9, we need to check if `i` (now 3) is a factor of `num`. If 3 is a factor of `num`, then `count` remains 2. If 3 is not a factor of `num`, then `count` is 4.

Output State: **`num` is at least 9, `i` is 3. If `i` is a factor of `num`, then `count` is 2. If `i` is not a factor of `num`, then `count` is 4.**
