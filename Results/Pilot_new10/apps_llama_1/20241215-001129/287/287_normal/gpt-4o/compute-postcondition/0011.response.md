The code increments the value of `count` by 1. Given the initial state, `num` must be at least 9, so the condition "if `num` is 1" is never true. Therefore, the initial value of `count` is 2. After the code is executed, `count` becomes 3.

The states of the other variables are not affected. The value of `i` remains 2, and `num` is still at least 9.

Output State: **`num` is at least 9, `i` is 2, `count` is 3**
