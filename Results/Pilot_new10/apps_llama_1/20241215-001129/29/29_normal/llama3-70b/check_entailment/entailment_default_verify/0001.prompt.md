You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The All-Berland National Olympiad in Informatics has just ended! Now Vladimir wants to upload the contest from the Olympiad as a gym to a popular Codehorses website.

Unfortunately, the archive with Olympiad's data is a mess. For example, the files with tests are named arbitrary without any logic.

Vladimir wants to rename the files with tests so that their names are distinct integers starting from 1 without any gaps, namely, "1", "2", ..., "n', where n is the total number of tests.

Some of the files contain tests from statements (examples), while others contain regular tests. It is possible that there are no examples, and it is possible that all tests are examples. Vladimir wants to rename the files so that the examples are the first several tests, all all the next files contain regular tests only.

The only operation Vladimir can perform is the "move" command. Vladimir wants to write a script file, each of the lines in which is "move file_1 file_2", that means that the file "file_1" is to be renamed to "file_2". If there is a file "file_2" at the moment of this line being run, then this file is to be rewritten. After the line "move file_1 file_2" the file "file_1" doesn't exist, but there is a file "file_2" with content equal to the content of "file_1" before the "move" command.

Help Vladimir to write the script file with the minimum possible number of lines so that after this script is run:  all examples are the first several tests having filenames "1", "2", ..., "e", where e is the total number of examples;  all other files contain regular tests with filenames "e + 1", "e + 2", ..., "n", where n is the total number of all tests. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of files with tests.

n lines follow, each describing a file with test. Each line has a form of "name_i type_i", where "name_i" is the filename, and "type_i" equals "1", if the i-th file contains an example test, and "0" if it contains a regular test. Filenames of each file are strings of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters. The filenames are guaranteed to be distinct.


-----Output-----

In the first line print the minimum number of lines in Vladimir's script file.

After that print the script file, each line should be "move file_1 file_2", where "file_1" is an existing at the moment of this line being run filename, and "file_2" — is a string of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6.

Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    files = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (name, type_) = input().split()
        files.append((name, int(type_)))
    files.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    examples = [file[0] for file in files if file[1] == 1]
    regular = [file[0] for file in files if file[1] == 0]
    script = []
    for (i, file) in enumerate(examples, start=1):
        script.append(f'move {file} {i}')
    for (i, file) in enumerate(regular, start=len(examples) + 1):
        script.append(f'move {file} {i}')
    print(len(script))
    for line in script:
        print(line)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the case when the target filename is already in use. According to the problem description, if the file with the target filename already exists when a "move" command is executed, then it should be overwritten. However, the current program does not take this into account when generating the script.

For instance, consider the following input:

```
2
1 0
2 1
```

In this case, the program outputs:

```
2
move 1 1
move 2 2
```

However, the correct output should be:

```
3
move 1 3
move 2 1
move 3 2
```

The program should first move file "1" to "3" to free up the name "1" for file "2", and then move the file "3" to its final position "2".

Here's an updated version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    files = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (name, type_) = input().split()
        files.append((name, int(type_)))
    files.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    examples = [file[0] for file in files if file[1] == 1]
    regular = [file[0] for file in files if file[1] == 0]
    script = []
    temp_name = "temp"
    used_names = set([file[0] for file in files])
    for (i, file) in enumerate(examples, start=1):
        if str(i)!= file:
            if str(i) in used_names:
                script.append(f'move {str(i)} {temp_name}')
                used_names.add(temp_name)
                used_names.remove(str(i))
            script.append(f'move {file} {str(i)}')
            used_names.add(str(i))
            used_names.remove(file)
    for (i, file) in enumerate(regular, start=len(examples) + 1):
        if str(i)!= file:
            if str(i) in used_names:
                script.append(f'move {str(i)} {temp_name}')
                used_names.add(temp_name)
                used_names.remove(str(i))
            script.append(f'move {file} {str(i)}')
            used_names.add(str(i))
            used_names.remove(file)
    print(len(script))
    for line in script:
        print(line)

func()
```

This updated version uses a temporary name to handle cases where the target filename is already in use.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a series of inputs, including an integer n and n lines of filename and type pairs, processes these inputs to generate a script to move the files based on their types, and prints the total number of lines in the script and the script itself, handling all potential cases including empty input, files with type 0 or 1, and edge cases such as a single file or multiple files with the same type 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
