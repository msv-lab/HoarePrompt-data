Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the problem description for several reasons:

1. The program does not check for conflicts between the original filenames and the target filenames. If a file is already named with the target name, the program will overwrite it without doing anything.

2. The program does not handle the case where the target filename is the same as the original filename. In this case, the program will still output a "move" command, which is unnecessary.

3. The program does not find the minimum possible number of lines in Vladimir's script file. It simply moves each file to its target location in one step, which may not be the most efficient way.

To correctly implement the problem description, the program should:

1. Check for conflicts between the original filenames and the target filenames.
2. Handle the case where the target filename is the same as the original filename.
3. Find the minimum possible number of lines in Vladimir's script file.

Here is an example of how the program can be corrected:

- Sort the files by their types and then by their names.
- Use a set to keep track of the used filenames.
- Use a temporary filename if a conflict occurs.
- Only output a "move" command if the original filename is different from the target filename.

Here is a high-level outline of the corrected program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    files = []
    for _ in range(n):
        name, type_ = input().split()
        files.append((name, int(type_)))
    
    files.sort(key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))
    examples = [file[0] for file in files if file[1] == 1]
    regular = [file[0] for file in files if file[1] == 0]
    
    used = set()
    script = []
    for i, file in enumerate(examples, start=1):
        if str(i)!= file:
            if str(i) in used:
                temp = 'temp'
                while temp in used:
                    temp += '1'
                script.append(f'move {str(i)} {temp}')
                used.add(temp)
            script.append(f'move {file} {str(i)}')
        used.add(str(i))
        
    for i, file in enumerate(regular, start=len(examples) + 1):
        if str(i)!= file:
            if str(i) in used:
                temp = 'temp'
                while temp in used:
                    temp += '1'
                script.append(f'move {str(i)} {temp}')
                used.add(temp)
            script.append(f'move {file} {str(i)}')
        used.add(str(i))
        
    print(len(script))
    for line in script:
        print(line)
```
