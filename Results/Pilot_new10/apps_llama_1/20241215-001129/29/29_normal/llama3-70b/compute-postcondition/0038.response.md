The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the parameter constraints, it is implicit that the function will be processing a series of inputs: an integer `n`, followed by `n` lines of input, each containing a string `filename` and an integer `type`. The `filename` is composed of digits and small English letters with a length between 1 and 6 characters, and the `type` is either 0 or 1. Since there's no explicit information about the return value in the provided constraints, we can't specify what the function returns. 

Given the lack of explicit return information, the functionality description focuses on the input parameters. 

Functionality: **The function implicitly accepts a series of inputs starting with an integer n, followed by n lines, each containing a distinct filename and a type, and processes these inputs without explicit return values specified.**
