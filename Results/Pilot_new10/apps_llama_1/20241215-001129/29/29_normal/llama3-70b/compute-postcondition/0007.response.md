The `files` list is updated by appending a new tuple `(name, int(type_))`, where `name` is the current string and `type_` is converted to an integer. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
`n` is still an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `_` is still 1, `name` is still a string from the input before the split, `type_` is still a string from the input after the split. 
`files` is now a list containing at least two tuples: the original tuple(s) and the new tuple `(name, int(type_))`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `name` is a string from the input before the split, `type_` is a string from the input after the split, `files` is a list containing at least two tuples (the original tuple(s) and the new tuple `(name, int(type_))`), `_` is 1**
