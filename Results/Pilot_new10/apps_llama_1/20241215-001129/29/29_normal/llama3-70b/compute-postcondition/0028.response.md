The code appends a new string to the `script` list in the format `f'move {file} {i}'`. 

Given that `file` is the third filename in `regular` and `i` is `len(examples) + 3`, the new string will be `f'move {regular[2]} {len(examples) + 3}'`.

Since `script` already contains strings for each filename in `examples` and the first, second, and third filenames in `regular`, this new string will be appended to the end of the list.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `name` is the last filename read, `type_` is the last type read, `files` is a sorted list of `n` tuples containing filenames and their corresponding types in descending order of types, `_` is the last index value of `n-1`, `examples` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 1, `regular` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 0 and must have at least 3 filenames, `script` is a list containing strings in the format `f'move {file} {i}'` for each filename in `examples` and also `f'move {file} {i}'` where `file` is the first, second, and third filename in `regular` and `i` is `len(examples) + 1`, `len(examples) + 2`, and `len(examples) + 3`, and an additional string `f'move {regular[2]} {len(examples) + 3}'`, `i` is `len(examples) + 3`, `file` is the third filename in `regular`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `name` is the last filename read, `type_` is the last type read, `files` is a sorted list of `n` tuples containing filenames and their corresponding types in descending order of types, `_` is the last index value of `n-1`, `examples` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 1, `regular` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 0 and must have at least 3 filenames, `script` is a list containing strings in the format `f'move {file} {i}'` for each filename in `examples` and also `f'move {file} {i}'` where `file` is the first, second, and third filename in `regular` and `i` is `len(examples) + 1`, `len(examples) + 2`, and `len(examples) + 3`, and an additional string `f'move {regular[2]} {len(examples) + 3}'`, `i` is `len(examples) + 3`, `file` is the third filename in `regular`**
