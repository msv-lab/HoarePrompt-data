According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `_` must be increased by 1, so `_` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1 and now must be greater than 2 since `_` is 2.
State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive), `name` is a string from the input before the split, `type_` is a string from the input after the split, `files` is a list containing at least two tuples (the original tuple(s) and the new tuple `(name, int(type_))`), `_` is 2**
