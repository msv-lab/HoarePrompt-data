The code creates a new list `examples` that contains the filenames from the `files` list where the type is equal to 1. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

The value of `examples` is a list of filenames where the type is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `name` is the last filename read, `type_` is the last type read, `files` is a sorted list of `n` tuples containing filenames and their corresponding types in descending order of types, `_` is the last index value of `n-1`, `examples` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 1**
