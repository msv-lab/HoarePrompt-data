The function func accepts a series of inputs starting with an integer n, followed by n lines, each containing a distinct filename and a type (0 or 1). It processes these inputs by sorting the files based on their types in descending order, then generates a script to move the files. The script moves the files of type 1 first, followed by the files of type 0, and assigns a unique number to each file in the order they are moved. The function then prints the total number of lines in the script and the script itself.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a series of inputs, including an integer n and n lines of filename and type pairs, processes these inputs to generate a script to move the files based on their types, and prints the total number of lines in the script and the script itself, handling all potential cases including empty input, files with type 0 or 1, and edge cases such as a single file or multiple files with the same type **
