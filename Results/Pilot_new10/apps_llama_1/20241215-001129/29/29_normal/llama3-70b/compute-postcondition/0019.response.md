The code `script.append(f'move {file} {i}')` appends a new string to the `script` list. The string is in the format 'move {file} {i}', where `file` is the second filename in the `examples` list and `i` is 2. 

So, the `script` list now contains two strings: f'move {first filename in examples list} 1' and f'move {second filename in examples list} 2'. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `name` is the last filename read, `type_` is the last type read, `files` is a sorted list of `n` tuples containing filenames and their corresponding types in descending order of types, `_` is the last index value of `n-1`, `examples` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 1 and must have at least 2 filenames, `regular` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 0, `script` is a list containing two strings: f'move {first filename in examples list} 1' and f'move {second filename in examples list} 2', `i` is 2, `file` is the second filename in the `examples` list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `name` is the last filename read, `type_` is the last type read, `files` is a sorted list of `n` tuples containing filenames and their corresponding types in descending order of types, `_` is the last index value of `n-1`, `examples` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 1 and must have at least 2 filenames, `regular` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 0, `script` is a list containing two strings: f'move {first filename in examples list} 1' and f'move {second filename in examples list} 2', `i` is 2, `file` is the second filename in the `examples` list**
