According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `regular`. If the list `regular` has at least 2 filenames, the loop can execute again for the next filename. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(examples) + 1`, `file` is the first filename in `regular`, `regular` must have at least 1 filename. Since `i` is the index of the current filename in `regular` plus `len(examples)`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, which is equivalent to `len(examples) + 2`, and `file` must be the next filename in `regular`, which is the second filename in `regular`. Also, `regular` must have at least 2 filenames.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `name` is the last filename read, `type_` is the last type read, `files` is a sorted list of `n` tuples containing filenames and their corresponding types in descending order of types, `_` is the last index value of `n-1`, `examples` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 1, `regular` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 0 and must have at least 2 filenames, `script` is a list containing strings in the format `f'move {file} {i}'` for each filename in `examples` and also `f'move {file} {i}'` where `file` is the first and second filename in `regular` and `i` is `len(examples) + 1` and `len(examples) + 2`, `i` is `len(examples) + 2`, `file` is the second filename in `regular`**
