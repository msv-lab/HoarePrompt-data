To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive).
- `name` is the last filename read.
- `type_` is the last type read.
- `files` is a sorted list of `n` tuples containing filenames and their corresponding types in descending order of types.
- `_` is the last index value of `n-1`.
- `examples` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 1.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
regular = [file[0] for file in files if file[1] == 0]
```
This line of code creates a new list called `regular` that includes the filenames (`file[0]`) from the `files` list where the type (`file[1]`) is 0.

Given this operation, the output state is as follows:
- `n` remains an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive).
- `name` remains the last filename read.
- `type_` remains the last type read.
- `files` remains a sorted list of `n` tuples containing filenames and their corresponding types in descending order of types.
- `_` remains the last index value of `n-1`.
- `examples` remains a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 1.
- A new variable `regular` is introduced, which is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `name` is the last filename read, `type_` is the last type read, `files` is a sorted list of `n` tuples containing filenames and their corresponding types in descending order of types, `_` is the last index value of `n-1`, `examples` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 1, `regular` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 0**
