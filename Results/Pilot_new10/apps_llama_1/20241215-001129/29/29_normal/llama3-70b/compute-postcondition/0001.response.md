The code initializes an empty list `files`. The previous state of `n` is still valid, which is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive). The input consists of `n` lines, each containing a string filename and an integer type, where the filenames are guaranteed to be distinct, but this information is not used in the given code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), the input consists of `n` lines, each containing a string filename and an integer type, where the filenames are guaranteed to be distinct, and `files` is an empty list.**
