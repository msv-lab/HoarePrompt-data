To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, we need to consider what happens when the loop completes its execution. The loop iterates over the `script` list and prints each line.

Given the initial state and the provided output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times, we can deduce the following:

- The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the `script` list.
- The `script` list contains strings in the format `f'move {file} {i}'` for each filename in `examples` and all filenames in `regular`.
- `i` equals `len(script)` if `regular` is not empty, which suggests that `i` is dependent on the length of `script`.
- `file` is the last filename in `regular` if `regular` is not empty.
- The value `len(examples) + len(regular)` has been printed before the loop starts.

Considering the loop code `for line in script: print(line)`, after all iterations have finished:

- All lines in `script` will have been printed.
- The `line` variable will hold the value of the last line in `script` that was printed.
- Since `i` equals `len(script)` and is used in the construction of the strings in `script`, after the loop, `i` will still be equal to `len(script)`, reflecting the total number of lines that were printed.
- `file` will still be the last filename in `regular` if `regular` is not empty, as this does not change with the loop's execution.
- The other variables (`n`, `name`, `type_`, `files`, `_`, `examples`, `regular`) retain their values from the initial state or as modified before the loop, as the loop does not modify these variables.

If the `script` list is empty, the loop will not execute, and the variables will retain their initial values. Specifically, `line` will not be defined (or will retain its value from before the loop, if any), and no printing will occur.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `name` is the last filename read, `type_` is the last type read, `files` is a sorted list of `n` tuples containing filenames and their corresponding types in descending order of types, `_` is the last index value of `n-1`, `examples` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 1, `regular` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 0, `script` is an empty list or a list that has been fully printed, `i` equals `len(script)` if `regular` is not empty, `file` is the last filename in `regular` if `regular` is not empty, `line` is the last string in `script` if `script` is not empty, and the value `len(examples) + len(regular)` has been printed.**
