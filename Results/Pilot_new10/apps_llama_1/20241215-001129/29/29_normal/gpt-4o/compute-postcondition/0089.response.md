The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `temp_counter` can be either the original `temp_counter` or `temp_counter + 1` and must be less than or equal to `2 * n`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Since `temp_counter` was either the original `temp_counter` or `temp_counter + 1`, it is now either the original `temp_counter + 1` or `temp_counter + 2`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` retains its original value, `regulars` must have at least 2 elements, `file`, `name`, and `type_` hold the values of the last file processed, `moves` is updated according to the loop body's logic, `temp_counter` is either the original `temp_counter + 1` or `temp_counter + 2` and must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, `i` is 1, `target` is `len(examples) + 2`, and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`**
