`moves` is appended with the string f'move {examples[i]} {i + 1}'. The value of `i` is 0, and the current value of `examples[i]` is not equal to the string representation of `i + 1`, which is '1'. The previous value of `examples[0]` was `str(temp_counter - 1)`, so the value of `examples[0]` is `str(temp_counter - 1)`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list of filenames of type "1", `regulars` is a list of filenames of type "0", `file`, `name`, and `type_` hold the values of the last file processed, `i` is 0, `moves` contains the strings f'move {str(temp_counter - 1)} {temp_counter - 1}' and f'move {examples[0]} {1}', and the current value of `examples[0]` is not equal to '1'.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list of filenames of type "1", `regulars` is a list of filenames of type "0", `file`, `name`, and `type_` hold the values of the last file processed, `i` is 0, `moves` contains the strings f'move {str(temp_counter - 1)} {temp_counter - 1}' and f'move {examples[0]} {1}', `examples[0]` is not equal to '1', and if `examples[0]` is not equal to '1', then the current value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1 and the previous value of `examples[0]` was `str(temp_counter - 1)`.**
