The code appends a new string to the `moves` list. The string is in the format `f'move {examples[i]} {i + 1}'`. 

Given that `examples` is a list of filenames of type "1", `i` is 1, and `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`, the new string will be `f'move {examples[1]} {1 + 1}'` = `f'move {examples[1]} {2}'`. 

The value of `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list of filenames of type "1" and must have at least 2 elements, `regulars` is a list of filenames of type "0", `file`, `name`, and `type_` hold the values of the next file to be processed, `i` is 1. 

Also, the current value of `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`, `n`, `files`, `regulars`, `file`, `name`, `type_`, and `i` retain their initial values, if previously `examples[i]` was not equal to `str(i + 1)`, then `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n` or `str(temp_counter + 1)` is not in `files_set`, and `examples[i]` is equal to `str(temp_counter)`, and `moves` list includes an additional element: `f'move {str(temp_counter)} {temp_counter}`.

After the code is executed, the `moves` list will have an additional element: `f'move {examples[1]} {2}'`. The other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list of filenames of type "1" and must have at least 2 elements, `regulars` is a list of filenames of type "0", `file`, `name`, and `type_` hold the values of the next file to be processed, `i` is 1, `examples[1]` is not equal to `str(1 + 1)`, `moves` list includes an additional element: `f'move {examples[1]} {2}'**, and if previously `examples[i]` was not equal to `str(i + 1)`, then `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n` or `str(temp_counter + 1)` is not in `files_set`, and `examples[i]` is equal to `str(temp_counter)`, and `moves` list includes an additional element: `f'move {str(temp_counter)} {temp_counter}`.
