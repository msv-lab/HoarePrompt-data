`temp_counter` is incremented by 1, so its new value is `temp_counter + 1`. The condition `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n` or `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set` still holds, but now it's `(temp_counter + 1)` that is greater than `2 * n` or `str(temp_counter + 1)` is not in `files_set`. The other variables (`n`, `files`, `regulars`, `file`, `name`, `type_`, `i`, `examples`, `moves`) retain their values, with the understanding that `examples[i]` is still equal to `str(temp_counter)`, and `moves` still includes the additional element `f'move {str(temp_counter)} {temp_counter}'`.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is `(temp_counter + 1)` which is greater than `2 * n` or `str(temp_counter + 1)` is not in `files_set`, `n`, `files`, `regulars`, `file`, `name`, `type_`, and `i` retain their initial values, `examples[i]` is equal to `str(temp_counter)`, `moves` list includes an additional element: `f'move {str(temp_counter)} {temp_counter}'`.**
