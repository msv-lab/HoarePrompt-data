To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the `while` loop condition: `temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set`.

For the loop to execute again, two conditions must be met:
1. `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
2. `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `temp_counter` is 1.
- Other variables' states are provided but are not directly relevant to the loop condition.

Since `temp_counter` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` (1) is always less than or equal to `2 * n` because `2 * n` will always be at least 2 (given `n` is a positive integer). Thus, the first condition is inherently met.

The critical factor is that `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`. Since we do not have explicit information about `files_set` but know that `files` is a list of `n` tuples and assuming `files_set` is derived from `files` in some manner, we must ensure that the loop can proceed under the assumption that `files_set` contains the necessary strings.

For the loop to execute one more time, given that `temp_counter` is currently 1, we need to ensure that `str(temp_counter + 1)` (i.e., "2") is in `files_set` because `temp_counter` will increment. Thus, we must adjust our understanding of `files_set` or the condition to ensure this can happen.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list where each element is either its original value if no move was necessary or the result of the last move operation if a move was necessary, `regulars` is a list of filenames of type "0" that must have at least 1 element, `file`, `name`, and `type_` hold the values of the last file processed, `moves` is a list of move commands executed during the loop, `temp_counter` is 1, `i` is 0, `target` is `len(examples) + 1`, and `files_set` must contain "2"**
