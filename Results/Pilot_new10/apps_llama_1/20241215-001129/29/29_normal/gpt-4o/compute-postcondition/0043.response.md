According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on two conditions: `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and equals to `temp_counter + 1`. This implies that `temp_counter` has been incremented, so for the loop to execute again, `temp_counter + 1` must still be less than or equal to `2 * n`. 

Also, `files_set` must contain `str(temp_counter)`, `str(temp_counter + 1)`, and `str(temp_counter + 2)`. For the loop to execute again, it must contain `str(temp_counter + 1)` because `temp_counter` has been incremented.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list of filenames of type "1" and must have at least 2 elements, `regulars` is a list of filenames of type "0", `file`, `name`, and `type_` hold the values of the next file to be processed, `i` is 1, `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and equals to `temp_counter + 1`, `temp_counter + 1` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `files_set` must contain `str(temp_counter + 1)`, `str(temp_counter + 2)`, and `str(temp_counter + 3)`**
