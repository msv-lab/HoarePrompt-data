The code increments the `temp_counter` by 1. The previous value of `temp_counter` is 2, so the new value of `temp_counter` is 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list where each element is either its original value if no move was necessary or the result of the last move operation if a move was necessary, `regulars` is a list of filenames of type "0" that must have at least 1 element, `file`, `name`, and `type_` hold the values of the last file processed, `moves` is a list of move commands executed during the loop, `temp_counter` is 3, `i` is 0, `target` is `len(examples) + 1`, and `files_set` must contain "2"**
