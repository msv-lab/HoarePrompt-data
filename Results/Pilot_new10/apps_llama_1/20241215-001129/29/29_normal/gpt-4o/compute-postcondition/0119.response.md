Output State: **The program returns a list of move commands, 'moves', that were performed during the loop, where the loop iterates over a list of 'n' tuples, 'files', with 'n' being a positive integer, and the loop's execution is dependent on the 'regulars' list not being empty, and 'regulars' is a list of strings where each element is 'str(len(examples) + i + 1)' for 'i' in the range of 'len(regulars)'**
