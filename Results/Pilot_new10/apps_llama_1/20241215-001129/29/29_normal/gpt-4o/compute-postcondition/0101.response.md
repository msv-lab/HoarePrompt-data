Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` retains its original value, `regulars` must have at least 2 elements, `file`, `name`, and `type_` hold the values of the last file processed, `i` is 1, `target` is `len(examples) + 2`, if `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`, then `regulars[i]` is updated to `str(temp_counter)`, `temp_counter` is incremented by 1, and `moves` includes an additional element `'move ' + str(temp_counter) + ' ' + str(temp_counter)`. If `regulars[i]` is equal to `str(target)`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
