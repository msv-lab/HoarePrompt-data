`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `temp_counter` was less than or equal to `2 * n`, so the new value of `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n + 1`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list of filenames of type "1" and must have at least 2 elements, `regulars` is a list of filenames of type "0", `file`, `name`, and `type_` hold the values of the next file to be processed, `i` is 1, `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n + 1`, and `files_set` must contain `str(temp_counter - 1)` and `str(temp_counter)`.
