The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `temp_counter` is such that its string representation must be in `files_set`, and `i` is 0, `target` is `len(examples) + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
`temp_counter` is now `temp_counter + 1` which is 1 since initially `i` is 0 and considering the fact that `temp_counter` should be in `files_set`, it can be assumed that `temp_counter` was initially 0 for this equation to make sense.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list where each element is either its original value if no move was necessary or the result of the last move operation if a move was necessary, `regulars` is a list of filenames of type "0" that must have at least 1 element, `file`, `name`, and `type_` hold the values of the last file processed, `moves` is a list of move commands executed during the loop, `temp_counter` is 1, `i` is 0, and `target` is `len(examples) + 1**
