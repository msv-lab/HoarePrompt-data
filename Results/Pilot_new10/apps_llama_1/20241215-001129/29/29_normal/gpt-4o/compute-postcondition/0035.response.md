Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list of filenames of type "1", `regulars` is a list of filenames of type "0", `file`, `name`, and `type_` hold the values of the last file processed, `i` is 0. If `examples[0]` is not equal to '1', then the current value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1, `moves` contains the string f'move {str(temp_counter - 1)} {temp_counter - 1}' and the previous value of `examples[0]` was `str(temp_counter - 1)`. The current value of `examples[i]` is not equal to the string representation of `i + 1`.**
