The code `temp_counter = n + 1` assigns the value of `n + 1` to `temp_counter`. The value of `n` is a positive integer. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list of filenames of type "1", `regulars` is a list of filenames of type "0", `file`, `name`, and `type_` hold the values of the last file processed, `moves` is an empty list, and `temp_counter` is equal to `n + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list of filenames of type "1", `regulars` is a list of filenames of type "0", `file`, `name`, and `type_` hold the values of the last file processed, `moves` is an empty list, and `temp_counter` is `n + 1`.**
