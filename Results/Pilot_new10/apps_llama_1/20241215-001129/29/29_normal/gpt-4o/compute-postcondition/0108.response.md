To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given `while` loop condition: `temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set`.

1. **Condition 1: `temp_counter <= 2 * n`**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and equals `temp_counter + 1`. This implies that after the last iteration, `temp_counter` has been incremented by 1 to reach the next value. For the loop to execute again, `temp_counter` after the last iteration must still be less than or equal to `2 * n`. Since `temp_counter` equals `temp_counter + 1` and this new value is in `files_set`, it means `temp_counter` (after the increment) must be less than or equal to `2 * n` to satisfy the first part of the condition.

2. **Condition 2: `str(temp_counter) in files_set`**
   - The condition also requires that `str(temp_counter)` (which is essentially `str(temp_counter + 1)` after the increment, given that `temp_counter` equals `temp_counter + 1` and `str(temp_counter + 1)` is in `files_set`) must be in `files_set`. This means, for the next iteration to occur, `str(temp_counter + 1)` (where `temp_counter` is the value after the last iteration's increment) must be present in `files_set`.

Given these conditions, let's evaluate the state adjustments needed:

- `n` is a positive integer: No adjustment needed; it's a given condition not directly impacting the loop condition.
- `files` is a list of `n` tuples: No adjustment needed; the loop condition doesn't directly depend on `files`.
- `examples` retains its original value: No adjustment needed; `examples` does not impact the loop condition.
- `regulars` must have at least 3 elements: No adjustment needed; the loop condition does not depend on `regulars`.
- `file`, `name`, and `type_` will be updated to the next file's values: These updates do not affect the loop condition directly.
- `i` is 2: The loop condition does not depend on `i`, so no adjustment is needed.
- `target` is `len(examples) + 3`: This does not affect the loop condition, so no adjustment is needed.
- `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and equals to `temp_counter + 1` with `str(temp_counter + 1)` in `files_set`: For the loop to execute again, given that `temp_counter` has been incremented, `temp_counter` (the new value) must still satisfy both parts of the condition. This implies `temp_counter` (after increment) must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter + 1)` (considering the increment) must be in `files_set`.

**State:** **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` retains its original value, `regulars` must have at least 3 elements, `file`, `name`, and `type_` will be updated to the next file's values, `i` is 2, `target` is `len(examples) + 3`, and `temp_counter` (after increment) must be less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter + 1)` (after the last increment) must be in `files_set`.**
