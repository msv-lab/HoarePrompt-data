According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `files` list. If the list has at least 1 file, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` is an empty list, and `regulars` is an empty list. So for the loop to be executed, the list `files` must have at least 1 file and the file is the first file in the list.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples that must have at least 1 file, `examples` is an empty list, `regulars` is an empty list, file is the first file in the list**
