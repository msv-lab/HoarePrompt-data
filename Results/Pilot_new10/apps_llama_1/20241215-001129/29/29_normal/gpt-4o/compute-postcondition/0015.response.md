The given code `name, type_ = file.split()` splits the string representation of `file` into two parts and assigns them to `name` and `type_` respectively. 

Since `file` is the third file in the list `files`, and `name` and `type_` are updated based on the string representation of `file`, the values of `name` and `type_` will be updated to the first and second part of the string representation of `file` after splitting. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of at least 3 tuples, `file` is the third file in the list, `name` is the first part of the string representation of `file` after splitting, `type_` is the second part of the string representation of `file` after splitting. If `type_` is '1', then `examples` is a list containing at least two occurrences of `name` and `regulars` is an empty list. If `type_` is not '1', then `examples` is an empty list and `regulars` is a list containing at least two occurrences of `name`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of at least 3 tuples, `file` is the third file in the list, `name` is the first part of the string representation of `file` after splitting, `type_` is the second part of the string representation of `file` after splitting, if `type_` is '1', then `examples` is a list containing at least two occurrences of `name` and `regulars` is an empty list, if `type_` is not '1', then `examples` is an empty list and `regulars` is a list containing at least two occurrences of `name`**
