The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `temp_counter` was less than or equal to `2 * n` and was equal to `temp_counter + 1`, which implies `temp_counter` was equal to an integer value and now `temp_counter` is still an integer but increased by 1, thus `temp_counter` equals `temp_counter + 1` from the previous state. Given that `temp_counter + 1` must be less than or equal to `2 * n` in the initial state, it means `temp_counter + 2` (the new value of `temp_counter + 1`) is also less than or equal to `2 * n`. The other variables (`n`, `files`, `examples`, `regulars`, `file`, `name`, `type_`, `i`, `files_set`) remain unchanged as they are not directly involved in this operation. Therefore, after the increment, `temp_counter` will still be less than or equal to `2 * n`, and all other conditions related to `files_set` containing `str(temp_counter + 1)`, `str(temp_counter + 2)`, and `str(temp_counter + 3)` will see the values within `files_set` shifted due to the increment of `temp_counter`, now requiring `files_set` to contain `str(temp_counter + 2)`, `str(temp_counter + 3)`, and `str(temp_counter + 4)` to meet the updated condition based on the incremented `temp_counter`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list of filenames of type "1" and must have at least 2 elements, `regulars` is a list of filenames of type "0", `file`, `name`, and `type_` hold the values of the next file to be processed, `i` is 1, `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and equals to the previous `temp_counter + 1`, `temp_counter + 1` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `files_set` must contain `str(temp_counter + 2)`, `str(temp_counter + 3)`, and `str(temp_counter + 4)`**
