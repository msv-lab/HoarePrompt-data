To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the condition of the `while` loop: `temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set`.

1. **`temp_counter <= 2 * n`**: For this condition to be true, given that `temp_counter` is `n + 2`, it must be that `n + 2` is less than or equal to `2 * n`. This simplifies to `n >= 2`. However, since `n` is a positive integer, the adjustment here is implicit in the condition itself, meaning `n` should be such that it satisfies this inequality but since `n` is already defined as a positive integer and we don't have a specific value, we focus on the other condition for more specific adjustments.

2. **`str(temp_counter) in files_set`**: Since `temp_counter` is `n + 2` and its string representation needs to be in `files_set`, and we know `files_set` must contain the string representation of `n + 1`, for the loop to execute again, `files_set` must also contain the string representation of `n + 2`. 

Given these considerations, the adjustments focus on ensuring both conditions of the `while` loop are met for another iteration:

- `n` needs to be at least 2 or more for the first condition to potentially be true given the starting value of `temp_counter`.
- `files_set` must contain the string representation of `n + 2`, in addition to containing the string representation of `n + 1`.

The states of `files`, `examples`, `regulars`, `file`, `name`, `type_`, and `moves` do not directly influence the loop condition, so they do not need adjustment based on the provided information. The value of `i` is 0, but it does not affect the loop condition directly.

State: **`n` is a positive integer and must be at least 2, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list of filenames of type "1" that must have at least 1 element, `regulars` is a list of filenames of type "0", `file`, `name`, and `type_` hold the values of the last file processed, `moves` is an empty list, `temp_counter` is `n + 2`, `i` is 0, and `files_set` must contain the string representations of both `n + 1` and `n + 2`**
