The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `temp_counter` was either the original `temp_counter + 2` or `temp_counter + 3`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the new value of `temp_counter` is either `temp_counter + 3` or `temp_counter + 4`. Since `temp_counter` must be less than `2 * n`, this condition remains valid. The condition `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set` for the loop to execute again is still valid.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` retains its original value, `regulars` must have at least 2 elements, `file`, `name`, and `type_` hold the values of the last file processed, `moves` is updated, `temp_counter` is either `temp_counter + 3` or `temp_counter + 4` and must be less than `2 * n`, `i` is 1, `target` is `len(examples) + 2`, and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set` for the loop to execute again**
