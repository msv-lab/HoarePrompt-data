Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `i` is 2. The current value of `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`. `examples` is a list of filenames where `examples[2]` is `str(temp_counter - 1)` and the rest are of type "1" with at least 2 other elements besides `examples[2]`, `regulars` is a list of filenames of type "0", `file`, `name`, and `type_` hold the values of the next file to be processed, `temp_counter` is the smallest value greater than the last string found in `files_set` that is less than or equal to `2 * n` plus 1, or `2 * n + 1` if all numbers up to `2 * n` are found in `files_set` plus 1, and `moves` is the updated list with the new move 'move {examples[2]} {temp_counter - 1}' appended to it.**
