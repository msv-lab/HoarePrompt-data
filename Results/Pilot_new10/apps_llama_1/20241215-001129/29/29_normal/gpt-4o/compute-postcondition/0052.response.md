Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list of filenames of type "1" and must have at least 2 elements, `regulars` is a list of filenames of type "0", `file`, `name`, and `type_` hold the values of the next file to be processed, `i` is 1. If `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`, then `moves` list includes an additional element: `f'move {examples[i]} {i + 1}`. If `examples[i]` is equal to `str(i + 1)`, then the state of the program remains unchanged, with no modifications to `n`, `files`, `regulars`, `file`, `name`, `type_`, `i`, or `moves`.**
