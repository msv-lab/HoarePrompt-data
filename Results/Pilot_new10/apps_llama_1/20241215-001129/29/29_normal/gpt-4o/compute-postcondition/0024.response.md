To ensure the loop can execute at least one time, we need to analyze the conditions set by the `while` loop statement. The loop will execute as long as two conditions are met: 

1. `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
2. The string representation of `temp_counter` must be in `files_set`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `files` is a list of `n` tuples.
- `examples` is a list of filenames of type "1" that must have at least 1 element.
- `regulars` is a list of filenames of type "0".
- `file`, `name`, and `type_` hold the values of the last file processed.
- `moves` is an empty list.
- `temp_counter` is `n + 1`.
- `i` is 0.
- The current value of `examples` at index `i` is not equal to the string representation of `i + 1`, meaning `examples[0]` is not equal to "1".

For the loop to execute at least one time, we need to ensure that both conditions can be met. 

1. Since `temp_counter` is `n + 1` and needs to be less than or equal to `2 * n`, this condition can be satisfied if `n + 1 <= 2 * n`, which simplifies to `1 <= n`. Given that `n` is a positive integer, this condition is inherently satisfied.

2. The string representation of `temp_counter` (which is `n + 1`) must be in `files_set`. For this to be possible, the set `files_set` must contain string representations of numbers, specifically the string representation of `n + 1`.

Given these considerations, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `files_set` contains the string representation of `temp_counter`, which is `str(n + 1)`. No other adjustments are necessary since `n` being a positive integer already satisfies the first condition of the loop, and `temp_counter` being `n + 1` does not violate this condition.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list of filenames of type "1" that must have at least 1 element, `regulars` is a list of filenames of type "0", `file`, `name`, and `type_` hold the values of the last file processed, `moves` is an empty list, `temp_counter` is `n + 1`, `i` is 0, and `files_set` must contain the string representation of `n + 1`.**
