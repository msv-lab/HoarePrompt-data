`moves` is updated by appending a string that represents a move operation. The string is in the format 'move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}', where `examples[i]` is the filename at index `i` in the `examples` list and `temp_counter` is the smallest value greater than `2 * n` or the smallest value greater than `n` whose string representation is not in `files_set`. The value of `i` is 0, so `examples[i]` is the first filename in the `examples` list. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp_counter` is the smallest value greater than `2 * n` or the smallest value greater than `n` whose string representation is not in `files_set`, `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list of filenames of type "1" that must have at least 1 element, `regulars` is a list of filenames of type "0", `file`, `name`, and `type_` hold the values of the last file processed, `moves` is a list containing the string 'move {examples[0]} {temp_counter}', and `i` is 0.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is the smallest value greater than `2 * n` or the smallest value greater than `n` whose string representation is not in `files_set`, `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list of filenames of type "1" that must have at least 1 element, `regulars` is a list of filenames of type "0", `file`, `name`, and `type_` hold the values of the last file processed, `moves` is a list containing the string f'move {examples[0]} {temp_counter}', and `i` is 0**
