Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list of filenames of type "1" and must have at least 2 elements, `regulars` is a list of filenames of type "0", `file`, `name`, and `type_` hold the values of the next file to be processed, `i` is 1. The current value of `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`, `n`, `files`, `regulars`, `file`, `name`, `type_`, and `i` retain their initial values, if previously `examples[i]` was not equal to `str(i + 1)`, then `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n` or `str(temp_counter + 1)` is not in `files_set`, and `examples[i]` is equal to `str(temp_counter)`, and `moves` list includes an additional element: `f'move {str(temp_counter)} {temp_counter}`.**
