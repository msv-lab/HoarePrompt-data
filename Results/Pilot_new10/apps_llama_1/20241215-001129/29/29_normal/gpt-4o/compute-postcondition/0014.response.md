To determine the adjusted states for the loop to execute one more time, we analyze the given loop statement and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

Given loop statement:
```python
for file in files:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

State at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `files` is a list of at least 2 tuples.
- `file` is the second file in the list.
- `name` is the first part of the string representation of `file` after splitting.
- `type_` is the second part of the string representation of `file` after splitting.
  - If `type_` is '1', then `examples` is a list containing at least two occurrences of `name` and `regulars` is an empty list.
  - If `type_` is not '1', then `examples` is an empty list and `regulars` is a list containing at least two occurrences of `name`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `files` must have at least 3 elements because `file` is currently the second file in the list. Thus, for the loop to proceed to the next iteration, it needs to move on to the third file in the list.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:
- `n` remains a positive integer, as its value does not affect the loop's ability to iterate over `files`.
- `files` must be a list of at least 3 tuples to ensure there's a next file to iterate over.
- `file` would be the third file in the list.
- `name` would be the first part of the string representation of this new `file` after splitting.
- `type_` would be the second part of the string representation of this new `file` after splitting, and its value ('1' or not '1') would dictate the contents of `examples` and `regulars` as before, but now in relation to the new `file`.

Given the conditional behavior based on `type_`, the state of `examples` and `regulars` would depend on the `type_` of the new `file`. If the new `file`'s `type_` is '1', then `examples` would contain at least two occurrences of the new `name`, and `regulars` would be empty. If the new `file`'s `type_` is not '1', then `examples` would be empty, and `regulars` would contain at least two occurrences of the new `name`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of at least 3 tuples, `file` is the third file in the list, `name` is the first part of the string representation of `file` after splitting, `type_` is the second part of the string representation of `file` after splitting. If `type_` is '1', then `examples` is a list containing at least two occurrences of `name` and `regulars` is an empty list. If `type_` is not '1', then `examples` is an empty list and `regulars` is a list containing at least two occurrences of `name`.**
