The code appends the value of `name` to the list `examples`. The previous values of `n`, `files`, `regulars`, `file`, `name`, and `type_` are not affected by this operation. 

The list `examples` was initially empty, but now it contains the `name` which is the first part of the string representation of the first file.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list containing the first part of the string representation of the first file, `regulars` is an empty list, `file` is the first file in the list, `name` is the first part of the string representation of the first file, `type_` is '1'**
