To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the condition of the `while` loop: `temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set`.

1. **Condition 1: `temp_counter <= 2 * n`**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `temp_counter` is `n + 3`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
   - Given that `temp_counter` is `n + 3`, for it to satisfy the condition `temp_counter <= 2 * n`, we need `n + 3 <= 2 * n`.
   - This simplifies to `3 <= n`, which means `n` must be at least 3 for this condition to potentially be true after incrementing `temp_counter`.

2. **Condition 2: `str(temp_counter) in files_set`**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `files_set` must contain the string representations of both `n + 1` and `n + 2`.
   - For the loop to execute again, the string representation of the next `temp_counter` (which is `n + 4` after incrementing `n + 3`) must be in `files_set`.
   - This means `files_set` must now also contain the string representation of `n + 4` for the loop to potentially execute again.

Given these considerations:

- `n` must be at least 3 to satisfy the first condition after incrementing `temp_counter`.
- `files_set` must contain the string representation of `n + 4` to satisfy the second condition.

No other states directly impact the loop's condition, so adjustments are only necessary for `n` and the contents of `files_set`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer and must be at least 3, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list of filenames of type "1" that must have at least 1 element, `regulars` is a list of filenames of type "0", `file`, `name`, and `type_` hold the values of the last file processed, `moves` is an empty list, `temp_counter` is `n + 3`, `i` is 0, and `files_set` must contain the string representations of `n + 1`, `n + 2`, and `n + 4`**
