To determine the new state, we need to analyze the given for loop statement and the previous state. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of `regulars`. If `i` is less than the length of `regulars`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `files` is a list of `n` tuples
- `examples` retains its original value
- `regulars` must have at least 2 elements
- `file`, `name`, and `type_` hold the values of the last file processed
- `i` is 1
- `target` is `len(examples) + 2`
- The state of `regulars[i]`, `temp_counter`, and `moves` depends on whether `regulars[i]` is equal to `str(target)`

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. So, `i` becomes 2. Since `i` is now 2, we are considering the next element in `regulars`. Therefore, `regulars` must have at least 3 elements for the loop to execute again.

The values of `file`, `name`, and `type_` are not directly related to the loop condition but are updated based on the loop body, which is not provided. However, since the loop is executing again, we can assume these variables will hold the values of the next file processed, but we don't have enough information to determine their exact values.

The state of `regulars[i]`, `temp_counter`, and `moves` after the next iteration depends on the comparison between `regulars[i]` (now `regulars[2]`) and `str(target)`, which is not provided. However, for the purpose of determining the state at the start of the next iteration, we focus on the conditions that allow the loop to continue, not the specific updates within the loop body.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` retains its original value, `regulars` must have at least 3 elements, `file`, `name`, and `type_` will be updated to the next file's values, `i` is 2, `target` is `len(examples) + 2`**
