The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `temp_counter` was less than or equal to `2 * n`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` retains its original value, `regulars` must have at least 3 elements, `file`, `name`, and `type_` will be updated to the next file's values, `i` is 2, `target` is `len(examples) + 3`, and `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and equals to `temp_counter + 1` with `str(temp_counter + 1)` in `files_set`.**
