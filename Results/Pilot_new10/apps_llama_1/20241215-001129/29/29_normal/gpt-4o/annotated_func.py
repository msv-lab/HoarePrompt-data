#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, and files is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a filename (a string of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters) and a type (either "0" for a regular test or "1" for an example test), such that the filenames are distinct and the number of files is equal to n.
def func_1(n, files):
    examples = []
    regulars = []
    for file in files:
        name, type_ = file.split()
        
        if type_ == '1':
            examples.append(name)
        else:
            regulars.append(name)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the given information and the loop code step by step.
    #
    #1. **Initial State**: 
    #   - `n` is a positive integer.
    #   - `files` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains a filename and a type ("0" for regular test or "1" for example test).
    #   - `examples` and `regulars` are empty lists.
    #
    #2. **Loop Code**:
    #   - The loop iterates over each file in `files`.
    #   - For each file, it splits the file into `name` and `type_`.
    #   - If `type_` is "1", it appends `name` to `examples`.
    #   - If `type_` is not "1", it appends `name` to `regulars`.
    #
    #Given the output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times, we can see patterns emerging:
    #- `files` must have at least as many tuples as the number of times the loop executes.
    #- `name` and `type_` are derived from the current `file` being processed.
    #- `examples` and `regulars` are populated based on the `type_` of each file.
    #
    #Considering the loop will execute `n` times (since `n` is the number of tuples in `files`), after all iterations:
    #- `n` remains a positive integer, as it's not modified by the loop.
    #- `files` remains a list of `n` tuples, as it's not modified by the loop, just iterated over.
    #- `file` will be the last file in the list after the loop finishes, as it takes on the value of the current file in each iteration.
    #- `name` and `type_` will be the filename and type of the last file in the list, respectively.
    #- `examples` will be a list containing the filenames of all files where `type_` was "1".
    #- `regulars` will be a list containing the filenames of all files where `type_` was not "1".
    #
    #If the loop does not execute (which contradicts the given that `n` is a positive integer and thus the loop must execute at least once), `examples` and `regulars` would remain empty lists, as they are only modified within the loop.
    #
    #**Output State**: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list of filenames of type "1", `regulars` is a list of filenames of type "0", and `file`, `name`, and `type_` hold the values of the last file processed.**

        if examples[i] != str(i + 1):
            while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
                temp_counter += 1
            moves.append(f'move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}')

    for i in range(len(regulars)):
        target = len(examples) + i + 1
        
        if regulars[i] != str(target):
            while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
                temp_counter += 1
            moves.append(f'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}')
            regulars[i] = str(temp_counter)

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` retains its original value, `regulars` is a list of strings where each element is `str(len(examples) + i + 1)` for `i` in the range of `len(regulars)`, `file`, `name`, and `type_` hold the values of the last file processed, `temp_counter` is the final value after all increments, and `moves` includes all move commands performed during the loop. If `regulars` is empty, the loop does not execute, and the variables retain their original values.
    return moves
    #The program returns a list of move commands, 'moves', that were performed during the loop, where the loop iterates over a list of 'n' tuples, 'files', with 'n' being a positive integer, and the loop's execution is dependent on the 'regulars' list not being empty, and 'regulars' is a list of strings where each element is 'str(len(examples) + i + 1)' for 'i' in the range of 'len(regulars)'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` tuples `files`, and returns a list of move commands to rearrange the files in a specific order, while handling potential edge cases such as undefined variables, invalid input, and infinite loops, and accounting for the possibility of duplicate filenames.
