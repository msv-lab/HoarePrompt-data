You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The All-Berland National Olympiad in Informatics has just ended! Now Vladimir wants to upload the contest from the Olympiad as a gym to a popular Codehorses website.

Unfortunately, the archive with Olympiad's data is a mess. For example, the files with tests are named arbitrary without any logic.

Vladimir wants to rename the files with tests so that their names are distinct integers starting from 1 without any gaps, namely, "1", "2", ..., "n', where n is the total number of tests.

Some of the files contain tests from statements (examples), while others contain regular tests. It is possible that there are no examples, and it is possible that all tests are examples. Vladimir wants to rename the files so that the examples are the first several tests, all all the next files contain regular tests only.

The only operation Vladimir can perform is the "move" command. Vladimir wants to write a script file, each of the lines in which is "move file_1 file_2", that means that the file "file_1" is to be renamed to "file_2". If there is a file "file_2" at the moment of this line being run, then this file is to be rewritten. After the line "move file_1 file_2" the file "file_1" doesn't exist, but there is a file "file_2" with content equal to the content of "file_1" before the "move" command.

Help Vladimir to write the script file with the minimum possible number of lines so that after this script is run:  all examples are the first several tests having filenames "1", "2", ..., "e", where e is the total number of examples;  all other files contain regular tests with filenames "e + 1", "e + 2", ..., "n", where n is the total number of all tests. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of files with tests.

n lines follow, each describing a file with test. Each line has a form of "name_i type_i", where "name_i" is the filename, and "type_i" equals "1", if the i-th file contains an example test, and "0" if it contains a regular test. Filenames of each file are strings of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters. The filenames are guaranteed to be distinct.


-----Output-----

In the first line print the minimum number of lines in Vladimir's script file.

After that print the script file, each line should be "move file_1 file_2", where "file_1" is an existing at the moment of this line being run filename, and "file_2" — is a string of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split('\n')
n = int(data[0])
files = data[1:n + 1]
files_set = set((file.split()[0] for file in files))
moves = func_1(n, files)
print(len(moves))
for move in moves:
    print(move)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, and files is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a filename (a string of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters) and a type (either "0" for a regular test or "1" for an example test), such that the filenames are distinct and the number of files is equal to n.
def func_1(n, files):
    examples = []
    regulars = []
    for file in files:
        name, type_ = file.split()
        
        if type_ == '1':
            examples.append(name)
        else:
            regulars.append(name)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the given information and the loop code step by step.
    #
    #1. **Initial State**: 
    #   - `n` is a positive integer.
    #   - `files` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains a filename and a type ("0" for regular test or "1" for example test).
    #   - `examples` and `regulars` are empty lists.
    #
    #2. **Loop Code**:
    #   - The loop iterates over each file in `files`.
    #   - For each file, it splits the file into `name` and `type_`.
    #   - If `type_` is "1", it appends `name` to `examples`.
    #   - If `type_` is not "1", it appends `name` to `regulars`.
    #
    #Given the output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times, we can see patterns emerging:
    #- `files` must have at least as many tuples as the number of times the loop executes.
    #- `name` and `type_` are derived from the current `file` being processed.
    #- `examples` and `regulars` are populated based on the `type_` of each file.
    #
    #Considering the loop will execute `n` times (since `n` is the number of tuples in `files`), after all iterations:
    #- `n` remains a positive integer, as it's not modified by the loop.
    #- `files` remains a list of `n` tuples, as it's not modified by the loop, just iterated over.
    #- `file` will be the last file in the list after the loop finishes, as it takes on the value of the current file in each iteration.
    #- `name` and `type_` will be the filename and type of the last file in the list, respectively.
    #- `examples` will be a list containing the filenames of all files where `type_` was "1".
    #- `regulars` will be a list containing the filenames of all files where `type_` was not "1".
    #
    #If the loop does not execute (which contradicts the given that `n` is a positive integer and thus the loop must execute at least once), `examples` and `regulars` would remain empty lists, as they are only modified within the loop.
    #
    #**Output State**: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list of filenames of type "1", `regulars` is a list of filenames of type "0", and `file`, `name`, and `type_` hold the values of the last file processed.**
    moves = []
    temp_counter = n + 1
    for i in range(len(examples)):
        if examples[i] != str(i + 1):
            while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
                temp_counter += 1
            moves.append(f'move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}')
            examples[i] = str(temp_counter)
            temp_counter += 1
        
        if examples[i] != str(i + 1):
            moves.append(f'move {examples[i]} {i + 1}')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list where each element is either its original value if no move was necessary or the result of the last move operation if a move was necessary, `regulars` is a list of filenames of type "0", `file`, `name`, and `type_` hold the values of the last file processed, `moves` is a list of move commands executed during the loop, and `temp_counter` is the smallest value greater than the last string found in `files_set` that is less than or equal to `2 * n`, plus one, or `2 * n + 1` if all numbers up to `2 * n` are found in `files_set`, plus one.
    for i in range(len(regulars)):
        target = len(examples) + i + 1
        
        if regulars[i] != str(target):
            while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
                temp_counter += 1
            moves.append(f'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}')
            regulars[i] = str(temp_counter)
            temp_counter += 1
        
        if regulars[i] != str(target):
            moves.append(f'move {regulars[i]} {target}')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` retains its original value, `regulars` is a list of strings where each element is `str(len(examples) + i + 1)` for `i` in the range of `len(regulars)`, `file`, `name`, and `type_` hold the values of the last file processed, `temp_counter` is the final value after all increments, and `moves` includes all move commands performed during the loop. If `regulars` is empty, the loop does not execute, and the variables retain their original values.
    return moves
    #The program returns a list of move commands, 'moves', that were performed during the loop, where the loop iterates over a list of 'n' tuples, 'files', with 'n' being a positive integer, and the loop's execution is dependent on the 'regulars' list not being empty, and 'regulars' is a list of strings where each element is 'str(len(examples) + i + 1)' for 'i' in the range of 'len(regulars)'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` tuples `files`, and returns a list of move commands to rearrange the files in a specific order, while handling potential edge cases such as undefined variables, invalid input, and infinite loops, and accounting for the possibility of duplicate filenames.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
