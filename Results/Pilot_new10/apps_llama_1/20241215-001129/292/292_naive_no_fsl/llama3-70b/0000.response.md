Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to find out after how many full years Limak will become strictly larger than Bob. 

Here's why the program is correct:

- It initializes the number of years to 0.
- It enters a while loop that continues as long as Limak's weight (`a`) is less than or equal to Bob's weight (`b`).
- Inside the loop, it triples Limak's weight and doubles Bob's weight (simulating one year), and increments the number of years.
- Once Limak's weight becomes strictly greater than Bob's, it breaks out of the loop and prints the number of years.

The program correctly handles all the given examples and general cases. For instance, if Limak and Bob initially weigh the same, the program will correctly output 1 because Limak will become larger after the first year. 

Since the weights are multiplied by constants (3 for Limak and 2 for Bob) every year, and these constants are relatively prime, there will always be a point where Limak becomes strictly larger than Bob if he is not already. The while loop guarantees that this point is found.

The program does not contain any missing logic or edge cases that it does not handle correctly. It adheres to the problem description and works correctly for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.
