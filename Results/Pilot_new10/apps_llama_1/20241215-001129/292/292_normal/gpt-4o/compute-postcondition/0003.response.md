The code `a *= 3` multiplies the value of `a` by 3. The initial state is that `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `years` is 0, and `a` must be less than or equal to `b`. 

After multiplying `a` by 3, `a` becomes `3 * a`. The condition that `a` must be less than or equal to `b` may not hold after this operation, since `a` has been multiplied by 3. However, we cannot determine the exact relationship between `a` and `b` after this operation without knowing their initial values.

The value of `b` and `years` remains unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is 3 times the input integer, `b` is an input integer, `years` is 0.
Output State: **`a` is 3 times the input integer, `b` is an input integer, `years` is 0**
