According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `a` and `b`. If `a` is less than or equal to `b`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and `years` is 0. The state of `years` does not affect the loop condition. For `a` and `b` being input integers does not ensure that the loop will execute, so their relationship needs to be adjusted to `a` is less than or equal to `b`. 

State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `years` is 0, and `a` must be less than or equal to `b`**
