The code line `a, b = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `a` and `b` based on the user's input. Here, `map(int, input().split())` means the input is split into two parts (assuming the input is separated by spaces) and each part is converted to an integer.

Given that `a` and `b` are assigned new values from the input, their initial constraint of `1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10` may not necessarily hold after the input, as the input values could be any integers. However, the nature of `a` and `b` as integers remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**
