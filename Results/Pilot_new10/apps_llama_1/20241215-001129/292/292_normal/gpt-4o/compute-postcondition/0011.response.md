The value of `a` is multiplied by 3. The previous relationship between `a` and `b` is that `a` must be less than or equal to `b`, but the new value of `a` is `3a`. The value of `years` is not affected, so it remains 2. 

Output State: **`a` is `3a`, `a` must be less than or equal to `b` is no longer guaranteed, `years` is 2**
