The code `a *= 3` multiplies the value of `a` by 3. The initial state specifies that `a` and `b` are integers, `a` must be less than or equal to `b`, and `years` is 0. 

After the multiplication, `a` becomes `3 * a`, which means its value is now three times its initial value. The relationship between `a` and `b` is no longer guaranteed to be `a <= b` because multiplying `a` by 3 could make it larger than `b` if `b` is not also multiplied by 3. The value of `years` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.

Output State: **`a` is 3 times its initial integer value, `b` is an integer, `years` is 0**
