The value of `a` is multiplied by 3. Initially, `a` is 9 times its initial integer value, so the new value of `a` is 3 * 9 * A = 27 * A, where A is the initial integer value of `a`. The states of the other variables are not affected. The condition `9A <= 4B` still holds. 

Output State: **`a` is 27 times its initial integer value, `b` is 4 times its initial integer value, `9A <= 4B` where `A` and `B` are the initial integer values of `a` and `b` respectively, `27y <= 8x`, and `years` is 2**
