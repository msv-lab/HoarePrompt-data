Correctness: **True**

The code provided seems to accurately solve the problem as described. It takes two integer inputs, `a` and `b`, representing the initial weights of Limak and Bob, respectively. The code then enters a loop where it triples `a` and doubles `b` in each iteration, incrementing a `years` counter until `a` exceeds `b`. This process directly aligns with the problem description, which asks for the number of full years it will take for Limak to become strictly heavier than Bob.

The loop condition `a <= b` ensures that the loop continues as long as Limak's weight is less than or equal to Bob's. Once Limak's weight exceeds Bob's, the loop exits, and the function prints the number of years it took for this to happen.

The output hints provided also agree with the code's behavior, indicating that the function works with any integer inputs and correctly calculates the number of iterations required for Limak's weight to surpass Bob's.

Furthermore, the examples given in the problem description are consistent with the code's expected output. For instance, when `a = 4` and `b = 7`, the code correctly outputs `2`, which matches the problem description's first example. Similarly, the code produces the expected outputs for the other examples provided.

Given that the code aligns with the problem description, output hints, and examples, and considering the logic of the loop and the incrementing of years, it appears that the program correctly solves the problem for every potential case.
