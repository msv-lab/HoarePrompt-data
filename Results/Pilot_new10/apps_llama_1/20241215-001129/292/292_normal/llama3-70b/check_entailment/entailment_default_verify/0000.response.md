To verify the correctness of the program, let's break it down and compare it with the problem description and output hints.

The problem asks for the number of full years it will take for Limak to become strictly heavier than Bob, given that Limak's weight is tripled and Bob's weight is doubled every year.

The provided code implements a loop that continuously triples Limak's weight and doubles Bob's weight until Limak's weight becomes strictly greater than Bob's weight. This aligns with the problem description.

The original assessment of the program's correctness is **True**, and it provides a detailed explanation of why the program works. The assessment correctly identifies that the program handles all potential cases, including when Limak's initial weight is less than, equal to, or the same as Bob's.

The output hints further support the original assessment, stating that the function accepts two integer parameters, multiplies the first by 3 and the second by 2 in each iteration until the first exceeds the second, and prints the number of iterations required for this condition to be met. This matches the problem description and the provided code.

Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, it appears that the program accurately implements the required logic. The original assessment seems to be accurate, and there are no obvious flaws in the program that would suggest it does not work as intended for the given problem constraints.

Therefore, considering all the information and given the constraints that the input will always be valid (i.e., two positive integers where the first is less than or equal to the second), the final assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **True**
