Correctness: **True**.

The given program correctly implements the logic to find the number of years it takes for Limak's weight to become strictly larger than Bob's weight. The program uses a while loop to simulate the process of Limak's weight being tripled and Bob's weight being doubled every year, and it increments the `years` counter each time through the loop. The loop continues as long as Limak's weight is less than or equal to Bob's weight.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including the case where Limak and Bob's initial weights are equal, as demonstrated in the example input `1 1`. In this case, the program correctly outputs `1`, because Limak becomes larger than Bob after one year.

The program also handles cases where Limak's initial weight is less than Bob's initial weight, as demonstrated in the other example inputs `4 7` and `4 9`. In these cases, the program correctly outputs the number of years it takes for Limak's weight to become strictly larger than Bob's weight.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
