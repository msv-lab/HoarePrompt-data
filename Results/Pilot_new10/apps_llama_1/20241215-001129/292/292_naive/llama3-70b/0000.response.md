Correctness: **True**.

This program is correct because it accurately implements the logic described in the problem. It continuously triples Limak's weight and doubles Bob's weight until Limak's weight becomes strictly greater than Bob's weight, at which point it outputs the number of years that have passed.

Here's a breakdown of why the program works:

1. The program starts by taking the initial weights of Limak (`a`) and Bob (`b`) as input.
2. It then enters a while loop that continues as long as Limak's weight (`a`) is less than or equal to Bob's weight (`b`).
3. Inside the loop, Limak's weight is tripled (`a *= 3`) and Bob's weight is doubled (`b *= 2`).
4. The loop also increments a `years` counter by 1 in each iteration, which keeps track of the number of years that have passed.
5. Once Limak's weight becomes strictly greater than Bob's weight (`a > b`), the loop exits and the program outputs the number of years that have passed (`print(years)`).

The program correctly handles all potential cases, including:

* When Limak's weight is initially less than Bob's weight.
* When Limak's weight is initially equal to Bob's weight.
* When Limak's weight becomes strictly greater than Bob's weight after one or more years.

All the provided examples work correctly with this program, and there are no obvious edge cases that the program does not handle. Therefore, the program is correct.
