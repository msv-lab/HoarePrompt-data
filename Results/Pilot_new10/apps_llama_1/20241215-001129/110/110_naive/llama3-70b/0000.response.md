Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes. It simply takes the minimum between the number of fishes `k` and the number of possible positions of the scoop-net `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`, which is not the correct approach to solve this problem.

A correct approach would involve placing the fishes in a way that maximizes the expected number of caught fishes. This can be done by placing the fishes in a uniform grid, such that each fish is at a distance of `r` from its neighbors. This way, each fish has the maximum chance of being caught by the scoop-net, and the expected number of caught fishes is maximized.

One case where the program does not work correctly is when `n = 3`, `m = 3`, `r = 2`, and `k = 3`. The program outputs `1.0`, but the correct output is `2.0`, which can be achieved by placing the fishes at positions `(2, 1)`, `(2, 2)`, and `(2, 3)`, as shown in the problem description.

Here is a simple explanation of why the program does not work: it does not take into account the size of the scoop-net `r` when calculating the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes. It simply divides the minimum between the number of fishes `k` and the number of possible positions of the scoop-net by the number of possible positions of the scoop-net, which is not the correct approach to solve this problem.

The correct approach should be to divide the number of fishes `k` by the area of the pond and then multiply by the area of the scoop-net, that way we get the expected number of fishes that will be caught.

To get the correct result, the program should be modified to calculate the expected number of caught fishes based on the size of the scoop-net `r` and the number of fishes `k`. 

Here is the correct code:
```python
def func():
    (n, m, r, k) = map(int, input().split())
    return k * (r * r) / (n * m)
```
