You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: While Grisha was celebrating New Year with Ded Moroz, Misha gifted Sasha a small rectangular pond of size n × m, divided into cells of size 1 × 1, inhabited by tiny evil fishes (no more than one fish per cell, otherwise they'll strife!).

The gift bundle also includes a square scoop of size r × r, designed for fishing. If the lower-left corner of the scoop-net is located at cell (x, y), all fishes inside the square (x, y)...(x + r - 1, y + r - 1) get caught. Note that the scoop-net should lie completely inside the pond when used.

Unfortunately, Sasha is not that skilled in fishing and hence throws the scoop randomly. In order to not frustrate Sasha, Misha decided to release k fishes into the empty pond in such a way that the expected value of the number of caught fishes is as high as possible. Help Misha! In other words, put k fishes in the pond into distinct cells in such a way that when the scoop-net is placed into a random position among (n - r + 1)·(m - r + 1) possible positions, the average number of caught fishes is as high as possible.


-----Input-----

The only line contains four integers n, m, r, k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m), 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n·m, 10^5)).


-----Output-----

Print a single number — the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes.

You answer is considered correct, is its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 9}. Namely, let your answer be a, and the jury's answer be b. Your answer is considered correct, if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1,|b|)} \leq 10^{-9}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3 2 3

Output
2.0000000000

Input
12 17 9 40

Output
32.8333333333



-----Note-----

In the first example you can put the fishes in cells (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3). In this case, for any of four possible positions of the scoop-net (highlighted with light green), the number of fishes inside is equal to two, and so is the expected value. [Image]
Program:
```
import heapq
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
(n, m, r, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(f'{func_1(n, m, r, k):.10f}')

def func_1(n, m, r, k):

    heap = []
    for x in range(n):
        for y in range(m):
            heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))
    total_coverage = 0
    for _ in range(k):
        (cov, x, y) = heapq.heappop(heap)
        total_coverage -= cov
    total_positions = (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)
    return total_coverage / total_positions

def coverage(x, y):
    return (min(x + 1, n - r + 1) - max(x - r + 1 + 1, 0)) * (min(y + 1, m - r + 1) - max(y - r + 1 + 1, 0))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

I have reviewed the program provided, and it appears to correctly implement the logic to maximize the expected number of caught fishes. Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. **Input handling**: The program correctly reads the input values `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` from the standard input.

2. **Greedy approach**: The program uses a greedy approach to select the `k` cells with the highest coverage. The `coverage` function calculates the number of possible positions where a fish at cell `(x, y)` can be caught. The `heapq` module is used to efficiently select the cell with the highest coverage at each step.

3. **Total coverage calculation**: The program correctly calculates the total coverage by summing up the coverage of the selected cells.

4. **Expected value calculation**: The program correctly calculates the expected value of the number of caught fishes by dividing the total coverage by the total number of possible positions.

The program's logic is sound, and it should produce the correct result for all possible inputs. The use of a greedy approach is justified in this case, as the goal is to maximize the expected value of the number of caught fishes, and selecting the cells with the highest coverage at each step will achieve this goal.

I was unable to find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the provided examples work correctly. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` representing the size of a rectangular pond, the size of a square scoop, and the number of fishes, and returns the average coverage per position, calculated as the total coverage of the `min(k, n*m)` cells with the highest coverage values divided by the total possible positions `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`, but may throw errors or return nonsense values for certain edge cases such as `n`, `m`, or `r` being 0, or `r` being greater than `n` or `m`. 

Output hint for function_2: The function accepts parameters x and y, representing the position of the scoop-net within a pond of size n x m, and returns the area of overlap between the scoop-net of size r and the pond, calculated as the product of the effective ranges in the x and y directions, assuming x and y are within the pond and r is not larger than the pond, and handling edge cases where x or y is at the edge of the pond or r is equal to n or m. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
