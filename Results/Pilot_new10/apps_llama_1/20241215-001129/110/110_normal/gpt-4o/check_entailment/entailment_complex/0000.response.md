Correctness: **True**

The provided code seems to correctly implement the solution for the problem description. It calculates the expected value of the number of caught fishes when the scoop-net is placed randomly in the pond. The code correctly distributes the k fishes among the cells of the pond to maximize the expected value of caught fishes.

Here's a breakdown of why the code is correct:
- The `coverage(x, y)` function calculates the area of overlap between the scoop-net and the pond when the lower-left corner of the scoop-net is at position `(x, y)`. This is done correctly, taking into account the edge cases where the scoop-net is near the edge of the pond.
- The `func_1(n, m, r, k)` function uses a heap to keep track of the cells with the highest coverage values. It pops the cell with the highest coverage value, adds its coverage value to the total coverage, and repeats this process k times. This greedy approach ensures that the k fishes are distributed among the cells to maximize the expected value of caught fishes.
- The code handles the edge cases correctly, such as when the scoop-net is larger than the pond, or when there are more fishes than cells in the pond.
- The examples provided in the problem description also support the correctness of the code. For instance, the code correctly calculates the expected value of 2.0 when the pond size is 3x3, the scoop-net size is 2x2, and there are 3 fishes.

The annotations provided in the code also agree with the code and the problem description, and they help to understand the state of the program and the logical flow of the code. 

In summary, the code seems to correctly implement the solution for the problem description, and it handles the edge cases correctly. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case, and the Correctness is **True**.
