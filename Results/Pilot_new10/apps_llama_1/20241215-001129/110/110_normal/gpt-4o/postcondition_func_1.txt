The function accepts parameters x and y, representing the position of the scoop-net within a pond of size n x m, and returns the area of overlap between the scoop-net of size r and the pond, calculated as the product of the effective ranges in the x and y directions, assuming x and y are within the pond and r is not larger than the pond, and handling edge cases where x or y is at the edge of the pond or r is equal to n or m.
