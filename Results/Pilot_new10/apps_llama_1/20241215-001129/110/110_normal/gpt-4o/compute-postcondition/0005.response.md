To determine the output state, we must consider the effects of the given Python code snippet on the initial state.

The code snippet is: 
```python
heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))
```

Given that `heap` is a list containing at least one tuple of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)`, this line of code adds another tuple to the `heap`. 

However, `x` and `y` are used in the expression but their values are not explicitly given in the initial state except for `y` which is 1. Since `y` is 1, we know the value of `y` in `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)`, but the value of `x` is unknown.

The `coverage(x, y)` function is also not defined in the initial state, so its return value is unknown. 

Thus, after executing the code, `heap` will have an additional tuple, but the values of `x`, `coverage(x, y)`, and the new tuple are unknown.

The other variables `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the output state is: 
`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 1, `r` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `y` is 1, and `heap` is a list containing at least two tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)`, with the last tuple being `(-coverage(x, 1), x, 1)`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 1, `r` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `y` is 1, and `heap` is a list containing at least two tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` with the last tuple being `(-coverage(x, 1), x, 1)`**
