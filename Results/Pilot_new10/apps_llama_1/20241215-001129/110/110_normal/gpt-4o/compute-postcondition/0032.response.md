To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

Initial State: 
- `n` and `m` are non-negative integers
- `r` is a non-negative integer
- `k` is greater than 1
- `x` is the x component of the popped tuple
- `y` is the y component of the popped tuple
- `cov` is the negative coverage of the popped cell
- `heap` is a list containing `n*m - 2` tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for the remaining cells
- `total_coverage` equals `-cov`

Given Code:
```python
total_coverage -= cov
```

Analysis:
- The code subtracts `cov` from `total_coverage`.
- Since `total_coverage` initially equals `-cov`, subtracting `cov` from it would result in `total_coverage` being equal to `-cov - cov = -2*cov`.

Output State:
- `n` and `m` are non-negative integers
- `r` is a non-negative integer
- `k` is greater than 1
- `x` is the x component of the popped tuple
- `y` is the y component of the popped tuple
- `cov` is the negative coverage of the popped cell
- `heap` is a list containing `n*m - 2` tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for the remaining cells
- `total_coverage` equals `-2*cov`

Output State: **`n` and `m` are non-negative integers, `r` is a non-negative integer, `k` is greater than 1, `x` is the x component of the popped tuple, `y` is the y component of the popped tuple, `cov` is the negative coverage of the popped cell, `heap` is a list containing `n*m - 2` tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for the remaining cells, `total_coverage` equals `-2*cov`**
