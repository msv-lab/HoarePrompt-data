The given Python code snippet is pushing a new tuple onto the heap. The `heapq.heappush()` function adds an element to the heap while maintaining the heap invariant. In this case, it adds a tuple containing the negative of the coverage of `x` and `y`, as well as `x` and `y` themselves. Since `x` is 2, the new tuple will be `(-coverage(2, y), 2, y)`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `m` must be greater than 1, `r` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `x` is 2, `y` is at least 1 and can be up to `m-1`, `heap` is a list containing at least three tuples, including the original tuples of the form `(-coverage(1, y), 1, y)` and the new tuples `(-coverage(2, y), 2, y)`, one of which was just added by `heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))`**
