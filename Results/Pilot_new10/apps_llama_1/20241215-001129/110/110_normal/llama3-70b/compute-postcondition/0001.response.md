To determine the output state, let's break down the given code and initial state.

The initial state provides that `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` are input integers. This means their values can vary based on the input provided.

The code snippet is:
```python
ans = min(k, (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1))
```
This line of code calculates the minimum between the value of `k` and the product of `(n - r + 1)` and `(m - r + 1)`, assigning this minimum value to `ans`.

Given that `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` can be any integers, the expressions `(n - r + 1)` and `(m - r + 1)` can also evaluate to any integer values. The product of these two expressions, `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`, will then be compared with `k` to find the minimum.

Therefore, `ans` will be the smaller value between `k` and the product `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`. The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` themselves do not change; only a new variable `ans` is introduced with a value dependent on these inputs.

Output State: **`n` and `m` can be any integers, `r` can be any integer, `k` can be any integer, and `ans` is the minimum of `k` and `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`**
