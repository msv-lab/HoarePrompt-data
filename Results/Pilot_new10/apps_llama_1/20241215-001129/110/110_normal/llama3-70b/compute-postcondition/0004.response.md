The function func implicitly accepts parameters n, m, r, and k, which are integers constrained by 1 <= n, m <= 10^5, 1 <= r <= min(n, m), and 1 <= k <= min(n*m, 10^5). The function calculates `ans` as the minimum of `k` and `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`, and then prints the ratio of `ans` to `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts integers n, m, r, and k as input, calculates the minimum of k and the area of a rectangle with sides (n - r + 1) and (m - r + 1), and then prints the ratio of this minimum value to the area of the rectangle, but does not handle potential edge cases such as division by zero or out-of-range inputs, and does not return any value, instead, it prints the result. **
