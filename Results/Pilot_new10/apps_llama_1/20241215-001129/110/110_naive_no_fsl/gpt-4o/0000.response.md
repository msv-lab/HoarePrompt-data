Correctness: **True**

I have reviewed the program provided, and it appears to correctly implement the logic to maximize the expected number of caught fishes. Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. **Input handling**: The program correctly reads the input values `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` from the standard input.

2. **Greedy approach**: The program uses a greedy approach to select the `k` cells with the highest coverage. The `coverage` function calculates the number of possible positions where a fish at cell `(x, y)` can be caught. The `heapq` module is used to efficiently select the cell with the highest coverage at each step.

3. **Total coverage calculation**: The program correctly calculates the total coverage by summing up the coverage of the selected cells.

4. **Expected value calculation**: The program correctly calculates the expected value of the number of caught fishes by dividing the total coverage by the total number of possible positions.

The program's logic is sound, and it should produce the correct result for all possible inputs. The use of a greedy approach is justified in this case, as the goal is to maximize the expected value of the number of caught fishes, and selecting the cells with the highest coverage at each step will achieve this goal.

I was unable to find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the provided examples work correctly. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
