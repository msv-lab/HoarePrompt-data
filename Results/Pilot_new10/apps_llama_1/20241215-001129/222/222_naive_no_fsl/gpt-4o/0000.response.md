Correctness: **True**

The program appears to be correct for all potential cases. It solves the problem by identifying the minimum number of skewers that need to be turned over to flip all skewers. The while loop increments the index `i` by `2 * k + 1` each time, effectively selecting every other skewer that is far enough away from the previous one to not interfere with its flipping. 

The provided examples in the problem description are handled correctly by the program. For instance, when `n = 7` and `k = 2`, the program correctly outputs `2` and the positions `1` and `6`. Similarly, when `n = 5` and `k = 1`, the program correctly outputs `2` and the positions `1` and `4`.

The program also handles cases where `n` is small or `k` is large, as the while loop stops when `i` exceeds `n`. Additionally, it correctly handles cases where `k` is `0`, in which case it simply turns over every other skewer.

The key insight behind this solution is that turning over a skewer flips not only that skewer but also its `k` closest neighbors on each side. By carefully selecting which skewers to turn over, it is possible to flip all skewers in the minimum number of operations. The provided code correctly implements this strategy, making it a correct solution to the problem.
