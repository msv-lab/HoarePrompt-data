Correctness: **True**

The provided code seems to be a correct solution to the problem description. Here's why:

1.  The code calculates the number of steps `l` required to turn all skewers by dividing `n` (number of skewers) by `k * 2 + 1`, which is the number of skewers that are turned in one step. The `-1` and `//` are used for ceiling division to ensure that all skewers are covered.

2.  It then generates a list `res` of skewer positions that need to be turned over at each step. These positions are calculated by multiplying the current step `i` with the number of skewers turned in one step (`k * 2 + 1`) and adding `1`.

3.  The code prints the total number of steps `l` and the list of skewer positions `res`.

The output hints also agree with the code. They mention that the function calculates the number of steps required, generates a list of skewer positions, and prints these values.

Upon reviewing the provided examples, the code works as expected:

-   For `n = 7` and `k = 2`, the code outputs `2` and the list `[1, 6]`, which is a correct solution.
-   For `n = 5` and `k = 1`, the code outputs `2` and the list `[1, 4]`, which is also a correct solution.

After examining the code, examples, and output hints, it appears that the code handles all potential cases correctly and aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the code is **True**.
