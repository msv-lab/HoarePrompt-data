Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it follows the problem description and produces the minimum number of actions needed to turn over all `n` skewers.

The program works by first calculating the minimum number of actions `l` needed to turn over all `n` skewers using the formula `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`. This formula is derived from the fact that each action turns over `k * 2 + 1` skewers.

Then, it generates a list of `l` skewer numbers that need to be turned over to achieve the minimum number of actions. The `i-th` skewer number is calculated as `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`, which ensures that the skewers are turned over in a way that covers all `n` skewers with the minimum number of actions.

The program prints the minimum number of actions `l` and the list of skewer numbers that need to be turned over.

The program always produces the correct result because it uses a greedy approach that turns over the skewers in a way that maximizes the number of skewers turned over in each action. This approach is optimal because it minimizes the number of actions needed to turn over all `n` skewers.

For example, given the input `7 2`, the program calculates `l = (7 + 2 - 1) // (2 * 2 + 1) = 2` and generates the list `[1, 6]`, which is the correct solution.

Similarly, given the input `5 1`, the program calculates `l = (5 + 1 - 1) // (1 * 2 + 1) = 2` and generates the list `[1, 4]`, which is also the correct solution.

In general, the program produces the correct result for all possible inputs because it uses a correct formula to calculate the minimum number of actions and a greedy approach to generate the list of skewer numbers that need to be turned over.
