Correctness: **True**

The given code correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum number of steps required to turn over all skewers. The code uses the formula `l = (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)` to calculate the number of steps required, which is derived from the fact that each step can turn over `k * 2 + 1` skewers.

The code then generates a list of skewer positions by iterating over the calculated number of steps and appending the position of the skewer to be turned over at each step. The position is calculated using the formula `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`, which ensures that the skewers are turned over in a manner that covers the entire range of skewers.

The code handles the examples provided in the problem description correctly. For instance, when `n = 7` and `k = 2`, the code outputs `2` and `1 6`, which is a valid solution. Similarly, when `n = 5` and `k = 1`, the code outputs `2` and `1 4`, which is also a valid solution.

The code does not contain any obvious errors or edge cases that are not handled correctly. The use of integer division `//` ensures that the calculation of `l` is correct even when `n` is not a multiple of `k * 2 + 1`. The code also handles the case when `k` is 0, in which case the number of steps required is simply `n`.

Overall, the code appears to be correct and follows the problem description for every potential case.
