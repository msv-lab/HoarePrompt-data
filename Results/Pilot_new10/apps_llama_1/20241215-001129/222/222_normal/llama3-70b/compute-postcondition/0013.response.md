The function `func` takes two integer parameters `n` and `k` as input from the user, where `n` represents the total number of skewers and `k` represents the number of skewers from each side that are turned in one step. It calculates the number of steps `l` required to turn all skewers, where `l` is the ceiling of the division of `n` by `2*k + 1`. 

The function then generates a list `res` of integers representing the positions of the skewers that are turned in each step. Each element `j` at index `i` in the list is calculated as `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`. 

If `l` is 0, the list `res` remains empty. 

Finally, the function prints the total number of steps `l` and the list of skewer positions `res`. 

The function does not handle potential edge cases such as invalid input values for `n` and `k` outside the ranges 1 to 1000 and 0 to 1000, respectively. 

However, based on the code, we can infer that the function will still execute and produce output even if the input values are outside these ranges.

Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k` as input from the user, calculates the number of steps required to turn all skewers, generates a list of skewer positions, and prints the total number of steps and the list of skewer positions, without handling invalid input values outside the specified ranges. **
