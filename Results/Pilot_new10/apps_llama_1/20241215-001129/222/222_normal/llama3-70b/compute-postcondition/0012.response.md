It appears that the provided function definition is incomplete, as it does not include any parameters. However, based on the given parameter constraints, I will proceed with the task.

The function `func` should accept two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer representing the number of skewers, and `k` is an integer representing the number of skewers from each side that are turned in one step. The constraints for these parameters are 1 <= n <= 1000 and 0 <= k <= 1000.

Since the output is not specified, I will wait for further information to complete the task. However, I can provide a general description of the function's parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, n and k, where n is an integer between 1 and 1000, and k is an integer between 0 and 1000.**
