The code `res.append(i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1)` appends a new element to the `res` list. The new element is calculated as `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`, where `i` is 2. Therefore, the new element is `2 * (k * 2 + 1) + 1 = 2 * k * 2 + 2 + 1 = 4 * k + 3`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. The value of `n` is still an input integer, the value of `k` is still an input integer, the value of `l` is still `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)` and must be greater than 2, and the value of `i` is still 2.

The `res` list now contains the elements `1`, `k * 2 + 2`, and `4 * k + 3`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)` and must be greater than 2, `res` is a list containing the elements `1`, `k * 2 + 2`, and `4 * k + 3`, `i` is 2**
