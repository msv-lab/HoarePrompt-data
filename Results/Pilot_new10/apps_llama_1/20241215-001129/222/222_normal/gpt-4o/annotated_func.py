#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 1000 and 0 <= k <= 1000.
def func_1(n, k):
    positions = []
    i = 1
    while i <= n:
        positions.append(i)
        
        i += 2 * k + 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is the original value, `k` is the original value, `positions` is a list containing a sequence of numbers starting from 1 and increasing by `2 * k + 1`, with the last number not exceeding `n`, `i` is the first number in the sequence that exceeds `n`.
    print(len(positions))
    print(' '.join(map(str, positions)))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`, generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 and increasing by `2 * k + 1` up to `n`, and prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself, effectively identifying positions in a sequence with a specified step size, handling all cases where `n` and `k` are within their specified ranges.
