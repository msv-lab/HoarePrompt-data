Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why:

1. The problem description asks to find the minimum number of actions needed to turn over all `n` skewers, where turning a skewer also turns over `k` closest skewers from each side.

2. The program uses a greedy approach by turning over skewers at intervals of `2 * k + 1`. This works because turning a skewer will flip the state of all skewers within `k` positions to its left and right. By turning every `2 * k + 1`th skewer, we ensure that each skewer is turned over exactly once, thus flipping their state.

3. The loop in the program starts at skewer `1` and appends every `2 * k + 1`th skewer to the `positions` list. This list represents the sequence of skewers to be turned over.

4. The `while` loop continues until `i` exceeds `n`, ensuring that all skewers are accounted for.

5. The program then prints the length of the `positions` list, which represents the minimum number of actions needed to turn over all skewers. Finally, it prints the list of skewer positions to be turned over.

The program is correct for all cases because it follows a simple, yet effective greedy strategy that guarantees the minimum number of actions required to turn over all skewers. This strategy works regardless of the values of `n` and `k`, as long as they are within the specified constraints. 

For example, when `n = 7` and `k = 2`, the program will output `2` and `1 6`, which is a correct solution. Similarly, when `n = 5` and `k = 1`, the program will output `2` and `1 4`, which is also a correct solution. 

In general, the program will always produce a correct solution because it systematically turns over skewers at intervals of `2 * k + 1`, ensuring that each skewer is turned over exactly once, thus flipping their state. This strategy guarantees the minimum number of actions required to turn over all skewers, which is what the problem description asks for.
