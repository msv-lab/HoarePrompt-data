Correctness: **True**

The provided code appears to be a correct solution for the problem of turning over all skewers with the minimal possible number of actions. It uses a simple and effective approach by turning over the skewers at positions that are `2 * k + 1` units apart, which ensures that all skewers are turned over.

The code generates a sequence of positions starting from 1 and increasing by `2 * k + 1` up to `n`. This sequence represents the positions of the skewers that need to be turned over to achieve the minimum number of actions. The length of this sequence is printed as the minimum number of actions required, and the sequence itself is printed as the positions of the skewers to be turned over.

The code handles all cases where `n` and `k` are within their specified ranges. The while loop condition `i <= n` ensures that the sequence generation stops once the end of the skewers is reached. The increment `i += 2 * k + 1` guarantees that the next skewer to be turned over is `2 * k + 1` positions away from the current one, which is the optimal strategy for turning over all skewers with the minimal number of actions.

The output hints agree with the code, indicating that the function generates a sequence of numbers with a specified step size and prints the length and the sequence itself. The examples provided in the problem description also support the correctness of the code.

Therefore, based on the code, output hints, and problem description, it appears that the code correctly solves the problem for all potential cases.
