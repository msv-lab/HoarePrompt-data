The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters, `n` and `k`, where `1 <= n <= 1000` and `0 <= k <= 1000`. It generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 and increasing by `2 * k + 1`, with the last number not exceeding `n`. The function then prints the length of this sequence and the sequence itself.

Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`, generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 and increasing by `2 * k + 1` up to `n`, and prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself, effectively identifying positions in a sequence with a specified step size, handling all cases where `n` and `k` are within their specified ranges. **
