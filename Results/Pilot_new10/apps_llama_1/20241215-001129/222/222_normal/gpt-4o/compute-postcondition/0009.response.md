The code `positions.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the end of the `positions` list. 

Given that `i` is `4 * k + 3`, this value is appended to the list. 

The initial state of `positions` is a list containing two elements: `1` and `2 * k + 2`. 

After executing the code, `positions` will be a list containing three elements: `1`, `2 * k + 2`, and `4 * k + 3`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

The value of `n` is still greater than `4 * k + 3`, and `k` is still an integer such that `0 <= k <= 1000`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than `4 * k + 3`, `k` is an integer such that `0 <= k <= 1000`, `positions` is a list containing three elements: `1`, `2 * k + 2`, and `4 * k + 3`, `i` is `4 * k + 3`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `4 * k + 3`, `k` is an integer such that `0 <= k <= 1000`, `positions` is a list containing three elements: `1`, `2 * k + 2`, and `4 * k + 3`, `i` is `4 * k + 3`**
