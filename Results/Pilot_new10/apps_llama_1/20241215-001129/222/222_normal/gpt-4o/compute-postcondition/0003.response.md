The code `positions.append(i)` adds the current value of `i` to the end of the `positions` list. The value of `i` is 1, so 1 is appended to `positions`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. `n` and `k` are still integers such that 1 <= n <= 1000 and 0 <= k <= 1000, and `i` is still 1.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 1000 and 0 <= k <= 1000, `positions` is a list containing a single element which is 1, `i` is 1**
