The value of `i` is incremented by `2 * k + 1`. The previous value of `i` was `2 * k + 2`. Therefore, the new value of `i` is `2 * k + 2 + 2 * k + 1 = 4 * k + 3`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. The value of `n` is still greater than `2 * k + 2`, and `k` is still an integer such that `0 <= k <= 1000`. The list `positions` still contains two elements: `1` and `2 * k + 2`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `n` > `2 * k + 2`, `k` is an integer such that `0 <= k <= 1000`, `positions` is a list containing two elements: `1` and `2 * k + 2`, `i` is `4 * k + 3`**
