Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly solve the problem because it only checks if the two puzzles have the same set of tiles after swapping the empty cells, but it does not check if the tiles can be rearranged to the same configuration through a sequence of valid moves.

A counterexample is:

Input
AC
BX
AC
BX

The program will return 'YES' because the puzzles have the same set of tiles, but they cannot be rearranged to the same configuration through a sequence of valid moves because the 'A' and 'C' tiles are in the same positions in both puzzles, but the 'B' tile is in a different position.

The program should instead check all possible configurations that can be reached by moving the tiles in the puzzles and see if there is a common configuration. 

The correct solution should involve checking all possible permutations of the puzzles and seeing if they can be transformed into each other through a series of valid moves. 

Here is a brief outline of the correct approach:

1. Generate all possible permutations of the puzzle.
2. Check if any of these permutations match the given puzzle configurations.
3. If a match is found, return 'YES'.
4. If no match is found after checking all permutations, return 'NO'. 

The given code does not implement this approach and therefore does not correctly solve the problem.
