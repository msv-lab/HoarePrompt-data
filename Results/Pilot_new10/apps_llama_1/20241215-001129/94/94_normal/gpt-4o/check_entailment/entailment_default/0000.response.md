Correctness: **True**

The code provided appears to correctly determine if Bessie and Elsie's puzzles can reach the same configuration. The `func_1` function concatenates the rows of the puzzle into a single string, which is used as the starting state for the puzzle. The `func_2` function then uses a breadth-first search to generate all possible reachable states from the starting state.

The `func_2` function correctly handles the movement of the tiles in the puzzle by swapping the position of the empty space with adjacent tiles. The function also keeps track of visited states to avoid revisiting the same configuration multiple times.

The code then checks if the set of reachable states for Bessie's puzzle intersects with the set of reachable states for Elsie's puzzle. If there is an intersection, it means that there is a configuration that both puzzles can reach, and the code prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

The provided examples in the problem description also match the expected output of the code. For instance, in the first example, Bessie's puzzle can reach the configuration "XBAC" by sliding the 'A' tile down, which is also a reachable configuration for Elsie's puzzle. Therefore, the code correctly prints "YES". In the second example, there is no configuration that both puzzles can reach, so the code correctly prints "NO".

Overall, the code appears to correctly solve the problem as described, and there are no obvious cases where it fails to work as expected. Therefore, the correctness of the code is **True**.
