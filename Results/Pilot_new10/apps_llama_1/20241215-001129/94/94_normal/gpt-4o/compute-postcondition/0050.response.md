The code `new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)` assigns a new string value to `new_state_str` by concatenating the characters in the `new_state` list.

Given the initial state:
- `start` is a string of length 4 containing the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once,
- `queue` contains unprocessed reachable states from `start` with one state removed,
- `visited` contains `start` and all reachable states from `start`,
- `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)],
- `current` is equal to the removed state from `queue`,
- `empty_pos` is a valid index of 'X' in `current`,
- `empty_row` and `empty_col` are determined by `divmod(empty_pos, 2)`,
- `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`,
- `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`,
- `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`,
- `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2` are true,
- `new_state` is a list where the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` of `current` are swapped,

The output state after executing `new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)` will be:
- `start` is a string of length 4 containing the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once,
- `queue` contains unprocessed reachable states from `start` with one state removed,
- `visited` contains `start` and all reachable states from `start`,
- `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)],
- `current` is equal to the removed state from `queue`,
- `empty_pos` is a valid index of 'X' in `current`,
- `empty_row` and `empty_col` are determined by `divmod(empty_pos, 2)`,
- `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`,
- `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`,
- `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`,
- `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2` are true,
- `new_state` is a list where the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` of `current` are swapped,
- `new_state_str` is a string representation of `new_state`, which is a permutation of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, where the positions of 'X' and another character are swapped compared to `current`.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, `queue` contains unprocessed reachable states from `start` with one state removed, `visited` contains `start` and all reachable states from `start`, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is equal to the removed state from `queue`, `empty_pos` is a valid index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` and `empty_col` are determined by `divmod(empty_pos, 2)`, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`, `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2` are true, `new_state` is a list where the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` of `current` are swapped, `new_state_str` is `''.join(new_state)`**
