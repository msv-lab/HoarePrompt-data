The code `new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)` creates a new string `new_state_str` by concatenating all the elements of the list `new_state`. 

The value of `new_state` is a copy of `current` with `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` swapped. The `current` is a permutation of 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X', and the `new_state` is also a permutation of these characters, but with two elements swapped.

So, the value of `new_state_str` will be a string of length 4, containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, which is a permutation of the string `start`.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`start` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, 
`visited` contains all reachable states from `start` that have been visited so far, 
`queue` is not empty, 
`current` may be updated, 
`empty_pos` may be updated, 
`empty_row` may be updated, 
`empty_col` may be updated, 
`directions` has at least 2 elements, 
`dr` and `dc` are the second elements of `directions`, 
`new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, 
`new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, 
`new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, 
`new_state` is a copy of `current` with `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` swapped, 
`new_state_str` is a string representation of `new_state`, which is a permutation of `start`.
Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, `visited` contains all reachable states from `start` that have been visited so far, `queue` is not empty, `current` may be updated, `empty_pos` may be updated, `empty_row` may be updated, `empty_col` may be updated, `directions` has at least 2 elements, `dr` and `dc` are the second elements of `directions`, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `new_state` is a copy of `current` with `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` swapped, `new_state_str` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once**
