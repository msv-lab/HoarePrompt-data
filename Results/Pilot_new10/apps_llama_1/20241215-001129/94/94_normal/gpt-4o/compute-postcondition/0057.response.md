To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

The initial state is:
- `start` is a string of length 4 containing the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once.
- `directions` has at least one more direction to process.
- `current` is updated.
- `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, and `empty_col` are based on the updated `current`.
- `queue` and `visited` are updated.

The code snippet is:
```python
new_row, new_col = empty_row + dr, empty_col + dc
```

This code updates the values of `new_row` and `new_col` based on the current values of `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, and `dc`. Here, `dr` and `dc` seem to represent the change in row and column, respectively, which are typically used to define the possible movements in a grid (e.g., up, down, left, right).

Given that `dr` and `dc` are not defined in the initial state, we will consider them as variables that hold some integer values representing the direction changes.

The update rules are as follows:
- `new_row` is updated to `empty_row + dr`.
- `new_col` is updated to `empty_col + dc`.

The output state will include the updated `new_row` and `new_col` values and retain the initial state's information for other variables.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, `directions` has at least one more direction to process, `current` is updated, `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, and `empty_col` are based on the updated `current`, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `queue` and `visited` are updated**
