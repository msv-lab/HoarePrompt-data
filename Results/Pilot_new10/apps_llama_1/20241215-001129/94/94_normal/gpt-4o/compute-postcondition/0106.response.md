The given code `new_state = list(current)` creates a new list `new_state` which is a copy of the `current` state. 

Since `current` may be updated and `start` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, the `current` state is a list of these characters, but its exact configuration is unknown.

The value of `new_state` is a list containing the same characters as `current`, i.e., 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' in some order.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, `visited` contains all reachable states from `start` that have been visited so far, `queue` is not empty, `current` may be updated, `empty_pos` may be updated, `empty_row` may be updated, `empty_col` may be updated, `directions` has at least 3 elements, `dr` and `dc` are the third elements of `directions`, `new_row` = `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` = `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` = (`empty_row + dr`) * 2 + (`empty_col + dc`), `new_state` is a list containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' in the same order as `current`.**
