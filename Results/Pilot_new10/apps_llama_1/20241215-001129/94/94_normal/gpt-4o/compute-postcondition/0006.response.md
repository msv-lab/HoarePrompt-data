To calculate the result, we need to determine the values of `empty_row` and `empty_col` based on the given `empty_pos`.

Since `start` is a string of length 4 containing the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, we can assume that `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `start`. 

Given that `current` is equal to `start`, `empty_pos` can be either 0, 1, 2, or 3.

Using the `divmod` function, we can calculate `empty_row` and `empty_col` as follows:

- If `empty_pos` is 0, then `empty_row` is 0 and `empty_col` is 0.
- If `empty_pos` is 1, then `empty_row` is 0 and `empty_col` is 1.
- If `empty_pos` is 2, then `empty_row` is 1 and `empty_col` is 0.
- If `empty_pos` is 3, then `empty_row` is 1 and `empty_col` is 1.

Therefore, the values of `empty_row` and `empty_col` are determined by the position of 'X' in the string `start`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, `queue` is a deque containing no elements or waiting for the next configuration of the 2x2 sliding puzzle, `visited` is a set containing the string `start`, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is equal to `start`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2, and `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2**
