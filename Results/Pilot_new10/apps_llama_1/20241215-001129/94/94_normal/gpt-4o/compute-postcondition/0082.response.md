The new values of `new_row` and `new_col` are calculated based on `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, and `dc`. The values of `empty_row` and `empty_col` are determined by `empty_pos`, which is the index of 'X' in `current`. 

`new_row` becomes `empty_row + dr` and `new_col` becomes `empty_col + dc`. The other variables are not affected by this calculation.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, `visited` contains all reachable states from `start` that have been visited so far, `queue` is one element shorter and not empty, `current` is the leftmost element that was in `queue`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` equals `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` equals `empty_pos % 2`, `directions` is not empty, `dr` and `dc` are the first elements of `directions`, `new_row` equals `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` equals `empty_col + dc`**
