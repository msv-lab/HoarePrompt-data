Postcondition: ***`start` is a string of length 4 containing the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is equal to the removed state from `queue`, `empty_pos` is a valid index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` and `empty_col` are determined by `divmod(empty_pos, 2)`, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`. If `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2` are true, then `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`. If `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, then `queue` contains unprocessed reachable states from `start` with one state removed and then `new_state_str` added, and `visited` contains `start`, all previously reachable states from `start`, and `new_state_str`. Otherwise, if `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2` are true and `new_state_str` is in `visited`, or if `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2` are false, then the state of the program remains unchanged, `queue` contains unprocessed reachable states from `start` with one state removed, and `visited` contains `start` and all reachable states from `start`.***
