To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given `while` loop statement and the current state.

The `while` loop statement is `while queue:`, which means the loop will continue to execute as long as `queue` is not empty.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
- `start` is a string of length 4 containing the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once.
- `queue` contains all reachable states from `start`.
- `visited` contains `start` and all reachable states from `start`.
- `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)].
- `current` is equal to `start`.
- `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, and `empty_col` are determined by the initial position of 'X' in `current`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `queue` must not be empty. Given that `queue` contains all reachable states from `start` at the end of the previous iteration, and considering that `current` is equal to `start`, it implies that all reachable states have been processed or are being processed.

However, the crucial point here is that if `queue` contains all reachable states from `start` and we want the loop to execute again, there must be at least one more state in `queue` that has not been processed yet. This means `queue` should not have been fully popped or depleted during the previous iteration for the loop to continue.

Thus, the adjustment needed is that `queue` must not be empty. Given that we cannot alter the past (i.e., the previous operations on `queue`), the only way to ensure this condition for the sake of continuing the loop is to assume that `queue` still contains at least one state that was not processed in the previous iteration.

State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, `queue` contains at least one unprocessed reachable state from `start`, `visited` contains `start` and all reachable states from `start`, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is equal to `start`, `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, and `empty_col` are determined by the initial position of 'X' in `current`.**
