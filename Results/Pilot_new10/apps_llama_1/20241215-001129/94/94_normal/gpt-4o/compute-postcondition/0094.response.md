The given code updates the values of `new_row` and `new_col` based on the existing values of `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, and `dc`. 

`new_row` is assigned the value `empty_row + dr`, where `dr` is the second element of `directions`. 
`new_col` is assigned the value `empty_col + dc`, where `dc` is the second element of `directions`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: 
`start` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, 
`visited` contains all reachable states from `start` that have been visited so far, 
`queue` is not empty, 
`current` may be updated, 
`empty_pos` may be updated, 
`empty_row` may be updated, 
`empty_col` may be updated, 
`directions` has at least 2 elements, 
`dr` and `dc` are the second elements of `directions`, 
`new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, 
`new_col` is `empty_col + dc`.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, `visited` contains all reachable states from `start` that have been visited so far, `queue` is not empty, `current` may be updated, `empty_pos` may be updated, `empty_row` may be updated, `empty_col` may be updated, `directions` has at least 2 elements, `dr` and `dc` are the second elements of `directions`, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`**
