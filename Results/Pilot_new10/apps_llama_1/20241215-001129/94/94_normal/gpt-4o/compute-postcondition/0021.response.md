To determine the new state, let's calculate the value of `new_pos` based on the given initial state and the provided code snippet.

Given:
- `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2
- `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2
- `new_row` is `empty_row + 1`
- `new_col` is `empty_col`

Since `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, and `current` is equal to `start`, which is a string of length 4, we can deduce that `empty_pos` can be 0, 1, 2, or 3.

However, we don't need to consider all possible values of `empty_pos` because we're tasked with finding the expression that `new_pos` is equal to, based on given equations.

The equation for `new_pos` is:
```python
new_pos = new_row * 2 + new_col
```
Substituting `new_row` and `new_col` with their respective expressions, we get:
```python
new_pos = (empty_row + 1) * 2 + empty_col
```
Given that `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2 and `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2, we substitute these into the equation:
```python
new_pos = ((empty_pos // 2) + 1) * 2 + (empty_pos % 2)
```
This simplifies to:
```python
new_pos = (empty_pos // 2) * 2 + 2 + (empty_pos % 2)
```
Which further simplifies to:
```python
new_pos = empty_pos + 2
```
Considering that `empty_pos` is an index in a string of length 4, the possible initial values of `empty_pos` are 0, 1, 2, or 3. Adding 2 to these values gives us 2, 3, 4, or 5, respectively. However, since the string has a length of 4 and we are working with 0-based indexing, `empty_pos + 2` can indeed be 2 or 3 (if `empty_pos` is 0 or 1), but it cannot be 4 or 5 because these are out of bounds for a string of length 4.

Given the constraints and operations, `new_pos` is thus directly dependent on `empty_pos`, and its calculation doesn't change the values of `start`, `queue`, `visited`, `directions`, `current`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, `dc`, or `new_row` and `new_col` directly. It's an expression that results in a value based on the position of 'X' in the string.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, `queue` is a deque containing either no elements or waiting for the next configuration of the 2x2 sliding puzzle, `visited` is a set containing the string `start` and possibly a new string if the new position is within the boundaries and the new string was not already in `visited`, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is equal to `start`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2, `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2, `dr` is 1, `dc` is 0, `new_row` is `empty_row + 1`, `new_col` is `empty_col`, and `new_pos` is `empty_pos + 2`.**
