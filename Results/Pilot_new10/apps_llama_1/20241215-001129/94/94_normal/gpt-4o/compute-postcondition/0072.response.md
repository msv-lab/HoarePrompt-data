The value of `visited` is updated by adding `new_state_str` to it. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `start` is a string of length 4 containing the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, `directions` has at least one direction to process, `current` is updated, `empty_pos` is based on the updated `current`, `empty_row` and `empty_col` are based on the updated `current`, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `queue` is updated to include the previous values, `visited` includes `new_state_str` in addition to its previous values, `new_state` is a list where the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped, `new_state_str` is `''.join(new_state)`.
