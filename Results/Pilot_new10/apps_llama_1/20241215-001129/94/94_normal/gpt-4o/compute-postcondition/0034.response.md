The code `new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)` is executed. 

`new_state_str` becomes a string of characters in the list `new_state`. 

The value of `new_state` is a list of characters where `new_state[empty_pos]` is the character at index `new_pos` in the original `new_state` list and `new_state[new_pos]` is 'X'. 

Since `new_state` is a list of characters and `new_state_str` is a string created by joining these characters, `new_state_str` is also a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`start` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, 
`queue` is a deque containing either the previous elements or the previous elements and `new_state_str` if `new_state_str` has not been visited before and the new position is within the boundaries, 
`visited` is a set containing the string `start` and possibly `new_state_str` if `new_state_str` has not been visited before and the new position is within the boundaries, 
`directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], 
`current` is equal to `start`, 
`empty_pos` is the initial index of 'X' in `current`, 
`empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2, 
`empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2, 
`dr` is 0, 
`dc` is -1, 
`new_row` is `empty_row`, 
`new_col` is `empty_col - 1`, 
`new_pos` is either -1, 0, 1, or 2 depending on the initial position of 'X', 
`new_state` is a list of characters where `new_state[empty_pos]` is the character at index `new_pos` in the original `new_state` list and `new_state[new_pos]` is 'X', 
`new_state_str` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once.
