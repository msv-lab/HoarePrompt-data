To calculate the new position `new_pos`, we need to multiply `new_row` by 2 and add `new_col` to it. Given that `new_row` is `empty_row - 1` and `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, and since `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, which is a string of length 4, we have to consider the possible positions of 'X'.

Since `current` equals `start` and `start` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, `empty_pos` can be 0, 1, 2, or 3.

However, we are given that `new_row` and `new_col` are such that 0 is less than or equal to `new_row` and it is less than 2 and 0 is less than or equal to `new_col` and it is less than 2. This constraint implies that `empty_row` must be 1 because if `empty_row` were 0, `new_row` would be -1 (since `new_row` is `empty_row - 1`), which does not meet the condition of `new_row` being greater than or equal to 0.

Given `empty_row` is 1, `empty_pos` must be either 2 or 3 (because `empty_pos // 2` equals 1). If `empty_pos` is 2, then `empty_col` is 0; if `empty_pos` is 3, then `empty_col` is 1.

Considering `new_row` is `empty_row - 1`, then `new_row` is 0 (because `empty_row` is 1). `new_col` remains the same as `empty_col` because there's no operation changing it, so `new_col` can be either 0 or 1.

Thus, `new_pos` will be calculated as `new_row * 2 + new_col`, which results in either `0 * 2 + 0 = 0` or `0 * 2 + 1 = 1`.

Therefore, the `new_pos` will be either 0 or 1, depending on the position of 'X' in `current`.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, `queue` is a deque containing no elements or waiting for the next configuration of the 2x2 sliding puzzle, `visited` is a set containing the string `start`, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is equal to `start`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2, `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2, `dr` is -1, `dc` is 0, `new_row` is 0, `new_col` is either 0 or 1, and `new_pos` is either 0 or 1**.
