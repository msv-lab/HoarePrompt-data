The code updates the values of `new_row` and `new_col` based on the current values of `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, and `dc`. 

The new values of `new_row` and `new_col` are calculated as `empty_row + dr` and `empty_col + dc`, respectively. 

The other variables (`start`, `directions`, `current`, `empty_pos`, `queue`, and `visited`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is: `start` is a string of length 4 containing the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, `directions` has at least one direction to process, `current` is updated, `empty_pos` is based on the updated `current`, `empty_row` and `empty_col` are based on the updated `current`, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, and `queue` and `visited` are updated to include the previous values.
