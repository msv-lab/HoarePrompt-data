The given code snippet swaps the values of `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]`. 

`empty_pos` is the current position of the empty space 'X' and `new_pos` is the position where 'X' will be moved after the swap. 

The values of the other variables are not affected.

`new_state` is updated to `['A', 'B', 'C', 'X']` where 'X' is at `new_pos` and the character that was previously at `new_pos` is now at `empty_pos`.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`start` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, 
`visited` contains all reachable states from `start` that have been visited so far, 
`queue` is not empty, 
`current` may be updated, 
`empty_pos` may be updated, 
`empty_row` may be updated, 
`empty_col` may be updated, 
`directions` has at least 3 elements, 
`dr` and `dc` are the third elements of `directions`, 
`new_row` = `empty_row + dr`, 
`new_col` = `empty_col + dc`, 
`new_pos` = (`empty_row + dr`) * 2 + (`empty_col + dc`), 
`new_state` is a list containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' where 'X' is at `new_pos`.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, `visited` contains all reachable states from `start` that have been visited so far, `queue` is not empty, `current` may be updated, `empty_pos` may be updated, `empty_row` may be updated, `empty_col` may be updated, `directions` has at least 3 elements, `dr` and `dc` are the third elements of `directions`, `new_row` = `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` = `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` = (`empty_row + dr`) * 2 + (`empty_col + dc`), `new_state` is a list containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' where 'X' is at `new_pos`.**
