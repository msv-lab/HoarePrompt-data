The value of `new_state_str` is assigned the string value of the list `new_state`. The `join()` function concatenates all the characters in the list `new_state` into a single string.

The state of the other variables, such as `start`, `directions`, `current`, `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `new_row`, `new_col`, `new_pos`, `queue`, `visited`, and `new_state`, remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `start` is a string of length 4 containing the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, `directions` has at least one direction to process, `current` is updated, `empty_pos` is based on the updated `current`, `empty_row` and `empty_col` are based on the updated `current`, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `queue` and `visited` are updated to include the previous values, `new_state` is a list where the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped, `new_state_str` is a string representing the list `new_state`.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, `directions` has at least one direction to process, `current` is updated, `empty_pos` is based on the updated `current`, `empty_row` and `empty_col` are based on the updated `current`, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `queue` and `visited` are updated to include the previous values, `new_state` is a list where the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped, `new_state_str` is `''.join(new_state)`**
