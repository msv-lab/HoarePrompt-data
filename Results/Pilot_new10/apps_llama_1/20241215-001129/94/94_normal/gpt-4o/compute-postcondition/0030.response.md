To determine the output state, we need to calculate the new values of `new_row` and `new_col` based on the given initial state.

Given:
- `dr` is 0
- `dc` is -1
- `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2
- `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2

We calculate `new_row` and `new_col` as follows:
- `new_row` = `empty_row` + `dr` = `empty_row` + 0 = `empty_row`
- `new_col` = `empty_col` + `dc` = `empty_col` - 1

Since `empty_pos` is the initial index of 'X' in `current` and `current` is a string of length 4, `empty_pos` can be 0, 1, 2, or 3. 
- If `empty_pos` is 0, then `empty_row` is 0, `empty_col` is 0, `new_row` is 0, and `new_col` is -1.
- If `empty_pos` is 1, then `empty_row` is 0, `empty_col` is 1, `new_row` is 0, and `new_col` is 0.
- If `empty_pos` is 2, then `empty_row` is 1, `empty_col` is 0, `new_row` is 1, and `new_col` is -1.
- If `empty_pos` is 3, then `empty_row` is 1, `empty_col` is 1, `new_row` is 1, and `new_col` is 0.

The states of the other variables are not affected by the given code. 

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, `queue` is a deque containing either the previous elements or the previous elements and `new_state_str` if `new_state_str` has not been visited before and the new position is within the boundaries, `visited` is a set containing the string `start` and possibly `new_state_str` if `new_state_str` has not been visited before and the new position is within the boundaries, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is equal to `start`, `empty_pos` is the initial index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2, `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2, `dr` is 0, `dc` is -1, `new_row` is `empty_row`, `new_col` is `empty_col - 1**
