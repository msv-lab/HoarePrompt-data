The value of `current` is updated to be the leftmost element of the `queue`. The `queue` becomes one element shorter. The states of the other variables are not affected, except that `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, and `empty_col` may be updated based on the new `current` state. 

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, `visited` contains all reachable states from `start` that have been visited so far, `queue` is one element shorter and not empty, `current` is the leftmost element that was in `queue`, `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, and `empty_col` are determined by the new `current` state, and `directions` remains unchanged**
