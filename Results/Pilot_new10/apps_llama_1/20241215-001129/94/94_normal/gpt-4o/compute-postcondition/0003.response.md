According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `queue`. If `queue` is not empty, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `queue` is a deque containing the initial configuration `start` of the 2x2 sliding puzzle. Since `queue` is not empty (it contains at least the initial configuration `start`), no adjustments to the states are needed for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, `queue` is a deque containing the initial configuration `start` of the 2x2 sliding puzzle, `visited` is a set containing the string `start`, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]**
