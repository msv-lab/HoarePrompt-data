Postcondition: ***`start` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, `visited` contains all reachable states from `start` that have been visited so far, `queue` is not empty and its last element is either the original last element or updated to `new_state_str` if the new state was reachable and not in `visited`, `current` is the leftmost element that was in `queue`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` equals `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` equals `empty_pos % 2`, `directions` is not empty, `dr` and `dc` are the first elements of `directions`, `new_row` equals `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` equals `empty_col + dc`, if `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2`, then `new_state_str` is included in `visited` if it was not already, and `queue`'s last element may be updated to `new_state_str`.***
