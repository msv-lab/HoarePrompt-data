#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string representing the initial configuration of a 2x2 sliding puzzle and returns a set of all unique reachable states from this configuration, assuming the input is valid and the puzzle is solvable, but does not provide any information about the sequence of moves required to reach each state and does not handle invalid inputs.
