Postcondition: **`N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` are integers where their values are determined by the user's input, `N` equals the first input integer, `M` equals the second input integer, `K` equals the third input integer, and `L` equals the fourth input integer. The current values of `M` and `N` and `K` and `L` are such that `M` is greater than or equal to `N - K + 1` and `M` is also greater than or equal to `L`.**
