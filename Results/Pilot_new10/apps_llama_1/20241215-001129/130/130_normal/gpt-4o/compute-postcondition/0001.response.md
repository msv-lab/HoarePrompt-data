The code maps the input values to integers and assigns them to the variables N, M, K, and L, respectively. The `input` function is used to get the input values, which are then split into a list of strings using the `split` method. The `map` function applies the `int` function to each string in the list, converting them to integers.

Output State: **N, M, K, and L are integers, such that N, M, K, and L are the input values converted to integers, 1 <= K <= N is not guaranteed, 1 <= M, and 1 <= L, and N, M, K, L are within the range [1, 10^18], and `input` is assigned the `read` function from `sys.stdin`, N = first input integer, M = second input integer, K = third input integer, L = fourth input integer**
