Postcondition: **N is an integer, M is an integer where 1 <= M, K is an integer, L is an integer where 1 <= L, and `min_x` is (L + M - 1) // M. The current value of `min_x` is (L + M - 1) // M, and the product of M and `min_x` is less than or equal to the difference between N and K, i.e., M * `min_x` <= N - K.**
