Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements the problem description. Here's why:

1. The problem asks to find the minimum number of coins one friend can gift to satisfy all the conditions. The conditions are:
   - Everyone must gift as many coins as others.
   - All coins given to Ivan must be different.
   - Not less than L coins from gifts altogether, must be new in Ivan's collection.

2. The program calculates `min_x` as `(L + M - 1) // M`, which is the minimum number of coins each friend needs to give to ensure that the total number of coins given is at least L. This is because `(L + M - 1) // M` is the smallest integer that satisfies the condition `M * min_x >= L`.

3. The program checks if `M * min_x <= N - K`. This condition ensures that the total number of coins given by all friends (`M * min_x`) does not exceed the number of coins that Ivan does not have (`N - K`). If this condition is true, it means that it is possible for each friend to give `min_x` coins, and Ivan will receive at least L new coins.

4. If the condition `M * min_x <= N - K` is true, the program prints `min_x`, which is the minimum number of coins each friend needs to give. If the condition is false, the program prints -1, indicating that it is not possible to satisfy all the conditions.

The program correctly handles all possible cases:

- If `M * min_x <= N - K`, the program prints the minimum number of coins each friend needs to give, which satisfies all the conditions.
- If `M * min_x > N - K`, the program prints -1, indicating that it is not possible to satisfy all the conditions.

Overall, the program accurately implements the problem description and provides the correct output for all possible inputs.
