The code takes two input integers, which are assigned to `a` and `b`. The values of `a` and `b` are now known and are input integers. The states of the other variables are not affected. `ratings_before` is a list containing the input integer `a`, and `ratings_after` is a list containing the input integer `b`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are input integers, `ratings_before` is a list containing the input integer `a`, `ratings_after` is a list containing the input integer `b`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are input integers, `ratings_before` is a list containing the input integer `a`, `ratings_after` is a list containing the input integer `b`**
