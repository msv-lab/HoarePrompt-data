Postcondition: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers. The current values of these lists have the following properties: the element at index `i` in `ratings_before` is less than the element at index `j` in `ratings_before`, and the element at index `i` in `ratings_after` is greater than the element at index `j` in `ratings_after`. Additionally, `rated` is `False` and `maybe` is `True`.**
