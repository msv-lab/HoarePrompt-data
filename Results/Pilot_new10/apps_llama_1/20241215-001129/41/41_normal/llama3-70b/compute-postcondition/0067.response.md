The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or conditional statement it is directly inside. The variables' values do not change as a result of this statement.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 5, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers, `unrated` is `False`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
