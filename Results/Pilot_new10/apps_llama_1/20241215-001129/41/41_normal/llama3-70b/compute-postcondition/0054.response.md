Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is `n`, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers, `rated` is `False`, `maybe` is `True`, if `unrated` is `False`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged as there is no else part to handle it.**
