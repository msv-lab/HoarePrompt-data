To determine the output state after all the iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variables and what conditions must be met for the loop to execute.

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop executes `n` times, where `n` is an input integer. This means for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0.

2. **Variables Modified**:
   - `ratings_before`: Initially an empty list, it gets appended with the input integer `a` in each iteration.
   - `ratings_after`: Initially an empty list, it gets appended with the input integer `b` in each iteration.
   - `a` and `b`: These are input integers read in each iteration. Their values are not retained from one iteration to the next but are used to update `ratings_before` and `ratings_after`.

3. **Output State after Loop Execution**:
   - If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, so `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` remain empty lists.
   - If `n` is greater than 0, after `n` iterations, `ratings_before` will contain `n` instances of input integers (each `a` from an iteration), and `ratings_after` will contain `n` instances of input integers (each `b` from an iteration).

4. **Relationships and Values**:
   - `n` remains unchanged as it's the loop counter.
   - `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of length `n`, filled with input integers `a` and `b` respectively from each iteration.

5. **Final State**:
   - `n` is the original input integer.
   - `ratings_before` is a list containing `n` input integers (each an `a` from the iterations).
   - `ratings_after` is a list containing `n` input integers (each a `b` from the iterations).

Given this analysis, the output state after all iterations have finished can be described as follows:

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `ratings_before` is a list of `n` input integers, `ratings_after` is a list of `n` input integers.**
