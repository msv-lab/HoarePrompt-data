According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the input is a list of pairs of integers, `n` is an input integer, `ratings_before` is an empty list, `ratings_after` is an empty list. These states do not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` must be greater than 0. 
State: **the input is a list of pairs of integers, `n` must be greater than 0, `ratings_before` is an empty list, `ratings_after` is an empty list**
