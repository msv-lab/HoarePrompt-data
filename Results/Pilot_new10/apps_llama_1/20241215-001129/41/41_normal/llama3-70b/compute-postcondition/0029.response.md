According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 3. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`, so `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `ratings_before` is a list of `n` input integers, `ratings_after` is a list of `n` input integers, `rated` is `False`, `unrated` is `False`, `maybe` is `True`**
