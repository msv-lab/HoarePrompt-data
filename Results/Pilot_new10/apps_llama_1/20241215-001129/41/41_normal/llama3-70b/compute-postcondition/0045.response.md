The `break` statement is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement that we are directly inside. This does not affect the values of any variables, but we exit the loop or if statement.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers, `rated` is `False`, `maybe` is `True`, `unrated` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
