According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is a non-negative integer, which means it can be 0. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The loop also introduces a new variable `i`, which will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `ratings_before` is a list of `n` input integers, `ratings_after` is a list of `n` input integers, `rated` is `False`, `unrated` is `True`, and `maybe` is `True`**
