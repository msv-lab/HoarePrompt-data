Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers. If there exists an `i` in `range(n)` such that `ratings_before[i]` is not equal to `ratings_after[i]`, then `rated` is `True` and 'rated' has been printed. If for all `i` in `range(n)`, `ratings_before[i]` is equal to `ratings_after[i]`, then `rated` is `False`. In both cases, `maybe` is `True`. If there exists a pair of indices `i` and `j` in `range(n)` such that `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j] and ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]`, then `unrated` is `False`. Otherwise, `unrated` is `True` and 'unrated' has been printed if `rated` is `False`, or `unrated` is `True` with no additional output if `rated` is `True`. If `rated` is `False` and `unrated` is `False`, then 'maybe' has been printed.**
