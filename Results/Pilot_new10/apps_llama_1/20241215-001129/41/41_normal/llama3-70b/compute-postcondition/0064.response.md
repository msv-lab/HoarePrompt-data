Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers. If `ratings_before[i]` is less than `ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i]` is greater than `ratings_after[j]`, then `unrated` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, with `rated` and `maybe` either being `False` or remaining unchanged and `True` or remaining unchanged respectively. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
