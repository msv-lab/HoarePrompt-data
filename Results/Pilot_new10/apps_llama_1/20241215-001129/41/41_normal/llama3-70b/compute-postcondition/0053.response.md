The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. The states of the variables `n`, `i`, `j`, `ratings_before`, `ratings_after`, `rated`, `maybe`, and `unrated` are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is `n`, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers, `rated` is `False`, `maybe` is `True`, `unrated` is `False`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
