The code statement `unrated = False` directly sets the value of `unrated` to `False`, regardless of its previous value. Other variables are not affected by this statement. 

So, `n` remains greater than or equal to 4, `i` remains 2, `j` remains 4, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` remain lists of `n` input integers, `rated` remains `False` or unchanged, `maybe` remains `True` or unchanged, and `unrated` is now `False`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers, `rated` is `False` or remains unchanged, `maybe` is `True` or remains unchanged, `unrated` is `False`**
