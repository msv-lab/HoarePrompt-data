You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Is it rated?

Here it is. The Ultimate Question of Competitive Programming, Codeforces, and Everything. And you are here to answer it.

Another Codeforces round has been conducted. No two participants have the same number of points. For each participant, from the top to the bottom of the standings, their rating before and after the round is known.

It's known that if at least one participant's rating has changed, then the round was rated for sure.

It's also known that if the round was rated and a participant with lower rating took a better place in the standings than a participant with higher rating, then at least one round participant's rating has changed.

In this problem, you should not make any other assumptions about the rating system.

Determine if the current round is rated, unrated, or it's impossible to determine whether it is rated of not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of round participants.

Each of the next n lines contains two integers a_{i} and b_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i}, b_{i} ≤ 4126) — the rating of the i-th participant before and after the round, respectively. The participants are listed in order from the top to the bottom of the standings.


-----Output-----

If the round is rated for sure, print "rated". If the round is unrated for sure, print "unrated". If it's impossible to determine whether the round is rated or not, print "maybe".


-----Examples-----

2194 2194
2876 2903
2624 2624
3007 2991
2884 2884

Output
rated

Input

1500 1500
1300 1300
1200 1200
1400 1400

Output
unrated

Input

3123 3123
2777 2777
2246 2246
2246 2246
1699 1699

Output
maybe



-----Note-----

In the first example, the ratings of the participants in the third and fifth places have changed, therefore, the round was rated.

In the second example, no one's rating has changed, but the participant in the second place has lower rating than the participant in the fourth place. Therefore, if the round was rated, someone's rating would've changed for sure.

In the third example, no one's rating has changed, and the participants took places in non-increasing order of their rating. Therefore, it's impossible to determine whether the round is rated or not.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ratings_before = []
    ratings_after = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        ratings_before.append(a)
        ratings_after.append(b)
    rated = False
    unrated = True
    maybe = True
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j] and ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]:
                unrated = False
                break
        if not unrated:
            break
    for i in range(n):
        if ratings_before[i] != ratings_after[i]:
            rated = True
            break
    if rated:
        print('rated')
    elif unrated:
        print('unrated')
    else:
        print('maybe')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given Python program seems to be correct according to the problem description. It follows the conditions given:

1. If at least one participant's rating has changed, then the round was rated for sure. This is handled by the code block `if ratings_before[i]!= ratings_after[i]:` which sets `rated` to `True` if any rating has changed.

2. If the round was rated and a participant with a lower rating took a better place in the standings than a participant with a higher rating, then at least one round participant's rating has changed. This condition is checked by the nested for loops `for i in range(n):` and `for j in range(i + 1, n):` which compare each pair of participants' ratings before and after the round. If a participant with a lower rating before the round takes a better place than a participant with a higher rating after the round, `unrated` is set to `False`.

3. The possible outputs of the program are 'rated', 'unrated', or 'maybe'. The 'rated' output occurs when `rated` is `True`. The 'unrated' output happens when `unrated` remains `True` after checking all participants. The 'maybe' output is printed when neither 'rated' nor 'unrated' conditions are met.

All the example input cases are handled correctly by the program, and it seems to cover all potential cases. If a participant's rating has changed, it correctly outputs 'rated'. If all ratings are the same and participants are ranked by their rating, it correctly outputs 'unrated'. In cases where all ratings are the same and participants' rankings do not correspond to their ratings, but also no rating has changed, it correctly outputs 'maybe'. Therefore, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: the input is a list of pairs of integers representing the ratings of participants before and after a round, where each pair is (a, b) such that a and b are the ratings of a participant before and after the round, respectively, and the participants are listed in order from the top to the bottom of the standings, and there are at least 2 participants.

If there does not exist a pair of indices `i` and `j` in `range(n)` such that `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j] and ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]`, then `unrated` is `True` and 'unrated' has been printed to the console.

If for all `i` in `range(n)`, `ratings_before[i]` is equal to `ratings_after[i]`, then `rated` is `False`. In both cases, `maybe` is `True`. If there exists a pair of indices `i` and `j` in `range(n)` such that `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j] and ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]`, then `unrated` is `False`.

If `rated` is `False` and `unrated` is `False`, then 'maybe' has been printed.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
