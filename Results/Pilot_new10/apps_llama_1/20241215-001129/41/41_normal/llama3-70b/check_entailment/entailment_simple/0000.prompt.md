You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Is it rated?

Here it is. The Ultimate Question of Competitive Programming, Codeforces, and Everything. And you are here to answer it.

Another Codeforces round has been conducted. No two participants have the same number of points. For each participant, from the top to the bottom of the standings, their rating before and after the round is known.

It's known that if at least one participant's rating has changed, then the round was rated for sure.

It's also known that if the round was rated and a participant with lower rating took a better place in the standings than a participant with higher rating, then at least one round participant's rating has changed.

In this problem, you should not make any other assumptions about the rating system.

Determine if the current round is rated, unrated, or it's impossible to determine whether it is rated of not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of round participants.

Each of the next n lines contains two integers a_{i} and b_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i}, b_{i} ≤ 4126) — the rating of the i-th participant before and after the round, respectively. The participants are listed in order from the top to the bottom of the standings.


-----Output-----

If the round is rated for sure, print "rated". If the round is unrated for sure, print "unrated". If it's impossible to determine whether the round is rated or not, print "maybe".


-----Examples-----

3060 3060
2194 2194
2876 2903
2624 2624
3007 2991
2884 2884

Output
rated

Input
4
1500 1500
1300 1300
1200 1200
1400 1400

Output
unrated

Input
5
3123 3123
2777 2777
2246 2246
2246 2246
1699 1699

Output
maybe



-----Note-----

In the first example, the ratings of the participants in the third and fifth places have changed, therefore, the round was rated.

In the second example, no one's rating has changed, but the participant in the second place has lower rating than the participant in the fourth place. Therefore, if the round was rated, someone's rating would've changed for sure.

In the third example, no one's rating has changed, and the participants took places in non-increasing order of their rating. Therefore, it's impossible to determine whether the round is rated or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: the input is a list of pairs of integers representing the ratings of participants before and after a round, where each pair is (a, b) such that a and b are the ratings of a participant before and after the round, respectively, and the participants are listed in order from the top to the bottom of the standings, and there are at least 2 participants.

                ] > ratings_after[j]:

                break

If there does not exist a pair of indices `i` and `j` in `range(n)` such that `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j] and ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]`, then `unrated` is `True` and 'unrated' has been printed to the console. Otherwise, `unrated` is `False` and 'maybe' has been printed to the console.

If there exists an `i` in `range(n)` such that `ratings_before[i]` is not equal to `ratings_after[i]`, then `rated` is `True` and 'rated' has been printed. If for all `i` in `range(n)`, `ratings_before[i]` is equal to `ratings_after[i]`, then `rated` is `False`. In both cases, `maybe` is `True`. If there exists a pair of indices `i` and `j` in `range(n)` such that `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j] and ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]`, then `unrated` is `False`. Otherwise, `unrated` is `True` and 'unrated' has been printed if `rated` is `False`, or `unrated` is `True` with no additional output if `rated` is `True`. If `rated` is `False` and `unrated` is `False`, then 'maybe' has been printed.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
