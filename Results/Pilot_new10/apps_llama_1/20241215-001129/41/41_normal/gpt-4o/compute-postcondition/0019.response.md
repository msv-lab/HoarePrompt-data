Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), there is a list of participants of length `n`, `ratings` is a list containing the original tuples and the new tuple `(a, b)`, `is_unrated` is `False`, loop counter `_` is 2, `a` is the new first input integer, `b` is the new second input integer, if `a` is not equal to `b`, then `is_rated` is `True`, otherwise, the state remains unchanged as there is no else part to handle the case when `a` equals `b`.**
