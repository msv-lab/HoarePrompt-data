According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 3 and 1000 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 3, and `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`n` is an input integer between 3 and 1000 (inclusive), there is a list of participants of length `n`, `ratings` is a list of `n` tuples containing the input integers `a` and `b` for each participant, `i` is 3**
