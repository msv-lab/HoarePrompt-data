To calculate the output state, let's analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state.

The initial state is:
- `n` is an input integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive).
- There is a list of participants of length `n`, where each participant has a rating before and after the round, and participants are listed in order from the top to the bottom of the standings.
- `ratings` is an empty list.
- `is_rated` is `False`.

The code snippet is:
```python
is_unrated = False
```

This code introduces a new variable `is_unrated` and sets it to `False`. The values of `n`, the list of participants, `ratings`, and `is_rated` are not changed by this operation.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is an input integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive).
- There is a list of participants of length `n`, where each participant has a rating before and after the round, and participants are listed in order from the top to the bottom of the standings.
- `ratings` is an empty list.
- `is_rated` is `False`.
- `is_unrated` is `False`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), there is a list of participants of length `n`, where each participant has a rating before and after the round, and participants are listed in order from the top to the bottom of the standings, `ratings` is an empty list, `is_rated` is `False`, `is_unrated` is `False`**
