According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n` and the loop counter `_`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), there is a list of participants of length `n`, `ratings` is a list containing [(a, b)], `is_unrated` is `False`, loop counter `_` is 0, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer. For the loop to execute again, the loop counter `_` must be increased by 1. So, `_` becomes 1. The loop can execute again if `n` is greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), there is a list of participants of length `n`, `ratings` is a list containing [(a, b)], `is_unrated` is `False`, loop counter `_` is 1, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer**
