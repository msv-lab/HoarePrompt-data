The code `ratings.append((a, b))` adds a new element to the `ratings` list. The new element is a tuple containing the values of `a` and `b`, which are the new input integers. 

So, `ratings` now contains one more tuple, in addition to the tuples it already had, and its length is increased by 1.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), there is a list of participants of length `n`, `ratings` is a list containing the original tuples and the new tuple `(a, b)`, `is_unrated` is `False`, loop counter `_` is 2, `a` is the new first input integer, `b` is the new second input integer, if `a` is not equal to `b`, then `is_rated` is `True`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), there is a list of participants of length `n`, `ratings` is a list containing the original tuples and the new tuple `(a, b)`, `is_unrated` is `False`, loop counter `_` is 2, `a` is the new first input integer, `b` is the new second input integer, if `a` is not equal to `b`, then `is_rated` is `True`.**
