The value of `is_rated` is set to `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), there is a list of participants of length `n`, `ratings` is a list containing the original tuples and the new tuple `(a, b)`, `is_unrated` is `False`, loop counter `_` is 2, `a` is the new first input integer, `b` is the new second input integer, `is_rated` is `True`.
