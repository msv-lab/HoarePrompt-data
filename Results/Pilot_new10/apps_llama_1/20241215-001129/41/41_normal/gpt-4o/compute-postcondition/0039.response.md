Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), there is a list of participants of length `n`, `ratings` is a list of `n` tuples containing the input integers `a` and `b` for each participant, `is_rated` is `False`, if any `ratings[i-1][0]` is less than `ratings[i][0]` for `i` in range(1, n), then `is_unrated` is `True`, and the list of participants and `ratings` remain unchanged**
