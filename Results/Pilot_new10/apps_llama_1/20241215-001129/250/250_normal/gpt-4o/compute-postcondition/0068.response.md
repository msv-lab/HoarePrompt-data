Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` increasing integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, `marks` is a list of input integers that must have at least 3 elements, `marks_set` is a set of unique input integers from `marks`, `y_found` is either `True` or `False`, `mark` is the third mark in `marks`. If `mark + x + y` is in `marks_set` or `mark + x - y` is in `marks_set` or `mark - x + y` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains at least the element `mark + x`. If none of these conditions are met, then if `mark - x + y` is in `marks_set` or `mark - x - y` is in `marks_set`, `new_marks` is a set containing at least one element which is `marks[2] - x`. Otherwise, no new elements are added to any set.**
