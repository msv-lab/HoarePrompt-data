Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` increasing integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, `marks` is a list of input integers, `marks_set` is a set of unique input integers from `marks`, `mark` is either the last mark processed or remains undefined if `marks` is empty, `new_marks` is an empty set, if `y_found` is `False`, then if `x_found` is `False`, `result` is a list containing the input integers `x` and `y`, otherwise `result` is its original value with `y` appended to it, and `x_found` retains its original value; otherwise, the program state remains unchanged**
