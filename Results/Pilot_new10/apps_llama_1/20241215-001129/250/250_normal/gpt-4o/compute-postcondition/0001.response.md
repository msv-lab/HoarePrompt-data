To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the program.

The initial state is:
- `n` is an input integer
- `l` is an input integer
- `x` is an input integer
- `y` is an input integer
- `a` is a list of `n` increasing integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`

The code snippet provided is:
```python
marks = list(map(int, input().split()))
```

This line of code:
1. Accepts an input from the user which is expected to be a sequence of integers separated by spaces.
2. Splits the input into a list of strings using spaces as the delimiter.
3. Maps each string in the list to an integer using the `int()` function, effectively converting all the strings into integers.
4. Assigns this list of integers to a new variable named `marks`.

Given this analysis, the output state is as follows:
- `n` is an input integer
- `l` is an input integer
- `x` is an input integer
- `y` is an input integer
- `a` is a list of `n` increasing integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`
- `marks` is a list of input integers

Therefore, the Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` increasing integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, `marks` is a list of input integers**
