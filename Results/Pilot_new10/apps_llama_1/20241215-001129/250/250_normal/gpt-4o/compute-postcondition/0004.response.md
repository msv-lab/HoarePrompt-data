The code introduces a new variable `y_found` and sets it to `False`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` increasing integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, `marks` is a list of input integers, `marks_set` is a set of unique input integers from `marks`, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`**
