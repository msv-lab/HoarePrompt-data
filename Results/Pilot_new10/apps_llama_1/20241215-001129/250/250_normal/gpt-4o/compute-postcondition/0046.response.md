To determine the output state after executing the given code snippet, we analyze the impact of the code on the program variables and their previous values. The code adds `mark + y` to the `new_marks` set.

Previous values:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `l` is an input integer.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `y` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of `n` increasing integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`.
- `marks` is a list of input integers with at least 1 element.
- `marks_set` is a set of unique input integers from `marks`.
- `y_found` is `False`, indicating no mark plus or minus `y` is found in `marks_set`.
- `mark` is the first mark in `marks`.
- `x_found` is `False`, with conditions related to `mark`, `x`, and `y` in `marks_set`.
- `new_marks` is a set with specific conditions based on `mark`, `x`, and `y`.

Given the condition that at least one of the following is in `marks_set`: `mark + y + x`, `mark + y - x`, or `mark - y + x`, and considering the addition of `mark + y` to `new_marks`, we need to update `new_marks` accordingly.

Output State: 
**`n` is an input integer, 
`l` is an input integer, 
`x` is an input integer, 
`y` is an input integer, 
`a` is a list of `n` increasing integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, 
`marks` is a list of input integers with at least 1 element, 
`marks_set` is a set of unique input integers from `marks`, 
`y_found` is `False`, 
`mark` is the first mark in `marks`, 
`x_found` is `False`, 
`new_marks` contains at least `mark + y` in addition to its previous elements, 
with the condition that at least one of `mark + y + x`, `mark + y - x`, or `mark - y + x` is in `marks_set`.**
