Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` increasing integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, `marks` is a list of input integers that must have at least 1 mark, `marks_set` is a set of unique input integers from `marks`, `mark` is the first mark in the `marks` list. The current value of `x_found` is `True` because `mark + x` is in `marks_set` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set`. The current value of `y_found` is `True` because `mark + y` is in `marks_set` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`. Both conditions for `x_found` and `y_found` are met, indicating that both `x` and `y` have been found in relation to `mark` within the `marks_set`.**
