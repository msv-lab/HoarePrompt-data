Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` increasing integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, `marks` is a list of input integers that must have at least 1 element, `marks_set` is a set of unique input integers from `marks`, if `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x` is in `marks_set`, then `y_found` remains `False`, `x_found` remains `False`, and `new_marks` is a set containing at least `mark - x` or `mark + x` and also `mark - y`. If neither `mark - y + x` nor `mark - y - x` is in `marks_set`, then the state of the program remains unchanged, meaning `x_found` is still `False`, `y_found` is still `False`, and `new_marks` is unchanged, however, it could be that `new_marks` contains `mark + x` if `mark + x + y`, `mark + x - y`, `mark - x + y`, or `mark - x - y` is in `marks_set` before the if else block, or `new_marks` contains `mark - x` if `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` is in `marks_set` before the if else block but none of `mark + x + y` or `mark + x - y` are in `marks_set`.***
