Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` increasing integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, `marks` is a list of input integers, `marks_set` is a set of unique input integers from `marks`, `x_found` is `True` because a mark plus or minus `x` is found in `marks_set`, `y_found` is `True` because a mark plus or minus `y` is found in `marks_set`, `mark` is either the last mark processed or remains undefined if `marks` is empty. The current values of `x_found` and `y_found` are both `True`, indicating that both conditions of finding a mark plus or minus `x` and plus or minus `y` in `marks_set` are met.**
