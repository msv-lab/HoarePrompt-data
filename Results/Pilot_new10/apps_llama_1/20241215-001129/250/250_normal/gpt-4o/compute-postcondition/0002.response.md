The code creates a new set called `marks_set` from the list `marks`. This set will contain unique elements from the `marks` list, because sets in Python only store unique values.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` increasing integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, `marks` is a list of input integers, `marks_set` is a set of unique input integers from `marks`.**
