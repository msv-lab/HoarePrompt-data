According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `marks` list. If the list has at least 1 mark, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the state of `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `marks_set`, `x_found`, and `y_found` does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `marks` must have at least 1 mark, and `mark` is the first mark in the list.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` increasing integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, `marks` is a list of input integers that must have at least 1 mark, `marks_set` is a set of unique input integers from `marks`, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`, `mark` is the first mark in the `marks` list**
