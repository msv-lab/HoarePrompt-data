Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 4, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, the ruler is represented by an increasing sequence of `n` integers, `marks` is a set of unique input integers, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, if `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `x`, then `need_x` is True, otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged as there is no else part in the code***
