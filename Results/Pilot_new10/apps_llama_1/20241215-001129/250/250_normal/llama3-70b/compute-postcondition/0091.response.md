To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the output states after the first few iterations.

The loop code checks two conditions: `i + j <= l` and `i + j not in marks`. If both conditions are met, it appends `i + j` to `additional_marks`.

From the output states after the first few iterations, we can see that:

* `additional_marks` starts with at least 1 element.
* If `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and not in `marks`, then `i + j` is added to `additional_marks` if it was not already present.
* The loop continues to execute as long as there are elements in `additional_marks` that satisfy the conditions.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, we can conclude that:

* `n` remains an input integer.
* `l` remains an input integer.
* `x` and `y` remain input integers.
* The ruler remains an increasing sequence of `n` integers.
* `marks` remains a set of unique input integers with at least 2 integers.
* `i` is an element in `marks`.
* `additional_marks` is a set that contains all possible values of `i + j` that satisfy the conditions `i + j <= l` and `i + j not in marks`, where `j` is an element in `additional_marks` or `marks`.

Note that the loop will not execute if `additional_marks` is empty or if no elements in `additional_marks` satisfy the conditions.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` and `y` are input integers, the ruler is an increasing sequence of `n` integers, `marks` is a set of unique input integers with at least 2 integers, `i` is an element in `marks`, and `additional_marks` is a set that contains all possible values of `i + j` that satisfy the conditions `i + j <= l` and `i + j not in marks`.**
