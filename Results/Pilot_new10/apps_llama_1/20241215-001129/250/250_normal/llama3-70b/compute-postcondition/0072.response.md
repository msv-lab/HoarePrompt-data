Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` and `y` are input integers, the ruler is an increasing sequence of `n` integers, `marks` is a set of unique input integers that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is an element of `marks`, `j` is `x`, if `i + x` is less than or equal to `l` and `i + x` is not in `marks`, then `need_y` is `False` and `additional_marks` is a list containing `x`, `y`, and `i + x`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
