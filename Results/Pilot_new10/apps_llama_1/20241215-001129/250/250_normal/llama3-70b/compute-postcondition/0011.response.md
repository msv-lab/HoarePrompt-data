According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` must be equal to `i` since this is the start of the loop for `j`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1. So, `j` is `i + 1` and for the loop to execute again `i + 1` must be less than `n`. 
State: **`n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, the ruler is represented by an increasing sequence of `n` integers `a_1, a_2,..., a_{n}`, `marks` is a set of unique input integers, `i` is the previous `i`, `j` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`**
