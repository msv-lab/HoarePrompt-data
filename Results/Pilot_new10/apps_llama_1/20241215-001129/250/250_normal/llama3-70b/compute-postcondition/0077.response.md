The code `additional_marks.append(i + j)` adds a new element to the `additional_marks` set, which is the sum of `i` and `j`. The value of `i` is an element of `marks`, and the value of `j` is the next element in `additional_marks`, potentially `i + y` if conditions are met.

Given the initial state, `n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` and `y` are input integers, the ruler is an increasing sequence of `n` integers, `marks` is a set of unique input integers with at least 1 integer, `i` is an element of `marks`, and `j` is the next element in `additional_marks`.

After executing the code, the `additional_marks` set now contains an additional element, which is `i + j`. The values of `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, the ruler, `marks`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` and `y` are input integers, the ruler is an increasing sequence of `n` integers, `marks` is a set of unique input integers with at least 1 integer, `i` is an element of `marks`, `j` is the next element in `additional_marks`, and `additional_marks` contains at least `y` and potentially `i + y` or another value, and also contains `i + j`.**
