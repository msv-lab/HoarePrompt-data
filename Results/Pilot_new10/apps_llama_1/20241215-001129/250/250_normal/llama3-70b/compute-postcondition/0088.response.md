According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `additional_marks` set. If `additional_marks` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `additional_marks` has at least 3 elements including the new element `i + j` if the conditions were met, otherwise the state remains unchanged. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `additional_marks` must have at least 4 elements including the new element `i + j` if the conditions were met, otherwise `additional_marks` remains the same. The other variables' states remain unchanged as they do not affect the loop condition.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` and `y` are input integers, the ruler is an increasing sequence of `n` integers, `marks` is a set of unique input integers with at least 2 integers, `additional_marks` is a set with at least 4 elements**
