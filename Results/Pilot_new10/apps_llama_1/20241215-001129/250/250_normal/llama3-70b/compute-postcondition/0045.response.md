Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, the ruler is represented by an increasing sequence of `n` integers, `marks` is a set of unique input integers, initially `i` was 2, initially `j` was 2, `need_y` is `True` if there exists a `j` such that `marks[j] - marks[1] == y`, if there exists a `j` such that `marks[j] - marks[2] == x`, then `i` is 2 and `j` is such that `marks[j] - marks[i] == x`, and `need_x` is `True`. Otherwise, `i` is 2 and `j` is 2.***
