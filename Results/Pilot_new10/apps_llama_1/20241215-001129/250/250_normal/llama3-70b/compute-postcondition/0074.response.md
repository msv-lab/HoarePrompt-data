To calculate the result, let's analyze the given code and the initial state.

The initial state is: 
- `n` is an input integer
- `l` is an input integer
- `x` and `y` are input integers
- The ruler is an increasing sequence of `n` integers
- `marks` is a set of unique input integers that must have at least 1 integer
- `i` is an element of `marks`
- `j` is `y`
- `additional_marks` contains at least `y` and potentially `i + x` if the conditions are still met

The given code is:
```python
additional_marks.append(i + j)
```
Here, `i + j` is equivalent to `i + y` since `j` is `y`. 

So, `additional_marks` now contains at least `y` and `i + y`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` is an input integer, 
`l` is an input integer, 
`x` and `y` are input integers, 
the ruler is an increasing sequence of `n` integers, 
`marks` is a set of unique input integers that must have at least 1 integer, 
`i` is an element of `marks`, 
`j` is `y`, 
`additional_marks` contains at least `y` and `i + y`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` and `y` are input integers, the ruler is an increasing sequence of `n` integers, `marks` is a set of unique input integers that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is an element of `marks`, `j` is `y`, `additional_marks` contains at least `y` and `i + y`.**
