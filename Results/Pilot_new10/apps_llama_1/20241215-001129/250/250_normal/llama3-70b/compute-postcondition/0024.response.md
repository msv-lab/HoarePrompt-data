Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, the ruler is represented by an increasing sequence of `n` integers `a_1, a_2,..., a_{n}`, `marks` is a set of unique input integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `need_x` is `True` if there exists a `j` such that `marks[j] - marks[0] == x`, `need_y` is `True` if there exists a `j` such that `marks[j] - marks[0] == y`. The current value of `marks[j] - marks[i]` is equal to `x`.**
