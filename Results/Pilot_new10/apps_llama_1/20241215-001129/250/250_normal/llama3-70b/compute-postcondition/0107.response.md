The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the provided constraints, it seems that the function operates under the context of the following parameters: 
- `n`: a positive integer
- `l`: a positive integer
- `x` and `y`: positive integers such that 1 <= `x` < `y` <= `l`
- A ruler represented by an increasing sequence of `n` integers `a_1, a_2,..., a_{n}`, where `a_{i}` denotes the distance of the `i`-th mark from the origin (`a_1 = 0, a_{n} = l`).

Since the actual output or return value of the function is not specified, we cannot determine what the function returns. 

However, if we were to describe the functionality based on typical expectations of a function operating within these constraints, we might expect it to return information related to measurements or intervals on the ruler. 

Functionality: **The function operates under the context of parameters n, l, x, y, and a sequence of integers representing a ruler, but its actual input parameters and return values are not specified.**
