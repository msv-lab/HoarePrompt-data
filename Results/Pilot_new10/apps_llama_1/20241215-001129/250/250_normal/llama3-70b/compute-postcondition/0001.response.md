The code `marks = set(map(int, input().split()))` creates a set of unique integers from the input. However, the initial state already has `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` as input integers, and a sequence of `n` integers representing the ruler. The new variable `marks` is assigned the value of this set.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, the ruler is represented by an increasing sequence of `n` integers `a_1, a_2,..., a_{n}`, `marks` is a set of unique input integers**
