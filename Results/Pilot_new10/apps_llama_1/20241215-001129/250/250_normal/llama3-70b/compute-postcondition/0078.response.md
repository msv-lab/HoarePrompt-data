Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` and `y` are input integers, the ruler is an increasing sequence of `n` integers, `marks` is a set of unique input integers with at least 1 integer, `i` is an element of `marks`, `j` is the next element in `additional_marks`, and `additional_marks` contains at least `y` and potentially `i + y` or another value. If `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`, then `additional_marks` also contains `i + j`.***
