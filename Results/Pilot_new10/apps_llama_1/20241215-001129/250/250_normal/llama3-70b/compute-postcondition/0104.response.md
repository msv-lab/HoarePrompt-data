To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the loop code and understand how it modifies the variables.

The loop code is a nested loop structure that iterates over the `marks` set and the `additional_marks` list. For each pair of `i` from `marks` and `j` from `additional_marks`, it checks two conditions: `i + j <= l` and `i + j not in marks`. If both conditions are satisfied, it appends `i + j` to `additional_marks`.

Given the output states after the loop executes a few times, we can observe patterns in how `additional_marks` is updated and how the conditions affect the loop's execution.

1. **`marks` must be a set of unique input integers**: For the loop to execute at least once, `marks` needs to have at least one element. The loop will iterate over each unique integer in `marks`.

2. **`additional_marks` is updated based on the conditions**: The list `additional_marks` starts with `x` and `y` (if `need_y` is `False`). During each iteration, if the sum of `i` (from `marks`) and `j` (from `additional_marks`) is less than or equal to `l` and this sum is not already in `marks`, the sum is appended to `additional_marks`.

3. **The loop continues until no new elements can be added to `additional_marks`**: The loop will continue to iterate over `marks` and the updated `additional_marks` until no new sums can be added to `additional_marks` because either the sum exceeds `l` or the sum is already in `marks`.

4. **`i` and `j`**: After the loop finishes, `i` will be the last element iterated over in `marks`, and `j` will be the last element iterated over in `additional_marks` during the last iteration of the loop.

5. **`n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, and the ruler**: These variables do not change during the loop execution. `n` remains the input integer, `l` remains the input integer, `x` and `y` are the original input integers used to initialize `additional_marks` (if `need_y` is `False`), and the ruler remains an increasing sequence of `n` integers.

Considering these points, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished can be described as follows:

- `n` is an input integer.
- `l` is an input integer.
- `x` and `y` are the original input integers.
- The ruler is an increasing sequence of `n` integers.
- `marks` is a set of unique input integers.
- `additional_marks` contains all possible values of `i + j` that satisfy `i + j <= l` and `i + j not in marks`, where `i` is an element in `marks` and `j` is an element in the original `additional_marks` or a value added during the iterations.
- `i` is the last element iterated over in `marks`.
- `j` is the last element iterated over in `additional_marks`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` and `y` are the original input integers, the ruler is an increasing sequence of `n` integers, `marks` is a set of unique input integers, `additional_marks` contains all sums `i + j` where `i` is in `marks`, `j` is in the updated `additional_marks`, `i + j <= l`, and `i + j` is not in `marks`, `i` is the last element in `marks`, and `j` is the last element in the updated `additional_marks`.**
