The code appends `i + j` to `additional_marks`. The current value of `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and is not an element of `marks`. The value of `j` is `x`. 

`additional_marks` initially contains `x` and `y`, and now it also contains `i + j`, which is `i + x`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` and `y` are input integers, the ruler is an increasing sequence of `n` integers, `marks` is a set of unique input integers that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is an element of `marks`, `j` is `x`, `need_y` is `False`, `additional_marks` is a list containing `x`, `y`, and `i + x`, the current value of `i + x` is less than or equal to `l` and the current value of `i + x` is not an element of `marks`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` and `y` are input integers, the ruler is an increasing sequence of `n` integers, `marks` is a set of unique input integers that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is an element of `marks`, `j` is `x`, `need_y` is `False`, `additional_marks` is a list containing `x`, `y`, and `i + x`, the value of `i + x` is less than or equal to `l` and `i + x` is not an element of `marks`**
