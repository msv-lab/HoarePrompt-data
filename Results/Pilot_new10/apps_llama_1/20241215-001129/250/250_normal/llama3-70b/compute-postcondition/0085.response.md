According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `additional_marks` set. If the set has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `additional_marks` has at least 1 element, `j` is the first element in `additional_marks`. For the loop to execute again, `additional_marks` must have at least 2 elements and `j` must be the next element in `additional_marks`.

If `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`, then `additional_marks` has at least 2 elements including `j` and `i + j`. This means that `i + j` is now an element in `additional_marks` and it will be considered as `j` in the next iteration.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` and `y` are input integers, the ruler is an increasing sequence of `n` integers, `marks` is a set of unique input integers with at least 2 integers, `i` is an element in `marks`, `j` is the next element in `additional_marks`, `additional_marks` is a set with at least 2 elements**
