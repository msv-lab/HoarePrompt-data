Postcondition: **`n` is at least 3, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, the ruler is represented by an increasing sequence of `n` integers, `marks` is a set of unique input integers, initially `i` was 2, initially `j` was 2, `need_x` is `True` if there exists a `j` such that `marks[j] - marks[1] == x`, and `need_y` is `True` if there exists a `j` such that `marks[j] - marks[1] == y`. The current value of `i` is 2 and the current value of `j` is such that the difference between `marks` at index `j` and `marks` at index `i` equals `x`, meaning `marks[j] - marks[i] == x`**
