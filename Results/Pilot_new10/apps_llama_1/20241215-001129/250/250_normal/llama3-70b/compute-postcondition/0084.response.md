Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` and `y` are input integers, the ruler is an increasing sequence of `n` integers, `marks` is a set of unique input integers with at least 2 integers, `i` is an element in `marks`, `j` is the first element in `additional_marks`, `additional_marks` is a set with at least 1 element. If `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`, then `additional_marks` has at least 2 elements including `j` and `i + j`, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged***
