Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, the ruler is represented by an increasing sequence of `n` integers, `marks` is a set of unique input integers, if there exists a `j` such that `marks[j] - marks[i] == y`, then `i` is 2, `j` is 2, and `need_y` is True. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged with `i` being 2 and `j` being 2, and `need_y` is False since the else part does not modify any conditions.***
