Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, the ruler is represented by an increasing sequence of `n` integers `a_1, a_2,..., a_{n}`, `marks` is a set of unique input integers, initially `need_x` is `False` and `need_y` is `False`, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and the current value of the difference between `marks[j]` and `marks[i]` is equal to `x`**
