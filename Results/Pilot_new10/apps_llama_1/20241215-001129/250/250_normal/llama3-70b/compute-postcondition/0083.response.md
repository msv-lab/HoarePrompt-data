The code appends the sum of `i` and `j` to the `additional_marks` set. The value of `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and is not an element in `marks`. 

The states of `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, the ruler, and `marks` are not affected. The value of `i` is still an element in `marks`, and the value of `j` is still the first element in `additional_marks`. The `additional_marks` set now includes the sum of `i` and `j` as an additional element. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` and `y` are input integers, the ruler is an increasing sequence of `n` integers, `marks` is a set of unique input integers with at least 2 integers, `i` is an element in `marks`, `j` is the first element in `additional_marks`, `additional_marks` is a set with at least 2 elements including `j` and `i + j`, and `i + j` is less than or equal to `l`.**
