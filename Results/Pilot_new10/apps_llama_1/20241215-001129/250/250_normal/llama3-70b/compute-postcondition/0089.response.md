The code `additional_marks.append(i + j)` modifies the `additional_marks` set by adding a new element, which is the sum of `i` and `j`. However, the values of `i` and `j` are not specified in the initial state. 

Since `additional_marks` is a set, it will only store unique elements. If `i + j` is already in `additional_marks`, then `additional_marks` will not change.

Given the initial state, `n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` and `y` are input integers, the ruler is an increasing sequence of `n` integers, `marks` is a set of unique input integers with at least 2 integers, and `additional_marks` is a set with at least 4 elements.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, the ruler is an increasing sequence of `n` integers, `marks` is a set of unique input integers with at least 2 integers, `additional_marks` is a set with at least 4 elements and contains `i + j` if `i + j` was not already in `additional_marks`.**
