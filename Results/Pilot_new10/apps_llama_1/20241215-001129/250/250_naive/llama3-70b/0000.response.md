Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a bug in its approach to solving the problem. It incorrectly appends new marks to the additional marks list without checking if the new marks are necessary for measuring the distances x and y.

For example, consider the input:
5 10 3 7
0 1 2 6 9 10

In this case, the program should output 0 because the existing marks already allow us to measure the distances 3 (2-(-1) is not an option but 6-3 is not an option too, however 9-6 = 3, and for 7: 9-2 = 7) and 7.

However, the program will incorrectly output additional marks.

The program should be corrected to check if the new marks are necessary before adding them to the list. 

Also, there is a problem with the line where it says `for i in range(n):` because `n` is the number of marks but the list `marks` has `n` elements and lists are 0-indexed, so it should be `for i in range(len(marks)):`. 

Another issue with this code is that it checks all pairs of marks, which results in a time complexity of O(n^2). This could be optimized to O(n) by using a set to store the differences between marks.

Here is a possible correction for the code:
```python
def func():
    (n, l, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    marks = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
    (need_x, need_y) = (False, False)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            if marks[j] - marks[i] == x:
                need_x = True
            if marks[j] - marks[i] == y:
                need_y = True
    additional_marks = []
    if not need_x:
        additional_marks.append(x)
    if not need_y:
        additional_marks.append(y)
    print(len(additional_marks))
    print(' '.join(map(str, additional_marks)))
```
