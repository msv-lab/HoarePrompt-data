To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the provided loop code and the given output states for the first few iterations.

The loop code iterates over the string `s` of length `n`, checking each character. If the character is 'G', it updates the variable `g` with the current index `i`. If the character is 'T', it updates the variable `t` with the current index `i`.

From the output states after 1, 2, and 3 iterations, we can observe the following patterns:
- `n` remains a positive integer from 2 to 100.
- `k` remains a positive integer from 1 to `n-1`, though its value doesn't change within the loop.
- `s` remains a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', with 'G' and 'T' appearing exactly once.
- `i` takes on the value of the current iteration, from 0 to `n-1`.
- `g` and `t` are updated based on the presence of 'G' and 'T' in the string `s`. If 'G' is found at any index, `g` is updated to that index. Similarly, if 'T' is found, `t` is updated to that index.

Given that the loop iterates `n` times and that 'G' and 'T' each appear exactly once in the string `s`, after all iterations, `g` will hold the index of 'G' in `s`, and `t` will hold the index of 'T' in `s`.

If the loop does not execute (which would be the case if `n` were less than or equal to 0, but this is not possible given the initial conditions that `n` is a positive integer from 2 to 100), `g` and `t` would remain -1, as there would be no opportunity for them to be updated.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer from 2 to 100, `k` is a positive integer from 1 to `n-1`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once, `g` is the index of 'G' in `s`, `t` is the index of 'T' in `s`.**
