Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer from 2 to 100, `k` is a positive integer from 1 to `n-1`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once, `i` is 2, if `s[i]` is 'T', then `t` is 2, otherwise, there is no change in `t` or other variables, and `n` must be greater than 2**
