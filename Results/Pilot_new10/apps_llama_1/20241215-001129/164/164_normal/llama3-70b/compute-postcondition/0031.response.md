The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters, but it reads two lines of input. The first line contains two integers `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer from 2 to 100, and `k` is a positive integer from 1 to `n-1`. The second line is a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once. 

Since the output is not provided, I'll describe the general functionality based on the input.

Functionality: **The function reads two lines of input, the first line containing two positive integers n and k, and the second line a string of length n with specific characters, and it will return a value based on the given input, which is not specified.**
