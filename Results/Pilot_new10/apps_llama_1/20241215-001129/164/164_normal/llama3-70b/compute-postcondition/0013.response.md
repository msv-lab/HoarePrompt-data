The value of `t` is updated to be equal to `i`. The previous value of `t` was dependent on the character at index `i` of string `s`, but now it is simply equal to `i`, which is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer from 2 to 100, `k` is a positive integer from 1 to `n-1`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once, `i` is 1, `t` is 1, if the character at index `i` of string `s` is 'G', then `g` is 0, if the character at index `i` of string `s` is 'T', then `g` is -1, if the character at index `i` of string `s` is neither 'G' nor 'T', then `g` is -1**
