Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer from 2 to 100, `k` is a positive integer from 1 to `n-1`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T`. If 'G' or 'T' is not found in `s`, 'NO' has been printed to the console. Otherwise, `g` is the index of 'G' in `s` and `t` is the index of 'T' in `s`, and if the absolute difference between `t` and `g` is a multiple of `k` and the substring of `s` from `g` to `t` (or `t` to `g`), stepping by `k`, contains no '#' characters, then 'YES' has been printed. In all other cases, 'NO' has been printed.***
