Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer from 2 to 100, `k` is a positive integer from 1 to `n-1`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2. If `s[i]` is 'G', then `g` is 2 and `t` is -1 or 1 depending on the character at index `i` of string `s`. If `s[i]` is 'T', then `t` is 2. If `s[i]` is neither 'G' nor 'T', then there is no change in `t` or `g`, but `g` is -1 or 1 and `t` is -1 or 1 depending on the initial character at index `i` of string `s`.***
