Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer from 2 to 100, `k` is a positive integer from 1 to `n-1`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T`. The current value of `g` is either the index of 'G' in `s` or -1 if 'G' is not found, and the current value of `t` is either the index of 'T' in `s` or -1 if 'T' is not found. Either 'G' or 'T' (or both) do not appear in `s`, as indicated by `g` being -1 or `t` being -1 (or both).**
