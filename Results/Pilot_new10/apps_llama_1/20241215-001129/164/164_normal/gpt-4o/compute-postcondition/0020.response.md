The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is directly inside. No changes are made to the values of the variables `n`, `k`, `line`, `G_pos`, `T_pos`, `pos`, and `reachable`. 

Since we break out of the loop, the condition that was being checked in the loop, `if line[pos] is '#', then k is 1`, is not executed. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `line` is the input string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once, `G_pos` is the original index of 'G' if the original index of 'G' is less than or equal to the original index of 'T` or the original index of 'T` otherwise, `T_pos` is the original index of 'T` if the original index of 'G' is less than or equal to the original index of 'T` or the original index of 'G` otherwise, `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, `pos` is `T_pos + 1`, `reachable` is `True`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
