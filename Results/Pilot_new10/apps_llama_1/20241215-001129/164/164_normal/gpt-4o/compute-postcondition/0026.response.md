The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables, but it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The previous values of the variables are still valid after the `break` statement is executed.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `line` is the input string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once, `G_pos` is the original index of 'G' if the original index of 'G' is less than or equal to the original index of 'T` or the original index of 'T` otherwise, `T_pos` is the original index of 'T` if the original index of 'G' is less than or equal to the original index of 'T`, or the original index of 'G` otherwise, `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, `reachable` is `True`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
