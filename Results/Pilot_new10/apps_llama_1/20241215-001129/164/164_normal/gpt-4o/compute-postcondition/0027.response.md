Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `line` is the input string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once, `G_pos` is the original index of 'G' if the original index of 'G' is less than or equal to the original index of 'T` or the original index of 'T` otherwise, `T_pos` is the original index of 'T` if the original index of 'G' is less than or equal to the original index of 'T`, or the original index of 'G` otherwise, `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`. If `pos` equals `T_pos`, then `reachable` is `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `pos` does not equal `T_pos`, then the state remains unchanged, with the same `n`, `k`, `line`, `G_pos`, `T_pos`, and the same relationship between `G_pos` and `T_pos`, and `pos` and `reachable` are determined based on the execution that follows the if statement.**
