Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `line` is the input string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once, `G_pos` is the original index of 'G' if the original index of 'G' is less than or equal to the original index of 'T' or the original index of 'T' otherwise, `T_pos` is the original index of 'T' if the original index of 'G' is less than or equal to the original index of 'T' or the original index of 'G' otherwise, `G_pos` must be less than or equal to `T_pos`, the current value of `reachable` is `False`, `pos` is `G_pos`, and the character at the current position `pos` in `line` is '#'.**
