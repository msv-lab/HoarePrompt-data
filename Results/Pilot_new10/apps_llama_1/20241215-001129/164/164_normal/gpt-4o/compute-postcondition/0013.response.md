The code sets `reachable` to `True`. The previous values of the other variables are not affected. 
The value of `n` is still an input integer, 
the value of `k` is still an input integer greater than 0, 
the value of `line` is still the input string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', 
where 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once, 
the value of `G_pos` is still the original index of 'G' if the original index of 'G' is less than or equal to the original index of 'T` or the original index of 'T` otherwise, 
the value of `T_pos` is still the original index of 'T` if the original index of 'G' is less than or equal to the original index of 'T` or the original index of 'G' otherwise, 
`G_pos` is still less than or equal to `T_pos`, 
and the current value of `pos` is still equal to `T_pos`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `line` is the input string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once, `G_pos` is the original index of 'G' if the original index of 'G' is less than or equal to the original index of 'T` or the original index of 'T` otherwise, `T_pos` is the original index of 'T` if the original index of 'G' is less than or equal to the original index of 'T` or the original index of 'G' otherwise, `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, `reachable` is `True`, and `pos` is equal to `T_pos`**.
