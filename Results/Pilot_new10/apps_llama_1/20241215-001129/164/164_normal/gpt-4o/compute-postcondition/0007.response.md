The code sets the value of `reachable` to `False`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `line` is the input string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once. If the original index of 'G' was greater than the original index of 'T', then `G_pos` is the original index of 'T' and `T_pos` is the original index of 'G'. Otherwise, `G_pos` and `T_pos` remain the original indices of 'G' and 'T' respectively, and `reachable` is `False`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `line` is the input string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once, `G_pos` is the original index of 'G' if the original index of 'G' is less than or equal to the original index of 'T' or the original index of 'T' otherwise, `T_pos` is the original index of 'T' if the original index of 'G' is less than or equal to the original index of 'T' or the original index of 'G' otherwise, and `reachable` is `False`**
