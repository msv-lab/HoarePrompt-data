The values of `G_pos` and `T_pos` are swapped. Initially, `G_pos` is greater than `T_pos`, so after swapping, `G_pos` will be less than `T_pos`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `line` is the input string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once, `G_pos` is the original index of 'T' in `line`, `T_pos` is the original index of 'G` in `line`, and the current value of `G_pos` is less than the current value of `T_pos`**
