Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly handle all cases according to the problem description. 

One potential issue with the program is that it assumes that the grasshopper can only jump in one direction (from the 'G' to the 'T' position) and does not consider the case where the grasshopper jumps in the opposite direction. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
6 2
G..T#.
```
In this case, the grasshopper can jump over the obstacles from the 'G' position to the 'T' position. However, the program will not be able to find this path because it only checks for the path from 'G' to 'T' in one direction. 

To fix this issue, the program should also consider the case where the grasshopper jumps in the opposite direction. 

Additionally, the program does not handle the case where the 'G' and 'T' positions are the same (i.e., `g == t`). In this case, the program should print "YES" because the grasshopper is already at the target position.

The given code does not handle these cases correctly, so its correctness is False. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
from collections import deque

def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    (g, t) = (-1, -1)
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'G':
            g = i
        elif s[i] == 'T':
            t = i
    if g == -1 or t == -1:
        print('NO')
    elif g == t:
        print('YES')
    else:
        queue = deque([g])
        visited = set([g])
        while queue:
            current = queue.popleft()
            for next_pos in [current + k, current - k]:
                if next_pos < 0 or next_pos >= n:
                    continue
                if next_pos not in visited and s[next_pos]!= '#':
                    if next_pos == t:
                        print('YES')
                        return
                    queue.append(next_pos)
                    visited.add(next_pos)
        print('NO')
```
This corrected version of the function uses a breadth-first search (BFS) to explore all possible jumps from the 'G' position and checks if it can reach the 'T' position. It handles the case where the grasshopper jumps in the opposite direction and also handles the case where the 'G' and 'T' positions are the same.
