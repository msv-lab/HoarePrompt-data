Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer in the range 1 <= n <= 100, `s` is a string with at least 3 characters. If `operation` is '-', then if the third character of `s` is '+', `stones` is either 0 (if initially 1) or 1 (if initially 2), if the third character of `s` is '-', then `stones` is 0, for any other third character in `s`, `stones` is either 0 (if initially 0) or decreased by 1 from its previous value (if not 0). If `operation` is not '-', the state of `n`, `s`, and other variables remains unchanged, implying that if the third character of `s` is '+', then `stones` is either 1 or 2, if the third character of `s` is '-', then `stones` is 0, and for any other third character in `s`, the state of `stones` and other variables remains as initially stated in the precondition.**
