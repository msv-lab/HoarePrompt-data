To determine the output state of the loop, let's analyze the given code and the provided output states after a few iterations.

The loop iterates over each character `operation` in the string `s`. If `operation` is '+', it increments `stones` by 1. If `operation` is '-', it decrements `stones` by 1 but ensures `stones` does not go below 0.

From the output states after the loop executes a few times, we can observe the following patterns:
- The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The string `s` must have at least as many characters as the number of times the loop executes.
- The value of `stones` depends on the sequence of '+' and '-' operations in `s`. Each '+' increases `stones` by 1, and each '-' decreases `stones` by 1, unless `stones` is already 0, in which case '-' has no effect.

Considering the loop will execute for all characters in `s`, we can deduce the final state:
- `n` remains a positive integer in the range 1 <= `n` <= 100, as it is not modified by the loop.
- `s` is the string equal to the user's input, which must have been fully iterated over.
- `stones` will end up being the net result of all '+' and '-' operations. Since each '+' adds 1 and each '-' subtracts 1 (unless `stones` is 0), `stones` will be the difference between the count of '+' operations and the count of '-' operations, ensuring that `stones` does not go below 0.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is that `n` remains unchanged, `s` is the input string that has been fully processed, and `stones` reflects the net effect of all '+' and '-' operations in `s`, remaining non-negative due to the `max(0, stones - 1)` operation when encountering a '-'.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range 1 <= `n` <= 100, `s` is a string equal to the user's input, `stones` is the maximum of 0 and the difference between the number of '+' operations and the number of '-' operations in `s`.**
