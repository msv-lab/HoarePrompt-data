The code provided is a simple print statement that outputs the value of the variable `stones`. The variable `stones` is calculated as the maximum of 0 and the difference between the number of '+' operations and the number of '-' operations in the string `s`. 

The print statement does not modify any variables, it only outputs the value of `stones`. Therefore, the values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged, and `stones` is still equal to the maximum of 0 and the difference between the number of '+' operations and the number of '-' operations in `s`. 

However, the value of `stones` is printed, which means it is now known and can be considered as returned at the output state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range 1 <= `n` <= 100, `s` is a string equal to the user's input, `stones` is the maximum of 0 and the difference between the number of '+' operations and the number of '-' operations in `s`, and the value of `stones` has been returned.**
