The code introduces a new variable `stones` and initializes it to 0. The values of `n` and `s` are not affected by this code. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer in the range 1 <= n <= 100, `s` is a string equal to the user's input, `stones` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range 1 <= n <= 100, `s` is a string equal to the user's input, `stones` is 0**
