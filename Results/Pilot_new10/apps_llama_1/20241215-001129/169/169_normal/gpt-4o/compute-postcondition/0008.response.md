The code subtracts 1 from `stones` and assigns the maximum value between 0 and the result back to `stones`. Since `stones` is initially 0, subtracting 1 results in -1. However, the `max` function ensures that `stones` remains 0, as 0 is greater than -1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range 1 <= n <= 100, `s` is a string equal to the user's input that must have at least 1 character, `stones` is 0, `operation` is the first character in the string `s`, `operation` is not equal to '+', and the current value of `operation` is '-'**
