Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description. The problem states that Vasya performs operations on a pile of stones, either taking one stone from the pile or adding one stone to the pile, and the pile was non-empty before each operation of taking one stone from the pile. The task is to find the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after making these operations.

The given code simply calculates the difference between the number of '+' operations and the number of '-' operations in the string `s` and prints the maximum of 0 and this difference. This approach assumes that Vasya starts with 0 stones in the pile, which is not necessarily the case. The problem description states that the number of stones at the beginning can't be less than the number of '-' operations, because the pile will be empty if Vasya tries to take more stones than are available.

For example, if the input is `3` followed by `--+-`, the code will print `0`, which is incorrect because Vasya must start with at least 2 stones to be able to take 2 stones from the pile. The correct output for this case should be `1`, assuming Vasya starts with 2 stones and then takes 2 stones and adds 1 stone.

To correctly solve this problem, the code should consider the minimum number of stones Vasya must start with to perform all the operations without the pile being empty at any point. This can be done by iterating over the string `s` and keeping track of the minimum number of stones Vasya must have at each point to perform the next operation.
