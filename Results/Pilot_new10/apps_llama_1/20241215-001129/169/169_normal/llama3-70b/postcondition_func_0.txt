The function reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from the user, counts the '+' and '-' characters in `s`, and then prints 0 if there are more '-' characters than '+' characters; otherwise, it prints the difference between the count of '+' and '-' characters, without validating `n` or `s` against the implied constraints.
