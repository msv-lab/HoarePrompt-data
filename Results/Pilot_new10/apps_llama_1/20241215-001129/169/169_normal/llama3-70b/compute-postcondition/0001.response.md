The code `s = input()` updates the value of `s` to be the input string. The original `n` was a positive integer from 1 to 100, and the new `n` is the input integer. 

However, the value of `n` is not updated by the code, so its value remains the input integer. 

The string `s` now holds the newly input string. 

The length of `s` is no longer necessarily equal to the original `n`, but rather it is the length of the newly input string. 

The output state includes the updated value of `s` and the fact that `n` is an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string**
