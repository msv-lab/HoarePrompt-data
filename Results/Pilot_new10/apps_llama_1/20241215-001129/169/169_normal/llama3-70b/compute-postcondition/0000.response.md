The code takes an input and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The initial state implies that there are two input variables: `n` and `s`, where `n` is a positive integer from 1 to 100, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '+' and '-' characters.

After the code is executed, `n` is assigned the value of the input integer. The value of `s` is not affected by the code.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '+' and '-' characters, where the original `n` is a positive integer from 1 to 100, and the new `n` is the input integer**
