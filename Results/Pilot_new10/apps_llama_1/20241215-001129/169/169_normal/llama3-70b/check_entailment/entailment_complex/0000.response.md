Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Counting operations**: The problem states that Vasya has performed `n` operations, which are represented by a string `s` consisting of `n` symbols, either '+' or '-'. The program correctly reads the input `n` and `s` and counts the number of '+' and '-' characters in `s`.

2. **Calculating the minimal possible number of stones**: The problem asks for the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after making these operations. The program correctly calculates this by comparing the counts of '+' and '-' characters.

   - If there are more '-' characters than '+' characters, it means that Vasya has taken out more stones than he has added. In this case, the minimal possible number of stones in the pile would be 0, because Vasya cannot take out stones from an empty pile.
   
   - If there are not more '-' characters than '+' characters, it means that Vasya has added at least as many stones as he has taken out. In this case, the minimal possible number of stones in the pile would be the difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of '-' characters, which represents the net gain of stones.

3. **Output**: The program correctly prints the calculated minimal possible number of stones.

The program handles all possible cases, including when the number of '+' characters is greater than, less than, or equal to the number of '-' characters. It does not need to validate `n` or `s` against the implied constraints because the problem statement guarantees that `n` is a positive integer from 1 to 100 and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '+' and '-' characters.

In summary, the program always does what the problem description says, and it is correct.
