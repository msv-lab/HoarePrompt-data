Correctness: **True**

The program always does what the problem description says. Here's why:

1. The problem asks to find the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after making the operations. 
2. The program correctly calculates the number of '-' and '+' operations using the `count()` function.
3. If the number of '-' operations is greater than the number of '+' operations, it means that Vasya must have started with at least as many stones as the number of '-' operations. In this case, the minimum number of stones that can be left after the operations is 0, because Vasya could have started with exactly the number of stones that are taken away, leaving no stones at the end.
4. If the number of '-' operations is not greater than the number of '+' operations, it means that Vasya added at least as many stones as he took away. In this case, the minimum number of stones that can be left after the operations is the difference between the number of '+' and '-' operations, because this represents the net addition of stones to the pile.

The program correctly implements this logic, printing 0 in the first case and `plus_count - minus_count` in the second case. This ensures that the program always returns the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after making the operations, as required by the problem description.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including the edge cases where the number of '-' operations is equal to the number of '+' operations, or where the number of '+' operations is much greater than the number of '-' operations. In all cases, the program returns the correct minimum number of stones that can be left after the operations.
