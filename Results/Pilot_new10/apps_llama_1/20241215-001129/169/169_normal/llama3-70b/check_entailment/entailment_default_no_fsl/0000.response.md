Correctness: **True**

The code accurately implements the problem description. It reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from the user, counts the '+' and '-' characters in `s`, and then prints the minimum possible number of stones that can be in the pile after making the operations.

The code's logic is as follows: it checks if there are more '-' characters than '+' characters in the string `s`. If there are, it prints 0, because the minimum possible number of stones that can be in the pile is 0 (i.e., Vasya started with a number of stones equal to the number of '-' characters). If there are more or equal '+' characters, it prints the difference between the count of '+' and '-' characters, which represents the minimum possible number of stones that can be in the pile after making the operations (i.e., Vasya started with 0 stones and added more stones than he removed).

The code correctly handles the provided examples:

- For the input `3` and `---`, the output is `0`, which is correct because the minimum possible number of stones that can be in the pile is 0.
- For the input `4` and `++++`, the output is `4`, which is correct because the minimum possible number of stones that can be in the pile after making the operations is indeed 4.
- For the input `2` and `-+`, the output is `1`, which is correct because the minimum possible number of stones that can be in the pile after making the operations is indeed 1.
- For the input `5` and `++-++`, the output is `3`, which is correct because the minimum possible number of stones that can be in the pile after making the operations is indeed 3.

In all cases, the code's output matches the problem description's expected output, indicating that the code is correct for every potential case.
