Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases because it assumes that the initial number of stones in the pile is 0, which is not necessarily true according to the problem description. The problem states that the pile was non-empty before each operation of taking one stone from the pile, which means the initial number of stones should be at least equal to the number of '-' operations in the string.

For example, if the input is 3 and the string is "---", the program will output 0, which is correct. However, if the input is 3 and the string is "+--", the program will also output 0, which may not be the minimum possible number of stones in the pile. The correct minimum possible number of stones in the pile should be 1, because Vasya had to have at least 2 stones in the pile at the beginning to make the operations "+--" valid.

To fix this issue, the program should try different initial numbers of stones and calculate the final number of stones for each case, then return the minimum possible number of stones. 

Here is a possible correct implementation:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    min_stones = float('inf')
    for initial_stones in range(1, n + 1):
        stones = initial_stones
        valid = True
        for operation in s:
            if operation == '+':
                stones += 1
            elif operation == '-':
                stones -= 1
                if stones < 0:
                    valid = False
                    break
        if valid:
            min_stones = min(min_stones, stones)
    print(min_stones)
```
