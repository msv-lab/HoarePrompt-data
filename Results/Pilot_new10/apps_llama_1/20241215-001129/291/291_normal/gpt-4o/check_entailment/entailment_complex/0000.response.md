Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description. According to the problem description, the minimum number of segments that Sofia will have to draw with a ruler without a guide in order to draw n squares is achieved when she arranges the squares in a rectangle with sides of length a and b, where a is as close to the square root of n as possible.

However, the formula used in the provided program, `2 * (a + b)`, does not accurately represent the minimum number of segments that Sofia needs to draw. 

A correct approach would be to consider the arrangement of squares in a rectangle of size a x b, where a is the number of rows and b is the number of columns. The minimum number of segments to draw is `a + b + 2*(a-1) + 2*(b-1)`, but this can be simplified.

Sofia can draw the first column and the first row with a ruler, which requires `a + b` segments. Then, she can use the first column and the first row as a guide to draw the remaining segments. This approach ensures the minimum number of segments are drawn with a ruler.

Let's consider the total number of segments required. For each row, Sofia needs to draw `2` segments (one horizontal and one vertical) for the first square in the row, and then `2` segments for each additional square. For `b` squares in each row, this is `2*b` segments per row. However, the vertical segments in each row are shared with the horizontal segments in the column, so the number of segments can be reduced by considering the arrangement as a whole.

The correct formula is `2 * a + 2 * b - 2`, which represents the perimeter of the rectangle (minus the shared segments).

Here is the corrected code:

```python
import math

n = int(input().strip())
min_segments_needed = float('inf')
for a in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
    if n % a == 0:
        b = n // a
    else:
        b = (n + a - 1) // a
    
    segments_needed = 2 * a + 2 * b - 2
    
    min_segments_needed = min(min_segments_needed, segments_needed)

print(min_segments_needed)
```

However, to strictly follow the problem description and achieve optimal results, we should find the factors of `n` closest to each other, and use those as `a` and `b`. This can be done more efficiently:

```python
import math

n = int(input().strip())
min_diff = float('inf')
best_a, best_b = None, None

for a in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
    if n % a == 0:
        b = n // a
        diff = abs(a - b)
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
            best_a, best_b = a, b

segments_needed = 2 * best_a + 2 * best_b - 2

print(segments_needed)
```
