You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Little Sofia is in fourth grade. Today in the geometry lesson she learned about segments and squares. On the way home, she decided to draw $n$ squares in the snow with a side length of $1$. For simplicity, we assume that Sofia lives on a plane and can draw only segments of length $1$, parallel to the coordinate axes, with vertices at integer points.

In order to draw a segment, Sofia proceeds as follows. If she wants to draw a vertical segment with the coordinates of the ends $(x, y)$ and $(x, y+1)$. Then Sofia looks if there is already a drawn segment with the coordinates of the ends $(x', y)$ and $(x', y+1)$ for some $x'$. If such a segment exists, then Sofia quickly draws a new segment, using the old one as a guideline. If there is no such segment, then Sofia has to take a ruler and measure a new segment for a long time. Same thing happens when Sofia wants to draw a horizontal segment, but only now she checks for the existence of a segment with the same coordinates $x$, $x+1$ and the differing coordinate $y$.

For example, if Sofia needs to draw one square, she will have to draw two segments using a ruler:  [Image] 

After that, she can draw the remaining two segments, using the first two as a guide:  [Image] 

If Sofia needs to draw two squares, she will have to draw three segments using a ruler:  [Image] 

After that, she can draw the remaining four segments, using the first three as a guide:  [Image] 

Sofia is in a hurry, so she wants to minimize the number of segments that she will have to draw with a ruler without a guide. Help her find this minimum number.


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^{9}$), the number of squares that Sofia wants to draw.


-----Output-----

Print single integer, the minimum number of segments that Sofia will have to draw with a ruler without a guide in order to draw $n$ squares in the manner described above.

        b = (n + a - 1) // a
        segments_needed = 2 * (a + b)
        min_segments_needed = min(min_segments_needed, segments_needed)
    return min_segments_needed


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description requires that we draw $n$ squares in the snow with a side length of $1$ and find the minimum number of segments that Sofia will have to draw with a ruler without a guide.

However, upon closer inspection, we can see that the provided function `func_1(n)` does not correctly calculate the minimum number of segments needed. 

For example, the case where $n=3$ does not work correctly with this program. 

The program tries to minimize the number of segments drawn by assuming the arrangement of squares as an $a \times b$ grid where $a \times b = n$, but it simply does not consider that there could be other arrangements that minimize the number of segments drawn with a ruler. 

To correctly solve this problem, one needs to realize that the optimal arrangement of squares that minimizes the segments drawn is a grid with dimensions $a$ and $b$ such that $a \le b \le a + 1$. Also, the number of segments required to draw this grid is $2a + 2b - 2$. The provided program does not ensure that $a \le b \le a + 1$ and it does not correctly calculate the number of segments. 

Thus, this solution can be proven to be incorrect for certain cases, such as $n=3$, where a simple 1 by 3 arrangement (with 5 segments drawn) is optimal, but the provided function might return a value greater than 5 or less than 5. The reader should note, though, the minimum segments Sofia can draw is given by the mathematical formula $2\lceil\sqrt{n}\rceil$ or $2\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor + 1$ depending on whether $\sqrt{n}$ is an integer or not, a concept the given solution does not recognize or account for.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
n = int(input().strip())
print(func_1(n))

import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9.
def func_1(n):
    min_segments_needed = float('inf')
    for a in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        b = (n + a - 1) // a
        
        segments_needed = 2 * (a + b)
        
        min_segments_needed = min(min_segments_needed, segments_needed)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that `1 <= n <= 10^9`, `a` is `int(math.sqrt(n))`, `b` is `(n + int(math.sqrt(n)) - 1) // int(math.sqrt(n))`, `segments_needed` is `2 * (int(math.sqrt(n)) + (n + int(math.sqrt(n)) - 1) // int(math.sqrt(n)))`, and `min_segments_needed` is the minimum of all possible `2 * (a + (n + a - 1) // a)` for `a` ranging from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(n))`.
    return min_segments_needed
    #The program returns the minimum of all possible 2 * (a + (n + a - 1) // a) for 'a' ranging from 1 to the square root of 'n', where 'n' is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
