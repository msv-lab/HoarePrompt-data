To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `min_segments_needed` is positive infinity, `a` is 1.

The code is: `b = (n + a - 1) // a`

Since `a` is 1, we can substitute it into the equation:

`b = (n + 1 - 1) // 1`

`b = n // 1`

`b = n`

So, `b` is assigned the value of `n`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `min_segments_needed` is positive infinity, `a` is 1, `b` is equal to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `min_segments_needed` is positive infinity, `a` is 1, `b` is equal to `n`**
