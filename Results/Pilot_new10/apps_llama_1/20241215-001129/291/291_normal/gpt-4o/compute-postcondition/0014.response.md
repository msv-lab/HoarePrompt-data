The program returns `min_segments_needed` which is the minimum of all possible `2 * (a + (n + a - 1) // a)` for `a` ranging from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(n))`. Here, `n` is a positive integer such that `1 <= n <= 10^9` and `a` is `int(math.sqrt(n))`. 

Output State: **The program returns the minimum of all possible 2 * (a + (n + a - 1) // a) for 'a' ranging from 1 to the square root of 'n', where 'n' is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9**
