The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and calculates the minimum value of `2 * (a + (n + a - 1) // a)` for all possible values of `a` ranging from 1 to the square root of `n`. The code iterates over each possible value of `a` within this range, calculates the corresponding value of `b` as `(n + a - 1) // a`, and then determines the number of segments needed as `2 * (a + b)`. It keeps track of the minimum number of segments needed across all values of `a`. 

The function handles all cases where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9. It correctly calculates the minimum number of segments for all possible values of `a` within the specified range. The function does not have any missing logic or edge cases that would affect its correctness for the given range of `n`. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the minimum value of `2 * (a + (n + a - 1) // a)` for all possible values of `a` ranging from 1 to the square root of `n`, handling all cases where `n` is between 1 and 10^9. **
