You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: An accordion is a string (yes, in the real world accordions are musical instruments, but let's forget about it for a while) which can be represented as a concatenation of: an opening bracket (ASCII code $091$), a colon (ASCII code $058$), some (possibly zero) vertical line characters (ASCII code $124$), another colon, and a closing bracket (ASCII code $093$). The length of the accordion is the number of characters in it.

For example, [::], [:||:] and [:|||:] are accordions having length $4$, $6$ and $7$. (:|:), {:||:}, [:], ]:||:[ are not accordions. 

You are given a string $s$. You want to transform it into an accordion by removing some (possibly zero) characters from it. Note that you may not insert new characters or reorder existing ones. Is it possible to obtain an accordion by removing characters from $s$, and if so, what is the maximum possible length of the result?


-----Input-----

The only line contains one string $s$ ($1 \le |s| \le 500000$). It consists of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], : and |.


-----Output-----

If it is not possible to obtain an accordion by removing some characters from $s$, print $-1$. Otherwise print maximum possible length of the resulting accordion.


-----Examples-----
Input
|[a:b:|]

Output
4

Input
|]:[|:]

Output
-1
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is a string s consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, |, and its length is between 1 and 500000 (inclusive).
def func():
    s = input()
    n = len(s)
    ind = -1
    f = False
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '[':
            f = True
        elif s[i] == ':':
            if f:
                ind = i
                break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s`, `i` is the last index checked in `s`, `f` is True if an '[' was encountered before the loop ended, otherwise False, and `ind` is the index of the first ':' encountered after an '[', or -1 if such a sequence did not occur.
    bind = -1
    f = False
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if s[i] == ']':
            f = True
        elif s[i] == ':':
            if f:
                bind = i
                break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s`, `i` is -1, `f` is `True` if `s` contains at least one `']'`, `ind` is -1, and `bind` is the index of the first `':'` encountered after a `']'` from the end of `s`, or -1 if no such sequence exists.
    if (ind == -1 or bind == -1) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        if (ind >= bind) :
            print(-1)
        else :
            ans = 4
            for i in range(ind + 1, bind):
                if s[i] == '|':
                    ans += 1
                
            #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string of length `n` (1 to 500000) consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, |, `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is `bind - 1` if the loop executes and -1 otherwise, `f` is `True` if `s` contains at least one `']'`, `ind` and `bind` are not -1 with `ind < bind`, and `ans` is 4 plus the number of '|' characters in the substring of `s` from `ind + 1` to `bind - 1`.
            print(ans)
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s`, `i` is either -1 or `bind - 1` if the loop executes, `f` is `True` if `s` contains at least one `']'`, `ind` and `bind` are not -1, and either the value -1 has been printed when `ind` is greater than or equal to `bind`, or the value 4 plus the number of '|' characters in the substring of `s` from `ind + 1` to `bind - 1` has been returned at the output when `ind` is less than `bind`.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s`, `f` is `True` if `s` contains at least one `']'`. If `ind` is -1 or `bind` is -1, the program outputs -1, `i` remains -1. If `ind` and `bind` are not -1, then `i` is either -1 or `bind - 1`, and the program either outputs -1 when `ind` is greater than or equal to `bind`, or returns 4 plus the number of '|' characters in the substring of `s` from `ind + 1` to `bind - 1` when `ind` is less than `bind`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a string of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, |, and returns the count of '|' characters between the first ':' after a '[' and the first ':' before a ']' from the end, plus 4, or -1 if the specified sequence is not found or if the indices do not meet the required conditions.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
