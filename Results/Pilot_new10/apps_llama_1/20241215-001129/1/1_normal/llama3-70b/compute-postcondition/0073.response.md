To calculate the output state, let's first determine the initial value of `ans`. 

Given that before the if-else block, if `s[i]` is '|', then `ans` is 5, otherwise `ans` is 4. Then, if the current value of `s[i]` is '|', then `ans` is 6, otherwise if `s[i]` is not '|', then `ans` is 5.

Let's analyze the possibilities:

1. If `s[i]` is '|', then initially `ans` is 5, and after the if-else block, `ans` becomes 6.
2. If `s[i]` is not '|', then initially `ans` is 4, and after the if-else block, `ans` becomes 5.

Now, considering the given code `ans += 1`, we can calculate the new value of `ans`:

1. If `s[i]` is '|', then `ans` is 6 + 1 = 7.
2. If `s[i]` is not '|', then `ans` is 5 + 1 = 6.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s`, `i` is 2, `f` is `True` if `s` contains at least one `']'`, `ind` is less than `bind`, `bind` is greater than 2, `ind + 1` is less than or equal to 2, and if `s[i]` is '|', then `ans` is 7, otherwise `ans` is 6.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s`, `i` is 2, `f` is `True` if `s` contains at least one `']'`, `ind` is less than `bind`, `bind` is greater than 2, `ind + 1` is less than or equal to 2, and `ans` is 7 if `s[2]` is '|', otherwise `ans` is 6**
