Postcondition: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s`, between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `i` is 0, and the character at index `i` of `s` is either ':' or not ':'. If the character at index `i` of `s` is ':', then if `f` is True, `ind` is 0; if `f` is False, `ind` remains -1. If the character at index `i` of `s` is not ':', then the state remains unchanged as there is no else part to handle this condition.**
