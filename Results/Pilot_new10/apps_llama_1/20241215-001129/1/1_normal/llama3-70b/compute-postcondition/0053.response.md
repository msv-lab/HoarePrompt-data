The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. The `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s` and is at least 3, `i` is `n-3`, `bind` is `n-3`. 
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s` and is at least 3, `i` is `n-3`, `bind` is `n-3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
