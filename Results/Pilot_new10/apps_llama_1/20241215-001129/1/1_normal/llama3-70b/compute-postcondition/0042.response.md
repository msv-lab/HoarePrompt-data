Postcondition: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s` and is at least 1, `i` is `n-1`. If the character at the index `i` of `s` is ']', then `f` is `True`, `ind` is -1, and `bind` is -1. If the character at index `i` in `s` is ':' and `f` is `True`, then `ind` is -1, `bind` is `n-1`. If the character at index `i` in `s` is not ']' and not ':', or if `f` is `False`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged, with `f` still `False`, `ind` still -1, and `bind` still -1.**
