Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s`, between 2 and 500000 (inclusive), `i` is 1. If `s[1]` is ':', then if condition `f` is met, `ind` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[1]` is ':' and condition `f` is not met, or if `s[1]` is not ':', the state of the variables remains the same as in the precondition.***
