Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `ind` is the index of the first '[' character in `s`, `bind` is the index of the first ']' character from the end of `s`, `ind` is less than `bind`, if `s[i]` (where `i` is `ind + 2`) is ':', then `start_colon` is `ind + 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged***
