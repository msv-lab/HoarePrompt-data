The code `ind = i` assigns the value of `i` to the variable `ind`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1. 

The value of `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), and this does not change. The value of `n` is an integer greater than 1, and this also does not change.

Therefore, after executing the code, `ind` is equal to 1 (the value of `i`), `s` remains a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` remains an integer greater than 1, and `i` remains 1.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `ind` is 1**
