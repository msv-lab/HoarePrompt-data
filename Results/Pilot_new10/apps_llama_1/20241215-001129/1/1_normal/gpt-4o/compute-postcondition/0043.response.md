The code `break` does not change the values of any variables. It only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. 

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `ind` is the index of the first '[' character in `s`, `bind` is the index of the first ']' character from the end of `s`, `ind` is less than `bind`, `i` is `ind + 2`, `start_colon` is `ind + 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
