Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `ind` is the index of the first '[' character in `s` and not -1, `bind` is the index of the first ']' character from the end of `s` and not -1, `ind` is less than `bind`. If `s[i]` equals ':', then `start_colon` is `ind + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[i]` does not equal ':', then the state of `start_colon` remains unchanged and the loop or if statement continues.***
