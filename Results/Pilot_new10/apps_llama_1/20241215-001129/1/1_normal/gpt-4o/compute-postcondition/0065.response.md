Postcondition: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `ind` is the index of the first '[' character in `s`, `bind` is the index of the first ']' character from the end of `s`, `i` is `ind`, the current value of `start_colon` is the index of the first ':' character in `s` between `ind + 1` and `bind - 1` or -1 if no ':' character is found in the range, and the current value of `end_colon` is the index of the last ':' character in `s` between `bind - 1` and `ind` (inclusive) or -1 if no ':' character is found in this range. Additionally, either the first ':' character in the specified range does not exist (`start_colon == -1`), or the last ':' character in the specified range does not exist (`end_colon == -1`), or the index of the first ':' character is greater than or equal to the index of the last ':' character (`start_colon >= end_colon`).**
