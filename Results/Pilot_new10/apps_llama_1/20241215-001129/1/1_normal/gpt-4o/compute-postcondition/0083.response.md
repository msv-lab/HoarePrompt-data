Postcondition: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), if `ind` is -1 or `bind` is -1 or `ind` is greater than or equal to `bind`, then the value -1 has been printed. Otherwise, `ind` is the index of the first '[' character in `s`, `bind` is the index of the first ']' character from the end of `s`, and if `start_colon` is -1 or `end_colon` is -1 or `start_colon` is greater than or equal to `end_colon`, then -1 has been printed. If `start_colon` and `end_colon` are valid, then `start_colon` is the index of the first ':' character in `s` between `ind + 1` and `bind - 1`, `end_colon` is the index of the last ':' character in `s` between `bind - 1` and `ind` (inclusive), `i` is either -1 or `end_colon - 1` depending on the loop execution, `pipe_count` is the total number of '|' characters in the substring of `s` from `start_colon + 1` to `end_colon - 1`, and `result` is `4 + pipe_count`, with the value of `result` having been printed.**
