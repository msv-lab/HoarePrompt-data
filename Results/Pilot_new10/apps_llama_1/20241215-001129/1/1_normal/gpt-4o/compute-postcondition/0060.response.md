To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive).
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000 (inclusive).
- `ind` is the index of the first '[' character in `s`.
- `bind` is the index of the first ']' character from the end of `s` and `bind - 2` is greater than or equal to `ind`.
- `i` is `bind - 2`.
- If `s[i]` is ':', then `end_colon` is `bind - 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Loop statement:
```python
for i in range(bind - 1, ind, -1):
```
For the loop to execute one more time, we need to look at the range of the loop. The loop currently starts from `bind - 1` and goes down to `ind` in reverse order (`-1` step). 

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `bind - 2`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be decremented by 1 because the loop iterates in reverse order. So, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `bind - 3`.

The states of `s`, `n`, `ind`, and `bind` do not change within the loop as per the given information, so they remain the same.

However, considering the conditions and the loop statement, `i` is updated to `bind - 3` for the next iteration to begin.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `ind` is the index of the first '[' character in `s`, `bind` is the index of the first ']' character from the end of `s` and `bind - 3` is greater than or equal to `ind`, `i` is `bind - 3`**
