The `break` statement terminates the loop that it is currently inside. Since we are breaking out of the loop, the values of the variables do not change. 

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `ind` is either -1 or the index of the first '[' character in `s`, `i` is `n-1`, `bind` is `n-1`, the character at index `i` (`n-1`) in string `s` is ']', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
