Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not follow the problem description. The problem asks to determine the number of nodes Amr will visit before reaching the exit node by following a specific algorithm. However, the given program only calculates the number of nodes from the root to the exit node, which does not account for the backtracking and the rules specified in the algorithm.

The algorithm described in the problem involves sequentially executing the characters of the string "LRLRLRLRL..." and following specific rules for moving to the left child, right child, or back to the parent node. The program does not implement this algorithm and instead simply calculates the number of nodes from the root to the exit node based on the binary representation of the exit node.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should simulate the execution of the algorithm, keeping track of visited nodes and following the specified rules. The provided program does not meet this requirement, making it incorrect.

Here is a correct implementation in Python:

```python
def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    h, n = map(int, input().split())
    total_leaves = 2 ** h
    visited = set()
    node = 1
    commands = "LRLRLRLRL" * (h + 1)
    i = 0
    visited_count = 0

    while True:
        if node == 2 ** h + n - 1:
            break
        command = commands[i]
        if command == 'L':
            new_node = 2 * node
        else:
            new_node = 2 * node + 1

        if new_node in visited:
            i += 1
            if commands[i] == 'L':
                new_node = 2 * node
            else:
                new_node = 2 * node + 1
            if new_node in visited:
                node = node // 2
                visited_count += 1
            else:
                node = new_node
                visited.add(node)
                visited_count += 1
        else:
            visited.add(new_node)
            node = new_node
            visited_count += 1

        i = (i + 1) % len(commands)

    print(visited_count)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()
```

This corrected implementation simulates the execution of the algorithm and keeps track of visited nodes to calculate the correct number of nodes visited before reaching the exit node.
