Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description states that Amr follows a specific algorithm to choose the path in the binary tree, which involves executing a sequence of 'L' and 'R' commands, skipping commands if the destination node is already visited, going back to the parent node if two consecutive commands are skipped, and returning to the parent node if a leaf node is reached that is not the exit. However, the provided code simply traverses the binary tree based on the binary representation of `n-1`, which does not accurately represent the algorithm described in the problem.

In particular, the code does not account for the skipping of commands, going back to the parent node, or returning to the parent node, which are all crucial parts of the algorithm. As a result, the code does not correctly calculate the number of nodes visited before reaching the exit.

For example, if the input is `h = 2` and `n = 3`, the code will output `2`, but the correct output should be `5`, as Amr will visit the root node, the left child of the root, the right child of the root, the left child of the left child of the root, and finally the right child of the left child of the root (which is the exit node), before reaching the exit.
