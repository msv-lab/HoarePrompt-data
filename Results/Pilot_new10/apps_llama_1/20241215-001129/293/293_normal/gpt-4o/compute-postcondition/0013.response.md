Postcondition: ***`h` is an input integer greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `total_leaves` is equal to 2 raised to the power of `h`, `visited_count` is 1, `path` is a non-empty binary string, `current_level` is 0, if the `direction` is '0', then `current_node` is 1, otherwise `current_node` is 2 and `direction` is '1'.***
