Postcondition: **`h` is an input integer greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `total_leaves` is equal to 2 raised to the power of `h`, `visited_count` is 3, `path` is a binary string with at least one more character, `current_level` is 1, and if `direction` is '0', `current_node` is updated to `2 * (previous value of current_node) + 1`, otherwise `current_node` is updated to `2 * (previous value of current_node) + 2`.**
