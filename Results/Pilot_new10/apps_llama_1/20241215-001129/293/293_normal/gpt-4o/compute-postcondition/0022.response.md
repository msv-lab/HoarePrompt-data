To determine the output state, we first need to analyze the given code and its impact on the variables.

The code provided is:
```python
current_node = 2 * current_node + 2
```
However, the initial state does not specify the value of `current_node`. Since the task does not provide the initial value of `current_node`, we will consider it as an unknown variable in the initial state.

Given the initial state:
- `h` is an input integer greater than 0
- `n` is an input integer
- `total_leaves` is equal to 2 raised to the power of `h`
- `visited_count` is 5
- `path` is a binary string with at least one more character after the current character
- `current_level` is 2

And the code snippet:
- The value of `current_node` is updated based on its previous value, which is not specified in the initial state.

Considering the information provided and the code snippet, the output state is:
- `h` is an input integer greater than 0
- `n` is an input integer
- `total_leaves` is equal to 2 raised to the power of `h`
- `visited_count` is 5
- `path` is a binary string with at least one more character after the current character
- `current_level` is 2
- `current_node` is equal to 2 times its previous value plus 2, but its previous value is unknown.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
Output State: **`h` is an input integer greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `total_leaves` is equal to 2 raised to the power of `h`, `visited_count` is 5, `path` is a binary string with at least one more character after the current character, `current_level` is 2, `current_node` is 2 times its previous value plus 2**
