Postcondition: **`h` is an input integer greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `total_leaves` is equal to 2 raised to the power of `h`, `visited_count` is 5, `path` is a binary string with at least one more character after the current character, `current_level` is 2, and if `direction` is '0', then `current_node` is `2 * previous_value_of_current_node + 1`, otherwise `current_node` is `2 * previous_value_of_current_node + 2`.**
