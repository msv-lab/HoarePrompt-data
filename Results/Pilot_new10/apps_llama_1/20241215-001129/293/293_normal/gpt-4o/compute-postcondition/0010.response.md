The value of `current_node` is updated to be twice its previous value plus 1. The previous value of `current_node` was 0. 

So, `current_node` becomes 2 * 0 + 1 = 1.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is an input integer greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `total_leaves` is equal to 2 raised to the power of `h`, `visited_count` is 1, `path` is a non-empty binary string, `current_level` is 0, `current_node` is 1, `direction` is '0'.
