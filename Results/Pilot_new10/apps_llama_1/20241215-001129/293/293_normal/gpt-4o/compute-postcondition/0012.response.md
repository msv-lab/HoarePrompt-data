The value of `current_node` is updated to be `2 * current_node + 2`. Given that `current_node` is initially 0, the new value of `current_node` is `2 * 0 + 2`, which equals 2. 

Output State: **`h` is an input integer greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `total_leaves` is equal to 2 raised to the power of `h`, `visited_count` is 1, `path` is a non-empty binary string, `current_level` is 0, `current_node` is 2, `direction` is '1'**
