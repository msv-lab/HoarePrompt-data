The code `visited_count += 1` increments the value of `visited_count` by 1. 

Given the initial state: 
- `h` is an input integer greater than 0, 
- `n` is an input integer, 
- `total_leaves` is equal to 2 raised to the power of `h`, 
- `visited_count` is 0, 
- `path` is a non-empty binary string, 
- `current_level` is 0, 
- `current_node` is 0, 
- `direction` is the first character in the `path`.

The value of `visited_count` is increased by 1, so it becomes 1.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
- `h` is an input integer greater than 0, 
- `n` is an input integer, 
- `total_leaves` is equal to 2 raised to the power of `h`, 
- `visited_count` is 1, 
- `path` is a non-empty binary string, 
- `current_level` is 0, 
- `current_node` is 0, 
- `direction` is the first character in the `path`.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `total_leaves` is equal to 2 raised to the power of `h`, `visited_count` is 1, `path` is a non-empty binary string, `current_level` is 0, `current_node` is 0, `direction` is the first character in the `path`.**
