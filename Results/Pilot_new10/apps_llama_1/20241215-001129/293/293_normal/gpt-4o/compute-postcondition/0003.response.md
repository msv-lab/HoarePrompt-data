The code introduces a new variable `visited_count` and assigns it the value 0. The values of `h`, `n`, and `total_leaves` are not affected by this code.

Given that `total_leaves` is equal to 2 raised to the power of `h`, this relationship remains unchanged.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `total_leaves` is equal to 2 raised to the power of `h`, `visited_count` is 0**
