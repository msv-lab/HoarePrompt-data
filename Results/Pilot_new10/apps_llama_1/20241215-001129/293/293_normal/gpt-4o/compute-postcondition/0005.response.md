The code introduces a new variable `current_level` and assigns it the value 0. The previous values of the variables `h`, `n`, `total_leaves`, `visited_count`, and `path` are not affected.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `total_leaves` is equal to 2 raised to the power of `h`, `visited_count` is 0, `path` is a binary string representation of `n-1` with leading zeros to make its length `h`, and `current_level` is 0**
