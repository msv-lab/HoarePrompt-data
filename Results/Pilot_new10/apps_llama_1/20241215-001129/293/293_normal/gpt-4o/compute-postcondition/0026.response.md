The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. However, the problem description provides constraints for two integers `h` and `n`. Given the constraints that `1 ≤ h ≤ 50` and `1 ≤ n ≤ 2^h`, and considering that the function `func_1` does not explicitly accept these parameters, it seems there might be an oversight in the problem statement provided. 

For the purpose of providing a response based on the information given and following the format requested, let's reinterpret the task with the assumption that the function is actually defined to accept these parameters, as the description implies their relevance:

The function `func_1` would accept two parameters `h` and `n`, where `h` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), and `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 to the power of `h` (inclusive). 

However, without specific details on what the function returns based on these inputs, we cannot accurately describe its functionality regarding return values. Therefore, based on the given constraints and the typical structure of such problems, we should note that the return value description is missing.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters h and n, where h is an integer between 1 and 50, and n is an integer between 1 and 2^h, but the return values are not specified.**
