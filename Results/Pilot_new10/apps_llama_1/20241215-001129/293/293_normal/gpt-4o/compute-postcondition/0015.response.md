The value of `visited_count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `visited_count` is 2, so the new value of `visited_count` is 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`h` is an input integer greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `total_leaves` is equal to 2 raised to the power of `h`, `visited_count` is 3, `path` is a binary string with at least one more character, `current_level` is 1**
