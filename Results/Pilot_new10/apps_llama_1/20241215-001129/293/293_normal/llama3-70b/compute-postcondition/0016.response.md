To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state specifies that `h` is an input integer and `n` must have been greater than 4 before the division by 4. However, the given code does not involve `h` or any division by 4; it only involves `ans` and `n`.

Given the code `ans += n // 2`, we understand that the value of `ans` is increased by the integer division of `n` by 2.

Since `n` must have been greater than 4, let's consider the implications of this on `n // 2`. If `n` is greater than 4, then `n // 2` will be greater than 2.

However, the initial state does not specify the current value of `n` or `ans`, only that `n` was greater than 4 at some point before the division by 4, which is not directly relevant to the given code but implies `n` could be any integer greater than or equal to 1 after such a division (if it happened before this code snippet).

Therefore, after executing `ans += n // 2`, `ans` will have increased by half of `n`'s value (integer division), and `n` and `h` remain unchanged in value but we acknowledge `n`'s past condition.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer, `n` is an integer that was greater than 4 before a division by 4 (if such division occurred), `ans` is increased by `n // 2`.**
