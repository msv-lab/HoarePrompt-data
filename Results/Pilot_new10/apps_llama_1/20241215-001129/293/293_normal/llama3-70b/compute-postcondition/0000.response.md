To calculate the output state, we first consider the given initial state: `h` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, and `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 2^h.

The provided code snippet is:
```python
h, n = map(int, input().split())
```
This code snippet reads input from the user, splits it into two parts (assuming the input is separated by spaces), converts these parts into integers using `map(int,...)`, and then assigns these integer values to `h` and `n`, respectively.

Given the operation, the values of `h` and `n` are updated based on the user's input. However, the constraints that `h` is between 1 and 50 and `n` is between 1 and 2^h are not inherently enforced by this line of code. They could be violated depending on the input provided by the user.

Since we are not provided with specific input values for `h` and `n` but are instead asked to deduce the outcome based on the operation performed, we acknowledge that `h` and `n` are assigned new integer values from the user input.

The output state, considering the constraints might not hold after the input (since the code does not validate the input against the initial constraints), is that `h` and `n` are integers as input by the user, without any guarantee they fall within the initially specified ranges.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer**
