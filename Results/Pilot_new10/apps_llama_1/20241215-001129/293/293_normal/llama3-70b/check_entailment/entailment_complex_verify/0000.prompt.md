You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Amr bought a new video game "Guess Your Way Out!". The goal of the game is to find an exit from the maze that looks like a perfect binary tree of height h. The player is initially standing at the root of the tree and the exit from the tree is located at some leaf node. 

Let's index all the leaf nodes from the left to the right from 1 to 2^{h}. The exit is located at some node n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^{h}, the player doesn't know where the exit is so he has to guess his way out!

Amr follows simple algorithm to choose the path. Let's consider infinite command string "LRLRLRLRL..." (consisting of alternating characters 'L' and 'R'). Amr sequentially executes the characters of the string using following rules:  Character 'L' means "go to the left child of the current node";  Character 'R' means "go to the right child of the current node";  If the destination node is already visited, Amr skips current command, otherwise he moves to the destination node;  If Amr skipped two consecutive commands, he goes back to the parent of the current node before executing next command;  If he reached a leaf node that is not the exit, he returns to the parent of the current node;  If he reaches an exit, the game is finished. 

Now Amr wonders, if he follows this algorithm, how many nodes he is going to visit before reaching the exit?


-----Input-----

Input consists of two integers h, n (1 ≤ h ≤ 50, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^{h}).


-----Output-----

Output a single integer representing the number of nodes (excluding the exit node) Amr is going to visit before reaching the exit by following this algorithm.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 2

Output
2
Input
2 3

Output
5
Input
3 6

Output
10
Input
10 1024

Output
2046


-----Note-----

A perfect binary tree of height h is a binary tree consisting of h + 1 levels. Level 0 consists of a single node called root, level h consists of 2^{h} nodes called leaves. Each node that is not a leaf has exactly two children, left and right one. 

Following picture illustrates the sample test number 3. Nodes are labeled according to the order of visit.

Program:
```
def func():
    (h, n) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    while n > 1:
        if n % 2 == 0:
            ans += n // 2 - 1
        else:
            ans += n // 2
        n //= 2
    print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to be correct for the given problem description. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. The program starts by reading the input values `h` and `n`, which represent the height of the binary tree and the index of the exit node, respectively.

2. The `while` loop iterates until `n` becomes 1, effectively traversing the binary tree from the leaf node to the root.

3. Inside the loop, it checks whether `n` is even or odd. If `n` is even, it means the current node is a left child, so the program adds `n // 2 - 1` to the answer. This is because, in the command string "LRLRLRL...", an even `n` will result in visiting `n // 2 - 1` nodes on the left subtree before moving to the right subtree.

4. If `n` is odd, it means the current node is a right child, so the program adds `n // 2` to the answer. This is because, for an odd `n`, the program will visit `n // 2` nodes on the left subtree before moving to the right subtree.

5. After updating the answer, the program updates `n` by performing integer division by 2 (`n //= 2`). This effectively moves up the tree by one level.

6. Once the loop finishes, the program prints the answer, which represents the total number of nodes visited before reaching the exit node.

The provided program seems to cover all possible cases, and the examples given in the problem description match the output of the program. Without finding a counterexample, it's reasonable to conclude that the program is correct for all valid inputs.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: h is a positive integer between 1 and 50, and n is a positive integer between 1 and 2^h, representing the height of the binary tree and the index of the exit node, respectively.
def func():
    h, n = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    while n > 1:
        if n % 2 == 0:
            ans += n // 2 - 1
        else:
            ans += n // 2
        
        n //= 2
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `h` is the original input integer, `n` is 1, and `ans` is the sum of the contributions based on the parity of `n` at each halving step from its original value down to 1.
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes two integers, `h` and `n`, as input from the user, calculates a value `ans` based on the parity of `n` at each halving step until `n` reaches 1, and then prints `ans`. It assumes `h` and `n` are positive integers where `h` represents the height of a binary tree and `n` is an index within that tree, but does not validate these assumptions.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
