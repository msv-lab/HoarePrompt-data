Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Incorrect logic**: The program simply counts the total number of lowercase letters in the string and prints it. However, the problem requires finding the maximum number of elements in a "pretty set" of positions, where a pretty set is defined as a set of positions that meet two conditions: (1) the letters at these positions are distinct and lowercase, and (2) there are no uppercase letters between any two positions in the set.

2. **Lack of consideration for distinct letters**: The program does not ensure that the letters at the positions in the set are distinct. It simply counts all lowercase letters.

3. **Lack of consideration for no uppercase letters between positions**: The program does not check if there are any uppercase letters between the positions in the set. It only counts the lowercase letters and prints their total count.

4. **No attempt to find the maximum size of a pretty set**: The program does not even attempt to find the maximum size of a pretty set by considering different combinations of positions.

To correctly solve this problem, the program should iterate over all possible combinations of positions in the string and check if each combination meets the conditions for a pretty set. It should then keep track of the maximum size of a pretty set found so far.

Here's an example of a correct implementation in Python:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    max_size = 0

    for mask in range(1 << n):
        positions = [i for i in range(n) if (mask & (1 << i))]
        if not positions:
            continue

        # Check if letters at positions are distinct and lowercase
        letters = [s[i] for i in positions]
        if not all(c.islower() for c in letters) or len(set(letters))!= len(letters):
            continue

        # Check if there are no uppercase letters between positions
        valid = True
        for i in range(len(positions) - 1):
            for j in range(positions[i] + 1, positions[i + 1]):
                if s[j].isupper():
                    valid = False
                    break
            if not valid:
                break

        if valid:
            max_size = max(max_size, len(positions))

    print(max_size)
```
This corrected implementation iterates over all possible combinations of positions in the string (represented as a bitmask), checks if each combination meets the conditions for a pretty set, and keeps track of the maximum size of a pretty set found so far.
