The code increments `current_count` by 1. The previous value of `current_count` is 0. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200, `s` is a string of length `n` that must have at least 1 character, `max_count` is 0, `current_set` is a set containing the first character in the string `s`, `current_count` is 1, and the current value of `char` is the first character in the string `s` which is a lowercase letter and is in `current_set`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200, `s` is a string of length `n` that must have at least 1 character, `max_count` is 0, `current_set` is a set containing the first character in the string `s`, `current_count` is 1, and `char` is the first character in `s` which is a lowercase letter and is in `current_set`**
