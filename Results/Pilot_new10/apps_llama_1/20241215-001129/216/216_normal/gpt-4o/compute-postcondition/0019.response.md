Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200, `s` is considered from the next character onwards and must have at least one more character, `char` will be the next character in the updated `s`. If `char` is not in `current_set`, then `current_set` includes the current `char`, `current_count` is incremented by 1, and `max_count` remains the same.***
