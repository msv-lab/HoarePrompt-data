Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200, `s` is considered from the next character onwards and must have at least one more character, `char` will be the next character in the updated `s`. If `char` is lowercase, then `current_set` includes the current `char` if it was not already present, `current_count` is incremented by 1 if `char` was not in `current_set`, and `max_count` remains the same. If `char` is not lowercase, then `current_set` is reset to empty, `current_count` is reset to 0, and `max_count` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and the previous value of `current_count`.**
