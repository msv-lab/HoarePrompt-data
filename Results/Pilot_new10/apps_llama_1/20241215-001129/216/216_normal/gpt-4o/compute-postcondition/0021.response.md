The code `current_set.clear()` clears the elements of `current_set`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200, `s` is considered from the next character onwards and must have at least one more character, `char` will be the next character in `s`, `current_set` is empty, `current_count` remains the same, and `max_count` is the maximum of its previous value and `current_count`.**
