Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200, `s` must have at least one more character, `char` will be the next character in the updated `s`. If `char` is lowercase, then if `char` is not in `current_set`, `char` is added to `current_set` and `current_count` is increased by 1. If `char` is not lowercase, then `max_count` remains its previous value, `current_count` is 0, and `current_set` is empty***
