The value of `current_count` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200, `s` must have at least one more character, `char` is the next character in the updated `s`, `current_set` includes `char`, and `current_count` is increased by 1.
