The given code is `n = int(input())`. This line of code reads an input from the user, converts it to an integer, and stores it in the variable `n`.

Given the initial state, we know that the input consists of two lines, but the code provided only reads the first line, which contains a positive integer `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200 (inclusive), the second line of input, a string `s` of length `n`, has not been read yet and is still pending as the next input to be processed**
