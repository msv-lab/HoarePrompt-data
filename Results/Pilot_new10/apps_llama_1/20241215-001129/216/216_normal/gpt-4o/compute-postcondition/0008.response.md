The code `current_set.add(char)` adds the current character `char` to the `current_set`. 

Since `char` is not in `current_set` initially and it is added to the set, `char` is now in `current_set`. 

Also, since `current_set` was empty initially and `char` is added to it, `current_set` now contains one element which is `char`.

No other variables are affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200, `s` is a string of length `n` that must have at least 1 character, `max_count` is 0, `current_set` is a set containing the first character in the string `s`, `current_count` is 0, and the current value of `char` is the first character in the string `s` which is a lowercase letter and is in `current_set`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200, `s` is a string of length `n` that must have at least 1 character, `max_count` is 0, `current_set` is a set containing the first character in the string `s`, `current_count` is 0, and the current value of `char` is the first character in the string `s` which is a lowercase letter and is in `current_set`.**
