Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay can use to cook the compote, given the ratio of 1:2:4. The key to the solution lies in finding the minimum number of lemons that can be used, which is constrained by the available number of lemons, apples, and pears.

The line `max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)` calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used, considering the available number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`). The `//` operator is used for integer division, which ensures that the number of apples and pears is an integer multiple of the required ratio.

The total number of fruits is then calculated as `max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`, which corresponds to the number of lemons, apples, and pears used, respectively.

The program correctly handles all potential cases, including the examples provided. For instance, in the first example, `a = 2`, `b = 5`, and `c = 7`, the program correctly calculates `max_lemons = 1` and outputs `7`, which is the total number of fruits used (`1` lemon, `2` apples, and `4` pears).

In the second example, `a = 4`, `b = 7`, and `c = 13`, the program correctly calculates `max_lemons = 3` and outputs `21`, which is the total number of fruits used (`3` lemons, `6` apples, and `12` pears).

In the third example, `a = 2`, `b = 3`, and `c = 2`, the program correctly calculates `max_lemons = 0` and outputs `0`, since there are not enough pears to cook the compote.

After analyzing the code and testing it with various inputs, I couldn't find any case where the program fails to produce the correct output. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
