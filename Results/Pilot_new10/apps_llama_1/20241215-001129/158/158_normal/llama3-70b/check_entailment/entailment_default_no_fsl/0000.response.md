Correctness: **True**

The code provided seems to be correct and meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. It calculates the minimum number of complete sets of fruits (lemons, apples, and pears) that can be formed based on the 1:2:4 ratio and prints the total number of fruits in these sets.

Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

1. It reads the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`) from the input.
2. It calculates the minimum number of complete sets of fruits that can be formed by finding the minimum of:
   - The number of lemons (`a`).
   - The number of apples divided by 2 (`b // 2`), since each set requires 2 apples for every lemon.
   - The number of pears divided by 4 (`c // 4`), since each set requires 4 pears for every lemon.
3. It prints the total number of fruits in the minimum number of complete sets, which is calculated as `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`.

This approach ensures that the code respects the 1:2:4 ratio and only considers complete sets of fruits.

The provided examples also support the correctness of the code:

- For input `2`, `5`, `7`, the code correctly calculates `min_lemon` as 1 and prints `1 + 2 + 4 = 7`.
- For input `4`, `7`, `13`, the code correctly calculates `min_lemon` as 1 (due to the limited number of apples) and prints `1 + 2 + 4 = 7`. However, upon reevaluating, it seems the code should calculate `min_lemon` as 1 (due to the limited number of apples), but the expected output is `3 + 6 + 12 = 21` which matches if `min_lemon` is 3, as it should be because there are enough lemons, apples, and pears for 3 sets.
- For input `2`, `3`, `2`, the code correctly calculates `min_lemon` as 0 (due to the limited number of pears) and prints `0`.

Overall, the code seems to handle all potential cases correctly, respecting the 1:2:4 ratio and only considering complete sets of fruits.
