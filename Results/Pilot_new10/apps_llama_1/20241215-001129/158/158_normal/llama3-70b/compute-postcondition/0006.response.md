The function `func` accepts three positive integers `a`, `b`, and `c` as input, representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears respectively, such that 1 <= a <= 1000, 1 <= b <= 1000, and 1 <= c <= 1000. 

Although the annotations state that the ratio of lemons, apples, and pears is 1:2:4, the code does not enforce this ratio. Instead, it calculates the minimum number of "sets" of lemons, apples, and pears that can be formed, where each set contains 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears. 

The code calculates `min_lemon` as the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, which represents the maximum number of complete sets that can be formed with the given inputs. 

It then prints the total number of fruits in these sets, which is `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`. 

This calculation does not consider any potential edge cases where the inputs may not follow the 1:2:4 ratio. 

The function does not handle cases where the inputs are not positive integers or are outside the specified range. 

The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the result directly.

Functionality: ** The function accepts three positive integers representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears, calculates the minimum number of complete sets of fruits that can be formed, and prints the total number of fruits in these sets, without enforcing the 1:2:4 ratio or handling invalid inputs. **
