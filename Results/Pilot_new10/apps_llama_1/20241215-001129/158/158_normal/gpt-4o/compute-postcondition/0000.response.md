The value of `a` is updated to be an input integer. The initial conditions that `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b`, `c` <= 1000 still hold for `b` and `c`, but `a` is now an input integer. The ratio of lemons to apples to pears should be 1:2:4, which implies `b` = 2 * `a` and `c` = 4 * `a`. 

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is 2 times `a`, `c` is 4 times `a`, and `a`, `b`, `c` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a` <= 1000, 2 <= `b` <= 2000, 4 <= `c` <= 4000**
