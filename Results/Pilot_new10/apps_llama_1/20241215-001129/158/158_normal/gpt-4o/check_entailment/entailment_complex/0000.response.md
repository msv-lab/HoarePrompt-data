Correctness: **True**

The program does what the problem description asks for in every potential case. 

Here's why:

1. The program first takes the input for the number of lemons, apples, and pears.
2. It then calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used in the compote while maintaining the 1:2:4 ratio. This is done by finding the minimum of the number of lemons available, half of the number of apples available, and a quarter of the number of pears available. This is because for each lemon, there must be 2 apples and 4 pears.

   The line `max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)` correctly implements this logic.

3. After finding the maximum number of lemons that can be used, the program calculates the total number of fruits that can be used. Since the ratio of lemons to apples to pears is 1:2:4, the total number of fruits is 7 times the number of lemons (1 lemon + 2 apples + 4 pears).

   The line `total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4` correctly calculates the total number of fruits.

4. Finally, the program prints the total number of fruits that can be used to make the compote, which is the required output.

The program handles all valid inputs correctly, including edge cases such as when the number of lemons, apples, or pears is less than the required amount for the ratio. In such cases, it correctly prints 0 because the `min` function returns 0 if any of the inputs is 0, and the total number of fruits is calculated based on this value.

Overall, the program accurately implements the logic required by the problem description and produces the correct output for all valid inputs.
