You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Nikolay has a lemons, b apples and c pears. He decided to cook a compote. According to the recipe the fruits should be in the ratio 1: 2: 4. It means that for each lemon in the compote should be exactly 2 apples and exactly 4 pears. You can't crumble up, break up or cut these fruits into pieces. These fruits — lemons, apples and pears — should be put in the compote as whole fruits.

Your task is to determine the maximum total number of lemons, apples and pears from which Nikolay can cook the compote. It is possible that Nikolay can't use any fruits, in this case print 0. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains the positive integer a (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000) — the number of lemons Nikolay has. 

The second line contains the positive integer b (1 ≤ b ≤ 1000) — the number of apples Nikolay has. 

The third line contains the positive integer c (1 ≤ c ≤ 1000) — the number of pears Nikolay has.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum total number of lemons, apples and pears from which Nikolay can cook the compote.


-----Examples-----
Input
2
5
7

Output
7

Input
4
7
13

Output
21

Input
2
3
2

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example Nikolay can use 1 lemon, 2 apples and 4 pears, so the answer is 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.

In the second example Nikolay can use 3 lemons, 6 apples and 12 pears, so the answer is 3 + 6 + 12 = 21.

In the third example Nikolay don't have enough pears to cook any compote, so the answer is 0.
Program:
```
def func():
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    c = int(input())
    max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
    total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4
    print(total_fruits)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay can use to cook the compote, given the ratio of 1:2:4. The key to the solution lies in finding the minimum number of lemons that can be used, which is constrained by the available number of lemons, apples, and pears.

The line `max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)` calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used, considering the available number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`). The `//` operator is used for integer division, which ensures that the number of apples and pears is an integer multiple of the required ratio.

The total number of fruits is then calculated as `max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`, which corresponds to the number of lemons, apples, and pears used, respectively.

The program correctly handles all potential cases, including the examples provided. For instance, in the first example, `a = 2`, `b = 5`, and `c = 7`, the program correctly calculates `max_lemons = 1` and outputs `7`, which is the total number of fruits used (`1` lemon, `2` apples, and `4` pears).

In the second example, `a = 4`, `b = 7`, and `c = 13`, the program correctly calculates `max_lemons = 3` and outputs `21`, which is the total number of fruits used (`3` lemons, `6` apples, and `12` pears).

In the third example, `a = 2`, `b = 3`, and `c = 2`, the program correctly calculates `max_lemons = 0` and outputs `0`, since there are not enough pears to cook the compote.

After analyzing the code and testing it with various inputs, I couldn't find any case where the program fails to produce the correct output. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts three positive integers as input, calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used to make a compote with a 1:2:4 ratio of lemons to apples to pears, calculates the total number of fruits that can be used to make the compote, and prints this total, without explicitly handling invalid inputs or input ranges. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
