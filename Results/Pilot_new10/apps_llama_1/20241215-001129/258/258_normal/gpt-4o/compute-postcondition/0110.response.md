The code snippet `continue` does not modify any variables or change their values. It simply skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is at least 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are based on the comparison of `c1 * T` and `c2 * T`, `d` is `T / c2 - T / c1`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `((x1 - x2) * (x1 - x2) + (y1 - y2) * (y1 - y2)) / 4`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop**
