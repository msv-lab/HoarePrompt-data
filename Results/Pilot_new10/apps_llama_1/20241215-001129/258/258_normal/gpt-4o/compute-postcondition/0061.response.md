The value of `d2` is calculated as the sum of the squares of `dx` and `dy`. Since `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2` and `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` becomes `((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2)`. This simplifies to `((x1 - x2) ** 2 + (y1 - y2) ** 2) / 4`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples with at least 1 piece of meat, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than 3, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are defined based on the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T`, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `d` is `d` divided by `c1 * c2`, `(c1 - c2) * T` is not less than 0, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, and `d2` is `((x1 - x2) ** 2 + (y1 - y2) ** 2) / 4`**
