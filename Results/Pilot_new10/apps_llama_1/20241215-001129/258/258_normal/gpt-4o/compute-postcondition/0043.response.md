The code calculates `mx` as `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`. Given that `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2) / 4`, and assuming `d` is a variable that is implied to be involved in the calculation but its exact nature or value isn't specified in the initial conditions provided, we'll consider it as part of the formula directly.

The values of `meats`, `K`, `T`, `N`, `i`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, and `d2` are not changed by this line of code. The new variable `mx` is introduced, and it's calculated based on the existing values.

Given the initial state:
- `meats` is a list of tuples with at least 1 piece of meat,
- `K` is a positive integer,
- `T` is a non-negative real number,
- `N` is greater than 2,
- `i` is 0,
- `j` is 2,
- `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the values of `meats[j]`,
- `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the values of `meats[0]`,
- `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`,
- `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`,
- `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`,
- `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`,
- `d2` is `((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2) / 4`,
- The condition regarding `d * d2` being less than or equal to `d2` does not directly influence the output state here since `mx` calculation assumes a specific scenario where this condition might not be directly applicable or its outcome does not alter the existence or values of the given variables.

The introduction of `mx` with its calculated value does not change the values of the existing variables but adds a new variable to the state.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`meats` is a list of tuples with at least 1 piece of meat, 
`K` is a positive integer, 
`T` is a non-negative real number, 
`N` is greater than 2, 
`i` is 0, 
`j` is 2, 
`x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the values of `meats[j]`, 
`x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the values of `meats[0]`, 
`cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, 
`cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, 
`dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, 
`dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, 
`d2` is `((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2) / 4`, 
and `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples with at least 1 piece of meat, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the values of `meats[j]`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the values of `meats[0]`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2) / 4`, and `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`**
