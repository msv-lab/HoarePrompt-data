Postcondition: ***`meats` is potentially modified, `K` retains its initial value, `T` retains its initial value, `N` is greater than 5, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, `cx` is `(meats[3] + meats[5]) / 2`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the values of the 5th or 3rd element of `meats` based on the comparison, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the values of the 3rd or 5th element of `meats` based on the comparison, `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, and `d2` is `((x1 - x2) / 2)^2 + ((y1 - y2) / 2)^2`. If `d * d2` is greater than `d2`, we move to the next iteration of the loop. Since there is no else part, if `d * d2` is not greater than `d2`, the program will terminate or continue to the next statement without any modification.***
