Postcondition: **`meats` is potentially modified, `K` retains its initial value, `T` retains its initial value, `N` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the old values of the 4th element of `meats`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the old values of the 3rd element of `meats`, `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2)`, `mx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2 + (y1 - y2) / 2 * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `my` is `(y1 + y2) / 2 - (x1 - x2) / 2 * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, the current value of `count` is the sum of all elements in `meats` where `c * math.sqrt((mx - x)**2 + (my - y)**2) >= 1` and this `count` is greater than or equal to `K`.**
