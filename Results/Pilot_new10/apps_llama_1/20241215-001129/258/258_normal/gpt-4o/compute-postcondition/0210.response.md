The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `meats`, `K`, and `T`. `meats` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers representing the coordinates and hardness of a piece of meat. `K` is a positive integer representing the minimum number of pieces of meat to be ready. `T` is a non-negative real number representing the time within which the pieces of meat should be ready.

After executing the function body, the function returns a boolean value. However, the problem description does not provide a clear condition for returning `True` or `False` based on the input parameters `meats`, `K`, and `T`. 

Given the information about the cases, it seems that the function returns `True` for most cases, and `False` for Case_10. But the specific conditions for these cases are not provided, making it difficult to give a precise description of the functionality.

However, based on the given information, the functionality of the function `func_1` can be described as follows:
Functionality: **The function accepts a list of meat pieces with their coordinates and hardness, a minimum number of pieces to be ready, and a time within which the pieces should be ready, and returns a boolean value indicating whether a certain condition related to the meat pieces has been met.**
