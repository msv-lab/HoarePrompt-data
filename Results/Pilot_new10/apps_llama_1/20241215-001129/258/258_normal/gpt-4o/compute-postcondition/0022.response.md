The code increments the `index` variable by 3. The previous value of `index` was at least 15. 

After the increment, `index` becomes `index + 3`, which is at least 18. The values of `N`, `K`, `meats`, `data`, `x`, `y`, and `c` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is at least 3, `K` is `int(data[1])`, `meats` includes the tuple `(int(data[index-3]), int(data[index-2]), int(data[index-1]))` in addition to its previous values, `data` remains the same, `index` is at least 18, `x` is `int(data[index-3])`, `y` is `int(data[index-2])`, and `c` is `int(data[index-1])`**
