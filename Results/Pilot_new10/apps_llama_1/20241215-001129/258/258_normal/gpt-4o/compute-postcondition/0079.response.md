The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of any variables. 

Given the initial state:
- `meats` is a list of tuples
- `K` is a positive integer
- `T` is a non-negative real number
- `N` must be at least 3
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 2
- The current values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are determined by the condition that if `c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T`, then `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the values of the third tuple in `meats` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the values of the second tuple in `meats`, otherwise `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the values of the second tuple in `meats` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the values of the third tuple in `meats`.
- `d` is `(c1 - c2) * T`, and the current value of `d` is less than 0.

After executing `continue`, all variable values remain the same because `continue` does not modify variables; it only controls the flow within loops.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` must be at least 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the values of the second and third tuples in `meats` based on the condition that if `c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T`, then `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the values of the third tuple in `meats` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the values of the second tuple in `meats`, otherwise `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the values of the second tuple in `meats` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the values of the third tuple in `meats`, `d` is `(c1 - c2) * T` and `d` is less than 0, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
