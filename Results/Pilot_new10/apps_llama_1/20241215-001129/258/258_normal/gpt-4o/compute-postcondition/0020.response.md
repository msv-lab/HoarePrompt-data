The value of `c` is updated to `int(data[index + 2])`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is at least 3, `K` remains as `int(data[1])`, `meats` is updated to include another tuple based on the next elements in `data`, `data` remains the same, `index` is at least 15, `x` is `int(data[index])`, `y` is `int(data[index + 1])`, and `c` is `int(data[index + 2])`.
