The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code in the current loop iteration and moves on to the next iteration. Given the initial state, the values of the variables are not changed directly by the `continue` statement. 

Since `i` is 0 and `j` is 2, and considering the conditions that define the values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, and the `count`, the `continue` statement does not affect these values directly. 

However, the `continue` statement implies that the current loop iteration is skipped, which might affect the values of `i` and `j` in the next iteration, depending on the loop construct. But based on the information given, the loop construct is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact values of `i` and `j` after the `continue` statement.

Given the initial state and the effect of the `continue` statement, the values of `meats`, `K`, `T`, `N`, `d`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, and `count` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples with at least 1 piece of meat, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`, if `c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T`, then `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the values of `meats[j]` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the values of `meats[0]`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2` are updated accordingly, and `mx` and `my` are functions of the updated `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, and `d`, the `count` is a sum that depends on the updated `mx`, `my`, and the elements of `meats`, and the count is less than `K`, else the state of the program remains unchanged, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
