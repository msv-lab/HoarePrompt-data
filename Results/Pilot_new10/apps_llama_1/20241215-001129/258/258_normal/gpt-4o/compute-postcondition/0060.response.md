To calculate the output state, we need to understand the impact of the given code on the program. The given code is `dy = (y1 - y2) / 2`. 

This code snippet assigns the value of the difference between `y1` and `y2` divided by 2 to the variable `dy`. 

Given the initial state:
- `meats` is a list of tuples with at least 1 piece of meat
- `K` is a positive integer
- `T` is a non-negative real number
- `N` is greater than 3
- `x1`, `y1`, `c1` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are defined based on the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T`
- `i` is 0
- `j` is 3
- `d` is `d` divided by `c1 * c2`
- `(c1 - c2) * T` is not less than 0
- `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`
- `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`
- `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`

The code only affects the variable `dy`, which is assigned the value `(y1 - y2) / 2`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples with at least 1 piece of meat, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than 3, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are defined based on the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T`, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `d` is `d` divided by `c1 * c2`, `(c1 - c2) * T` is not less than 0, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, and `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`**
