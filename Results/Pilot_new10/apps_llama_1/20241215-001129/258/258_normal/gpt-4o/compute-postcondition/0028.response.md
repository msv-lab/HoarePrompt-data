To solve this problem, let's consider the given code snippet and the initial state provided.


Given the initial state and the code snippet:
```python
x1, y1, c1 = meats[i]
```

Given that `i` is 0, we are essentially extracting the first tuple from the `meats` list and assigning its values to `x1`, `y1`, and `c1`.


The values of `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` after the execution will be the values of the first tuple in the `meats` list.


Considering the initial state:
- `meats` is a list of tuples with at least 1 piece of meat,
- `K` is a positive integer,
- `T` is a non-negative real number,
- `N` is greater than 2,
- `i` is 0,
- `j` is 2,
- `x2`, `y2`, `c2` remain as they were after any possible swap,
- `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`,
- `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`,
- `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`,
- `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`,
- `d2` is `((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2) / 4`,
- `d` is `d / (c1 * c2)` if the product of the current value of `d` and `d2` is greater than `d2`,
- `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`,
- `my` is `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`,
- `count` is the sum of `c * math.sqrt((mx - x)^2 + (my - y)^2)` over all tuples in `meats`, and the count is less than `K`.


The only variables that change are `x1`, `y1`, and `c1`, which are assigned the values of the first tuple in `meats`.


Thus, `x1` equals the first element of `meats[0]`, `y1` equals the second element of `meats[0]`, and `c1` equals the third element of `meats[0]`.


The rest of the variables retain their initial state values or expressions.


Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples with at least 1 piece of meat, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `x1` equals the first element of `meats[0]`, `y1` equals the second element of `meats[0]`, `c1` equals the third element of `meats[0]`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` remain as they were after any possible swap, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2) / 4`, `d` is `d / (c1 * c2)` if the product of the current value of `d` and `d2` is greater than `d2`, `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `my` is `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `count` is the sum of `c * math.sqrt((mx - x)^2 + (my - y)^2)` over all tuples in `meats`, and the count is less than `K`**
