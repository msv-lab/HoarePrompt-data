To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `N` is `int(data[0])` and must be greater than 0.
- `K` is `int(data[1])`.
- `meats` is an empty list `[]`.
- `data` is a list of input strings split by spaces where `data[0]` can be converted to an integer greater than 0.
- `index` is 2.
- `x` is `int(data[2])`.

The code to be executed is:
```python
y = int(data[index + 1])
```

Given that `index` is 2, `index + 1` equals 3. Therefore, `y` is assigned the value of `int(data[3])`, which means `y` is the integer conversion of the fourth element in the `data` list (since indexing starts at 0).

The output state, considering the changes and the initial state information, is:
- `N` is `int(data[0])` and must be greater than 0.
- `K` is `int(data[1])`.
- `meats` is an empty list `[]`.
- `data` is a list of input strings split by spaces where `data[0]` can be converted to an integer greater than 0.
- `index` is 2.
- `x` is `int(data[2])`.
- `y` is `int(data[3])`.

Output State: **`N` is `int(data[0])` and must be greater than 0, `K` is `int(data[1])`, `meats` is an empty list `[]`, `data` is a list of input strings split by spaces where `data[0]` can be converted to an integer greater than 0, `index` is 2, `x` is `int(data[2])`, and `y` is `int(data[3])`.**
