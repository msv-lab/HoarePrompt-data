Postcondition: **`meats` is a list of tuples with at least 1 piece of meat, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2. If `c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T`, then `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are updated to the values of `meats[j]` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are updated to the values of `meats[0]`. The values of `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, and `d` are updated accordingly, and `mx` and `my` are functions of the updated `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, and `d`. The `count` is a sum that depends on the updated `mx`, `my`, and the elements of `meats`, and the count is less than `K`. If `c1 * T` is not less than `c2 * T`, then the state of the program remains unchanged.**
