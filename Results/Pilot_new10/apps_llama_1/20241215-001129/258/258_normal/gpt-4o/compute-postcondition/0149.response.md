Postcondition: **`meats` is potentially modified, `K` and `T` retain their initial values, `N` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`, if `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then the current values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the old values of the 4th element of `meats`, the current values of `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the old values of the 3rd element of `meats`, otherwise the current values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the values of the 3rd element of `meats`, the current values of `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the values of the 4th element of `meats`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, `count` hold values based on the previous iteration of the loop or remain unchanged, and since `d` is less than 0, it implies that `c1 * T < c2 * T`, and the program moves to the next iteration of the loop.**
