Postcondition: ***`meats` is a list of tuples with at least 1 piece of meat, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than 3, if `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then `x1`, `y1`, `c1` equal the old values of `meats[3]` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` equal the old values of `meats[0]`, otherwise `x1`, `y1`, `c1` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` remain as initially defined, and other variables (`cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, `i`, `j`) retain their initial values based on the condition, `i` is 0, `j` is 3.***
