The code `meats = []` assigns an empty list to the variable `meats`. This overwrites the previous value of `meats`, which was a list of `N` tuples. The values of `N`, `K`, and `data` are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`N` is `int(data[0])`, `K` is `int(data[1])`, `meats` is an empty list `[]`, and `data` is a list of input strings split by spaces.**
