The value of `cx` is assigned as the average of `x1` and `x2`. The previous values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` were based on the condition that if `c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T`, then `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the values of the third tuple in `meats` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the values of the second tuple in `meats`, otherwise `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the values of the second tuple in `meats` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the values of the third tuple in `meats`. 
The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` must be at least 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the values of either the second or third tuple in `meats` based on the condition that if `c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T`, then `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the values of the third tuple in `meats` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the values of the second tuple in `meats`, otherwise `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the values of the second tuple in `meats` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the values of the third tuple in `meats`, `d` is `((c1 - c2) * T) / (c1 * c2)` and `d` is greater than or equal to 0, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` must be at least 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the values of either the second or third tuple in `meats` based on the condition that if `c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T`, then `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the values of the third tuple in `meats` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the values of the second tuple in `meats`, otherwise `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the values of the second tuple in `meats` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the values of the third tuple in `meats`, `d` is `((c1 - c2) * T) / (c1 * c2)` and `d` is greater than or equal to 0, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`**
