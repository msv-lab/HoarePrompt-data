The code snippet assigns the values of the tuple at index `i` in the `meats` list to `x1`, `y1`, and `c1`. Given that `i` is 1, we can deduce that `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` will be assigned the values of the second tuple in the `meats` list (since indexing starts at 0). 

However, without knowing the exact values in the `meats` list, we can only express `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` in terms of `meats` and `i`. Thus, `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` are equal to `meats[1][0]`, `meats[1][1]`, and `meats[1][2]`, respectively.

The other variables' states are not affected by this code snippet. 

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is at least 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `x1` is `meats[1][0]`, `y1` is `meats[1][1]`, `c1` is `meats[1][2]`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are based on the comparison of `c1 * T` and `c2 * T`, `d` is `T / c2 - T / c1`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `((x1 - x2) * (x1 - x2) + (y1 - y2) * (y1 - y2)) / 4`, `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `my` is `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`**
