The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It does not change the values of any variables but moves the control to the next iteration of the loop.

Given the initial state, none of the variable values are changed by the `continue` statement. However, the execution moves to the next iteration of the loop, if any.

Output State: **`meats` is potentially modified, `K` retains its initial value, `T` retains its initial value, `N` is greater than 5, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, `cx` is `(meats[3] + meats[5]) / 2`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the values of the 5th or 3rd element of `meats` based on the comparison, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the values of the 3rd or 5th element of `meats` based on the comparison, `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, and `d2` is `((x1 - x2) / 2)^2 + ((y1 - y2) / 2)^2`, and we move to the next iteration of the loop.**
