You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Takahashi wants to grill N pieces of meat on a grilling net, which can be seen as a two-dimensional plane. The coordinates of the i-th piece of meat are \left(x_i, y_i\right), and its hardness is c_i.
Takahashi can use one heat source to grill the meat. If he puts the heat source at coordinates \left(X, Y\right), where X and Y are real numbers, the i-th piece of meat will be ready to eat in c_i \times \sqrt{\left(X - x_i\right)^2 + \left(Y-y_i\right)^2} seconds.
Takahashi wants to eat K pieces of meat. Find the time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready if he put the heat source to minimize this time.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N \leq 60
 - 1 \leq K \leq N
 - -1000 \leq x_i , y_i \leq 1000
 - \left(x_i, y_i\right) \neq \left(x_j, y_j\right) \left(i \neq j \right)
 - 1 \leq c_i \leq 100

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
x_1 y_1 c_1
\vdots
x_N y_N c_N

-----Output-----
Print the answer.
It will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error from our answer is at most 10^{-6}.

-----Sample Input-----
4 3
-1 0 3
0 0 3
1 0 2
1 1 40

-----Sample Output-----
2.4

If we put the heat source at \left(-0.2, 0\right), the 1-st, 2-nd, and 3-rd pieces of meat will be ready to eat within 2.4 seconds. This is the optimal place to put the heat source.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: meats is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (x, y, c) representing the coordinates and hardness of a piece of meat, K is a positive integer representing the minimum number of pieces of meat to be ready, and T is a non-negative real number representing the time within which the pieces of meat should be ready.
def func_1(meats, K, T):
    N = len(meats)

    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of meat pieces with their coordinates and hardness, a minimum number of pieces to be ready, and a time within which the pieces should be ready. It calculates and checks conditions based on the meat pieces' hardness and distance to certain calculated points, returning True if the condition where the count of pieces meeting a specific distance and time criteria is greater than or equal to the minimum required is met, and False otherwise. The function modifies the input list by swapping elements based on their hardness relative to time, does not handle edge cases like an empty input list explicitly, and implicitly assumes positive K and non-negative T for its logic to apply as described.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer representing the total number of pieces of meat, K is an integer representing the minimum number of pieces of meat to be ready, and meats is a list of tuples or lists, where each tuple or list contains three integers representing the x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and hardness of a piece of meat, such that 1 <= N <= 60 and 1 <= K <= N.
def func_2(N, K, meats):
    low, high = 0, 1000000000.0
    while high - low > 1e-07:
        mid = (low + high) / 2
        
        if func_1(meats, K, mid):
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `N` is an integer, `K` is an integer, `meats` is a list of tuples or lists, `low` and `high` are approximately equal and represent the result of the binary search with `high - low <= 1e-07`.
    return high
    #The program returns high, which is approximately equal to low and represents the result of a binary search with a precision of 1e-07, involving the variables N, K, and the list of tuples or lists 'meats'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function performs a binary search with a precision of 1e-07 to find a threshold related to the readiness of meat pieces based on their hardness and a minimum readiness requirement, returning this threshold value. The precise condition for readiness is determined by another function, `func_1`, which is not defined in the provided code.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is a positive integer representing the number of pieces of meat, K is a positive integer representing the number of pieces of meat to be eaten, and meats is a list of N tuples, each containing three integers representing the x and y coordinates and hardness of a piece of meat, such that 1 <= K <= N and the coordinates and hardness values are within the given constraints.
def func_3():
    data = input().split()
    N = int(data[0])
    K = int(data[1])
    meats = []
    index = 2
    for _ in range(N):

        meats.append((x, y, c))
        
        index += 3
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is `int(data[0])`, `K` is `int(data[1])`, `meats` is a list of `N` tuples, where each tuple contains values from `data` at indices `2 + 3i`, `3 + 3i`, and `4 + 3i`, for `i` ranging from 0 to `N-1`, `data` is a list of input strings split by spaces, and `index` is `2 + 3N`. If `N` is 0, `meats` is an empty list and `index` is 2.
    result = func_2(N, K, meats)
    print(f'{result:.6f}')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from the user, parses it into the number of pieces of meat `N`, the number of pieces to be eaten `K`, and a list of meat pieces, calls `func_2` with these parameters, and prints the result with six decimal places, without validating if `K` exceeds `N` or if the input values are within the given constraints




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
