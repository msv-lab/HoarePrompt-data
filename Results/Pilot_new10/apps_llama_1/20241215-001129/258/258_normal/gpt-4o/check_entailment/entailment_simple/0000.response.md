Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem description. 

The issue lies in the `func_1` function, where the program tries to find a location for the heat source that minimizes the time required to cook `K` or more pieces of meat. However, the function only checks a limited number of locations, specifically the midpoints of line segments formed by pairs of meat pieces. This approach does not guarantee that the optimal location will be found, especially in cases where the optimal location is not on the line segment formed by any pair of meat pieces.

For example, consider a case where there are three pieces of meat, one at `(0, 0)` with hardness `1`, one at `(1, 0)` with hardness `1`, and one at `(0.5, 1)` with hardness `2`. In this case, the optimal location for the heat source would be at approximately `(0.5, 0.5)`, but this location would not be checked by the `func_1` function.

Furthermore, the program assumes that the hardness of the meat is directly proportional to the time required to cook it, but it does not consider the fact that the distance from the heat source to the meat also affects the cooking time. The formula used in the `func_1` function, `c * math.sqrt((mx - x) ** 2 + (my - y) ** 2) <= T`, is correct, but the program does not properly account for the interaction between the hardness and distance factors.

To correctly solve this problem, a more comprehensive search algorithm would be needed, one that considers all possible locations for the heat source and evaluates the cooking time for each piece of meat at each location. This could involve using a more sophisticated optimization technique, such as gradient descent or genetic algorithms, or simply performing an exhaustive search over a grid of possible locations. 

In its current form, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description, and therefore its correctness is **False**.
