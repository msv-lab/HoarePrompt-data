Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not seem to handle the case where the heat source is placed at a position that is not the midpoint of two meat pieces. In the function `func_1`, it only checks the midpoints of two meat pieces and calculates the time required for the pieces to be ready. However, the optimal position for the heat source could be anywhere on the plane, not just the midpoint of two pieces.

Furthermore, the code does not consider the case where the optimal position is at a position that is not on the line segment connecting two meat pieces. The function `func_1` only checks the conditions based on the distance and hardness of the pieces, but it does not consider the global optimality of the position.

Another issue is that the code does not validate the input values. For example, it does not check if `K` exceeds `N`, or if the input values are within the given constraints. If the input is invalid, the code may produce incorrect results or fail to execute.

In addition, the code does not handle the case where the time `T` is negative or zero. The function `func_1` assumes that `T` is positive, but it does not check for this condition explicitly.

Lastly, the code does not provide any error handling or exception handling mechanisms. If an error occurs during execution, the code may fail or produce incorrect results without providing any indication of what went wrong.

Overall, while the code appears to be correct for some cases, it does not handle all possible scenarios and edge cases, and therefore, its correctness is **False**.
