To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the variables involved in the loop statement. The loop iterates over a range from -1000 to 1000 (inclusive), which means the variable `y` will take on each integer value in this range during the loop's execution.

Given the initial state:
- `x` is -999
- `y` is 1000
- `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `ans` is the minimum of the K-1th elements of `times` for all iterations
- `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-1000, 1000, -1000, 1000)`

For the loop to execute, the initial value of `y` (which is 1000) is not within the range that the loop will iterate over, starting from -1000 and going up to 1000. The loop's execution does not directly depend on `x`, `K`, `ans`, or `times`, but rather on the range specified in the loop statement itself. 

However, since `y` is used as the loop variable, before the loop starts, `y` should conceptually be "reset" or considered as if it's about to take on the first value in the range, which is -1000, to accurately reflect the state at the start of the loop execution. The values of `x`, `K`, `ans`, and `times` do not directly affect the loop's ability to start executing but are part of the overall program state.

Thus, considering the initial state and the loop statement, we adjust our understanding of the state to reflect that `y` is about to take on values from -1000 to 1000, starting with -1000.

State: **`x` is -999, `y` is about to be -1000 (the first value in the loop's range), `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `ans` is the minimum of the K-1th elements of `times` for all iterations, and `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-1000, 1000, -1000, 1000)`**
