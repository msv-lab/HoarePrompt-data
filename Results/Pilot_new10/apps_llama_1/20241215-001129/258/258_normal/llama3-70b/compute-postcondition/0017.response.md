To calculate the output state, we first need to understand the impact of the given code on the program. The code provided is:

```python
times = func_2(x, y, x, y)
```

Given the initial state:
- `x` is -999,
- `y` is about to be -1000,
- `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`,
- `ans` is the minimum of the K-1th elements of `times` for all iterations,
- `times` is initially the sorted result of `func_2(-1000, 1000, -1000, 1000)`.

Now, let's analyze the change:
- The function `func_2` is called with arguments `(x, y, x, y)`, which means it's called with `(-999, -1000, -999, -1000)` given the current values of `x` and `y`.
- The result of `func_2(-999, -1000, -999, -1000)` is assigned to `times`.

Since we don't have the specific implementation details of `func_2`, we can't determine the exact value of `times` after this operation. However, we can state that `times` will now hold the result of `func_2` called with the specified arguments, rather than its initial value which was the sorted result of `func_2(-1000, 1000, -1000, 1000)`.

The values of `x`, `y`, `K`, and `ans` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, after executing this line of code:

Output State: **`x` is -999, `y` is -1000, `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `ans` is the minimum of the K-1th elements of the previous `times` for all iterations, and `times` is the result of `func_2(-999, -1000, -999, -1000)`**.
