The value of `times` is sorted in ascending order. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is -999, `y` is -1000, `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `ans` is the minimum of the K-1th elements of the previous `times` for all iterations, and `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-999, -1000, -999, -1000)`.
