The function `func_3` does not explicitly accept any parameters `x`, `y`, or `K` in its definition. However, based on the given constraints and output description, it seems that `x`, `y`, and `K` are utilized within the function, possibly as global variables or defined elsewhere in the program. 

Given that `x` and `y` are integers in the range -1000 to 1000, and `K` is an integer between 1 and `N` (where `N` is defined elsewhere), the function appears to operate under these constraints to produce its output.

The output indicates that the function returns the minimum of the K-1th elements of 'times' for all possible pairs of 'x' and 'y' in the specified range, with a specific condition where 'x' is 1000 and 'y' is 1000.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to return the minimum value based on the K-1th elements of 'times' for the given conditions, although it does so without explicitly accepting `x`, `y`, or `K` as parameters.

Functionality: **The function returns the minimum of the K-1th elements of 'times' for all possible pairs of 'x' and 'y' in the range -1000 to 1000, given 'x' equals 1000 and 'y' equals 1000.**
