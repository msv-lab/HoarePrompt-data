According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y`. The loop iterates over a fixed range from -1000 to 1000, so `y` will take on each value in this range. 

Since `y` is already defined as an integer such that -1000 <= `y` <= 1000, its state does not need to be adjusted in terms of its range. However, at the start of the loop, `y` should be set to the first value in the range, which is -1000.

The other variables `x`, `K`, and `ans` do not affect the execution of the loop, so their states do not need to be adjusted. 

The state of `y` at the start of the loop is the first value in the range, which is -1000.

State: **`x` is -1000, `y` is -1000, `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, and `ans` is positive infinity**
