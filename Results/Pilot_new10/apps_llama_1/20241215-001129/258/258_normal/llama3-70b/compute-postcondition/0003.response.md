To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial conditions step by step.

Given the initial state:
- `x` is -1000
- `y` is -1000
- `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `ans` is positive infinity

The code provided is:
```python
times = func_2(x, y, x, y)
```

The impact of this code on the program is the assignment of the return value of `func_2(x, y, x, y)` to the variable `times`. The function `func_2` and its implementation details are not provided, so we will treat its return value as `func_2(-1000, -1000, -1000, -1000)`.

Since we do not have the specifics of `func_2`, we cannot calculate its return value directly. However, we can state that `times` will be assigned the result of this function call.

The initial conditions for `x`, `y`, `K`, and `ans` remain unchanged by this operation, as the code snippet does not modify these variables. The value of `N` is also not affected, as it is part of the condition defining `K` but is not changed by the given code.

Thus, the output state, considering the changes and the initial conditions, is:
- `x` is -1000
- `y` is -1000
- `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `ans` is positive infinity
- `times` is equal to `func_2(-1000, -1000, -1000, -1000)`

Given the information and the format required:

Output State: **`x` is -1000, `y` is -1000, `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `ans` is positive infinity, and `times` is equal to `func_2(-1000, -1000, -1000, -1000)`**
