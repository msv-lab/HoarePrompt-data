The code assigns `ans` the value `float('inf')`, which represents positive infinity. The values of `x`, `y`, `K`, and `N` are not affected by this code. 

Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers such that -1000 <= `x`, `y` <= 1000, `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, and `ans` is positive infinity**
