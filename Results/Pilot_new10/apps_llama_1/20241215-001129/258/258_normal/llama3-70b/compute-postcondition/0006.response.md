To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the impact of the `for` loop statement on the program state.

The `for` loop statement is `for y in range(-1000, 1001):`, which means that the loop will iterate over the range of values from -1000 to 1000.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
**`x` is -1000, `y` is -1000, `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `ans` is `times[K - 1]`, and `times` is a sorted list equal to the sorted result of `func_2(-1000, -1000, -1000, -1000)`**

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `y` needs to be incremented by 1, since the loop iterates over the range of values from -1000 to 1000.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
**`x` is -1000, `y` is -999, `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `ans` is `times[K - 1]`, and `times` is a sorted list equal to the sorted result of `func_2(-1000, -1000, -1000, -1000)`**
