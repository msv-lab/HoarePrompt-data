To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is:
- `x` is -999
- `y` is -998
- `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`
- `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-999, -999, -999, -999)`

The code snippet is:
```python
times = func_2(x, y, x, y)
```

Given that `x` is -999, `y` is -998, the code snippet calls `func_2` with these values. However, the specific implementation of `func_2` is not provided, which means we cannot determine the exact output of `func_2(-999, -998, -999, -998)`. 

But we can infer the following:
- The value of `times` will be updated to the result of `func_2(x, y, x, y)`, which is `func_2(-999, -998, -999, -998)`.
- The values of `x`, `y`, `K`, and `ans` are not directly modified by this operation.
- The previous value of `times` was the sorted result of `func_2(-999, -999, -999, -999)`, but this is now overwritten.

Since the specific output of `func_2` cannot be determined without its implementation details, we can only state that `times` is now equal to the result of `func_2(-999, -998, -999, -998)`.

Output State: **`x` is -999, `y` is -998, `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`, `times` is the result of `func_2(-999, -998, -999, -998)`**
