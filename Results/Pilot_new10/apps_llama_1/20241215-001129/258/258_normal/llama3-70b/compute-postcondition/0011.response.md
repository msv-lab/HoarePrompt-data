The value of `times` is reassigned to the result of `func_2(x, y, x, y)`. Given that `x` is -1000 and `y` is -998, `times` becomes `func_2(-1000, -998, -1000, -998)`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Since `times` is updated to `func_2(-1000, -998, -1000, -998)`, `ans` which is the K-1th element of `times` will also be updated, but its exact value depends on the result of `func_2(-1000, -998, -1000, -998)` and the value of `K`.

Output State: **`x` is -1000, `y` is -998, `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-1000, -998, -1000, -998)`, `ans` is the K-1th element of the sorted result of `func_2(-1000, -998, -1000, -998)`**
