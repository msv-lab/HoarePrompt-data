To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `x` is -999
- `y` is -999
- `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`
- `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-999, -999, -999, -999)`

The code snippet is:
```python
ans = min(ans, times[K - 1])
```

This line of code updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum between its current value and the value of `times[K - 1]`.

Given that `ans` is already defined as the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`, this line essentially reinforces or updates this relationship by ensuring `ans` remains the minimum between its current value and `times[K - 1]`.

Since `x`, `y`, and `K` are not modified by the code snippet, their values or conditions remain unchanged. The value of `times` also does not change, as it is the sorted result of a function call that is not repeated or modified in the given code snippet.

The only change is in the value of `ans`, which will be the minimum between its previous value and `times[K - 1]`. However, since the initial state already defines `ans` in terms of being the minimum involving `times[K - 1]`, we can infer that the operation is consistent with its initial definition.

Therefore, the output state, considering the specific update to `ans`, remains that `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`, with all other variables retaining their initial state descriptions.

Output State: **`x` is -999, `y` is -999, `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`, `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-999, -999, -999, -999)`**
