To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the given for loop statement and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop statement is `for y in range(-1000, 1001):`, which means `y` will take on integer values from -1000 to 1000.

Given that at the end of the previous iteration, `y` is -1000, for the loop to execute again, `y` must be incremented by 1.

So, the new value of `y` should be -999.

The other variables `x`, `K`, `ans`, and `times` do not depend on the loop variable `y` for their updates within the context of the loop statement provided. Their states are not directly affected by the loop iteration in terms of the loop control (i.e., whether the loop continues or not).

Therefore, their values remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration: `x` is -998, `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`, and `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-998, -1000, -998, -1000)`.

State: **`x` is -998, `y` is -999, `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`, `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-998, -1000, -998, -1000)`**
