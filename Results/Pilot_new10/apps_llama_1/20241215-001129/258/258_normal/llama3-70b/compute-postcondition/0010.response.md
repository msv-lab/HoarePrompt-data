According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y`. If `y` is less than 1000, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is -999. For the loop to execute again, `y` must be increased by 1, so `y` is -998. The value of `x` remains unchanged, `K` must still be an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, and `ans` must be updated to be the K-1th element of `times`, which is the sorted result of `func_2(-1000, -998, -1000, -998)`. `times` must also be updated to be the sorted result of `func_2(-1000, -998, -1000, -998)`.
State: **`x` is -1000, `y` is -998, `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `ans` is the K-1th element of `times`, `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-1000, -998, -1000, -998)`**
