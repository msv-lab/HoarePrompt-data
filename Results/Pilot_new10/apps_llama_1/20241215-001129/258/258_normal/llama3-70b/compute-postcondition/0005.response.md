To calculate the output state, we need to consider the impact of the code `ans = min(ans, times[K - 1])` on the program.

The variable `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value (`ans` is positive infinity) and the value of `times[K - 1]`. 

Given that:
- `times` is a sorted list equal to the sorted result of `func_2(-1000, -1000, -1000, -1000)`.
- `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`.

Since `times` is sorted in ascending order, `times[K - 1]` will be the Kth smallest element in the `times` list.

The initial value of `ans` is positive infinity, so `ans` will be updated to `times[K - 1]` if `times[K - 1]` is less than positive infinity.

Other variables (`x`, `y`, `K`, `N`, and `times`) remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the `ans = min(ans, times[K - 1])` operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
**`x` is -1000, `y` is -1000, `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `ans` is `times[K - 1]`, and `times` is a sorted list equal to the sorted result of `func_2(-1000, -1000, -1000, -1000)`.**
