The value of `times` is the result of `func_2(-998, -1000, -998, -1000)`. The code sorts the `times` list in ascending order. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`x` is -998, `y` is -1000, `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `ans` is the minimum of the K-1th elements of all `times` calculated for each `y` in the range, `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-998, -1000, -998, -1000)`**
