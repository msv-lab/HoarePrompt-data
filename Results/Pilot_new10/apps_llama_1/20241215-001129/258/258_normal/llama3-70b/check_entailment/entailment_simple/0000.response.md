Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for several reasons:

1.  The function `func_1` calculates the Euclidean distance between a piece of meat and the heat source correctly. However, in `func_3`, when calculating the time it takes for each piece of meat to cook, it uses the integer coordinates of the heat source (`x` and `y`) instead of floating-point coordinates (`X` and `Y`).
2.  In the problem description, the heat source's coordinates (`X`, `Y`) are real numbers. However, the program only considers integer coordinates (`x` and `y`) in the range -1000 to 1000.
3.  The function `func_2` calculates the cooking time for each piece of meat correctly. However, in `func_3`, when sorting the cooking times, it always uses the same integer coordinates (`x` and `y`) for the heat source instead of the optimal real coordinates (`X` and `Y`).
4.  The program does not find the minimum time required to cook at least `K` pieces of meat. Instead, it iterates over all possible integer coordinates for the heat source, which does not guarantee finding the optimal solution.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should find the optimal real coordinates (`X`, `Y`) for the heat source that minimize the time required to cook at least `K` pieces of meat. This can be achieved using a more sophisticated approach, such as using numerical methods to optimize the coordinates (`X`, `Y`) or employing a more efficient algorithm that takes into account the specific constraints and requirements of the problem.

Here's an example of how the problem could be solved using a brute force approach with a finer grid of possible heat source coordinates:

```python
import math

def calculate_cooking_time(X, Y, meats):
    cooking_times = []
    for x, y, c in meats:
        cooking_times.append(c * math.sqrt((X - x) ** 2 + (Y - y) ** 2))
    return cooking_times

def find_min_time(meats, K):
    min_time = float('inf')
    step = 0.1  # adjust this value to change the precision of the result
    for X in [i * step for i in range(-10000, 10001)]:
        for Y in [i * step for i in range(-10000, 10001)]:
            cooking_times = calculate_cooking_time(X, Y, meats)
            cooking_times.sort()
            time = cooking_times[K - 1]
            if time < min_time:
                min_time = time
    return min_time

# read input
N, K = map(int, input().split())
meats = []
for _ in range(N):
    x, y, c = map(int, input().split())
    meats.append((x, y, c))

# calculate and print result
min_time = find_min_time(meats, K)
print(min_time)

```

This code works by iterating over a grid of possible heat source coordinates (`X`, `Y`) with a specified step size, calculating the cooking time for each piece of meat at each coordinate, and keeping track of the minimum time found. The step size can be adjusted to trade off between precision and running time. However, please note that this brute force approach can still be slow for large inputs or high precision requirements. A more efficient algorithm would be needed for such cases.
