Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The main issue lies in the way `func_3` calculates the optimal position for the heat source. It only considers integer coordinates for `x` and `y`, whereas the problem statement specifies that `X` and `Y` can be real numbers. 

This means that `func_3` may miss the optimal solution if the optimal position for the heat source has non-integer coordinates, which is likely given the nature of the problem. The optimal position is likely to be at a point that is not necessarily an integer coordinate due to the continuous nature of the Euclidean distance formula used in `func_1`.

Additionally, `func_2` has an incorrect implementation. The function should calculate the time it takes for each piece of meat to be ready given the heat source position `(X, Y)`, but it uses `(x, y)` as the heat source position instead of the actual `(X, Y)`.

In the provided sample input, the function might still return the correct result because the optimal position happens to have integer coordinates, but this is not guaranteed for all inputs. Therefore, the code does not meet the problem description's requirements for all potential cases.
