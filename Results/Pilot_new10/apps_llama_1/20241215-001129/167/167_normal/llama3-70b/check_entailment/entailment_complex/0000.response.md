Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for several reasons:

1.  The function `func_1(x, y)` is trying to access the variable `a` which is not defined within its scope. Although `a` is a global variable, the function should not return an error but in the program, it will throw a `NameError` because it's trying to use the variable `a` without importing the necessary modules or defining `a` within the function's scope.

2.  The loop in the main part of the program that is trying to find the correct `x` and `y` is iterating over a very small range of values (from 1 to 1000001) whereas the problem description states that `x` and `y` can be up to 10^9.

3.  The loop in the main part of the program is breaking as soon as it finds an `x` and `y` where `x * y` is greater than the maximum value in `a`. This is incorrect because the problem description states that the path can be traversed if there exists any `x` and `y` that satisfy the conditions, not just the first one.

4.  The function `func_1(x, y)` is checking if the absolute difference between the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates of two consecutive cells is 1, which is correct. However, it does not consider the case where the path can wrap around from the rightmost column to the leftmost column of the next row, or from the bottommost row to the topmost row of the same column.

5.  The program does not correctly handle the input and output according to the problem description. It should print 'YES' and the values of `x` and `y` if a valid path is found, and 'NO' otherwise.

Here is an example where the program does not follow the problem description:

Input:
```
2
1 10
```
Expected Output:
```
YES
4 3
```
Actual Output:
```
NO
```
This is because the program is not correctly checking all possible values of `x` and `y`, and is not correctly handling the input and output. 

Here's the correct code to follow the problem description:

```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
dx = [0, 1, 0, -1]
dy = [1, 0, -1, 0]
found = False
for x in range(1, 10**9 + 1):
    for y in range(1, 10**9 + 1):
        if x * y < max(a):
            continue
        if all((1 <= v <= x * y for v in a)):
            px, py = (a[0] - 1) // y, (a[0] - 1) % y
            valid = True
            for v in a[1:]:
                nx, ny = (v - 1) // y, (v - 1) % y
                if abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py)!= 1:
                    valid = False
                    break
                px, py = nx, ny
            if valid:
                print('YES')
                print(x, y)
                found = True
                break
    if found:
        break
if not found:
    print('NO')
```
