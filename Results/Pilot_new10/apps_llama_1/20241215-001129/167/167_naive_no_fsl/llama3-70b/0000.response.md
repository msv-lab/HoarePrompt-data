Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly check for all possible valid cases. The issue with the program is that it stops checking for valid `x` and `y` values as soon as it finds a pair where `x * y > max(a)`. However, this check is not sufficient to ensure that all possible valid cases are considered.

Additionally, the inner loop should also be limited to the range where `x * y > max(a)` to avoid unnecessary iterations. 

The program also does not consider cases where `x` and `y` are swapped, which can also produce a valid solution.

To fix the program, it should iterate over all possible `x` and `y` values within a reasonable range and check if the given conditions are met. 

Here is an example of an incorrect case:

Input:
```
2
1 1000000000
```
The program will print `NO`, but the correct output should be `YES` with `x = 1` and `y = 1000000000`.

Another issue with the program is the definition of the function `func_1(x, y)`. This function checks if the given sequence of numbers can be traversed in a matrix of size `x` by `y`. However, it does not handle the case where the sequence starts at a cell that is not in the first row or column. 

To fix this, the program should be modified to start the sequence at the correct position in the matrix.

Here is the corrected code:
```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
max_a = max(a)
min_x = 1
while min_x * min_x <= max_a:
    min_x += 1
min_x -= 1

for x in range(1, min_x + 1):
    y = max_a // x + (1 if max_a % x!= 0 else 0)
    if y <= 1:
        continue
    if all(1 <= v <= x * y for v in a):
        (px, py) = ((a[0] - 1) // y, (a[0] - 1) % y)
        valid = True
        for v in a[1:]:
            (nx, ny) = ((v - 1) // y, (v - 1) % y)
            if abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py)!= 1:
                valid = False
                break
            (px, py) = (nx, ny)
        if valid:
            print('YES')
            print(x, y)
            exit()
print('NO')
```
