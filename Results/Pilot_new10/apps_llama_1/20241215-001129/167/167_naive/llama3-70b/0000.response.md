Correctness: **False**

The program tries to find a possible number of lines and columns in the matrix by iterating over all possible combinations of x and y. However, the program has a few issues:

1. It only checks for x and y up to 1,000,000, which is not sufficient as the problem statement allows x and y to be up to 10^9.
2. The program does not efficiently check for all possible combinations of x and y. It checks for every possible combination, which can be very inefficient for large inputs.
3. The program does not check if the path is valid for the given x and y. It only checks if the difference between the current and next point is 1, which is not a sufficient condition for the path to be valid.

However, the main issue with the program is that it does not handle the case when the input is a valid path, but the program is unable to find a valid x and y within its search range. In this case, the program should continue searching for x and y up to 10^9, but it stops at 1,000,000.

For example, if the input is:
```
2
1 10
```
The program will print:
```
YES
4 3
```
Which is a correct answer. However, if the input is:
```
2
1 1000001
```
The program will print:
```
NO
```
Which is an incorrect answer, because a valid x and y for this input is x = 1000 and y = 1001.

To fix this issue, the program should continue searching for x and y up to 10^9, or it should use a more efficient algorithm to find a valid x and y.
