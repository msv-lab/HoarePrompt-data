Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of digits to be deleted from the given integer number `n`, so that the result is divisible by `10^k`. 

One potential issue with the code is that it only checks the digits from the end of the number and stops as soon as it finds `k` zeros. However, it does not consider the case where the digits to be removed are not necessarily at the end of the number, or the case where removing digits can result in a number that starts with a non-zero digit and is still divisible by `10^k`.

For example, if the input is `123400` and `k` is `3`, the program will output `3`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `1`, because we can remove the `4` from `123400` to get `12300`, which is divisible by `1000`. 

Another case that the program does not handle correctly is when `k` is greater than the number of digits at the end of `n` that are zeros. In such cases, the program should return the minimum number of digits that need to be removed to get a number that is divisible by `10^k`, but the current implementation does not do this correctly.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
