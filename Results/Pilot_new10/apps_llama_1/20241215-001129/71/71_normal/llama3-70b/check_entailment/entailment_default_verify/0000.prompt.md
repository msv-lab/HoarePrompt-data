You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp is crazy about round numbers. He especially likes the numbers divisible by 10^{k}.

In the given number of n Polycarp wants to remove the least number of digits to get a number that is divisible by 10^{k}. For example, if k = 3, in the number 30020 it is enough to delete a single digit (2). In this case, the result is 3000 that is divisible by 10^3 = 1000.

Write a program that prints the minimum number of digits to be deleted from the given integer number n, so that the result is divisible by 10^{k}. The result should not start with the unnecessary leading zero (i.e., zero can start only the number 0, which is required to be written as exactly one digit).

It is guaranteed that the answer exists.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integer numbers n and k (0 ≤ n ≤ 2 000 000 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 9).

It is guaranteed that the answer exists. All numbers in the input are written in traditional notation of integers, that is, without any extra leading zeros.


-----Output-----

Print w — the required minimal number of digits to erase. After removing the appropriate w digits from the number n, the result should have a value that is divisible by 10^{k}. The result can start with digit 0 in the single case (the result is zero and written by exactly the only digit 0).


-----Examples-----
Input
30020 3

Output
1

Input
100 9

Output
2

Input
10203049 2

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the example 2 you can remove two digits: 1 and any 0. The result is number 0 which is divisible by any number.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    w = 0
    while n % 10 ** k != 0:
        w += 1
        n //= 10
    print(w)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. It simply removes the last digit of the number `n` in each iteration until `n` is divisible by `10 ** k`, which is not the optimal solution.

For example, consider the input `10203049 2`. The correct solution would be to remove the digits `1`, `2`, and `3`, resulting in the number `040`, but since the result should not start with unnecessary leading zeros, we would remove `4` and one `0` as well, resulting in `0`, which requires removing 3 digits from the original number `10203049` to get a number divisible by `10 ** 2 = 100`. However, the provided program would remove the last digits one by one, which would result in removing more digits than necessary.

A more correct approach would be to convert the number to a string and then try all possible substrings to see which one, when removed, results in a number that is divisible by `10 ** k` and requires the minimum number of digits to be removed.

Here is a possible correct solution:
```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    s = str(n)
    min_removed = float('inf')
    for mask in range(1 << len(s)):
        new_s = ''
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if (mask >> i) & 1:
                new_s += s[i]
        if new_s and (new_s[0]!= '0' or new_s == '0'):
            num = int(new_s)
            if num % (10 ** k) == 0:
                min_removed = min(min_removed, len(s) - len(new_s))
    print(min_removed)
```

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts two integers `n` and `k` as input, where `n` is divided by 10 repeatedly until it is divisible by 10 to the power of `k`, and it prints the number of divisions required to achieve this, handling cases where `n` becomes 0 or `k` exceeds the number of digits in `n`. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
