The value of `n` is updated by performing integer division of `n` by 10. Since `n` is the input integer divided by 10 and must not be divisible by 10, let's denote the input integer as `x`. Then `n` is `x / 10`, and since `n` must not be divisible by 10, `x` must not be divisible by 100.

After the update, `n` becomes `(x / 10) // 10`, which simplifies to `x // 100`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the input integer divided by 100, `k` is an input integer, `w` is 2, and the current `n` must not be divisible by 10.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer divided by 100, `k` is an input integer, `w` is 2, and the current `n` must not be divisible by 10**
