The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `n` and `k` by taking new integer inputs. The previous range of `n` (between 0 and 2,000,000,000) and `k` (between 1 and 9) is no longer valid as new values are assigned. 

The `map(int, input().split())` expression splits the input string into two parts, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `n` and `k`, respectively. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**
