The value of `w` is incremented by 1. Initially, `w` is 0, so the new value of `w` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `w` is 1, and `n` must not be divisible by `10` raised to the power of `k`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `w` is 1, and `n` must not be divisible by `10` raised to the power of `k`.**
