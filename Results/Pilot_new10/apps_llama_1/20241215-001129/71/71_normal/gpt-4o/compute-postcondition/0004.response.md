According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `n`. If `n` is not empty, the loop can execute. Since `n` is a string input and `k` is an integer converted from `n`, `n` must be a numeric string. For the loop to execute, `n` must have at least 1 digit. The loop iterates over the digits of `n` in reverse order. 

State: **`n` is a non-empty numeric string, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is 0, `to_remove` is 0, digit is the last digit of `n`**
