The code increments the value of `to_remove` by 1. The initial value of `to_remove` is 0, so the new value of `to_remove` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty numeric string, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is 0, `to_remove` is 1, `digit` is the last digit of `n`, and the last digit of `n` is not '0'**
