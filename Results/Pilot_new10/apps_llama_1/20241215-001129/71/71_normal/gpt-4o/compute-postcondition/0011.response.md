The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables. It only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement that we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-empty numeric string, `k` is an integer, if the last digit of `n` is '0', then `count_zeros` is 1 and `to_remove` is 0. Otherwise, `count_zeros` is 0, `to_remove` is 1, and the last digit of `n` is not '0'. The value of `count_zeros` equals the value of `k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
