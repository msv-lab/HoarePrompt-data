You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp is crazy about round numbers. He especially likes the numbers divisible by 10^{k}.

In the given number of n Polycarp wants to remove the least number of digits to get a number that is divisible by 10^{k}. For example, if k = 3, in the number 30020 it is enough to delete a single digit (2). In this case, the result is 3000 that is divisible by 10^3 = 1000.

Write a program that prints the minimum number of digits to be deleted from the given integer number n, so that the result is divisible by 10^{k}. The result should not start with the unnecessary leading zero (i.e., zero can start only the number 0, which is required to be written as exactly one digit).

It is guaranteed that the answer exists.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integer numbers n and k (0 ≤ n ≤ 2 000 000 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 9).

It is guaranteed that the answer exists. All numbers in the input are written in traditional notation of integers, that is, without any extra leading zeros.


-----Output-----

Print w — the required minimal number of digits to erase. After removing the appropriate w digits from the number n, the result should have a value that is divisible by 10^{k}. The result can start with digit 0 in the single case (the result is zero and written by exactly the only digit 0).


-----Examples-----
Input
30020 3

Output
1

Input
100 9

Output
2

Input
10203049 2

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the example 2 you can remove two digits: 1 and any 0. The result is number 0 which is divisible by any number.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(str, input().split())
    k = int(k)
    count_zeros = 0
    to_remove = 0
    for digit in reversed(n):
        if digit == '0':
            count_zeros += 1
        else:
            to_remove += 1
        if count_zeros == k:
            break
    if count_zeros == k:
        print(to_remove)
    else:
        print(len(n) - 1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of digits to be deleted from the given integer number `n`, so that the result is divisible by `10^k`. 

One potential issue with the code is that it only checks the digits from the end of the number and stops as soon as it finds `k` zeros. However, it does not consider the case where the digits to be removed are not necessarily at the end of the number, or the case where removing digits can result in a number that starts with a non-zero digit and is still divisible by `10^k`.

For example, if the input is `123400` and `k` is `3`, the program will output `3`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `1`, because we can remove the `4` from `123400` to get `12300`, which is divisible by `1000`. 

Another case that the program does not handle correctly is when `k` is greater than the number of digits at the end of `n` that are zeros. In such cases, the program should return the minimum number of digits that need to be removed to get a number that is divisible by `10^k`, but the current implementation does not do this correctly.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 2,000,000,000, and k is a positive integer between 1 and 9.
def func():
    n, k = map(str, input().split())
    k = int(k)
    count_zeros = 0
    to_remove = 0
    for digit in reversed(n):
        if digit == '0':
            count_zeros += 1
        else:
            to_remove += 1
        
        if count_zeros == k:
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is the original numeric string input, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is the count of zeros from the end of `n` until `k` zeros are found or until all digits have been processed, and `to_remove` is the count of non-zero digits from the end of `n` until `k` zeros are found or until all digits have been processed.
    if (count_zeros == k) :
        print(to_remove)
    else :
        print(len(n) - 1)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is the original numeric string input, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is the count of zeros from the end of `n` until `k` zeros are found or until all digits have been processed, and `to_remove` is the count of non-zero digits from the end of `n` until `k` zeros are found or until all digits have been processed. If `count_zeros` equals `k`, then `to_remove` has been returned at the output. Otherwise, the value `len(n) - 1` has been printed and the count of zeros from the end of `n` is less than `k`.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
