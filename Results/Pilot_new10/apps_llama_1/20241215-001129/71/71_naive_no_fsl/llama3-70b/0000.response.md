Correctness: **False**

The given program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue with the program is that it removes digits from the end of the number until it is divisible by 10^k. However, this approach may not result in the minimum number of digits to be removed. 

For example, if the input is 10203049 2, the program will remove digits one by one from the end until it finds a number that is divisible by 10^2. However, the optimal solution is to remove the digits 1, 2, 3 (three digits) to get the number 0049, which is not considered valid, but if we remove 1, 2 to get 003049, it is still not valid, but if we remove 1, 2, 0, 3 to get 049 it is not valid, but if we remove 1, 0, 2, 0, 3 to get 049 it is not valid, but if we remove 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0 to get 49 it is valid.

However, there is an even more optimal solution, which is removing the digits 1, 0, 2, 0 to get the number 3049, which is not valid, but if we remove 1, 0, 2 to get 03049, it is not valid because of the extra leading zeros, but if we remove 1, 0 to get 0203049 it is not valid because of the extra leading zeros, but if we remove 1 to get 0203049 and then remove the extra leading zeros we get 203049, which is not valid, but if we remove 1 and the extra leading zeros to get 203049 and then remove 2 to get 03049, which is not valid, but if we remove 1 and the extra leading zeros and 2 to get 3049 and then remove 0 to get 3049 and then remove 3 to get 049 it is valid.

A correct solution should consider all possible ways to remove digits from the number, not just from the end. 

A correct Python program would be:
```python
def min_digits_to_remove(n, k):
    n = str(n)
    min_removals = float('inf')
    for mask in range(1 << len(n)):
        new_n = ''
        for i in range(len(n)):
            if (mask & (1 << i)) == 0:
                new_n += n[i]
        if new_n == '' or (new_n[0] == '0' and len(new_n) > 1):
            continue
        if int(new_n) % (10 ** k) == 0:
            min_removals = min(min_removals, bin(mask).count('1'))
    return min_removals

n, k = map(int, input().split())
print(min_digits_to_remove(n, k))
```
