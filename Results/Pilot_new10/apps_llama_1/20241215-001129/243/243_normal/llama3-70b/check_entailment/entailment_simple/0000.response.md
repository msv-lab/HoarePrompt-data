Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. 

The main issue lies in the way the program calculates the number of trailing zeros in a factorial. The number of trailing zeros in `n!` is determined by the number of factors of 5 in the prime factorization of all numbers from 1 to `n`. This is because a trailing zero is created by a factor of 2 and a factor of 5, and there are usually more factors of 2 than 5.

The program attempts to calculate this by using the condition `n // 5 ** count >= m`, but this is not a correct way to calculate the number of factors of 5 in `n!`.

A correct approach would involve iterating over all numbers from 1 to `n` and counting the number of factors of 5 in each number. This can be done using a loop that counts the number of factors of 5 in each number, and then summing up these counts.

Another issue with the program is that it does not correctly generate the list of integers `n` for which the factorial of `n` ends with exactly `m` zeroes. The program attempts to do this by appending `n` to the list `ans` whenever `n // 5 ** count < m`, but this condition is not a correct way to determine whether the factorial of `n` ends with exactly `m` zeroes.

A correct approach would involve iterating over all numbers from 1 to some sufficiently large number, calculating the number of factors of 5 in the factorial of each number, and appending the number to the list `ans` whenever the number of factors of 5 is equal to `m`.

Here's a correct implementation of the program in Python:

```python
def find_trailing_zeros():
    m = int(input())
    count = 0
    ans = []

    # Function to calculate the number of factors of 5 in n!
    def factors_of_five(n):
        count = 0
        i = 5
        while n // i >= 1:
            count += n // i
            i *= 5
        return count

    n = 1
    while True:
        if factors_of_five(n) > m:
            break
        if factors_of_five(n) == m:
            ans.append(n)
        n += 1

    print(len(ans))
    print(' '.join(map(str, ans)))

find_trailing_zeros()
```

This program correctly calculates the number of factors of 5 in the factorial of each number and appends the number to the list `ans` whenever the number of factors of 5 is equal to `m`. It then prints the length of the list `ans` and the numbers in the list `ans`.
