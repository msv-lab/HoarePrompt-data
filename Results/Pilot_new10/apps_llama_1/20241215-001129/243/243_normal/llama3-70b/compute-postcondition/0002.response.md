The value of `n` is assigned to 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000 (inclusive), `count` is 0, `n` is 1.
Output State: **`m` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000 (inclusive), `count` is 0, `n` is 1**
