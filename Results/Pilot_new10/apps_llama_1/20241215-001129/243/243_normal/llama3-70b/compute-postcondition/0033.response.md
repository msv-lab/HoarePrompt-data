To calculate the output state, let's consider the given condition and the code snippet. 

Given the initial state: 
- `n` is 3, 
- `count` is 1, 
- `ans` is [1, 2]. 
The condition `n // 5` is not met because `n` (which is 3) divided by 5 gives 0, and 0 is considered False in a conditional context. However, this condition seems to be incomplete or improperly formatted as provided. Assuming the intent might have been to check if `n` is less than 5 (since `n // 5` doesn't make sense as a standalone condition without further context), we can infer that since `n` is indeed less than 5, the condition is met under this interpretation.

Given the code snippet:
```python
ans.append(n)
```
This code appends the value of `n` to the list `ans`.

So, considering `n` is 3 and it's appended to `ans`:
- `n` remains 3,
- `count` remains 1,
- `ans` becomes [1, 2, 3] because `n` (which is 3) is appended to it.

Output State: **`n` is 3, `count` is 1, `ans` is [1, 2, 3]**
