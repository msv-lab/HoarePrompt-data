Postcondition: ***`m` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000 (inclusive), `count` is 2, `n` is 1, and if `n // 5` is less than `m` then `result` is `n`, else `result` is not defined. If `n // 5` squared (which is `n // 5 ** count`) is greater than or equal to `m`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution with the existing state of `m`, `count`, `n`, and `result`.***
