Correctness: **True**

The code seems to be correct. Let's analyze the functions and their output hints.

Function `func_1` calculates the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of a given number `n`. It does this by summing the integer divisions of `n` by all powers of 5 less than or equal to `n`. This approach is correct because trailing zeroes in a factorial are caused by the multiplication of 2 and 5. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5 in a factorial, the number of trailing zeroes is determined by the number of factors of 5.

Function `func_2` uses binary search to find the range of numbers `n` where `n!` has exactly `m` trailing zeroes. Once it finds a number `mid` where `mid!` has `m` trailing zeroes, it expands around `mid` to find the entire range of numbers with `m` trailing zeroes. This approach is correct because the number of trailing zeroes in a factorial is a non-decreasing function of the input number.

The output hints for both functions agree with the code and suggest that the code is correct. The problem description provides examples that the code should handle correctly, and the code seems to do so. For example, when the input is 1, the output is 5 followed by the numbers 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, which is correct because the factorials of these numbers all have exactly 1 trailing zero. When the input is 5, the output is 0, which is also correct because there are no numbers whose factorial has exactly 5 trailing zeroes.

Overall, the code seems to be correct and should handle all potential cases as described in the problem description.
