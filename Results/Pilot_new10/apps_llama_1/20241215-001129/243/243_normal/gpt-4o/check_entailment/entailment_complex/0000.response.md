Correctness: **True**

The code appears to correctly implement the problem description. The `func_1` function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of a given number `n`, and the `func_2` function uses this to find all numbers `n` such that `n!` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes.

The `func_1` function works by summing the integer divisions of `n` by all powers of 5 less than or equal to `n`, which is a well-known method for calculating the number of trailing zeroes in a factorial.

The `func_2` function uses a binary search approach to find the range of values for `n` that satisfy the condition. It first finds a value of `n` such that `n!` has at least `m` trailing zeroes, and then expands outwards to find the range of values that satisfy the condition exactly.

The annotations in the code provide a clear explanation of the logic and state of the program at each point, and they appear to accurately reflect the behavior of the code. The examples provided in the problem description also match the expected output of the code.

Overall, the code appears to be correct and should produce the expected output for all valid inputs. It handles the edge cases and follows the problem description for every potential case.
