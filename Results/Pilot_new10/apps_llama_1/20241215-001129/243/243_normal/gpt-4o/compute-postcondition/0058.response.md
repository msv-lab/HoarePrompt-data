Postcondition: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `n` should satisfy the condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`. If the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid` is less than `m`, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, if the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid` is greater than `m`, then `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. In all cases, the specific values of `low`, `high`, `mid`, and `result` are adjusted based on the relationship between the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid` and `m`, and the loop or if statement is executed accordingly to determine the final values of `result` and the relationship between `zeroes` and `m`.**
