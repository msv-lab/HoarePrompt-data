According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `right` and the function `func_1(right)` should equal `m`. Right before the loop, `right` is `mid + 1`. For the loop to execute, `func_1(right)` must equal `m`. Since `left` is decremented until `func_1(left)` does not equal `m` and `right` is `mid + 1`, it means `func_1(mid)` should not equal `m` for `right` to be the first value where `func_1(right)` equals `m`. Also, since `func_1(mid)` does not equal `m` but `func_1(right)` equals `m`, then `mid` must be less than the least value `x` where `func_1(x)` equals `m`. The state of `n` satisfies `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, this does not need to be adjusted as the condition for the loop does not depend on this. 

State: **`m` is unchanged, `n` satisfies `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, `low` and `high` are unchanged, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2` and `mid` must be less than the least value `x` where `func_1(x)` equals `m`, `left` is decremented until `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, `zeroes` equals the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid`, `result` is an empty list, `right` is `mid + 1`**
