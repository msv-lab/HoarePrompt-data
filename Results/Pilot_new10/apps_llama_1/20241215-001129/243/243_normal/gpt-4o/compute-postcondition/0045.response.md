The code decrements the value of `left` by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. `left` was such that `func_1(left)` equals `m`, but after decrementing, this condition may not hold. 

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `n` satisfies the condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `left` is `left - 1`, `zeroes` equals the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid`, `result` is an empty list**
