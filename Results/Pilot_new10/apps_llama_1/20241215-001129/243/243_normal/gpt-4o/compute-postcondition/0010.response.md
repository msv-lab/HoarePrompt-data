The value of `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. The previous values of `m`, `n`, `low`, `mid`, `zeroes`, and `result` are not affected by this operation. The new value of `high` is `5 * m // 2 + 2 - 1`, which simplifies to `5 * m // 2 + 1`.

Given the initial conditions, `1 <= m <= 100000`, `low` is `0`, `mid` is `5 * m // 2 + 2`, and `high` is updated to `mid - 1` which equals `5 * m // 2 + 1`. The number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid` is more than or equal to `m`, and `zeroes` equals the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid` and is greater than `m`. `result` is an empty list.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `n` should satisfy the condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, `low` is `0`, `high` is `5 * m // 2 + 1`, `mid` is `5 * m // 2 + 2`, the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid` is more than or equal to `m`, `zeroes` is greater than `m` and equals the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid`, and `result` is an empty list**
