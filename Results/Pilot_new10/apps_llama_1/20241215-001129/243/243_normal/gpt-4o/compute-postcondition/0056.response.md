The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It only terminates the loop or conditional statement it is directly inside. Therefore, all the variables retain their previous values. The values of `m`, `n`, `low`, `high`, `left`, `right`, `mid`, `zeroes`, and `result` remain unchanged. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`m` is unchanged, `n` satisfies `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, `low` and `high` are unchanged, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `left` is decremented until `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, `zeroes` equals the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid`, `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, `right` is the smallest value greater than the initial `mid` for which `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
