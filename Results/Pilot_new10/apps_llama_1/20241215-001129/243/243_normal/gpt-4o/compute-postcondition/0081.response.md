The code assigns `result` the value of a list containing all integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1` (since the `range` function in Python generates numbers up to but not including the stop value). The values of `left`, `zeroes`, `m`, and `right` are not changed.

Output State: **`left` is the first value less than or equal to the original `(low + high) // 2` for which `func_1(left)` is less than `m`, `zeroes` equals `m`, `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, `m` is a positive integer, and `right` is the first value greater than `mid` for which `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`.**
