The code increments the value of `right` by 1. The initial state of `right` is `mid + 3`, where `func_1(right)` equals `m`. After incrementing `right`, its new value becomes `mid + 4`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. `left` remains decremented to the point where `func_1(left)` no longer equals `m`, `m` retains its initial value, `n` retains its initial value, `low` retains its initial value, `high` retains its initial value, `mid` retains its initial value, `zeroes` retains its initial value, and `result` retains its initial value.

Output State: **`left` is decremented to the point where `func_1(left)` no longer equals `m`, `m` retains its initial value, `n` retains its initial value, `low` retains its initial value, `high` retains its initial value, `mid` retains its initial value, `zeroes` retains its initial value, `result` retains its initial value, and `right` is equal to `mid + 4`**
