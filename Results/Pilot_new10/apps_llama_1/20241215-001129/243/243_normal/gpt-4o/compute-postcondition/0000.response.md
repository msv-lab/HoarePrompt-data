To solve this problem, we need to find all numbers `n` such that `n!` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes.

The number of trailing zeroes in `n!` is determined by the number of factors of 5 in `n!`, since 5*2 = 10, and the number of factors of 2 is always greater than or equal to the number of factors of 5.

The number of factors of 5 in `n!` can be calculated using the formula: 

`factors_of_5 = n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +...`

where `//` denotes integer division.

Since `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, we need to find all `n` such that `factors_of_5` equals `m`.

However, the given code snippet is a comment and does not modify any variables. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the understanding that `n` should satisfy the condition `factors_of_5 = m`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 100000, `n` should satisfy the condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`.**
