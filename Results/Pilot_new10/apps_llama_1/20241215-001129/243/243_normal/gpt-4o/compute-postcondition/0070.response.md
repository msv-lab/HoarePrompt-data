To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we must analyze the condition that governs the loop's execution: `func_1(left) == m`.

1. **Understanding the Condition**: The loop continues as long as `func_1(left)` equals `m`. This implies that for the loop to execute again, `func_1(left)` must still equal `m` after the previous iteration.

2. **Analyzing `func_1(left)`**: Without the specific implementation of `func_1`, we can infer that its output depends on the input `left`. For `func_1(left)` to potentially equal `m` again, `left` must be such that it allows `func_1(left)` to output `m`.

3. **State Adjustments**:
   - `m` is a constant within the context of the loop condition, so it doesn't need adjustment.
   - `n`'s relation to `m` is given but does not directly affect the loop condition.
   - `low` and `high` are related to `mid` and `left`, but the loop condition directly depends on `left` and `func_1(left)`.
   - `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, and `left` is `mid - 2`. These values are intermediate calculations and do not directly impact the loop condition unless they affect `func_1(left)`.
   - `left` must allow `func_1(left)` to potentially equal `m`. Given `left` is calculated based on `low` and `high`, for `func_1(left)` to equal `m` in the next iteration, `left` should be adjusted such that its value still satisfies the condition `func_1(left) == m`.
   - `zeroes` equals `m`, which doesn't directly influence the loop condition.
   - `result` is an empty list, which does not affect the loop condition.

Given that `func_1(left)` must equal `m` for the loop to execute again, and considering the provided relationships, the critical adjustment is ensuring that `left` still allows `func_1(left)` to potentially equal `m`. However, without specific details on `func_1`, we can only assert that `left` should be in a state where `func_1(left)` could equal `m`, which is already a given condition.

Thus, the state adjustments focus on maintaining the potential for `func_1(left)` to equal `m`, which means `left` must be such that it can satisfy the loop condition again. Since `left` is `(low + high) // 2 - 2` and must allow `func_1(left)` to potentially equal `m`, the range defined by `low` and `high` should be adjusted so that `left` can still fulfill this requirement.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `n` should satisfy the condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, `low` and `high` must be such that `left` (calculated as `(low + high) // 2 - 2`) allows `func_1(left)` to potentially equal `m`, `zeroes` is equal to `m`, and `result` is an empty list `[]`**
