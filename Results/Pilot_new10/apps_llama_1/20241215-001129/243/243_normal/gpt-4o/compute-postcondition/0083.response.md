Postcondition: ***`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `n` should satisfy the condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`. If `zeroes` (which equals `func_1(mid)`) is greater than `m`, then `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. Otherwise, `left` is the first value less than or equal to the original `(low + high) // 2` for which `func_1(left)` is less than `m`, `zeroes` equals `m`, `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, where `right` is the first value greater than `mid` for which `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
