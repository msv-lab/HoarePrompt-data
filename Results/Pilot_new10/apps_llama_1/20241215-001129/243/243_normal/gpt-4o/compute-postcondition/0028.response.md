To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have executed, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. The loop continues to execute as long as `func_1(right)` equals `m`.
2. In each iteration, `right` is incremented by 1.
3. The output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times show a pattern where `right` increases by 1 in each step, starting from `mid + 1` (its initial value before the loop starts) to `mid + 2`, `mid + 3`, and so on.

From this pattern, we can infer that the loop will continue to increment `right` until `func_1(right)` no longer equals `m`. At this point, the loop condition will be false, and the loop will terminate.

Given that the other variables (`left`, `m`, `n`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `zeroes`, `result`) retain their initial values throughout the execution of the loop and do not influence the termination condition of the loop, their values will remain unchanged after the loop finishes.

Therefore, the key factors to consider in the output state are the initial and final values of `right` and the condition under which the loop terminates.

- If `func_1(right)` never equals `m` for any value of `right` starting from `mid + 1`, the loop will not execute at all, and `right` will remain `mid + 1`.
- If `func_1(right)` equals `m` for one or more increments of `right` starting from `mid + 1`, the loop will execute until `func_1(right)` no longer equals `m`, at which point `right` will be one more than the last value for which `func_1(right)` equaled `m`.

Considering these points, the output state of the loop after all iterations have executed can be described as follows:

Output State: **`left` is decremented to the point where `func_1(left)` no longer equals `m`, `m` retains its initial value, `n` retains its initial value, `low` retains its initial value, `high` retains its initial value, `mid` retains its initial value, `zeroes` retains its initial value, `result` retains its initial value, and `right` is the first value greater than `mid` for which `func_1(right)` does not equal the initial value of `m`. If no such value exists and `func_1(mid + 1)` never equals `m`, then `right` remains `mid + 1`.**
