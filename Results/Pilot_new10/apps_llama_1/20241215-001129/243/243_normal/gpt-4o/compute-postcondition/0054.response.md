Based on the given information, we can analyze the loop's behavior. The loop continues as long as `func_1(right)` equals `m`. 

The loop's purpose is to increment `right` until `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`. 

Looking at the output states after the loop executes a few times, we can see that `right` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.

When the loop finishes executing, `right` will be the smallest value greater than the initial `mid` for which `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`. 

This means `func_1(right - 1)` will equal `m` because the loop stops when `func_1(right)` is not equal to `m`.

All other variables (`m`, `n`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `left`, `zeroes`, `result`) remain unchanged throughout the loop.

Output State: **`m` is unchanged, `n` satisfies `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, `low` and `high` are unchanged, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `left` is decremented until `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, `zeroes` equals the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid`, `result` is an empty list, and `right` is the smallest value greater than the initial `mid` for which `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`**
