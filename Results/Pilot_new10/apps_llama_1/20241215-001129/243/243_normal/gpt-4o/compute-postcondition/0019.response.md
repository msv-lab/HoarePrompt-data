The code decrements the value of `left` by 1. The initial values of the other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `n` should satisfy the condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, `low` is `0`, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `mid` is `5 * m // 2 + 2`, `zeroes` equals the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid`, `result` is an empty list, and `left` is decreased by 1 from its initial value.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `n` should satisfy the condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, `low` is `0`, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `mid` is `5 * m // 2 + 2`, `zeroes` equals the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid`, `result` is an empty list, `left` is `left - 1`, and the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid` is less than or equal to `m`.**
