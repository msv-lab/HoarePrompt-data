To determine the output state after executing the given Python code, let's analyze the impact of the code on the program.

The given code snippet is:
```python
zeroes = func_1(mid)
```
Here, `mid` is calculated as `5 * m // 2 + 2`, where `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`.

Now, we need to understand what `func_1(mid)` does. Although the function definition is not provided, based on the context, it seems that `func_1(mid)` calculates the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid`. 

In the context of finding `n` such that `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, `func_1(mid)` likely counts the number of factors of 5 in `mid!`, which would be the number of trailing zeroes in `mid!`.

The initial state is:
- `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`.
- `n` should satisfy the condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`.
- `low` is `0`.
- `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`.
- `mid` is `5 * m // 2 + 2`.
- `result` is an empty list.

After executing `zeroes = func_1(mid)`, the value of `zeroes` is set to the result of `func_1(mid)`, which is the number of trailing zeroes in `mid!`.

The other variables remain unchanged, as their values do not depend on the result of `func_1(mid)`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `n` should satisfy the condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, `low` is `0`, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `mid` is `5 * m // 2 + 2`, `zeroes` equals the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid`, and `result` is an empty list**
