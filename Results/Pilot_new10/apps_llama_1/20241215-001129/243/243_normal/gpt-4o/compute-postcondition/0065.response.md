The code snippet assigns the value of `mid` to `left`. The previous values of `m`, `n`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `zeroes`, and `result` are not affected, except for `left` which now equals `mid`. 

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `n` should satisfy the condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `left` is `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`, and `result` is an empty list `[]`.**
