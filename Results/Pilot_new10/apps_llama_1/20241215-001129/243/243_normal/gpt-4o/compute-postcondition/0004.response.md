To calculate the output state, we need to determine the value of `mid` after the given code is executed. 

`mid` is assigned the value of `(low + high) // 2`. 

We know that `low` is 0 and `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`. 

So, `mid` becomes `(0 + 5 * (m + 1)) // 2`.

Since `//` is integer division, `mid` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2` which simplifies to `5 * m // 2 + 5 // 2`. 

Given that `//` performs floor division, `5 // 2` evaluates to `2`, and thus `mid` evaluates to `5 * m // 2 + 2`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: 
`m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 100000, `n` should satisfy the condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, `low` is 0, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `mid` is `5 * m // 2 + 2`, and `result` is an empty list.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 100000, `n` should satisfy the condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, `low` is 0, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `mid` is `5 * m // 2 + 2`, and `result` is an empty list**
