The code assigns the values to two new variables `low` and `high`. The variable `low` is assigned the value 0 and the variable `high` is assigned the value 5 times the sum of `m` and 1. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. The value of `m` is still a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 100000, and the condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m` still applies to `n`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 100000, `n` should satisfy the condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, `low` is 0, and `high` is 5 * (`m` + 1).

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 100000, `n` should satisfy the condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, `low` is 0, `high` is 5 * (`m` + 1)**
