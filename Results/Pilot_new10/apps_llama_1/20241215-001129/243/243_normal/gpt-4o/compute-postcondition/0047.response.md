To determine the output state after executing the given Python code, we analyze the effect of the code on the variables.

The code `right = mid + 1` assigns the value of `mid + 1` to the variable `right`. This directly affects the value of `right` by making it one more than the current value of `mid`.

Given the initial state:
- `m` is unchanged,
- `n` satisfies the equation `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, which implies that `n` is related to `m` through this specific equation but its exact value isn't specified,
- `low` and `high` are unchanged,
- `mid` is the average of `low` and `high`, given by `(low + high) // 2`,
- `left` is a decremented value until `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, which implies that `left` has been adjusted based on some function `func_1` in relation to `m`,
- `zeroes` equals the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid`, indicating it's based on a calculation related to `mid`,
- `result` is an empty list.

After executing `right = mid + 1`, the only change is to `right`, which becomes `mid + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged as per the given code snippet.

Thus, the output state, considering all given information and the change to `right`, is:
- `m` is unchanged,
- `n` still satisfies `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`,
- `low` and `high` are unchanged,
- `mid` remains `(low + high) // 2`,
- `left` is unchanged as it was decremented until `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`,
- `zeroes` remains the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid`,
- `result` is still an empty list,
- `right` is now `mid + 1`.

Output State: **`m` is unchanged, `n` satisfies `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, `low` and `high` are unchanged, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `left` is decremented until `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, `zeroes` equals the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid`, `result` is an empty list, `right` is `mid + 1`.**
