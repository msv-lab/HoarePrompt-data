According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `right` and the function `func_1(right)` being equal to `m`. If `func_1(right)` equals `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `right` is equal to `mid + 2`, but `func_1(left)` no longer equals `m` after `left` was decremented. However, the state of `func_1(left)` does not affect the loop condition directly; what matters is `func_1(right)`.

Given that `right` is `mid + 2` and the loop requires `func_1(right)` to equal `m`, for the loop to execute one more time, `func_1(right)` must equal `m`. Since the value of `right` is known (`mid + 2`), the condition implies that `func_1(mid + 2)` must equal `m` for the loop to continue. No other states need to be adjusted because the values of `left`, `m`, `n`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `zeroes`, and `result` do not affect the loop condition directly.

State: **`left` is decremented to the point where `func_1(left)` no longer equals `m`, `m` retains its initial value, `n` retains its initial value, `low` retains its initial value, `high` retains its initial value, `mid` retains its initial value, `zeroes` retains its initial value, `result` retains its initial value, and `right` is equal to `mid + 2` and `func_1(right)` equals `m`**
