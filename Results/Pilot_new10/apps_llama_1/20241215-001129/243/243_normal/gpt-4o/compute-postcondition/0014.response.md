To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we must analyze the condition of the `while` loop, which is `func_1(left) == m`. The loop can execute if this condition is met.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`.
- `n` should satisfy the condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`.
- `low` is `0`.
- `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`.
- `mid` is `5 * m // 2 + 2`.
- `zeroes` equals the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid`.
- `result` is an empty list.
- `left` is `5 * m // 2 + 2`.
- The number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid` is less than or equal to `m`.

The condition for the loop to execute is based on the function `func_1(left)` equaling `m`. Without the specific implementation details of `func_1`, we can infer that `func_1` likely calculates something related to the number of trailing zeroes in a factorial or a similar property, given the context of the variables provided (especially `zeroes` and how `mid` and `left` are calculated).

For the loop to execute, `func_1(left)` must equal `m`. Given that `left` is set to `5 * m // 2 + 2` and assuming `func_1` calculates the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of its argument (a common operation in problems involving factorials and trailing zeroes), the loop's condition hinges on whether the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `left` equals `m`.

Since we do not have the exact implementation of `func_1`, and assuming it does something similar to calculating trailing zeroes, the crucial part is ensuring that the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `left` (which is set to `5 * m // 2 + 2`) equals `m`. 

The given conditions and variables suggest a setup for a binary search or a similar algorithm to find a value (`n`) that satisfies a certain condition related to its factorial's trailing zeroes. However, without knowing the exact behavior of `func_1`, the key adjustment for the loop to execute would be to ensure that `func_1(left)` indeed equals `m`, which is indirectly suggested by the condition that the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid` (which equals `left`) is less than or equal to `m`.

Thus, the most direct adjustment based on the given information is ensuring that the initial setup allows `func_1(left)` to potentially equal `m`, which means the conditions provided are already aimed at setting up a scenario where this could be true. The exact adjustment would depend on the specifics of `func_1`, which are not provided.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `n` should satisfy the condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, `low` is `0`, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `mid` is `5 * m // 2 + 2`, `zeroes` equals the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid`, `result` is an empty list, `left` is `5 * m // 2 + 2`, and the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid` is less than or equal to `m`, with the understanding that `func_1(left)` must equal `m` for the loop to execute.**
