To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop, which is `func_1(left) == m`. 

1. The loop will execute as long as `func_1(left)` equals `m`. 
2. `func_1(left)` is not defined in the given problem, but based on the condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, it seems like `func_1` might be related to calculating the number of trailing zeroes in a factorial or a similar concept, given the context of `zeroes` equals the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid`.
3. For the loop to execute again, `func_1(left)` must still equal `m` after the previous iteration.
4. Since `left` is defined as `((low + high) // 2) - 2` and `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, the relationship between `low`, `high`, and `left` suggests that the loop might be adjusting these values to find a specific condition related to `m`.
5. Given that `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000` and `n` satisfies the condition related to `m`, the focus is on maintaining the relationship between `func_1(left)` and `m`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the critical condition is that `func_1(left)` must equal `m`. Since we don't have the exact definition of `func_1`, we must ensure that the condition which leads to `func_1(left)` being equal to `m` is maintained.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `n` satisfies the condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `left` must be such that `func_1(left)` equals `m`, `zeroes` equals the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid`, `result` is an empty list**
