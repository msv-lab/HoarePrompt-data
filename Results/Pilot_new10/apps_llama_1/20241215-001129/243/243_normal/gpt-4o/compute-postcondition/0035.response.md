The code `zeroes = func_1(mid)` assigns the result of `func_1(mid)` to the variable `zeroes`. The function `func_1(mid)` calculates the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid`. 

The values of `m`, `n`, `low`, `high`, and `mid` are not changed by this code. The value of `result` might be affected if it depends on `zeroes` in subsequent code, but based on the provided code snippet, only `zeroes` is directly updated.

Given that `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, and `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, and considering the relationship between `n` and `m` with the condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, the output state after executing the given line of code would reflect the updated value of `zeroes` based on the calculation of the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `n` should satisfy the condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` equals the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid`, and the specific values of `low`, `high`, `mid`, and `result` still depend on the relationship between the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid` and `m`.**
