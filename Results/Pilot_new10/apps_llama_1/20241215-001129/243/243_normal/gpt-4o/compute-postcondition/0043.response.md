The code decrements the value of `left` by 1. The initial value of `left` is `((low + high) // 2) - 1`. After decrementing, the new value of `left` becomes `((low + high) // 2) - 2`. 

The other variables are not affected by this code. `m` remains a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `n` still satisfies the condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, `low` is still less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is still `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is still equal to the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid`, and `result` is still an empty list. The relationship between the new value of `left` and `m` through `func_1` may or may not be such that `func_1(left)` equals `m`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `n` satisfies the condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `left` is `((low + high) // 2) - 2`, `zeroes` equals the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid`, `result` is an empty list**
