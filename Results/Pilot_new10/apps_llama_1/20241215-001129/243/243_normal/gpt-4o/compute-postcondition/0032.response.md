Postcondition: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `n` should satisfy the condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`. If the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid` (`5 * m // 2 + 2`) is less than `m`, then `low` is updated to `5 * m // 2 + 3` and `high` remains `5 * (m + 1)`, with `result` being an empty list. Otherwise, `low` is `0` and `high` is either `5 * (m + 1)` or `5 * m // 2 + 1`, with `mid` being `5 * m // 2 + 2` and `zeroes` equaling the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid`. If `zeroes` is greater than `m`, then `high` is `5 * m // 2 + 1` and `result` is an empty list. If `zeroes` equals `m`, then `left` is decremented to the point where `func_1(left)` no longer equals `m`, `right` is the first value greater than `mid` for which `func_1(right)` does not equal the initial value of `m` (or `mid + 1` if no such value exists), and `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`.**
