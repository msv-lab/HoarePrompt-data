Correctness: **True**

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of positive integers n such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. 

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Trailing Zeroes Calculation**: The `func_1` calculates the number of trailing zeroes in n! by dividing n by powers of 5. This is because trailing zeroes in n! are caused by factors of 10, which is the product of 2 and 5. Since there are generally more factors of 2 than 5 in n!, the number of trailing zeroes is determined by the number of factors of 5. This function correctly calculates the number of trailing zeroes.

2. **Binary Search**: The `func_2` function uses a binary search approach to find the range of n values that result in exactly m trailing zeroes. It first finds a midpoint where the number of trailing zeroes is greater than or equal to m, and then checks the surrounding values to find the exact range.

3. **Range Calculation**: Once the midpoint is found, the function calculates the range of n values by checking the surrounding values. It subtracts 1 from the midpoint until it finds a value where the number of trailing zeroes is less than m, and adds 1 to the midpoint until it finds a value where the number of trailing zeroes is greater than m. This ensures that the entire range of n values is included.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as m = 1, where the output should be 5 6 7 8 9. It also handles cases where there are no n values that result in exactly m trailing zeroes, in which case it outputs 0.

Overall, the program appears to correctly solve the problem and handle all edge cases. I was unable to find any examples where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that it is correct.
