Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements the problem description. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

- It calculates the minimum and maximum possible upvotes and downvotes by considering the range of possible votes from the unknown persons.
- It then checks the conditions for a certain outcome:
  - If the maximum possible upvotes are less than the minimum possible downvotes, it prints '-' because there's no way to get more upvotes than downvotes.
  - If the maximum possible downvotes are less than the minimum possible upvotes, it prints '+' because there's no way to get more downvotes than upvotes.
  - Otherwise, it prints '?' to indicate that the result is uncertain because there are multiple possible outcomes depending on how the unknown persons vote.

The program handles all possible cases correctly:

- When there are no unknown votes (z = 0), it correctly determines the outcome based on the number of upvotes and downvotes.
- When there are unknown votes, it correctly checks for the possibility of different outcomes and prints '?' if there's uncertainty.
- It also correctly handles edge cases such as when x, y, or z are 0.

The provided examples in the problem description demonstrate the program's correctness, and there are no obvious cases where the program would not work as expected. Therefore, the program is correct.
