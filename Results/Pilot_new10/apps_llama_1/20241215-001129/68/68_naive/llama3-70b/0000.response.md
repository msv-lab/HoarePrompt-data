Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not handle all cases correctly. For example, consider the case where x = 5, y = 3, and z = 3. In this case, the program will print '?' because x is greater than y, but less than or equal to y + z. However, if all z unknown persons upvote, the result will be '+', but if all z unknown persons downvote, the result will still be '+'. Therefore, the result is not uncertain, and the program should print '+'. 

However, the main issue with this code is the condition `elif x < y:` which only checks if x is less than y, but does not consider the case where x + z is greater than y. A more accurate condition would be `elif x + z < y:` to check if the maximum possible upvotes are still less than the downvotes. 

Similarly, the condition `if x > y + z:` only checks if x is greater than y + z, but does not consider the case where x is greater than y, but less than or equal to y + z, and z is not enough to change the result to 0 or -. 

Therefore, the code does not cover all possible cases correctly. 

Here's a modified version of the code:

```python
def func():
    (x, y, z) = map(int, input().split())
    if x + z < y:
        print('-')
    elif x > y + z:
        print('+')
    elif x == y and z == 0:
        print('0')
    elif x + z > y and y + z > x:
        print('?')
    else:
        print('0')
```
This modified code first checks if the maximum possible upvotes are less than the downvotes. If so, it prints '-'. Then, it checks if the minimum possible upvotes are greater than the downvotes. If so, it prints '+'. 
Then, it checks if x equals y and z equals 0. If so, it prints '0'. 
Finally, it checks if the result is uncertain by checking if the maximum possible upvotes are greater than the downvotes, and the minimum possible upvotes are less than the downvotes. If so, it prints '?'. Otherwise, it prints '0'. 

This modified version should handle all cases correctly.
