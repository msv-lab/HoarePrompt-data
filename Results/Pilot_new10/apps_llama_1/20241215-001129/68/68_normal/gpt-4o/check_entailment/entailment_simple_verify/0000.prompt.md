You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Nauuo is a girl who loves writing comments.

One day, she posted a comment on Codeforces, wondering whether she would get upvotes or downvotes.

It's known that there were $x$ persons who would upvote, $y$ persons who would downvote, and there were also another $z$ persons who would vote, but you don't know whether they would upvote or downvote. Note that each of the $x+y+z$ people would vote exactly one time.

There are three different results: if there are more people upvote than downvote, the result will be "+"; if there are more people downvote than upvote, the result will be "-"; otherwise the result will be "0".

Because of the $z$ unknown persons, the result may be uncertain (i.e. there are more than one possible results). More formally, the result is uncertain if and only if there exist two different situations of how the $z$ persons vote, that the results are different in the two situations.

Tell Nauuo the result or report that the result is uncertain.


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers $x$, $y$, $z$ ($0\le x,y,z\le100$), corresponding to the number of persons who would upvote, downvote or unknown.


-----Output-----

If there is only one possible result, print the result : "+", "-" or "0".

Otherwise, print "?" to report that the result is uncertain.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 7 0

Output
-
Input
2 0 1

Output
+
Input
1 1 0

Output
0
Input
0 0 1

Output
?


-----Note-----

In the first example, Nauuo would definitely get three upvotes and seven downvotes, so the only possible result is "-".

In the second example, no matter the person unknown downvotes or upvotes, Nauuo would get more upvotes than downvotes. So the only possible result is "+".

In the third example, Nauuo would definitely get one upvote and one downvote, so the only possible result is "0".

In the fourth example, if the only one person upvoted, the result would be "+", otherwise, the result would be "-". There are two possible results, so the result is uncertain.
Program:
```
def func():
    (x, y, z) = map(int, input().split())
    min_upvotes = x
    max_upvotes = x + z
    min_downvotes = y
    max_downvotes = y + z
    if max_upvotes < min_downvotes:
        print('-')
    elif max_downvotes < min_upvotes:
        print('+')
    else:
        print('?')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given program appears to be correct based on the problem description. It accurately determines the possible outcomes of the voting scenario and reports whether the result is certain or uncertain.

The program calculates the minimum and maximum number of upvotes and downvotes by considering the range of possible votes from the unknown persons. It then checks the conditions for a certain outcome:

- If the maximum number of upvotes is less than the minimum number of downvotes, the result is certainly "-" (more downvotes than upvotes).
- If the maximum number of downvotes is less than the minimum number of upvotes, the result is certainly "+" (more upvotes than downvotes).
- If neither of the above conditions is met, it means that there are overlapping possibilities, and the result is uncertain, so the program prints "?".

This logic aligns with the problem description, covering all scenarios:

- When there's no uncertainty because one side will always have more votes.
- When the outcome is certain to be a tie (though this specific case of a tie is covered under the uncertain category when z=0, as the program doesn't specifically check for x==y without z).
- When the outcome is uncertain due to the unknown persons' potential votes.

The provided examples and edge cases (like when z=0, or when x or y equals 0) are correctly handled by the program. Without finding a single case where the program does not behave as expected according to the problem description, we conclude that it is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no arguments, but it is implied that there are three non-negative integers x, y, z where 0 <= x, y, z <= 100, corresponding to the number of persons who would upvote, downvote or unknown.
def func():
    x, y, z = map(int, input().split())
    min_upvotes = x
    max_upvotes = x + z
    min_downvotes = y
    max_downvotes = y + z
    if (max_upvotes < min_downvotes) :
        print('-')
    else :
        if (max_downvotes < min_upvotes) :
            print('+')
        else :
            print('?')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `x` is the number of upvotes, `y` is the number of downvotes, `z` is the number of unknown votes, `min_upvotes` equals `x`, `max_upvotes` equals `x + z`, `min_downvotes` equals `y`, `max_downvotes` equals `y + z`, 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, `x + z` is greater than or equal to `y`. If `y + z` is less than `x`, then the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, a '?' has been printed and `y + z` is greater than or equal to `x`.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`x` is the number of upvotes, `y` is the number of downvotes, `z` is the number of unknown votes, `min_upvotes` equals `x`, `max_upvotes` equals `x + z`, `min_downvotes` equals `y`, `max_downvotes` equals `y + z`, 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100. If `x + z` is less than `y`, a string '-' has been returned. Otherwise, if `y + z` is less than `x`, the state remains unchanged; otherwise, a '?' has been printed and `y + z` is greater than or equal to `x`.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
