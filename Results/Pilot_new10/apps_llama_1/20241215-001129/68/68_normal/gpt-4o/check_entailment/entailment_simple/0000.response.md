Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. Here's why:

1. The program takes three integers `x`, `y`, and `z` as input, representing the number of upvotes, downvotes, and unknown votes, respectively.
2. It calculates the minimum and maximum number of upvotes and downvotes, considering the unknown votes. This is done using the variables `min_upvotes`, `max_upvotes`, `min_downvotes`, and `max_downvotes`.
3. The program then checks the following conditions:
   - If the maximum number of upvotes is less than the minimum number of downvotes, it prints `-`, indicating that the result will be a downvote.
   - If the maximum number of downvotes is less than the minimum number of upvotes, it prints `+`, indicating that the result will be an upvote.
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, it prints `?`, indicating that the result is uncertain.

This logic aligns with the problem description, which states that the result is uncertain if and only if there exist two different situations of how the `z` persons vote, resulting in different outcomes.

The program covers all possible cases:

* If `x + z < y`, the result will always be a downvote, so it prints `-`.
* If `y + z < x`, the result will always be an upvote, so it prints `+`.
* If `x + z >= y` and `y + z >= x`, the result is uncertain, so it prints `?`.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible scenarios, making it a correct implementation of the problem description.
