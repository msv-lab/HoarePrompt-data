Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. Here's why:

1. It calculates the minimum and maximum possible upvotes and downvotes based on the given input `x`, `y`, and `z`.
2. It checks if the maximum possible upvotes are less than the minimum possible downvotes. If so, it prints `-`, indicating that downvotes will definitely win.
3. If the condition in step 2 is not met, it checks if the minimum possible upvotes are greater than the maximum possible downvotes. If so, it prints `+`, indicating that upvotes will definitely win.
4. If neither of the conditions in steps 2 and 3 are met, it prints `?`, indicating that the outcome is uncertain.

The program's logic is sound, and it covers all possible cases. The conditions are mutually exclusive, and the program will always print exactly one of the three possible outputs: `-`, `+`, or `?`.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

* If `max_upvotes < min_downvotes`, downvotes will definitely win, so printing `-` is correct.
* If `max_downvotes < min_upvotes`, upvotes will definitely win, so printing `+` is correct.
* If neither of the above conditions is true, it means that the outcome is uncertain, so printing `?` is correct.

The program does not need to validate the input range or type, as it is assumed that the input is valid and consists of three non-negative integers `x`, `y`, and `z`.

Overall, the program correctly implements the problem description and will produce the correct output for all possible input combinations.
