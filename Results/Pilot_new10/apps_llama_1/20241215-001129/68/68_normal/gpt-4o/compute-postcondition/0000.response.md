The code `x, y, z = map(int, input().split())` assigns the values from the input to the variables `x`, `y`, and `z`. The input is expected to be three space-separated integers. Since the function takes no arguments but implies the existence of `x`, `y`, and `z` corresponding to the number of persons who would upvote, downvote, or unknown, and given that these are non-negative integers where 0 <= x, y, z <= 100, the output state reflects the updated values of `x`, `y`, and `z` based on the input provided.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, `z` are input integers where `x` is the number of upvotes, `y` is the number of downvotes, `z` is the number of unknown votes, and 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, all three are assigned values from the input.**
