The given code simply prints a question mark ('?') and does not modify any variables. Therefore, the values of `x`, `y`, `z`, `min_upvotes`, `max_upvotes`, `min_downvotes`, and `max_downvotes` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is the number of upvotes, `y` is the number of downvotes, `z` is the number of unknown votes, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`, 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, `x + z` is greater than or equal to `y`, `y + z` is greater than or equal to `x`, and a '?' has been printed**
