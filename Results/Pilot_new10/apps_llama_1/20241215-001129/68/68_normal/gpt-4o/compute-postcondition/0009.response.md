The given code snippet is a simple print statement that prints '+'. This operation does not modify any variables. 

The preconditions are: 
- `x` is the number of upvotes
- `y` is the number of downvotes
- `z` is the number of unknown votes
- `min_upvotes` equals `x`
- `max_upvotes` equals `x + z`
- `min_downvotes` equals `y`
- `max_downvotes` equals `y + z`
- 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100
- `x + z` is greater than or equal to `y` (maximum number of upvotes is greater than or equal to the minimum number of downvotes)
- `y + z` is less than `x` (current value of `max_downvotes` is less than the current value of `min_upvotes`)

Since the print statement does not change the values of any variables, all preconditions remain valid.

Output State: **`x` is the number of upvotes, `y` is the number of downvotes, `z` is the number of unknown votes, `min_upvotes` equals `x`, `max_upvotes` equals `x + z`, `min_downvotes` equals `y`, `max_downvotes` equals `y + z`, 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, `x + z` is greater than or equal to `y`, and `y + z` is less than `x`.**
