The value of `max_downvotes` is assigned to be `y + z`. The initial state contains information about the number of upvotes `x`, downvotes `y`, unknown votes `z`, as well as the minimum and maximum upvotes and downvotes. Since `x`, `y`, and `z` are within the range 0 to 100, the new variable `max_downvotes` will also be within a certain range but its exact value depends on `y` and `z`.

Given that `min_upvotes` equals `x`, `max_upvotes` equals `x + z`, `min_downvotes` equals `y`, and now `max_downvotes` equals `y + z`, and considering the constraints 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, we can infer the following:

- `x` remains the number of upvotes.
- `y` remains the number of downvotes.
- `z` remains the number of unknown votes.
- `min_upvotes` remains equal to `x`.
- `max_upvotes` remains equal to `x + z`.
- `min_downvotes` remains equal to `y`.
- `max_downvotes` is now equal to `y + z`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is the number of upvotes, `y` is the number of downvotes, `z` is the number of unknown votes, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`, and 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100.

Output State: **`x` is the number of upvotes, `y` is the number of downvotes, `z` is the number of unknown votes, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`, and 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100**
