Postcondition: **`x`, `y`, `z` are non-negative integers, each less than or equal to 100, representing the number of people who would upvote, downvote, and vote with unknown outcome, respectively, and their values are set to the input integers. The number of people who would upvote is less than or equal to the sum of the people who would downvote and those who would vote with unknown outcome, i.e., `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`. Additionally, `x` is greater than or equal to `y`.**
