The given code simply prints a question mark ('?') and does not modify any variables. Therefore, the states of the variables `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, `z` are non-negative integers, each less than or equal to 100, `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, `x` is not equal to `y`, and '?' has been printed.**
