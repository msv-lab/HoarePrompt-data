You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Recently Vasya found a golden ticket — a sequence which consists of $n$ digits $a_1a_2\dots a_n$. Vasya considers a ticket to be lucky if it can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums. For example, ticket $350178$ is lucky since it can be divided into three segments $350$, $17$ and $8$: $3+5+0=1+7=8$. Note that each digit of sequence should belong to exactly one segment.

Help Vasya! Tell him if the golden ticket he found is lucky or not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 100$) — the number of digits in the ticket.

The second line contains $n$ digits $a_1 a_2 \dots a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le 9$) — the golden ticket. Digits are printed without spaces.


-----Output-----

If the golden ticket is lucky then print "YES", otherwise print "NO" (both case insensitive).


-----Examples-----
Input
5
73452

Output
YES

Input
4
1248

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example the ticket can be divided into $7$, $34$ and $52$: $7=3+4=5+2$.

In the second example it is impossible to divide ticket into segments with equal sum.
Program:
```
n = int(input())
ticket = list(map(int, input()))
if func_1(ticket):
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')

def func_1(ticket):
    total_sum = sum(ticket)
    if total_sum % 2 != 0:
        return False
    target_sum = total_sum // 2
    curr_sum = 0
    segments = 0
    for digit in ticket:
        curr_sum += digit
        if curr_sum == target_sum:
            segments += 1
            curr_sum = 0
    return segments >= 2


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it only checks if the ticket can be divided into two segments with equal sums, but it does not handle cases where the ticket can be divided into more than two segments with equal sums.

The problem description states that a ticket is lucky if it can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums. However, the program only checks if the total sum of the ticket is divisible by 2 and if the ticket can be divided into two segments with equal sums.

A counterexample to the program is the ticket "350178". According to the problem description, this ticket is lucky because it can be divided into three segments with equal sums: 3+5+0=1+7=8. However, the program does not handle this case correctly because it only checks for two segments with equal sums.

The program should be modified to handle cases where the ticket can be divided into more than two segments with equal sums. One possible approach is to try all possible segment sizes and check if the ticket can be divided into segments with equal sums. 

The code in the problem only works when the two segments are at the start of the string, it wont work when the segments are somewhere else in the string. It also only works when there are exactly two segments. It does not work when there are more than two segments.

For example the input "3 5 0 1 7 8" will work with the code but if the input is "350 17 8" it wont work, it wont work because it only works with two segments, not with any amount of segments larger than 2. 

Another issue is it does not consider all possible segment sizes. 

For example the string "111" can be divided into 3 segments of size 1 but the program wont find this. 

All these edge cases and more make the program not work as expected.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a string of digits, checks if the total sum of the digits is even, and if so, attempts to divide the string into segments summing up to half of the total sum, returning True if at least two such segments exist and False otherwise; if the total sum is odd, it immediately returns False, but it does not handle cases of non-string inputs or strings containing non-digit characters. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
