Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle cases where the segments should have a sum other than half of the total sum. The problem description states that the ticket is lucky if it can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums, but it does not specify that the sum of the segments should be half of the total sum. 

For example, consider the ticket 111111. The code will return 'NO' because the total sum of the digits (6) is even, but it cannot be divided into two segments with a sum of 3. However, the ticket can be divided into three segments with a sum of 2: 1+1, 1+1, and 1+1 are not the segments, but 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 -> 2, 2, 2 does not work but 1+1 = 2, 1+1 = 2, 1+1 = 2. However 6/3 = 2 segments with sum 2, which indeed divides into three segments but two is also fine (2, 2, 2 is not what we want, but 1+1, 1+1, 1+1 is fine so we just need to loop through each segment possibility and make sure we don't miss any.

In general, the code should check for all possible segment sums, not just half of the total sum. 

The code should loop through each possible segment sum from 1 to the total sum and check if the ticket can be divided into two or more segments with that sum. If such a sum is found, the code should return 'YES', otherwise it should return 'NO'. 

Here is an example of how the corrected code could look like:

```python
n = int(input())
ticket = list(map(int, input()))

def func_1(ticket):
    total_sum = sum(ticket)
    for target_sum in range(1, total_sum + 1):
        curr_sum = 0
        segments = 0
        valid = True
        for digit in ticket:
            curr_sum += digit
            if curr_sum == target_sum:
                segments += 1
                curr_sum = 0
            elif curr_sum > target_sum:
                valid = False
                break
        if valid and segments >= 2 and curr_sum == 0:
            return True
    return False

if func_1(ticket):
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```

This code will correctly determine if a given ticket is lucky according to the problem description.
