Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. 

The issue with the program lies in its assumption that the sum of each segment must be exactly half of the total sum of the ticket. However, the problem description does not specify this; it only requires that the ticket can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums.

For example, consider the ticket "73452". According to the problem description, this ticket is lucky because it can be divided into segments "7", "34", and "52", where each segment has a sum of 7, 7, and 7, respectively. However, the program will not consider this ticket as lucky because the total sum of the ticket is 21, and half of 21 is 10.5, which is not an integer. Therefore, the program will immediately return False.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should try all possible segment sums, not just half of the total sum. It should also ensure that each digit belongs to exactly one segment. 

Here's an example of how the corrected program could work:
- Generate all possible segment sums from the ticket.
- For each segment sum, try to divide the ticket into segments that sum up to this value.
- If a division is found that uses all digits and has at least two segments, return True.
- If no such division is found for any segment sum, return False. 

Here is some sample Python code that implements this approach:
```python
from itertools import chain, combinations

def powerset(iterable):
    "powerset([1,2,3]) --> () (1,) (2,) (3,) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (1,2,3)"
    s = list(iterable)
    return chain.from_iterable(combinations(s, r) for r in range(len(s)+1))

def func_1(ticket):
    n = len(ticket)
    for segment_sum in range(1, sum(ticket) + 1):
        curr_pos = 0
        segments = 0
        while curr_pos < n:
            curr_sum = 0
            for i in range(curr_pos, n):
                curr_sum += ticket[i]
                if curr_sum == segment_sum:
                    segments += 1
                    curr_pos = i + 1
                    break
                elif curr_sum > segment_sum:
                    break
            else:
                break
        if curr_pos == n and segments >= 2:
            return True
    return False

n = int(input())
ticket = list(map(int, input()))
if func_1(ticket):
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
