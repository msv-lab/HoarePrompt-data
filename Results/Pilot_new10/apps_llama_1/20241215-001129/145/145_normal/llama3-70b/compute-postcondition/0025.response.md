The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `ticket`, which is a string of digits where each digit is between '0' and '9'. After executing the function body, the function returns a value based on the following cases:

- Case_1: The function returns False. 
- Case_2: The function checks if there are at least 2 segments in 'ticket' that sum up to 'target_sum', which is half of the even 'total_sum' of the digits in 'ticket'. If the condition is met, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a string of digits `ticket` and return a boolean value indicating whether there are at least 2 segments in 'ticket' that sum up to half of the even total sum of the digits, or return False in the first case.
