The code initializes a new variable `curr_sum` and sets it to 0. This operation does not affect the values of `ticket`, `total_sum`, or `target_sum`. 

`ticket` is still a string of digits where each digit is between '0' and '9'. 
`total_sum` is still the sum of the digits in `ticket` and remains even. 
`target_sum` is still `total_sum // 2` or half of `total_sum`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `ticket` is a string of digits where each digit is between '0' and '9', `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket` and is even, `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`, and `curr_sum` is 0.
Output State: **`ticket` is a string of digits where each digit is between '0' and '9', `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket` and is even, `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`, and `curr_sum` is 0**
