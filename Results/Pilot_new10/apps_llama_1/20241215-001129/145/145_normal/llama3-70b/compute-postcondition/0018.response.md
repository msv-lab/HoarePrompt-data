To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `ticket` is a non-empty string of digits where each digit is between '0' and '9' and has at least two digits.
- `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket` and is even.
- `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`.
- If `curr_sum` equals `target_sum`, then `segments` is 2, `digit` is the second digit in `ticket`, and `curr_sum` is 0. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.
- `digit` is the second digit in `ticket`.

The loop statement is `for digit in ticket:`. For this loop to execute again, it means we are moving to the next digit in the `ticket` string.

Adjusting the states:
- Since `digit` was the second digit in `ticket` during the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `digit` should now be the third digit in `ticket`. This implies `ticket` must have at least three digits.
- The `total_sum` and `target_sum` remain unchanged because they are calculated based on the entire `ticket` string, not on the current position of the loop.
- If `curr_sum` had reached `target_sum` and was reset to 0, and `segments` was set to 2, these conditions are based on the calculation within the loop body which we cannot see. However, since we are considering the next iteration, the values of `curr_sum` and `segments` could potentially change based on the loop's internal logic, but their exact new state cannot be determined without the loop body. Assuming no explicit change mentioned for the next iteration in the problem statement, we focus on what must change for the loop to continue, which is the position in the string `ticket`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time:
- `ticket` must have at least three digits because we've moved past the second digit.
- Other states like `total_sum`, `target_sum`, `segments`, and `curr_sum` would be as per the previous iteration unless specified otherwise by internal loop logic, which is not provided.

State: **`ticket` is a non-empty string of digits where each digit is between '0' and '9' and has at least three digits, `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket` and is even, `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`, `digit` is the third digit in `ticket`**
