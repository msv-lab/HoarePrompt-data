Postcondition: **`ticket` is a non-empty string of digits where each digit is between '0' and '9', `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket` and is even, `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`. If `curr_sum` equals `target_sum`, then `curr_sum` is 0, `segments` is 1, and `digit` is the first digit in `ticket` with its integer value equal to `target_sum`. If `curr_sum` does not equal `target_sum`, then the state of the variables remains as initially described in the precondition, with `curr_sum` equal to the integer value of the first digit in `ticket`, `segments` is 0, and `digit` is the first digit in `ticket`.**
