The function calculates the sum of digits in a string `ticket` from index `start` to `end` (inclusive), assuming `ticket` contains only digits and `start` and `end` are valid, non-negative indices where `start <= end < len(ticket)`, but does not handle cases of non-digit characters, out-of-bounds indices, or invalid input types for `start` and `end`.
