Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 2, `ticket` is a string of `n` digits where each digit is a non-negative integer less than 10, `segment_length` is 2, `target_sum` is the sum of the first two digits of `ticket`, `current_sum` is the sum of the last sequence of digits not equal to `target_sum` or 0 if the last sequence equals `target_sum`, `segment_count` is the number of sequences of digits that sum up to `target_sum`, and `i` is `n-1`. The current value of `current_sum` is 0 and the current value of `segment_count` is greater than 1.**
