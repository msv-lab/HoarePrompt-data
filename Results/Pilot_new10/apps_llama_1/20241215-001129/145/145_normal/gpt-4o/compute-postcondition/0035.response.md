To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is: 
- `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 3,
- `ticket` is a string of `n` digits,
- `segment_length` is 2,
- `target_sum` is `int(ticket[0]) + int(ticket[1])`,
- `i` is 3.

Given the code `current_sum += int(ticket[i])`, we need to understand that `current_sum` is being incremented by the value of the digit at index `i` in the `ticket` string. Since `i` is 3, this means we're adding the 4th digit of the `ticket` string to `current_sum`.

However, the initial state does not explicitly define `current_sum`. Given the context, it seems `current_sum` should be related to the `target_sum` or the sum of certain digits in the `ticket`. But without an explicit initial value for `current_sum`, we can only describe its update in relation to `ticket` and `i`.

Thus, after executing the code, `current_sum` will be its previous value (which is not specified) plus the integer value of the 4th character of `ticket`. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state, considering the information provided and the operation performed, is:
- `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 3,
- `ticket` is a string of `n` digits,
- `segment_length` is 2,
- `target_sum` is `int(ticket[0]) + int(ticket[1])`,
- `i` is 3,
- `current_sum` is its previous value plus `int(ticket[3])`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 3, `ticket` is a string of `n` digits, `segment_length` is 2, `target_sum` is `int(ticket[0]) + int(ticket[1])`, `i` is 3, `current_sum` is its previous value plus `int(ticket[3])`**
