To calculate the output state, we first need to consider the initial values and the operation performed.

- `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 4.
- `ticket` is a string of `n` digits.
- `segment_length` is 2.
- `target_sum` is `int(ticket[0]) + int(ticket[1])`.
- `i` is 4.
- `current_sum` is being updated by adding the integer value of the character at index `i` in `ticket`.

Since `i` is 4, we are adding the 5th digit of `ticket` to `current_sum`. The initial value of `current_sum` is not provided, but based on the given information, we can deduce that its value before this operation is not explicitly defined. However, after this operation, `current_sum` will be its previous value (if any) plus the integer value of `ticket[4]`.

Given that `n` is greater than 4, `ticket` has at least 5 digits, ensuring that `ticket[4]` is a valid operation.

The states of `n`, `ticket`, `segment_length`, `target_sum`, and `i` are not changed by this operation. Only the value of `current_sum` is updated.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 4, `ticket` is a string of `n` digits, `segment_length` is 2, `target_sum` is `int(ticket[0]) + int(ticket[1])`, `i` is 4, and `current_sum` is its previous value plus `int(ticket[4])`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 4, `ticket` is a string of `n` digits, `segment_length` is 2, `target_sum` is `int(ticket[0]) + int(ticket[1])`, `i` is 4, and `current_sum` is its previous value plus `int(ticket[4])`**
