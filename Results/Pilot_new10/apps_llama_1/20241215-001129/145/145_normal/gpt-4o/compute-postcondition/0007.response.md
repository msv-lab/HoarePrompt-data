The value of `current_sum` is reset to 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `ticket` is a string of `n` digits where each digit is a non-negative integer less than 10, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is the integer value of the first digit of `ticket`, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 0, and `i` is 0.
