The code resets the value of `current_sum` to 0. The previous values of the other variables are not affected. 

`n` is still a non-negative integer greater than 1, 
`ticket` is still a string of `n` digits where each digit is a non-negative integer less than 10, 
`segment_length` is still 1, 
`target_sum` is still the integer value of the first digit of `ticket`, 
`segment_count` is still the value it was before, 
`i` is still 1.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `ticket` is a string of `n` digits where each digit is a non-negative integer less than 10, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is the integer value of the first digit of `ticket`, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is the value it was before, `i` is 1**
