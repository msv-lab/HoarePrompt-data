The value of `current_sum` is increased by the integer value of the digit at index `i` in `ticket`. The value of `i` is 1, and `ticket` is a string of `n` digits. The digit at index 1 is the second digit of `ticket`. Since `target_sum` is the sum of the first three digits of `ticket`, and `current_sum` is the current sum, we can infer that `current_sum` initially had the value of the first digit of `ticket`. Now, `current_sum` is increased by the second digit of `ticket`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 3, `ticket` is a string of `n` digits where each digit is a non-negative integer less than 10, `segment_length` is 3, `target_sum` is the sum of the first three digits of `ticket`, `current_sum` is the sum of the first two digits of `ticket`, `segment_count` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 1**
