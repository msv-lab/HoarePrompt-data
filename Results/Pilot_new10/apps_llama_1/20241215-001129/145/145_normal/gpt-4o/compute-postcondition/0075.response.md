The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, a non-negative integer greater than 1, and `ticket`, a string of `n` digits where each digit is a non-negative integer less than 10. 

Looking at the code, it iterates over all possible segment lengths from 1 to `n-1` and checks if the `ticket` string can be divided into segments of the current length, where the sum of digits in each segment is equal to the sum of digits in the first segment. 

If it finds such a division for any segment length, and there is more than one segment, it immediately returns 'YES'. 

If it checks all segment lengths and doesn't find such a division, it returns 'NO'.

However, there is a missing function `segment_sum` which is called in the line `target_sum = segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1)`. This function is not defined in the given annotated code, but based on its usage, it seems to calculate the sum of digits in the `ticket` string from index 0 to `segment_length - 1`.

Considering the potential edge cases, the function does not handle cases where `n` is less than or equal to 1, or where `ticket` is not a string of `n` digits. 

Also, the function does not check if the segments are non-empty, which could lead to incorrect results if the `ticket` string starts with zeros.

The functionality of the function is to check if the `ticket` string can be divided into segments of the same sum, where the sum is equal to the sum of the first segment, and return 'YES' if such a division exists, or 'NO' otherwise.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` greater than 1 and a string `ticket` of `n` digits, and returns 'YES' if the `ticket` string can be divided into two or more segments of the same sum, where the sum is equal to the sum of the first segment, and 'NO' otherwise, assuming the existence of a `segment_sum` function to calculate the sum of digits in a given range of the `ticket` string. **
