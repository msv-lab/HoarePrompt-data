Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `ticket` is a string of `n` digits where each digit is a non-negative integer less than 10, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is the integer value of the first digit of the original `ticket`, `current_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket` not forming complete segments of sum `target_sum`, and `segment_count` is the number of complete segments found in `ticket` where the sum of digits equals `target_sum`. The current value of `current_sum` is 0, and the current value of `segment_count` is greater than 1.**
