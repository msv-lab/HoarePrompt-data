Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 2, `ticket` is a string of `n` digits where each digit is a non-negative integer less than 10, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is the integer value of the first digit of `ticket`, `i` is 2, if `current_sum` equals `target_sum`, then `current_sum` is 0 and `segment_count` is increased by 1, otherwise the state of the variables remains as in the precondition with `current_sum` being its previous value plus `int(ticket[2])`***
