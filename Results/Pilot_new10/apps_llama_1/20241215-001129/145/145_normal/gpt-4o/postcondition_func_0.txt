The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` greater than 1 and a string `ticket` of `n` digits, and returns 'YES' if the `ticket` string can be divided into two or more segments of the same sum, where the sum is equal to the sum of the first segment, and 'NO' otherwise, assuming the existence of a `segment_sum` function to calculate the sum of digits in a given range of the `ticket` string.
