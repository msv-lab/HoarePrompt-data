You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Salem gave you $n$ sticks with integer positive lengths $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$.

For every stick, you can change its length to any other positive integer length (that is, either shrink or stretch it). The cost of changing the stick's length from $a$ to $b$ is $|a - b|$, where $|x|$ means the absolute value of $x$.

A stick length $a_i$ is called almost good for some integer $t$ if $|a_i - t| \le 1$.

Salem asks you to change the lengths of some sticks (possibly all or none), such that all sticks' lengths are almost good for some positive integer $t$ and the total cost of changing is minimum possible. The value of $t$ is not fixed in advance and you can choose it as any positive integer. 

As an answer, print the value of $t$ and the minimum cost. If there are multiple optimal choices for $t$, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 1000$) — the number of sticks.

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_i$ ($1 \le a_i \le 100$) — the lengths of the sticks.


-----Output-----

Print the value of $t$ and the minimum possible cost. If there are multiple optimal choices for $t$, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
10 1 4

Output
3 7

Input
5
1 1 2 2 3

Output
2 0



-----Note-----

In the first example, we can change $1$ into $2$ and $10$ into $4$ with cost $|1 - 2| + |10 - 4| = 1 + 6 = 7$ and the resulting lengths $[2, 4, 4]$ are almost good for $t = 3$.

In the second example, the sticks lengths are already almost good for $t = 2$, so we don't have to do anything.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: There exists a list of positive integers, which will be referred to as the stick lengths, where each integer is in the range of 1 to 100, and the count of stick lengths is in the range of 1 to 1000. This list of stick lengths will be provided as input to the function.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    sticks = list(map(int, input().split()))
    sticks.sort()
    mid = sticks[n // 2]
    cost = sum(abs(x - mid) for x in sticks)
    t = mid
    min_cost = cost
    min_t = t
    for i in range(mid - 1, 0, -1):
        cost = sum(min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i + 1))) for x in sticks)
        
        if cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = cost
            min_t = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sticks` is a sorted list of positive integers, each in the range of 1 to 100, and the count of these stick lengths is in the range of 1 to 1000; `n` is an input integer that is at least 2 if the loop executes, or any integer if the loop does not execute; `mid` is the `n // 2`-th element in `sticks` and is at least 1; `t` is equal to `mid`; `min_cost` is the minimum sum of the minimum absolute differences between each stick length in `sticks` and either `i` or `i + 1` for any `i` from 1 to `mid`; `min_t` is the value of `i` that achieves this minimum sum.
    for i in range(mid + 1, 101):
        cost = sum(min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i - 1))) for x in sticks)
        
        if cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = cost
            min_t = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sticks` is a sorted list of positive integers, `n` is an integer, `mid` is the `n // 2`-th element in `sticks`, `t` equals `mid`, `min_cost` is the minimum sum of the minimum absolute differences between each stick length in `sticks` and either `i` or `i - 1` for any `i` from `mid + 1` to `100`, and `min_t` is the value of `i` that achieves this minimum sum.
    print(min_t, min_cost)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of stick lengths, calculates the median, and then finds the stick length that minimizes the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each stick length and either the current length or the adjacent length, printing this stick length and the corresponding minimum cost.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
