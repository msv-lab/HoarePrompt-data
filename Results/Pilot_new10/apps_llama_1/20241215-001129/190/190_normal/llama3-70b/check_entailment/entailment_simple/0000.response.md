Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem described. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Sorting the stick lengths**: The program sorts the stick lengths in ascending order. This is not explicitly required by the problem description, but it simplifies the implementation and does not affect the correctness of the solution.

2. **Initial cost calculation**: The program calculates the initial cost by summing the absolute differences between each stick length and the middle stick length (`mid`). This is a reasonable initial guess for the minimum cost.

3. **Search for the optimal `t`**: The program then searches for the optimal `t` by iterating over all possible values of `t` from `mid - 1` down to 1 and from `mid + 1` up to 100. For each `t`, it calculates the cost by summing the minimum absolute differences between each stick length and either `t` or `t - 1` (or `t + 1` for the upper range). This ensures that each stick length is either `t`, `t - 1`, or `t + 1`, which meets the condition of being "almost good" for `t`.

4. **Updating the minimum cost and `t`**: If the calculated cost for a given `t` is less than the current minimum cost, the program updates the minimum cost and the corresponding `t`.

5. **Printing the result**: Finally, the program prints the optimal `t` and the minimum cost.

The program covers all possible values of `t` and calculates the cost for each one, ensuring that it finds the minimum cost and the corresponding `t`. The use of `min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i + 1)))` (or `min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i - 1)))`) in the cost calculation ensures that each stick length is assigned to either `t`, `t - 1`, or `t + 1`, which meets the problem's requirements.

Overall, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem and should produce the expected output for all valid inputs.
