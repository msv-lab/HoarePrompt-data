To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop condition and the updates made at the end of the previous iteration.

Given the loop statement:
```
for i in range(mid + 1, 101):
```
The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 101.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `sticks` is a sorted list of positive integers with a length of at least `n // 2` where `n // 2` is less than or equal to 1000 and the `n // 2`-th element is less than 100.
- `n` is at least 2 and `n // 2` is a valid index for `sticks`.
- `mid` is less than 100.
- If `cost` < `min_cost`, then `i` is `mid + 2`, `t` remains unchanged, `cost` is the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each `x` in `sticks` and `mid + 2` and `mid + 1`, `min_cost` is equal to `cost`, and `min_t` is `mid + 2`; otherwise, `i`, `t`, `cost`, `min_cost`, and `min_t` retain their previous values.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than 101. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at the end of each iteration, we can conclude that `i` will be incremented by 1 from its current value. 

So, if `cost` < `min_cost`, then `i` was set to `mid + 2` at the end of the previous iteration, and it needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. Otherwise, `i` retains its previous value and also needs to be incremented by 1.

Given these conditions, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:
- `sticks` remains a sorted list of positive integers with a length of at least `n // 2` where `n // 2` is less than or equal to 1000 and the `n // 2`-th element is less than 100.
- `n` is at least 2 and `n // 2` is a valid index for `sticks`.
- `mid` is less than 100.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

State: **`sticks` is a sorted list of positive integers with a length of at least `n // 2` where `n // 2` is less than or equal to 1000 and the `n // 2`-th element is less than 100, `n` is at least 2 and `n // 2` is a valid index for `sticks`, `mid` is less than 100, `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1, `t` remains unchanged, `cost` remains unchanged, `min_cost` remains unchanged, and `min_t` remains unchanged**
