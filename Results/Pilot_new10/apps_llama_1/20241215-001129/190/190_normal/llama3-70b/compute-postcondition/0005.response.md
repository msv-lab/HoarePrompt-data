The value of `t` is assigned the value of `mid`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
`sticks` is still a sorted list of positive integers, each in the range of 1 to 100, and the count of these stick lengths is in the range of 1 to 1000; 
`n` is still an input integer; 
`mid` is still the `n // 2`-th element in `sticks`; 
`cost` is still equal to `sum(abs(x - mid) for x in sticks)`. 
Therefore, the Output State is: 
`sticks` is a sorted list of positive integers, each in the range of 1 to 100, and the count of these stick lengths is in the range of 1 to 1000; 
`n` is an input integer; 
`mid` is the `n // 2`-th element in `sticks`; 
`cost` is equal to `sum(abs(x - mid) for x in sticks)`;
`t` is equal to `mid`.
Output State: **`sticks` is a sorted list of positive integers, each in the range of 1 to 100, and the count of these stick lengths is in the range of 1 to 1000; `n` is an input integer; `mid` is the `n // 2`-th element in `sticks`; `cost` is equal to `sum(abs(x - mid) for x in sticks)`; `t` is equal to `mid`**
