To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

1. The initial state gives us several variables and their conditions:
   - `sticks` is a sorted list of positive integers, each in the range of 1 to 100, and the count of these stick lengths is in the range of 1 to 1000.
   - `n` is an input integer that is at least 2.
   - `mid` is the `n // 2`-th element in `sticks` and is at least 2.
   - `t` is equal to `mid`.
   - Initially, `min_cost` was equal to `sum(abs(x - mid) for x in sticks)`, which means it's the sum of absolute differences between each stick length and the `mid` value.
   - Initially, `min_t` was equal to `mid`.
   - `i` is `mid - 1`.
   - Initially, `cost` was equal to `sum(min(abs(x - (mid - 1)), abs(x - mid)) for x in sticks)`, which means it's the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each stick length and either `mid - 1` or `mid`, whichever is smaller.
   - The current value of `cost` is less than the current value of `min_cost`.

2. The code provided is `min_cost = cost`. This line updates the value of `min_cost` to be equal to the current value of `cost`.

3. Given that `cost` is less than the previous `min_cost` and now `min_cost` is updated to be equal to `cost`, we can conclude:
   - `sticks`, `n`, `mid`, `t`, `i`, and the relationship of `cost` being the sum of minimum absolute differences remain unchanged.
   - `min_cost` is now equal to `cost`, which is `sum(min(abs(x - (mid - 1)), abs(x - mid)) for x in sticks)`.
   - `min_t`'s value is not updated in the given code, so it remains equal to `mid`.

Output State: **`sticks` is a sorted list of positive integers, each in the range of 1 to 100, and the count of these stick lengths is in the range of 1 to 1000; `n` is an input integer that is at least 2; `mid` is the `n // 2`-th element in `sticks` and is at least 2; `t` is equal to `mid`; `min_cost` is equal to `cost`, which is `sum(min(abs(x - (mid - 1)), abs(x - mid)) for x in sticks)`; `min_t` is equal to `mid`; `i` is `mid - 1`; `cost` is less than the previous value of `min_cost` but now equal to the updated `min_cost`.**
