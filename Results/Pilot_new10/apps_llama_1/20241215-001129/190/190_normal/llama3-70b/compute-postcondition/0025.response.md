To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given loop statement and the initial state.

The loop statement is:
```python
for i in range(mid + 1, 101):
    # the loop body is omitted
```
This loop will execute if `mid + 1` is less than 101, which means `mid` must be less than 100.

Given the initial state:
- `sticks` is a sorted list of positive integers, each in the range of 1 to 100, and the count of these stick lengths is in the range of 1 to 1000.
- `n` is an input integer that is at least 2 if the loop executes, or any integer if the loop does not execute.
- `mid` is the `n // 2`-th element in `sticks` and is at least 1.
- `t` is equal to `mid`.
- `min_cost` is the minimum sum of the minimum absolute differences between each stick length in `sticks` and either `i` or `i + 1` for any `i` from 1 to `mid`.
- `min_t` is the value of `i` that achieves this minimum sum.

For the loop to execute, we need `mid + 1` to be less than 101, which implies `mid` must be less than 100. Since `mid` is at least 1 and is the `n // 2`-th element in `sticks`, and given that `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to potentially execute, we also know that `n` must be such that `n // 2` corresponds to a valid index in `sticks` that is less than 100.

Therefore, for the loop to execute:
- `sticks` must have at least `n // 2` elements where `n // 2` is less than or equal to the length of `sticks` and the `n // 2`-th element is less than 100.
- `n` must be at least 2 and such that `n // 2` is a valid index for `sticks`.
- `mid` must be less than 100.
- `i` starts at `mid + 1`, so initially, `i` is `mid + 1`.
- The rest of the variables (`t`, `min_cost`, `min_t`) are dependent on the loop body which is not provided, so their initial states before the loop executes are as given, but their relevance to the loop's execution condition is through `mid` and the length of `sticks`.

State: **`sticks` is a sorted list of positive integers with a length of at least `n // 2` where `n // 2` is less than or equal to 1000 and the `n // 2`-th element is less than 100, `n` is at least 2 and `n // 2` is a valid index for `sticks`, `mid` is less than 100, `t` is equal to `mid`, `min_cost` is defined based on `mid` and `sticks`, `min_t` is defined based on `min_cost`, and `i` is `mid + 1`.**
