Postcondition: ***`sticks` is a sorted list of positive integers with a length of at least `n // 2` where `n // 2` is less than or equal to 1000 and the `n // 2`-th element is less than 100, `n` is at least 2 and `n // 2` is a valid index for `sticks`, `mid` is less than 100. If `sum(min(abs(x - (mid + 1)), abs(x - mid)) for x in sticks)` is less than the initial `min_cost`, then `t` is `mid`, `min_t` is `mid + 1`, `i` is `mid + 1`, and `cost` equals `min_cost` equals `sum(min(abs(x - (mid + 1)), abs(x - mid)) for x in sticks)`. Otherwise, `t`, `min_t`, `i`, and `cost` remain unchanged.***
