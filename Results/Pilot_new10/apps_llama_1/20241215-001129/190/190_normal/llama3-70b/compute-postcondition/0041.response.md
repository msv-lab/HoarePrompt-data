To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the loop's behavior based on the given information and the loop code itself.

The loop iterates from `mid + 1` to `100`. In each iteration, it calculates the `cost` as the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each stick length in `sticks` and either `i` or `i - 1`. If this `cost` is less than the current `min_cost`, it updates `min_cost` with this new `cost` and sets `min_t` to the current `i`.

Given the initial state and the loop's behavior, we can deduce the following:

- `sticks` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `n` also remains unchanged for the same reason.
- `mid` is initially set to the `n // 2`-th element in `sticks` and does not change throughout the loop's execution.
- `t` is initially set to `mid` but does not get updated within the loop based on the provided code.
- `min_cost` starts with a value that represents the minimum sum of the minimum absolute differences between each stick length in `sticks` and either `mid` or `mid + 1`. However, this initial value is not explicitly given in the initial state, but based on the loop's logic, `min_cost` will be updated to be the minimum `cost` found throughout the loop's iterations.
- `min_t` is the value of `i` that achieves the minimum `cost`. Initially, it might not be explicitly set to a meaningful value related to `mid`, but after the loop, it will hold the value of `i` that resulted in the minimum `cost`.
- `i` iterates from `mid + 1` to `100`, and its final value after the loop will be `101`, as it increments one last time before exiting the loop.
- `cost` is a temporary variable used to calculate the sum of the minimum absolute differences for each `i`. Its value after the loop is not of interest, as `min_cost` and `min_t` hold the relevant information.

Considering the loop's logic and the initial state, the loop will execute if `n` is at least `2` and `mid` (the `n // 2`-th element in `sticks`) is less than `100`, ensuring that there is at least one iteration (`mid + 1` to `100`).

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished can be summarized as follows:

- `sticks` is a sorted list of positive integers, each in the range of 1 to 100, with a count in the range of 1 to 1000.
- `n` is an integer, which must be at least 2 for the loop to execute.
- `mid` is the `n // 2`-th element in `sticks`, initially set and unchanged.
- `t` equals `mid`, set initially and not modified by the loop.
- `min_cost` is the minimum sum of the minimum absolute differences between each stick length in `sticks` and either `i` or `i - 1` for any `i` from `mid + 1` to `100`.
- `min_t` is the value of `i` (from `mid + 1` to `100`) that achieves this minimum sum.
- `i` will be `101` after the loop finishes, as it increments one last time before exiting.

Output State: **`sticks` is a sorted list of positive integers, `n` is an integer, `mid` is the `n // 2`-th element in `sticks`, `t` equals `mid`, `min_cost` is the minimum sum of the minimum absolute differences between each stick length in `sticks` and either `i` or `i - 1` for any `i` from `mid + 1` to `100`, and `min_t` is the value of `i` that achieves this minimum sum.**
