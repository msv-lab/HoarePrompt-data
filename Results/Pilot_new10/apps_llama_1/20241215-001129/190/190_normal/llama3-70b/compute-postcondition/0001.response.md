The list of stick lengths is assigned the value of a list of integers, where each integer is in the range of 1 to 100 and the count of these stick lengths is in the range of 1 to 1000, as a result of the `input().split()` function, which splits the input string into a list of strings, and `map(int,...)`, which converts each string in the list to an integer. `n` is an input integer.

Output State: **The list of stick lengths `sticks` is a list of positive integers, each in the range of 1 to 100, and the count of these stick lengths is in the range of 1 to 1000; `n` is an input integer.**
