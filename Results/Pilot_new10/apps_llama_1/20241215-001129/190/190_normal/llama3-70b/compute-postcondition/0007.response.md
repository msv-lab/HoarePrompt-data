The value of `min_t` is assigned the value of `t`, which is equal to `mid`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `sticks` is a sorted list of positive integers, each in the range of 1 to 100, and the count of these stick lengths is in the range of 1 to 1000; `n` is an input integer; `mid` is the `n // 2`-th element in `sticks`; `cost` is equal to `sum(abs(x - mid) for x in sticks)`; `t` is equal to `mid`; `min_cost` is equal to `sum(abs(x - mid) for x in sticks)`; `min_t` is equal to `mid`.
