The value of `min_t` is updated to `i`, which is `mid - 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `sticks` is a sorted list of positive integers, each in the range of 1 to 100, and the count of these stick lengths is in the range of 1 to 1000; `n` is an input integer that is at least 2; `mid` is the `n // 2`-th element in `sticks` and is at least 2; `t` is equal to `mid`; `i` is `mid - 2`; `cost` is equal to the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each stick length in `sticks` and either `mid - 2` or `mid - 1`; `min_cost` is equal to `cost`; `min_t` is equal to `mid - 2`.
