The value of `cost` is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between each stick length `x` in `sticks` and the middle value `mid`. The value of `mid` is the `n // 2`-th element in `sticks`, where `n` is an input integer. 

The states of `sticks` and `n` are not affected, and `mid` remains the same. 

`cost` is assigned the value of the sum of the absolute differences between each stick length `x` in `sticks` and `mid`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `sticks` is a sorted list of positive integers, each in the range of 1 to 100, and the count of these stick lengths is in the range of 1 to 1000; `n` is an input integer; `mid` is the `n // 2`-th element in `sticks`; `cost` is the sum of the absolute differences between each stick length `x` in `sticks` and `mid`.
Output State: **`sticks` is a sorted list of positive integers, each in the range of 1 to 100, and the count of these stick lengths is in the range of 1 to 1000; `n` is an input integer; `mid` is the `n // 2`-th element in `sticks`; `cost` is equal to `sum(abs(x - mid) for x in sticks)`**
