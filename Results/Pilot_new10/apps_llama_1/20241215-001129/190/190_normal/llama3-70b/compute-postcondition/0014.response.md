To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we should analyze the given loop statement and the current state.

The loop statement is `for i in range(mid - 1, 0, -1)`. This means the loop will iterate from `mid - 1` down to `1`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be `mid - 1` if we were considering the loop's progression. However, since we're looking at the state after the previous iteration and before the next one, we need to adjust `i` to the next value in the sequence, which would be `mid - 2` if the loop were to continue.

Given that `mid` is at least 2 and is the `n // 2`-th element in `sticks`, and considering the loop condition, for the loop to execute again, `mid - 2` must be greater than or equal to `1` because the loop's range stops when `i` reaches `0` (exclusive).

The state of `n`, `sticks`, `t`, `min_cost`, `min_t`, and `cost` does not directly depend on the loop variable `i` in the context of the loop's execution condition. Thus, their values are not adjusted based solely on the loop's progression from one iteration to the next.

Therefore, considering the decrement of `i` by `1` for the next iteration and the constraints provided:

State: **`sticks` is a sorted list of positive integers, each in the range of 1 to 100, and the count of these stick lengths is in the range of 1 to 1000; `n` is an input integer that is at least 2; `mid` is the `n // 2`-th element in `sticks` and is at least 2; `t` is equal to `mid`; `i` is `mid - 2`; `min_cost`, `min_t`, and `cost` retain their values unless updated within the loop body, which is not provided.**
