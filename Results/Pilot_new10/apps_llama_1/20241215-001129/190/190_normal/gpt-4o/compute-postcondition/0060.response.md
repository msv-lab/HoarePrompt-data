Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 1 element, the initial value of `length` is the first element in `a` and the current value of `length` is greater than `t + 1`, where `t` is 3, and the current value of `length` is more than 4, `current_cost` is 0**
