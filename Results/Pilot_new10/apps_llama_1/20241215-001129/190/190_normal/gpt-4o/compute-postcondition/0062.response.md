Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 1 element, `t` is 3. If `length` is greater than 4, `length` is at least 5 and is the first element in `a`, and `current_cost` is `length - 4`. If `length` is less than or equal to 4, the state of `current_cost` and other variables remains as initially described in the precondition, since there's no explicit else part to modify them.**
