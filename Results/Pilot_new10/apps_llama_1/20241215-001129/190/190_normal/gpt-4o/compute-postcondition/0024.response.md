To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given loop code and the patterns observed from the output states after executing the loop a few times.

The loop iterates over each `length` in the list `a`. For each `length`, it checks two conditions:
1. If `length` is less than `t - 1`, it adds `t - 1 - length` to `current_cost`.
2. If `length` is greater than `t + 1`, it adds `length - (t + 1)` to `current_cost`.

Given that `t` is initially 1, the conditions simplify to:
1. If `length` is less than 0, it adds `1 - length` to `current_cost`. However, since `length` is between 1 and 100 (inclusive), this condition will never be true.
2. If `length` is greater than 2, it adds `length - 2` to `current_cost`.

From the output states after executing the loop a few times, we can infer the following:
- `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `a` also remains unchanged as it is the list being iterated over and its elements are not modified.
- `min_cost` and `best_t` are not updated within the given loop snippet, so they remain positive infinity and -1, respectively.
- `t` is initially 1, but based on the provided output states, it seems `t` might be intended to change outside this loop or in a part of the code not shown. However, within the confines of the given loop, `t` does not change.
- `current_cost` is updated based on the conditions relative to `t`. Since `t` is 1, `current_cost` increases by `length - 2` for each `length` greater than 2.

Considering all iterations, the loop will execute over all elements in `a`. For each element:
- If the element is between 1 and 2 (inclusive), `current_cost` does not change because the element does not trigger either condition (since `t` is 1).
- If the element is greater than 2, `current_cost` increases by `length - 2`.

Thus, after all iterations, `current_cost` will be the sum of `length - 2` for all `length` in `a` that are greater than 2.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, and `current_cost` is the sum of `max(0, length - 2)` for all `length` in `a`.**
