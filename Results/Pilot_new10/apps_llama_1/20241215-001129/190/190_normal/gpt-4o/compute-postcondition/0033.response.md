The code increments `current_cost` by `t - 1 - length`. Given that `t` is 2 and `length` is less than `t - 1`, which is less than 1, we know `length` must be 0 because it's the only integer less than 1. 

So, `t - 1 - length` becomes `2 - 1 - 0`, which equals 1. 

Thus, `current_cost` is incremented by 1.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 1 element, `t` is 2, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `length` is 0, `current_cost` is 1**
