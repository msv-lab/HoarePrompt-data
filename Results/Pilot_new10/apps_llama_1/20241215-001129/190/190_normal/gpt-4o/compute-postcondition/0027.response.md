The code `best_t = t` assigns the value of `t` to `best_t`. The value of `t` is 1, so `best_t` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `min_cost` is the sum of `max(0, length - 2)` for all `length` in `a`, `best_t` is 1, `t` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `min_cost` is the sum of `max(0, length - 2)` for all `length` in `a`, `best_t` is 1, `t` is 1**
