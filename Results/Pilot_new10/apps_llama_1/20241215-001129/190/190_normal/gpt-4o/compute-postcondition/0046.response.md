The value of `current_cost` is increased by `length - (t + 1)`. Given that `t` is 2 and `length` is the third element in the list `a`, we can substitute these values into the expression. Therefore, `current_cost` is increased by `length - 3`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 3 elements, `t` is 2, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `length` is the third element in the list `a`, `current_cost` is increased by `length - 3`**
