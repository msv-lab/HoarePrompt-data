Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 1 element, `t` is 2, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1. If the `length` (the first element in the list `a`) is less than 1, then `length` is 0 and `current_cost` is 1. If `length` is more than or equal to 1, `length` remains the first element in the list `a` and if `length` is more than 3, `current_cost` is increased by `length - 3`.**
