The given code snippet is `current_cost += length - (t + 1)`. However, `length` and `current_cost` are not defined in the initial state. To provide the output state, we need to make assumptions about these variables.

Since `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, and `t` is 1, and assuming `length` and `current_cost` are variables that are somehow related to the given initial state (perhaps `length` is related to the length of list `a` and `current_cost` is a variable tracking some form of cost), the code would update `current_cost` based on `length` and `t`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) with at least 2 elements
- `min_cost` is positive infinity
- `best_t` is -1
- `t` is 1

If we consider `length` as the length of list `a` (since `a` is the only list mentioned in the initial state), then `length` would be the number of elements in `a`, which is at least 2.

Let's denote the original value of `current_cost` as `original_current_cost`. After executing the code, `current_cost` becomes `original_current_cost + length - (t + 1)`.

Since `t` is 1, `t + 1` equals 2. Thus, `current_cost` becomes `original_current_cost + length - 2`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) with at least 2 elements, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, `length` is the number of elements in `a`, and `current_cost` is `original_current_cost + length - 2`**
