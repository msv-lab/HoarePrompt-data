Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `t` is 3, `length` is the last element in `a`, and `current_cost` is the sum of adjustments based on elements in `a` that are outside the range [2, 4]. If `current_cost` is less than `min_cost`, then `min_cost` is equal to `current_cost` and `best_t` is 3.**
