The given code updates the `current_cost` variable. 

The initial state is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 1 element, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, `current_cost` is 0, the length is the first element in the list `a` and is greater than or equal to `t - 1`, and the current value of `length` is greater than `t + 1`.

The `length` is the first element in the list `a`, so `length = a[0]`. Since `length` is greater than `t + 1` and `t` is 1, then `length` is greater than 2.

`current_cost` is updated by adding `length - (t + 1)` to it. Since `t` is 1, `current_cost` becomes `current_cost + length - 2` or `current_cost + a[0] - 2`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 1 element, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, `current_cost` is `a[0] - 2`, the length is the first element in the list `a` and is greater than or equal to `t - 1`, and the current value of `length` is greater than `t + 1`**
