To calculate the result, we first need to understand the initial state and the given code. 

The initial state is: 
- `n` is an input integer, 
- `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 3 elements, 
- `t` is 3, 
- `length` is the next element in the list, 
- `current_cost` is the updated value after the previous iteration.

The given code is: 
```python
current_cost += t - 1 - length
```

Now, let's think step by step: 

- `t` is 3, 
- `length` is the next element in the list `a`, which means it is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).

Given the code `current_cost += t - 1 - length`, we can calculate the new value of `current_cost` as follows:

- `t - 1` equals 3 - 1 = 2, 
- `t - 1 - length` equals 2 - `length`, 
- `current_cost` is updated by adding `t - 1 - length` to it.

The update of `current_cost` is `current_cost = current_cost + (2 - length)`.

Since `length` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `2 - length` will be an integer between -98 and 1 (inclusive).

Other variables are not affected, so their states remain the same.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` is an input integer, 
`a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 3 elements, 
`t` is 3, 
`length` is the next element in the list `a`, 
`current_cost` is the updated value, `current_cost` equals `current_cost` from the previous iteration plus `t - 1 - length`, which is `current_cost + 2 - length`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 3 elements, `t` is 3, `length` is the next element in the list, `current_cost` equals the previous `current_cost` + 2 - `length`**
