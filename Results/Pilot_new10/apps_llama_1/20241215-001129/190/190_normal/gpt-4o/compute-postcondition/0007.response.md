Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 1 element, initially `length` equals the first element in the list `a`, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, initially `t` is 1, `current_cost` is 0. The current value of `length` is less than the current value of `t` minus 1, with `t` being 1, this implies `length` is less than 0.**
