To determine the output state, we need to consider the impact of the given code on the program variables.

The initial state is: 
- `n` is an input integer, 
- `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 1 element, 
- `length` equals the first element in the list `a`, 
- `min_cost` is positive infinity, 
- `best_t` is -1, 
- `t` is 1, 
- `current_cost` is 0.

Given that `length` is less than `t` minus 1, with `t` being 1, this implies `length` is less than 0. However, since `length` is defined as the first element of `a` and all elements in `a` are between 1 and 100, this initial condition seems to imply a contradiction based on the given constraints. Yet, for the sake of analyzing the code's effect, we'll proceed under the assumption that the condition `length` < `t` - 1 holds true in a more abstract or hypothetical scenario where such values could be possible, or there might be an oversight in interpreting the constraints.

The code is: `current_cost += t - 1 - length`

Given `t` is 1, the expression simplifies to: `current_cost += 1 - 1 - length` = `current_cost += -length`

Since `length` is less than 0 (based on the given conditions), `-length` will be positive. Therefore, `current_cost` will increase by a positive amount equal to the absolute value of `length`.

The states of `n`, `a`, `length`, `min_cost`, `best_t`, and `t` are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state, considering the specific change and the rest of the initial conditions, is:
- `n` is an input integer, 
- `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 1 element, 
- `length` equals the first element in the list `a` (but we've established a hypothetical where it's less than 0 for the sake of analyzing change), 
- `min_cost` is positive infinity, 
- `best_t` is -1, 
- `t` is 1, 
- `current_cost` is increased by the absolute value of `length` (which is a positive value given `length` < 0 in this hypothetical scenario).

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) with at least 1 element, `length` is less than 0, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, `current_cost` is 0 plus the absolute value of `length`.**
