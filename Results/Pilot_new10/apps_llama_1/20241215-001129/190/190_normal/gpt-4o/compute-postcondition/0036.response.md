The value of `current_cost` is increased by `length - (t + 1)`. Given that `length` is more than 3 and `t` is 2, `length - (t + 1)` is `length - 3`. Therefore, the new value of `current_cost` is `current_cost + length - 3`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. `n` is still an input integer, `a` is still a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) with at least 1 element, `t` is still 2, `min_cost` is still positive infinity, `best_t` is still -1, and `length` is still more than 3.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) with at least 1 element, `t` is 2, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `length` is more than 3, `current_cost` is `current_cost + length - 3`**
