Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 3 elements, `t` is 2, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `length` is the third element in the list `a`. If `length` is greater than 3, `current_cost` is increased by `length - 3`.***
