Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), initially `min_cost` was positive infinity, initially `best_t` was -1, `t` is 1, `current_cost` is the sum of `max(0, length - 2)` for all `length` in `a`, and the current value of `current_cost` is less than the current value of `min_cost`.**
