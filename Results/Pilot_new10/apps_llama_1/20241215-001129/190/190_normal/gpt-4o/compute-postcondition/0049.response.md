To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the provided output states for the first few iterations.

The loop iterates over each `length` in the list `a`. For each `length`, it checks if `length` is less than `t - 1` (which is 1, since `t` is 2) or greater than `t + 1` (which is 3). If `length` is less than 1, it adds `t - 1 - length` (which is `1 - length`) to `current_cost`. If `length` is greater than 3, it adds `length - (t + 1)` (which is `length - 3`) to `current_cost`.

From the output states, we can see that:

- `n` remains an input integer throughout the loop.
- `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations.
- `t` remains 2 throughout the loop.
- `min_cost` and `best_t` do not change within the provided loop code, so they remain positive infinity and -1, respectively, after the loop finishes, assuming no other code modifies them outside this loop.
- `length` takes on the value of each element in `a` during each iteration.
- `current_cost` is updated based on the value of `length` relative to `t`.

After all iterations, `length` will be the last element in the list `a`, and `current_cost` will be the sum of all adjustments made for each `length` in `a`. These adjustments are `t - 1 - length` for `length < 1` and `length - (t + 1)` for `length > 3`.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished can be summarized as follows:

- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
- `t` is 2.
- `min_cost` is positive infinity.
- `best_t` is -1.
- `length` is the last element in the list `a`.
- `current_cost` is the sum of adjustments for all `length` in `a`, where for each `length`, if `length < 1`, it adds `1 - length`, and if `length > 3`, it adds `length - 3`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `t` is 2, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `length` is the last element in `a`, and `current_cost` is the sum of all `max(1 - length, 0, length - 3)` for each `length` in `a`.**
