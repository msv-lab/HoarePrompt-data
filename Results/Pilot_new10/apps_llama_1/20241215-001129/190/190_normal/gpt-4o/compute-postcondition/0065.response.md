To calculate the result, we need the value of `current_cost` and `length`. However, these values are not provided in the initial state. Assuming that `current_cost` and `length` are defined and have some initial values, we can proceed with the given information.

`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) with at least 2 elements, and `t` is 3. 

The code `current_cost += t - 1 - length` updates the value of `current_cost` by adding `t - 1 - length` to it. Since `t` is 3, the expression becomes `current_cost += 3 - 1 - length`, which simplifies to `current_cost += 2 - length`.

The value of `length` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `current_cost`. However, we can express the new value of `current_cost` as `current_cost + 2 - length`.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `a`, and `t`) are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 2 elements, `t` is 3, and `current_cost` is `current_cost + 2 - length`.**
