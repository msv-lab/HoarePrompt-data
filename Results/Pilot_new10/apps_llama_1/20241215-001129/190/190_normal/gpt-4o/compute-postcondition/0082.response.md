To determine the functionality of the given function, let's analyze it step by step:

1. The function takes no arguments but reads input from the user. The first input is an integer `n`, representing the number of stick lengths, and the second input is a list of integers `a`, representing the stick lengths themselves.

2. The function initializes `min_cost` to infinity and `best_t` to -1. It then iterates over all possible values of `t` from 1 to 100.

3. For each `t`, it calculates the `current_cost` by summing the adjustments needed to bring each stick length within the range `[t-1, t+1]`. If a stick is shorter than `t-1`, it adds the difference between `t-1` and the stick length to `current_cost`. If a stick is longer than `t+1`, it adds the difference between the stick length and `t+1` to `current_cost`.

4. If `current_cost` is less than `min_cost`, it updates `min_cost` and sets `best_t` to the current `t`.

5. After checking all possible values of `t`, the function prints `best_t` and `min_cost`, which represent the target length and the minimum cost to adjust all stick lengths to be within a range of the form `[t-1, t+1]`, respectively.

Based on this analysis, the functionality of the function is to find the target length `t` that minimizes the total cost of adjusting a list of stick lengths to be within the range `[t-1, t+1]`, and to print this target length along with the minimum cost. The function handles all potential cases, including when all sticks are of different lengths or when all sticks are of the same length.

Functionality: ** The function reads a list of stick lengths from the user, calculates the target length that minimizes the total cost of adjusting the stick lengths to be within a range of the form [t-1, t+1], and prints the target length along with the minimum cost, handling all potential cases of stick length distributions. **
