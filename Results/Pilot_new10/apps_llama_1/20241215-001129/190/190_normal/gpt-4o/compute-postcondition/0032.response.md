Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 1 element, `t` is 2, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `current_cost` is 0, the initial value of `length` is the first element in the list `a`, and the current value of `length` is less than `t - 1`, which is less than 1**
