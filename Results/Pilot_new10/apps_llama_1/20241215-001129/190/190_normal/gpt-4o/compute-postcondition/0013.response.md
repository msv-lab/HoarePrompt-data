Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 1 element, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1. If `length` (which is the first element in the list `a`) is less than `t - 1` (i.e., less than 0), then `current_cost` is 0 plus the absolute value of `length`. If `length` is greater than or equal to `t - 1` (i.e., greater than or equal to 0), then if `length` is greater than `t + 1` (i.e., greater than 2), `current_cost` is `a[0] - 2`. Otherwise, `current_cost` remains 0.***
