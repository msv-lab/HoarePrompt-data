To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the given loop statement and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

Given loop statement:
```
for length in a:
    # the loop body is omit
```
State at the end of the previous iteration: 
* `n` is an input integer, 
* `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 1 element, 
* `min_cost` is positive infinity, 
* `best_t` is -1, 
* `t` is 1.

Since `a` must have at least 1 element and we are considering the state after the first iteration, `a` must now have at least 2 elements for the loop to execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, the first element of `a` (let's call it `length`) has been processed. For the loop to execute again, the next element in `a` needs to be considered.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 2 elements, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1**
