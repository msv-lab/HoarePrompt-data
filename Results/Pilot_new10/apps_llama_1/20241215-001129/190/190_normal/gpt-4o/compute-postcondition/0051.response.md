The code updates the value of `min_cost` to be equal to `current_cost`. The previous value of `min_cost` was positive infinity, but it is now updated to the current value of `current_cost`, which is less than the previous value of `min_cost`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `t` is 2, `min_cost` is equal to `current_cost`, `best_t` is -1, `length` is the last element in `a`, and `current_cost` is the sum of all `max(1 - length, 0, length - 3)` for each `length` in `a`.**
