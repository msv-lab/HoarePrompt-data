Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) with at least 3 elements, `t` is 3, `length` is the next element in the list `a`. If `length` is greater than 4, `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + length - 4`. If `length` is less than or equal to 4, `current_cost` remains unchanged as the if condition is not met and there is no else part to handle this case.**
