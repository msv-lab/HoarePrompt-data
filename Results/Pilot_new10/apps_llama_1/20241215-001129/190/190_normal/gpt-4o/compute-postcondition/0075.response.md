Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `t` is 3, the current value of `length` is the last element in `a`, and the current value of `current_cost` is the sum of adjustments based on elements in `a` that are outside the range [2, 4]. Additionally, the current value of `current_cost` is less than the minimum cost `min_cost`.**
