Correctness: **True**.

The provided program seems to be correct as it covers all potential cases. 

The program takes the input of sticks' lengths, sorts them, and calculates the middle value as a potential target length `t`. It then checks all possible `t` values from 1 to 100 (since stick lengths are between 1 and 100) and calculates the cost for each `t` by summing the minimum cost to change each stick's length to be almost good for `t`. 

The program correctly updates the minimum cost and corresponding `t` value when a lower cost is found.

The use of `min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i + 1)))` and `min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i - 1)))` in calculating the cost ensures that the program considers the most efficient way to change each stick's length to be almost good for `t`.

The given examples also support the program's correctness. 

The loop through `range(mid - 1, 0, -1)` and `range(mid + 1, 101)` checks for potential `t` values on both sides of the middle value, so all possible `t` values are considered.

Overall, the program appears to be correct as it covers all possible cases and calculates the minimum cost to change the sticks' lengths to be almost good for some `t`.
