It appears there's a missing part in the problem description regarding the output of the function. Since the output details are not provided, I'll create a general template based on the given information about the parameters and assume hypothetical output cases for demonstration purposes.


The function `func` accepts parameters `m`, `a`, and `b`. `m`, `a`, and `b` are integers where `1 <= m <= 10^9`, and `1 <= a, b <= 10^5`. 

Given the lack of specific output details, let's assume hypothetical Cases for demonstration:
- Case_1: If a certain condition is met (e.g., `m` is greater than `a` and `b`), the function returns a specific value (e.g., the sum of `a` and `b`).
- Case_2: If another condition is met (e.g., `m` is less than or equal to `a` or `b`), the function returns a different value (e.g., the product of `a` and `b`).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept integers `m`, `a`, and `b` within the specified ranges and return values based on conditions related to these parameters.


Functionality: **The function accepts parameters m, a, and b, which are integers within specific ranges, and returns values based on conditions related to these parameters.**
