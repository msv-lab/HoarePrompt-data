The given code snippet is `print(sum(dp))`. This line calculates the sum of all elements in the list `dp` and prints the result. 

The initial state is: `m` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` elements where `dp[i]` is the sum of `dp[i - b]` (if `i - b` is greater than or equal to 0) and `dp[i]` itself, and `dp[i + a]` (if `i + a` is less than or equal to `m`) is the sum of `dp[i + a]` itself and `dp[i]`, with `dp[0]` being 1.

After executing the code, the values of `m`, `a`, `b`, and `dp` do not change. However, the sum of all elements in `dp` is printed. 

Let's denote the printed sum as `sum_of_dp`. The value of `sum_of_dp` is equal to the sum of all elements in `dp`, which can be calculated as `dp[0] + dp[1] +... + dp[m]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` elements, and the sum of all elements in `dp` has been printed, which is equal to `dp[0] + dp[1] +... + dp[m]`.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` elements, and the sum of all elements in `dp` has been printed and is equal to `sum(dp)`**
