To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step.

The initial state is: 
- `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1.

The code provided is:
```python
dp[i + a] += dp[i]
```

This line of code updates the value of `dp[i + a]` by adding the value of `dp[i]` to it. The dictionary or list `dp` is not defined in the initial state, so we assume it exists and can hold values for different indices.

The impact of this code on the program is that it modifies the value of `dp` at the index `i + a` based on its previous value at index `i`. 

The states of `m`, `a`, `b`, and `i` itself are not directly affected by this operation, assuming `i` was already defined and calculated as per the initial condition before this line of code. However, since `i` is mentioned to be the previous value of `i` plus 1, and this operation does not change the value of `i` but rather uses its value to index `dp`, we consider `i`'s value as already updated before this line is executed.

Given this analysis, the output state is: 
- `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1 (its value is used in the indexing).
- `dp[i + a]` is increased by the value of `dp[i]`.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1, `dp[i + a]` equals its previous value plus `dp[i]`.**
