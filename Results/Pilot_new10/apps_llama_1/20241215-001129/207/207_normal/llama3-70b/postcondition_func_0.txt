The function accepts three integer parameters `m`, `a`, and `b` as input from the user, initializes a dynamic programming list `dp` of size `m + 1`, updates `dp` based on `a` and `b`, and prints the sum of all elements in `dp`, effectively calculating and returning the sum of all reachable states in a sequence defined by `m`, `a`, and `b`.
