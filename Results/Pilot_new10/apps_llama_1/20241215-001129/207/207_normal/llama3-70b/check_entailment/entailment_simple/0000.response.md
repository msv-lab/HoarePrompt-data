Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the function described in the problem description. The main issue lies in the way it updates the `dp` array.

In the problem description, `f(x)` is defined as the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval `[0, x]`. The program attempts to calculate this by maintaining a dynamic programming array `dp`, where `dp[i]` is supposed to represent `f(i)`.

However, the way the program updates `dp` is incorrect. Specifically, the lines `dp[i + a] += dp[i]` and `dp[i] += dp[i - b]` do not accurately reflect the problem description.

The line `dp[i + a] += dp[i]` is attempting to propagate the number of reachable integers from position `i` to position `i + a`. However, this is not sufficient, as it does not consider the fact that the frog can also jump from position `i - b` to position `i`.

The line `dp[i] += dp[i - b]` is attempting to account for the fact that the frog can jump from position `i - b` to position `i`. However, this is incorrect, as it is adding the number of reachable integers from position `i - b` to the number of reachable integers from position `i`, which is not what the problem description requires.

To correctly implement the function, we need to keep track of the distinct integers that can be reached from each position `i`, and then calculate the sum of these distinct integers for each `i` from `0` to `m`. The current implementation does not achieve this.

A correct implementation would involve using a set or a similar data structure to keep track of the distinct integers that can be reached from each position, and then calculating the sum of the sizes of these sets for each `i` from `0` to `m`. 

Here is a high-level outline of a correct implementation:

1. Initialize a set `reachable` to keep track of the distinct integers that can be reached from position `0`.
2. Iterate over each position `i` from `0` to `m`.
3. For each position `i`, iterate over each possible jump `a` and `b`.
4. If the jump `a` is within the interval `[0, m]`, add `i + a` to the `reachable` set.
5. If the jump `b` is within the interval `[0, m]`, add `i - b` to the `reachable` set.
6. Calculate the sum of the sizes of the `reachable` sets for each `i` from `0` to `m`.

This implementation would correctly calculate the sum of `f(i)` for each `i` from `0` to `m`, as required by the problem description. 

Here is an example of a correct implementation in Python:
```python
def func():
    m, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    total = 0
    for i in range(m + 1):
        reachable = set()
        stack = [0]
        while stack:
            pos = stack.pop()
            if pos not in reachable:
                reachable.add(pos)
                if pos + a <= i:
                    stack.append(pos + a)
                if pos - b >= 0 and pos - b <= i:
                    stack.append(pos - b)
        total += len(reachable)
    print(total)
```
This implementation uses a set `reachable` to keep track of the distinct integers that can be reached from each position `i`, and then calculates the sum of the sizes of these sets for each `i` from `0` to `m`. It uses a stack to perform a depth-first search of the reachable positions, and adds each position to the `reachable` set as it is visited. The `total` variable keeps track of the sum of the sizes of the `reachable` sets for each `i` from `0` to `m`.
