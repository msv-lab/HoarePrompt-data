You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A frog is initially at position $0$ on the number line. The frog has two positive integers $a$ and $b$. From a position $k$, it can either jump to position $k+a$ or $k-b$.

Let $f(x)$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $[0, x]$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $0$.

Given an integer $m$, find $\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$. That is, find the sum of all $f(i)$ for $i$ from $0$ to $m$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers $m, a, b$ ($1 \leq m \leq 10^9, 1 \leq a,b \leq 10^5$).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, the desired sum.


-----Examples-----
Input
7 5 3

Output
19

Input
1000000000 1 2019

Output
500000001500000001

Input
100 100000 1

Output
101

Input
6 4 5

Output
10



-----Note-----

In the first example, we must find $f(0)+f(1)+\ldots+f(7)$. We have $f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$. The sum of these values is $19$.

In the second example, we have $f(i) = i+1$, so we want to find $\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$.

In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.
Program:
```
def func():
    (m, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    dp = [0] * (m + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(m + 1):
        if i + a <= m:
            dp[i + a] += dp[i]
        if i - b >= 0:
            dp[i] += dp[i - b]
    print(sum(dp))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided code has a bug in the way it updates the dp array. The issue lies in the line `dp[i] += dp[i - b]`. This line is incorrect because it tries to add the number of ways to reach `i-b` to the number of ways to reach `i`. However, this is not the correct way to calculate `f(i)`.

When the frog jumps from `i-b` to `i`, it is essentially adding one more way to reach `i` for each way to reach `i-b`. So, the correct update should be `dp[i] += dp[i-b]` only when `i-b` is within the bounds of the array.

However, the more significant issue is that the dp array is being updated in-place, which can lead to incorrect results because the update for `dp[i+a]` and `dp[i-b]` depends on the current value of `dp[i]`. If `dp[i]` is updated before `dp[i+a]`, the update for `dp[i+a]` will be incorrect.

To fix this, we need to use two separate loops, one for updating `dp[i+a]` and another for updating `dp[i-b]`. Alternatively, we can use a completely different approach to calculate `f(i)`.

Another issue is that the dp array is not being reset or reinitialized for each `i`. This means that once `dp[i]` is updated, its value will be used for all subsequent `i`, which is incorrect.

Here's an example of when the program does not work correctly: if `m = 10`, `a = 2`, and `b = 3`, the program will return an incorrect result. 

Here's a possible correct implementation:
```python
def func():
    (m, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    res = 0
    for i in range(m + 1):
        reached = set()
        stack = [0]
        while stack:
            x = stack.pop()
            if x not in reached:
                reached.add(x)
                if x + a <= i:
                    stack.append(x + a)
                if x - b >= 0 and x - b <= i:
                    stack.append(x - b)
        res += len(reached)
    print(res)
```
This implementation uses a breadth-first search approach to calculate `f(i)` for each `i` and then sums up the results. It avoids the issues mentioned above and correctly handles the boundary cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: m, a, and b are integers where 1 <= m <= 10^9, and 1 <= a, b <= 10^5.
def func():
    m, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    dp = [0] * (m + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(m + 1):
        if i + a <= m:
            dp[i + a] += dp[i]
        
        if i - b >= 0:
            dp[i] += dp[i - b]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `m` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` elements where `dp[i]` is the sum of `dp[i - b]` (if `i - b` is greater than or equal to 0) and `dp[i]` itself, and `dp[i + a]` (if `i + a` is less than or equal to `m`) is the sum of `dp[i + a]` itself and `dp[i]`, with `dp[0]` being 1.
    print(sum(dp))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three integer parameters `m`, `a`, and `b` as input from the user, initializes a dynamic programming list `dp` of size `m + 1`, updates `dp` based on `a` and `b`, and prints the sum of all elements in `dp`, effectively calculating and returning the sum of all reachable states in a sequence defined by `m`, `a`, and `b`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
