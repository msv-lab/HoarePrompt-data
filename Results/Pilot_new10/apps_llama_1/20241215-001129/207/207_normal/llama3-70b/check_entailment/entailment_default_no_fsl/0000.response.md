Correctness: **False**

The given Python program does not correctly implement the problem description. The issue lies in the fact that it does not correctly calculate `f(x)`, which is defined as the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval `[0, x]`. 

The current implementation uses dynamic programming to calculate the sum of all reachable states but does so in a way that does not correctly account for the restrictions imposed by the interval `[0, x]`. Specifically, it does not ensure that jumps are only made within the allowed interval.

For example, when calculating `f(5)` in the first example with `m = 7`, `a = 5`, and `b = 3`, the frog should only be able to reach positions `0`, `2`, `3`, `4`, and `5` because it cannot jump to an integer outside the interval `[0, 5]`. However, the current implementation does not enforce this constraint correctly.

To correctly implement the problem, we would need to modify the dynamic programming approach to keep track of the distinct integers reachable within each interval `[0, i]` for `i` from `0` to `m`, rather than simply accumulating all reachable states without regard to the interval constraints. 

One way to correct this could involve using a more complex dynamic programming approach that explicitly tracks reachable positions within each interval, ensuring that no jumps are made outside the allowed range. 

However, the current program does not handle this correctly, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs. Thus, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential case.
