The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `m`, a non-negative integer, and `a` and `b`, both positive integers. The function first calculates `g` using `func_1(a, b)`. If `g` is not equal to 1, the function calls itself recursively with `m // g`, `a // g`, and `b // g`, and multiplies the result by `g`. 

If `g` is equal to 1, the function then calculates `k` as `a + b - 1`. If `m` is less than `k`, the function returns the sum of the first `m + 1` positive integers. 

If `m` is greater than or equal to `k`, the function calculates `sum_k` as the sum of the first `k` positive integers and `sum_m` as the sum of the first `m` positive integers minus the sum of the first `k - 1` positive integers, and returns the sum of `sum_k` and `sum_m`.

The functionality of the function seems to depend on the value of `g` and the comparison between `m` and `k`. 

However, the code does not handle the case when `m` is a non-negative integer and `a` or `b` is not a positive integer, or when `m` is not an integer, or when `a` or `b` is not an integer. 

Also, the function calls `func_1(a, b)` but the definition of `func_1` is not provided, which makes it difficult to determine the exact functionality of `func_2`. 

Additionally, if `g` is not equal to 1 and `m // g` or `a // g` or `b // g` is not an integer, the function may not work as expected.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer `m` and two positive integers `a` and `b`, and returns a value based on the value of `g` calculated from `func_1(a, b)` and the comparison between `m` and `k = a + b - 1`, handling cases where `m` is less than `k` and where `m` is greater than or equal to `k`, but may not handle cases where `m`, `a`, or `b` is not an integer or where `a` or `b` is not positive, and its behavior depends on the definition of `func_1` **
