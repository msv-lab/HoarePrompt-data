Correctness: **True**

The code is correct because it follows the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm, and the function `func_2` uses this gcd to calculate the sum of the number of distinct integers the frog can reach for each position from 0 to `m`. 

The base case for `func_2` is when the gcd of `a` and `b` is not 1, in which case it calls itself with `m`, `a`, and `b` divided by the gcd. This is correct because if the gcd of `a` and `b` is not 1, then the frog can only reach positions that are multiples of the gcd.

The recursive case for `func_2` is when the gcd of `a` and `b` is 1. In this case, it checks if `m` is less than `a + b - 1`. If it is, then the frog can only reach positions from 0 to `m`, so the function returns the sum of the first `m + 1` positive integers. If `m` is greater than or equal to `a + b - 1`, then the frog can reach all positions from 0 to `m`, so the function returns the sum of the first `a + b - 1` positive integers plus the sum of the integers from `a + b - 1` to `m`.

The code also handles the examples given in the problem description correctly. For example, when `m = 7`, `a = 5`, and `b = 3`, the function returns 19, which is the correct answer. 

The annotations provide additional information about the state of the program at different points, but they do not reveal any cases where the code does not follow the problem description. 

Therefore, the code is correct, and it follows the problem description for every potential case.
