Correctness: **True**

The given program meets the requirements of the problem description. Here's why:

1. The program calculates the sum of distinct integers the frog can reach from position 0 to `m`.
2. It uses a helper function `func_1` to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`.
3. In `func_2`, if the GCD of `a` and `b` is not 1, it recursively calls `func_2` with `m`, `a`, and `b` divided by their GCD, and multiplies the result by the GCD. This is a valid optimization, as the frog's jump pattern repeats every `g` units, where `g` is the GCD of `a` and `b`.
4. If the GCD of `a` and `b` is 1, the program calculates the sum of distinct integers the frog can reach from 0 to `m` using the formulae for the sum of arithmetic series.

The program handles different cases correctly:

* If `m` is less than `a + b - 1`, the frog can only reach positions up to `m`, so the program returns the sum of the first `m + 1` positive integers.
* If `m` is greater than or equal to `a + b - 1`, the program calculates the sum of distinct integers the frog can reach from 0 to `m` by summing the first `k` positive integers and the remaining integers from `k` to `m`, where `k = a + b - 1`.

The program's use of the GCD optimization and arithmetic series formulae ensures that it accurately calculates the sum of distinct integers the frog can reach from 0 to `m` for all possible inputs.

The program's logic and calculations align with the problem description, and it does not contain any obvious errors or corner cases that would cause it to deviate from the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
