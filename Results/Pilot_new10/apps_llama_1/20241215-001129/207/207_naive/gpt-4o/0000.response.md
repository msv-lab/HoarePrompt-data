Correctness: **True**.

The given program is designed to calculate the sum of all `f(i)` for `i` from `0` to `m`, where `f(x)` represents the number of distinct integers a frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval `[0, x]`. The frog can jump either `a` steps forward or `b` steps backward from any position.

The program first defines a function `func_1` to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm. This GCD is used to reduce the problem size when the GCD of `a` and `b` is greater than `1`.

The main calculation is performed in the `func_2` function. It first checks if the GCD of `a` and `b` is `1`. If not, it recursively calls itself with reduced values of `m`, `a`, and `b` (divided by the GCD) and multiplies the result by the GCD. This is because the frog's movement pattern repeats every `g` steps, where `g` is the GCD of `a` and `b`.

If the GCD is `1`, it calculates the sum of all `f(i)` from `0` to `m`. The key insight here is that when `m` is less than `a + b - 1`, the frog can only reach positions `0` to `m`, resulting in a simple arithmetic series sum. When `m` is greater than or equal to `a + b - 1`, the frog can reach all positions from `0` to `m`, and the sum can be calculated as the sum of all numbers from `0` to `m` minus the sum of numbers from `0` to `a + b - 2`.

The provided examples demonstrate the correctness of the program for various inputs, including cases where `a` and `b` are relatively prime and cases where they share a common factor.

I have not found any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The use of the GCD to reduce the problem size and the handling of cases where `m` is less than or greater than `a + b - 1` seem to cover all possible scenarios. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
