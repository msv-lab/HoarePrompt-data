Correctness: **False**

The provided code has a bug in the way it updates the dp array. The issue lies in the line `dp[i] += dp[i - b]`. This line is incorrect because it tries to add the number of ways to reach `i-b` to the number of ways to reach `i`. However, this is not the correct way to calculate `f(i)`.

When the frog jumps from `i-b` to `i`, it is essentially adding one more way to reach `i` for each way to reach `i-b`. So, the correct update should be `dp[i] += dp[i-b]` only when `i-b` is within the bounds of the array.

However, the more significant issue is that the dp array is being updated in-place, which can lead to incorrect results because the update for `dp[i+a]` and `dp[i-b]` depends on the current value of `dp[i]`. If `dp[i]` is updated before `dp[i+a]`, the update for `dp[i+a]` will be incorrect.

To fix this, we need to use two separate loops, one for updating `dp[i+a]` and another for updating `dp[i-b]`. Alternatively, we can use a completely different approach to calculate `f(i)`.

Another issue is that the dp array is not being reset or reinitialized for each `i`. This means that once `dp[i]` is updated, its value will be used for all subsequent `i`, which is incorrect.

Here's an example of when the program does not work correctly: if `m = 10`, `a = 2`, and `b = 3`, the program will return an incorrect result. 

Here's a possible correct implementation:
```python
def func():
    (m, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    res = 0
    for i in range(m + 1):
        reached = set()
        stack = [0]
        while stack:
            x = stack.pop()
            if x not in reached:
                reached.add(x)
                if x + a <= i:
                    stack.append(x + a)
                if x - b >= 0 and x - b <= i:
                    stack.append(x - b)
        res += len(reached)
    print(res)
```
This implementation uses a breadth-first search approach to calculate `f(i)` for each `i` and then sums up the results. It avoids the issues mentioned above and correctly handles the boundary cases.
