To verify the correctness of the program, we need to analyze whether it accurately follows the problem description for all potential cases.

The problem description involves starting with an equilateral triangle of side length `x` and ending with an equilateral triangle of side length `y`, where `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`. The modification process involves changing the length of a single side of the current triangle in one second, ensuring the triangle remains non-degenerate (has a positive area), and keeping the length of each side as an integer.

The program provided calculates the absolute difference between `x` and `y` and prints this value as the minimum number of seconds required to achieve the equilateral triangle of side length `y` from the equilateral triangle of side length `x`.

However, the problem description implies a more complex process than simply calculating the absolute difference between `x` and `y`. The modification involves not just changing one side to reach the final length directly but considering the process of adjusting the sides of the triangle in a way that maintains its non-degenerate state.

Upon closer examination, the provided program does not accurately capture the complexity of the process described. The key issue with the program is that it oversimplifies the transformation process. The problem description requires a transformation that involves adjusting the triangle's sides in such a way that at each step, the triangle remains valid (i.e., the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side), and this process cannot be reduced to simply changing the length of one side by the absolute difference between `x` and `y`.

To illustrate this discrepancy, consider the example where `x = 6` and `y = 3`. The program will output `3`, which is `abs(6 - 3)`. However, the correct transformation, as described in the problem, involves several steps where each side is adjusted to ensure the triangle remains valid, not just changing one side by 3 units. For instance, the transformation could be `(6,6,6) → (6,6,3) → (6,4,3) → (3,4,3) → (3,3,3)`, requiring 4 steps, not just the absolute difference between `x` and `y`.

Given this analysis, the program does not correctly implement the process described in the problem for all potential cases. The program fails to account for the step-by-step adjustment of the triangle's sides to maintain a non-degenerate state, instead simplistically calculating the difference between the starting and ending side lengths.

Correctness: **False**
