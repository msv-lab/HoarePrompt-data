Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It simply calculates and prints the absolute difference between the input values `x` and `y`, which does not accurately represent the minimum number of operations required to transform an equilateral triangle of side length `x` into one of side length `y`.

The problem description asks for the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length `y` if he starts with the equilateral triangle of side length `x`, with the constraint that in a single second, he can modify the length of a single side of the current triangle such that it remains a non-degenerate triangle (triangle of positive area). At any moment of time, the length of each side should be an integer.

The provided program does not consider these constraints and the process of transforming one equilateral triangle into another by changing one side at a time, ensuring that the triangle remains valid (i.e., the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the third side).

For instance, in the example given in the problem description where `x = 6` and `y = 3`, the program would incorrectly output `3` (which is `abs(6 - 3)`), whereas the correct minimum number of operations, as demonstrated in the problem description, is `4`: `(6,6,6) → (6,6,3) → (6,4,3) → (3,4,3) → (3,3,3)`.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description for every potential case.
