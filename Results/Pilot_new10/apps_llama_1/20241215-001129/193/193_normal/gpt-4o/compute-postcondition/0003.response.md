The function `func` accepts two integer parameters, `x` and `y`, as input from the user, where `x` and `y` are expected to be such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. However, the code does not enforce these constraints, so it will accept any two integers as input. The function calculates and prints the ceiling of the difference between `x` and `y` divided by 2, which is equivalent to `(x - y + 1) // 2`. The functionality of the function does not include any error checking or handling for cases where the input values do not meet the expected constraints, or for non-integer inputs.

Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer parameters, `x` and `y`, as input from the user, calculates the ceiling of their difference divided by 2, and prints the result, without enforcing any specific constraints on the input values. **
