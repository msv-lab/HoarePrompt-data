It appears that the provided function definition is incomplete, as it does not accept any parameters (`x` and `y`). However, based on the given parameter constraints, I will describe the expected functionality.

The function is expected to accept two parameters, `x` and `y`, where both are integers, `x` is greater than or equal to 3, `y` is less than `x`, and `x` is less than or equal to 100,000. 

However, since the exact output is not specified, I will outline a general description of the functionality.


Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, x and y, where x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, and returns a value based on the given input parameters x and y.**
