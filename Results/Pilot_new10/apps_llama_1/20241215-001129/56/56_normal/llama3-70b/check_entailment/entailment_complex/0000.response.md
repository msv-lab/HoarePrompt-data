Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description in all cases. 

The problem description asks to find k integers such that the sum of two to the power of each number equals to the number n and the largest integer in the answer is as small as possible. The program attempts to construct a list of k integers representing the powers of 2 that sum up to n, but it does not guarantee that the largest integer in the answer is as small as possible.

The program works by repeatedly finding the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to n, subtracting it from n, and adding it to the list. This approach does not consider the constraint of the largest integer in the answer being as small as possible.

For example, if n = 23 and k = 5, the program will output [3, 3, 2, 1, 0] which is correct. However, if n = 23 and k = 4, the program will output 'No' because it cannot find a sequence of 4 powers of 2 that sum up to 23. But a correct sequence is [3, 2, 2, 2] which has a smaller maximum value.

The program also does not handle cases where the input n is not a non-negative integer or k is not a positive integer. The problem description guarantees that these conditions will be met, but the program does not validate the input.

To fix this, the program needs to be modified to consider all possible sequences of powers of 2 that sum up to n, and then select the sequence with the smallest maximum value. This can be achieved using a more complex algorithm, such as a recursive or dynamic programming approach.

Here is a possible way to solve this problem using a recursive approach:

```python
def func(n, k):
    def recursive_func(n, k):
        if k == 1:
            if n > 0:
                return [[n.bit_length() - 1]]
            else:
                return []
        else:
            result = []
            for i in range(n.bit_length() - 1, -1, -1):
                if 2 ** i <= n:
                    for seq in recursive_func(n - 2 ** i, k - 1):
                        result.append([i] + seq)
            return result

    sequences = recursive_func(n, k)
    if not sequences:
        return 'No'
    else:
        min_max = min(max(seq) for seq in sequences)
        lexicographically_largest = max((seq for seq in sequences if max(seq) == min_max), key=lambda x: x[::-1])
        return 'Yes\n' + ' '.join(map(str, lexicographically_largest))

n, k = map(int, input().split())
print(func(n, k))
```

This program generates all possible sequences of powers of 2 that sum up to n, selects the sequence with the smallest maximum value, and then selects the lexicographically largest sequence among those with the smallest maximum value.
