Correctness: **False**

The given code does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. One of the main issues is that it constructs a list of powers of 2 that sum up to `n` without considering the constraint of finding the lexicographically largest sequence with the minimum maximum value (y-value). 

For instance, when `n` equals 23 and `k` equals 5, the code correctly outputs "Yes" followed by the sequence "3 3 2 1 0". However, it does so because it happens to find this sequence in its search, not because it is actively seeking the lexicographically largest sequence with the minimum y-value.

A counterexample where the code fails is when `n` equals 18 and `k` equals 3. In this case, the code should output "Yes" followed by "4 1 0" because the sum of 2^4, 2^1, and 2^0 equals 18 and this is the lexicographically largest sequence with the minimum y-value. However, the code will output "No" because it only checks for sequences where the maximum value is as large as possible, not the lexicographically largest sequence with the minimum y-value.

The code also has a logical flaw in the line where it checks if `n` is less than `k`. This check is not sufficient to determine whether a valid sequence exists, as it does not take into account the actual values of the powers of 2 that sum up to `n`. 

To correctly solve the problem, the code needs to be modified to actively seek the lexicographically largest sequence with the minimum y-value, rather than simply finding any sequence that sums up to `n`. This requires a more complex approach, such as using dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm that prioritizes the lexicographically largest sequence.
