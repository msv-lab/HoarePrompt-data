The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `i`, but it does provide an equation for `n` as `n = n - 2`, which seems to be a contradictory or incomplete definition for `n` as it stands. 

Given the provided initial state and the operation performed by the code, we can say the following about the variables after execution:

- The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but since its initial value is not specified, we can only say `i` is increased by 1 from its previous state.
- The equation `n = n - 2` provided in the initial state does not directly influence the operation `i += 1` but indicates an issue or a specific condition related to `n`. However, without further context on how `n` is defined or used (since `n = n - 2` would typically result in `n` being undefined or an error in most programming contexts), we must consider `n` as being in a state that does not directly interact with the increment operation on `i`.

Therefore, considering the provided information and the specific format requested for the output:

Output State: **`n` is as defined by the equation `n = n - 2`, `i` is increased by 1 from its previous state**
