The function `func` accepts two input values `n` and `k` through the standard input, where `n` is a non-negative integer and `k` is a positive integer. 

Here is the step-by-step analysis of the code:
1. The function first checks if `n` is less than `k` and prints 'No' if true.
2. If `n` is not less than `k`, it attempts to construct a list `a` of integers representing the powers of 2 that sum up to `n`, from largest to smallest.
3. It uses a while loop to find the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n`, appends the exponent to the list `a`, subtracts the corresponding power of 2 from `n`, and repeats this process until `n` becomes 0 or the list `a` contains `k` elements.
4. After the loop, if the length of `a` is less than `k`, it prints 'No'.
5. If the length of `a` is greater than or equal to `k`, it truncates the list `a` to the first `k` elements, sorts them in descending order, prints 'Yes', and then prints the sorted list `a`.

The code does not explicitly handle cases where `n` or `k` are outside their specified ranges. However, the input is taken through the standard input and the function does not perform any validation on the input values.

Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `k` through the standard input, attempts to construct a list of `k` integers representing the powers of 2 that sum up to `n`, and prints 'Yes' along with the list in descending order if successful, or 'No' otherwise. If `n` is less than `k`, it prints 'No'. The function assumes `n` is a non-negative integer and `k` is a positive integer, but does not perform any input validation. **
