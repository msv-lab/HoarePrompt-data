The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` assigns the input values to the variables `n` and `k`. The `input()` function reads a line of input, and the `split()` method splits this input into a list of substrings separated by whitespace. The `map(int,...)` function applies the `int()` function to each substring, converting them to integers.

Since the initial state specifies that `n` is a non-negative integer and `k` is a positive integer, and the code reads input values for `n` and `k`, the output state will have the input values assigned to these variables.

However, we can be more specific. The input values for `n` and `k` are provided through the `input()` function, which accepts an input and splits it into two integers. Let's call the input integers `input_n` and `input_k`, where `input_n` is the first integer and `input_k` is the second integer.

The variable `n` is assigned the value `input_n`, and the variable `k` is assigned the value `input_k`. The preconditions that `n` is a non-negative integer and `k` is a positive integer are still valid after the code has been executed, but now `n` and `k` have specific values equal to the input integers.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer equal to the first input integer, `k` is a positive integer equal to the second input integer**
