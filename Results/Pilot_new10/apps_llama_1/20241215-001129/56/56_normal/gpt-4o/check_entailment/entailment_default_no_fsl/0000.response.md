Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description. It seems to attempt to find the lexicographically largest sequence of bits that can represent the number `n` with `k` bits set, but it does not take into account the powers of 2.

One case where the program does not work correctly is when `n = 13` and `k = 2`. The code returns 'No', which is correct, but it does not attempt to find a sequence of powers of 2 that can sum up to 13. For example, `2^3 + 2^2 = 8 + 4 = 12`, which is close to 13, but the code does not consider this possibility.

Another case where the program does not work correctly is when `n = 23` and `k = 5`. The code returns 'Yes' with the sequence `3 3 2 1 0`, which is correct, but it does not guarantee that this sequence has the minimum `y` value. In fact, this sequence is not the lexicographically largest sequence with the minimum `y` value.

The code also does not correctly handle cases where `n` is a power of 2. For example, when `n = 16` and `k = 1`, the code should return 'Yes' with the sequence `4`, but it does not.

Overall, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem, and it does not consider all possible cases. Therefore, its correctness is **False**.
