To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the condition of the `while` loop: `len(bits) < k`. 

According to the given state, `bits` is a list containing the indices of all bits in the original value of `n` that are 1, in descending order. The number of bits set in `n` (i.e., the length of `bits`) is less than or equal to `k`. For the loop to execute at least one time, the condition `len(bits) < k` must be true. This means that the length of `bits` must be less than `k`.

Given that `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5 and `k` is less than or equal to `n`, and the number of bits set in `n` is less than or equal to `k`, for the loop to execute, the number of bits set in `n` (i.e., the length of `bits`) must be strictly less than `k`. 

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, and `k` is less than or equal to `n`.
- `bits` is a list containing the indices of all bits in the original value of `n` that are 1, in descending order.
- `i` is -1.
- The number of bits set in `n` (i.e., the length of `bits`) must be strictly less than `k`.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, and `k` is less than or equal to `n`, `bits` is a list containing the indices of all bits in the original value of `n` that are 1, in descending order, `i` is -1, and the number of bits set in `n` (i.e., the length of `bits`) must be strictly less than `k`**
