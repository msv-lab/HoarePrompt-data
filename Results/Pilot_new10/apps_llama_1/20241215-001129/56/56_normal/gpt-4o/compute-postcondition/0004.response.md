According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`. The loop will execute as long as `i` ranges from 60 to -1 in reverse order. Since `n` and `k` do not affect the loop execution and `bits` is an empty list, we only need to focus on `i`. 

Before the loop starts, `i` is not defined. For the loop to execute, `i` should start at 60.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, and k is less than or equal to n, `bits` is an empty list, `i` is 60**
