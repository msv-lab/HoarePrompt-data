The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, a non-negative integer `n` and a positive integer `k`, where `1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5` and `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18`. 

First, it checks if `k` is greater than `n`. If this condition is met, it returns the string 'No'. 

If `k` is less than or equal to `n`, it then generates a list `bits` containing the indices of all bits in the binary representation of `n` that are 1, in descending order.

Next, it checks if the number of bits set in `n` (i.e., the length of `bits`) is greater than `k`. If this condition is met, it returns the string 'No'.

If the number of bits set in `n` is less than or equal to `k`, it then enters a loop where it duplicates the smallest bit index in `bits` and decreases it by 1 until the length of `bits` is equal to `k`.

After the loop, it sorts `bits` in descending order and returns a string 'Yes' followed by the `k` elements of `bits`.

The functionality of the function is to determine whether it's possible to have `k` bits set in the binary representation of `n` by potentially adding new bits, and if so, return 'Yes' along with the indices of these bits in descending order. If it's not possible, it returns 'No'.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and a positive integer `k`, and returns 'Yes' followed by `k` sorted bit indices in descending order if it's possible to have `k` bits set in the binary representation of `n` by potentially adding new bits, and 'No' otherwise **
