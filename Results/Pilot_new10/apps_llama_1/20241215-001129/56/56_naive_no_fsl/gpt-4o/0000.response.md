Correctness: **True**

The program provided is a solution to the problem described. It first checks if the number of integers `k` is greater than the target sum `n`. If so, it returns "No" as it's impossible to find a sequence of `k` integers that sum up to `n` using powers of 2.

Then, it generates a list of bits representing the binary representation of `n`. If the number of bits is greater than `k`, it returns "No" as it's impossible to find a sequence of `k` integers that sum up to `n`.

Next, it enters a loop where it copies the smallest bit in the list and replaces it with two smaller bits. This process continues until the number of bits in the list is equal to `k`.

Finally, it sorts the list in descending order and returns "Yes" followed by the list of integers.

The program handles all the edge cases mentioned in the problem description, including cases where `n` is a power of 2, cases where `k` is greater than `n`, and cases where `n` is 1 and `k` is 2.

Upon reviewing the code, I couldn't find any case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The code correctly generates the lexicographically largest sequence of integers that sum up to `n` using powers of 2.

Note that the code assumes that the input integers `n` and `k` are valid and within the specified ranges. If the input is invalid, the code may not work correctly.

In summary, the program provided is correct and works as expected for all the cases mentioned in the problem description.
