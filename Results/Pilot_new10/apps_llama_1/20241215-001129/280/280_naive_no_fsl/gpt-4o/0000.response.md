Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it doesn't consider the constraint that the absolute difference in speed between any two adjacent seconds doesn't exceed `d`. It only checks for this constraint when calculating the speed at each second, but it doesn't guarantee that the speed at the previous second plus `d` won't exceed `v2 + (t - i - 1) * d`. 

However, a more specific reason the code is incorrect is due to the line where it calculates the speed at each second: 

```python
speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)
```

This line of code assumes that the speed should always increase as much as possible, but it doesn't consider the case where `speeds[i - 1] - d` is greater than `v2 + (t - i - 1) * d` if `v1` is larger than `v2`. In this case, it should decrease the speed as much as possible instead of increasing it.

For example, if `v1` is 10, `v2` is 5, `t` is 3, and `d` is 3, the program will calculate the speeds as `[10, 13, 5]`, which is incorrect because the difference in speed between the first and second seconds exceeds `d`. 

The correct calculation should ensure that the speed at each second is within the allowed range and also doesn't exceed `v2 + (t - i - 1) * d`. 

Here is a correct version of the code:
```python
def func():
    (v1, v2) = map(int, input().split())
    (t, d) = map(int, input().split())
    speeds = [0] * t
    speeds[0] = v1
    speeds[-1] = v2
    for i in range(1, t-1):
        speeds[i] = min(max(speeds[i - 1] - d, v2 - (t - i - 1) * d), speeds[i - 1] + d)
    total_distance = sum(speeds)
    print(total_distance)

func()
```
This version of the code correctly calculates the speed at each second, ensuring that it's within the allowed range and doesn't exceed `v2 + (t - i - 1) * d`. 

So in conclusion, because there is at least one potential case that the code does not work as expected then the program is incorrect.
