To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the provided output states for the first few iterations.

The loop code updates `max_speed`, `min_speed`, `max_length`, and `min_length` in each iteration. The key points to note are:

1. `max_speed` is updated to be the maximum of its current value minus `d` and `min_speed`. This means `max_speed` will decrease by at most `d` in each iteration but will not go below `min_speed`.
2. `min_speed` is updated to be the minimum of its current value plus `d` and `max_speed`. This means `min_speed` will increase by at most `d` in each iteration but will not exceed `max_speed`.
3. `max_length` and `min_length` are updated by adding the current `max_speed` and `min_speed` to them, respectively.

From the output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times, we can see patterns emerging:

- `max_speed` and `min_speed` are adjusted based on `d` and their previous values, ensuring `max_speed` does not go below `min_speed` and `min_speed` does not exceed `max_speed`.
- `max_length` and `min_length` accumulate the values of `max_speed` and `min_speed` over the iterations, starting from the initial `max(v1, v2) * t` and `min(v1, v2) * t`, respectively.

Considering the loop runs from `t - 1` down to `1` (since it stops when `i` reaches `0`), the total number of iterations is `t - 1`. Thus, the adjustments to `max_speed` and `min_speed` happen `t - 1` times, and so do the accumulations to `max_length` and `min_length`.

If `t` is `1` or less, the loop does not execute. In this case, `max_speed` remains as the maximum of `v1` and `v2`, `min_speed` remains as the minimum of `v1` and `v2`, `max_length` remains `max(v1, v2) * t`, and `min_length` remains `min(v1, v2) * t`.

Given these observations, after all iterations of the loop have finished:

- `v1` and `v2` retain their original input integer values.
- `t` and `d` also retain their original input values.
- `max_speed` will have decreased from its initial value (the maximum of `v1` and `v2`) by at most `d` for each iteration, but its final value is dependent on the interplay with `min_speed` and the number of iterations (`t - 1`).
- `min_speed` will have increased from its initial value (the minimum of `v1` and `v2`) by at most `d` for each iteration, with its final value similarly dependent on `max_speed` and the number of iterations.
- `max_length` and `min_length` accumulate the adjusted `max_speed` and `min_speed` values over `t - 1` iterations, starting from their initial values based on `v1`, `v2`, and `t`.

Therefore, the output state after the loop finishes can be described as follows, taking into account the initial conditions and the effects of the loop iterations:

Output State: **`v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `max_speed` is the result of iteratively adjusting the maximum of `v1` and `v2` by `d` over `t - 1` iterations while ensuring it does not go below `min_speed`, `min_speed` is the result of iteratively adjusting the minimum of `v1` and `v2` by `d` over `t - 1` iterations while ensuring it does not exceed `max_speed`, `max_length` is the accumulation of `max_speed` values over `t` (including the initial `max(v1, v2) * t`), and `min_length` is the accumulation of `min_speed` values over `t` (including the initial `min(v1, v2) * t`), with the loop's execution dependent on `t` being greater than 1.**
