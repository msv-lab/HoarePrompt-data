The value of `max_length` is updated by adding `max_speed` to it. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer greater than 2, `d` is an input integer, `max_speed` is the maximum of its previous value minus `d` and the new `min_speed`, `min_speed` is the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`, `max_length` is updated to `max_length + max_speed`, and `i` is `t - 3`.

Output State: **`v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer greater than 2, `d` is an input integer, `max_speed` is the maximum of its previous value minus `d` and the new `min_speed`, `min_speed` is the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`, `max_length` is `max_length + max_speed`, and `i` is `t - 3`**
