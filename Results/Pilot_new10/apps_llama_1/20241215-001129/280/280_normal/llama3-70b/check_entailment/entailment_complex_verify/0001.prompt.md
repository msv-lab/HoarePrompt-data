You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The on-board computer on Polycarp's car measured that the car speed at the beginning of some section of the path equals v_1 meters per second, and in the end it is v_2 meters per second. We know that this section of the route took exactly t seconds to pass.

Assuming that at each of the seconds the speed is constant, and between seconds the speed can change at most by d meters per second in absolute value (i.e., the difference in the speed of any two adjacent seconds does not exceed d in absolute value), find the maximum possible length of the path section in meters.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers v_1 and v_2 (1 ≤ v_1, v_2 ≤ 100) — the speeds in meters per second at the beginning of the segment and at the end of the segment, respectively.

The second line contains two integers t (2 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the time when the car moves along the segment in seconds, d (0 ≤ d ≤ 10) — the maximum value of the speed change between adjacent seconds.

It is guaranteed that there is a way to complete the segment so that:  the speed in the first second equals v_1,  the speed in the last second equals v_2,  the absolute value of difference of speeds between any two adjacent seconds doesn't exceed d. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of the path segment in meters. 


-----Examples-----
Input
5 6
4 2

Output
26
Input
10 10
10 0

Output
100


-----Note-----

In the first sample the sequence of speeds of Polycarpus' car can look as follows: 5, 7, 8, 6. Thus, the total path is 5 + 7 + 8 + 6 = 26 meters.

In the second sample, as d = 0, the car covers the whole segment at constant speed v = 10. In t = 10 seconds it covers the distance of 100 meters.
Program:
```
def func():
    (v1, v2) = map(int, input().split())
    (t, d) = map(int, input().split())
    max_speed = max(v1, v2)
    min_speed = min(v1, v2)
    max_length = max_speed * t
    min_length = min_speed * t
    for i in range(t - 1, 0, -1):
        max_speed = max(max_speed - d, min_speed)
        min_speed = min(min_speed + d, max_speed)
        max_length += max_speed
        min_length += min_speed
    print(max_length)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program provided does not correctly calculate the maximum possible length of the path segment in meters. 

The main issue with the program is its approach to calculating the `max_length`. It starts with an initial `max_length` as `max_speed * t` and then updates `max_speed` and `min_speed` in a loop, adding `max_speed` to `max_length` in each iteration. However, this approach does not accurately represent the problem's requirements.

In the problem, the car's speed can change at most by `d` meters per second in absolute value between any two adjacent seconds. The program's current implementation does not take into account the optimal way to change the speed to maximize the length of the path segment.

For example, consider the case where `v1 = 5`, `v2 = 6`, `t = 4`, and `d = 2`. The program will calculate `max_length` as `6 * 4 = 24` and then update `max_speed` and `min_speed` in the loop. However, the optimal solution would be to have speeds `5, 7, 8, 6`, resulting in a total length of `5 + 7 + 8 + 6 = 26` meters. The program does not produce this optimal solution.

To correctly solve the problem, a different approach is needed, such as using dynamic programming or a more sophisticated algorithm that takes into account the optimal way to change the speed at each second. 

Here's an example of how to correctly solve this problem:
```python
def func():
    (v1, v2) = map(int, input().split())
    (t, d) = map(int, input().split())
    speeds = [v1]
    for _ in range(t - 1):
        if speeds[-1] < v2:
            speeds.append(min(speeds[-1] + d, v2))
        elif speeds[-1] > v2:
            speeds.append(max(speeds[-1] - d, v2))
        else:
            speeds.append(speeds[-1])
    speeds.append(v2)
    max_length = sum(speeds)
    print(max_length)
```
This corrected program calculates the maximum possible length of the path segment by iteratively updating the speeds, ensuring that the speed changes by at most `d` meters per second in absolute value between any two adjacent seconds, and finally summing up the speeds to get the total length.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: v_1 and v_2 are integers between 1 and 100, t is an integer between 2 and 100, and d is an integer between 0 and 10, such that there exists a sequence of speeds where the first speed equals v_1, the last speed equals v_2, and the absolute difference between any two adjacent speeds does not exceed d.
def func():
    v1, v2 = map(int, input().split())
    t, d = map(int, input().split())
    max_speed = max(v1, v2)
    min_speed = min(v1, v2)
    max_length = max_speed * t
    min_length = min_speed * t
    for i in range(t - 1, 0, -1):
        max_speed = max(max_speed - d, min_speed)
        
        min_speed = min(min_speed + d, max_speed)
        
        max_length += max_speed
        
        min_length += min_speed
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `max_speed` is the result of iteratively adjusting the maximum of `v1` and `v2` by `d` over `t - 1` iterations while ensuring it does not go below `min_speed`, `min_speed` is the result of iteratively adjusting the minimum of `v1` and `v2` by `d` over `t - 1` iterations while ensuring it does not exceed `max_speed`, `max_length` is the accumulation of `max_speed` values over `t` (including the initial `max(v1, v2) * t`), and `min_length` is the accumulation of `min_speed` values over `t` (including the initial `min(v1, v2) * t`), with the loop's execution dependent on `t` being greater than 1.
    print(max_length)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and prints the maximum possible distance (`max_length`) that can be traveled under given constraints, including initial and final speeds (`v1` and `v2`), time (`t`), and maximum speed difference per time unit (`d`), but does not explicitly verify the existence of a valid sequence of speeds as suggested by the annotations.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
