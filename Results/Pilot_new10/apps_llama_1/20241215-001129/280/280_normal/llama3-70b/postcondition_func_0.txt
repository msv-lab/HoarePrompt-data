The function calculates and prints the maximum possible distance (`max_length`) that can be traveled under given constraints, including initial and final speeds (`v1` and `v2`), time (`t`), and maximum speed difference per time unit (`d`), but does not explicitly verify the existence of a valid sequence of speeds as suggested by the annotations.
