The value of `speeds[0]` is updated to `v1`. The list `speeds` initially contained `t` zeros, and now its first element is `v1`. The values of `v1`, `v2`, `t`, and `d` are not affected by this code. 

Output State: **`v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `speeds` is a list of length `t` where the first element is `v1` and the rest are zeros**
