The function `func` reads four integer parameters: two speeds `v1` and `v2`, time `t`, and acceleration `d`, where `1 <= v1, v2 <= 100`, `2 <= t <= 100`, and `0 <= d <= 10`. It calculates a list of speeds where the first element is `v1`, the last element is `v2`, and each subsequent element is the minimum of the previous speed plus `d` and `v2` plus `d` times the number of elements remaining after the current index. The function then calculates the total distance traveled by summing up all the speeds in the list and prints this total distance.

Given the parameters, potential edge cases include when `t` is 2, in which case the list of speeds will only have two elements (`v1` and `v2`), and when `d` is 0, in which case the speed will remain constant after `v1` until it reaches `v2`. However, the code correctly handles these edge cases by adjusting the speeds list according to the given formula.

Functionality: ** The function reads two initial and final speeds, time, and acceleration, calculates a list of speeds based on these inputs where each subsequent speed is the minimum of the previous speed plus acceleration and the final speed plus acceleration times the remaining time, and prints the total distance traveled by summing up these speeds. **
