The code creates a list called `speeds` of length `t`, where all elements are initialized to 0. The values of `v1`, `v2`, `t`, and `d` are not changed by this code. 

Output State: **`v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `speeds` is a list of `t` zeros**
