Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately simulates the sequence of movements and checks the conditions specified in the problem description. Here's why it works:

1. The program initializes the current latitude (`curr_lat`) to 90, representing the North Pole.
2. It iterates over each movement, updating the current latitude based on the direction and distance.
3. When the direction is "North" or "South", it updates the latitude by adding or subtracting the distance divided by 111.195 (which is the approximate conversion factor from kilometers to degrees latitude).
4. It ignores "West" and "East" movements, as they don't affect the latitude.
5. After each movement, it checks if the current latitude is within the valid range (-90 to 90). If it's outside this range, it prints "NO" and exits.
6. It also checks if the current latitude is at the poles (90 or -90) and if the direction is invalid (i.e., not "South" at the North Pole or not "North" at the South Pole). If so, it prints "NO" and exits.
7. Finally, after all movements have been processed, it checks if the final latitude is equal to 90 (the North Pole). If it is, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

The program correctly handles all the conditions specified in the problem description:

* It ensures that if Limak is at the North Pole, he can only move south.
* It ensures that if Limak is at the South Pole, he can only move north.
* It checks if the journey ends at the North Pole.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly simulates the sequence of movements while checking the specified conditions. Therefore, it always does what the problem description says, making it correct.
