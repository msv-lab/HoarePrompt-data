The function simulates a sequence of 1 to 50 movements with distances between 1 and 10^6 in the "North", "South", "West", or "East" directions, ignoring "West" and "East" movements, and checks if the resulting latitude is equal to 90 after accounting for valid "North" and "South" movements, printing "YES" if the final latitude is 90 and "NO" otherwise, while also handling invalid pole movements and out-of-bounds latitudes by printing "NO" and exiting
