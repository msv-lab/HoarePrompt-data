The function `func` accepts a sequence of movements, where each movement consists of a non-negative integer distance `t` and a direction `dir`. The direction can be one of the following: "North", "South", "West", "East". The distance `t` is constrained between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive), and there are between 1 and 50 (inclusive) such movements in the sequence. 

However, the provided information does not specify the output of the function. To accurately describe the functionality, the output details are necessary. Given the current information, we can only describe the input parameters.


Functionality: **The function accepts a sequence of 1 to 50 movements, each consisting of a non-negative integer distance between 1 and 10^6 and a direction that is one of "North", "South", "West", "East".**
