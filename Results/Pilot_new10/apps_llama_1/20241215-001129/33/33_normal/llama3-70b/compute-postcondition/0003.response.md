The code splits the input into two variables: `t` and `dir`. The value of `t` is a string representing the first part of the input, and the value of `dir` is a string representing the second part of the input. 

The input is a sequence of `n` movements, but only the first movement is processed in this code snippet. The values of `n` and `curr_lat` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `curr_lat` is 90, `t` is the first part of the input movement, `dir` is the second part of the input movement**
