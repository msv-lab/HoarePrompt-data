The `exit()` function terminates the program immediately. As a result, the program does not continue executing any further lines of code, and no variables are changed after the `exit()` call. The states of all variables remain the same as before the `exit()` call. 
Given the initial state: `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `t` is the integer value of the first part of the input movement, `dir` is either 'North', 'South', or neither, the current value of `curr_lat` is either less than -90 or greater than 90, and 'NO' has been printed.
The `exit()` function does not affect the state of these variables. It simply stops the execution of the program. Therefore, the Output State is: the program has stopped execution, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `t` is the integer value of the first part of the input movement, `dir` is either 'North', 'South', or neither, the current value of `curr_lat` is either less than -90 or greater than 90, and 'NO' has been printed.

Output State: **the program has stopped execution, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `t` is the integer value of the first part of the input movement, `dir` is either 'North', 'South', or neither, the current value of `curr_lat` is either less than -90 or greater than 90, and 'NO' has been printed**
