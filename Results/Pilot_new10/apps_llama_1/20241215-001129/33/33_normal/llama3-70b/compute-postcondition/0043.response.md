According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again, but since `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the state, the only relevant state variable affected by this loop is `n` itself. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be at least 2 to allow for another iteration. After the iteration, `n` must be at least 1 (because one iteration just occurred), but actually, for the loop to execute again `n` is decreased by 1, so `n` is at least 1 and becomes 0 after one iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `t` is an integer, `dir` is either 'North', 'South', or neither, `curr_lat` is within the range [-90, 90]**
