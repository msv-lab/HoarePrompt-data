Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `t` is the integer value of the first part of the input movement, `dir` is either 'North', 'South', or neither. If `curr_lat` is initially less than -90 or greater than 90, the program has stopped execution and 'NO' has been printed. If `curr_lat` is -90 and `dir` is not 'North', then `dir` is either 'South' or neither, 'NO' has been printed to the console, and the program has terminated. Otherwise, the execution continues with `curr_lat` being within the range [-90, 90] and `dir` being 'North' if `curr_lat` is -90, or any of the allowed values if `curr_lat` is not -90.***
