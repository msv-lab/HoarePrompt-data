Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string input, `curr_lat` is within the range [-90, 90]. If `dir` is 'North', then `curr_lat` is updated to `curr_lat + t / 111.195`. If `dir` is 'South', then `curr_lat` is updated to `curr_lat - t / 111.195`. For any other direction, `curr_lat` remains unchanged.**
