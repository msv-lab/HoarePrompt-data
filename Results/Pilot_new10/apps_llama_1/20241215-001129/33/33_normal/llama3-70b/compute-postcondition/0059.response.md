Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string. If `curr_lat` is not within the range [-90, 90], 'NO' has been printed to the console, and the program has been terminated. If `curr_lat` is within the range [-90, 90], then if `dir` is 'North', `curr_lat` is updated to `curr_lat + t / 111.195`. If `dir` is 'South', then `curr_lat` is updated to `curr_lat - t / 111.195`. For any other direction, `curr_lat` remains unchanged, unless `curr_lat` is -90 and `dir` is not 'North', in which case 'NO' has been printed to the console, and the program has been terminated. Additionally, if `curr_lat` is 90 and `dir` is not 'South', 'NO' has been printed to the console, and the program has been terminated. Otherwise, the program continues with the updated `curr_lat` value.***
