Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `t` is an integer, `dir` is either 'North', 'South', or neither. If `curr_lat` is outside the range [-90, 90], the program has terminated with `n`, `t`, and `dir` retaining their respective values and `curr_lat` bounded by the range [-90, 90]. If `curr_lat` is -90 and `dir` is not 'North', the program has printed 'NO' and terminated. For all other cases, the program continues with its current state.***
