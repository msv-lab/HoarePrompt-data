The given code is a simple print statement that outputs the string 'NO'. This statement does not modify any variables. 

The values of `n`, `t`, `dir`, and `curr_lat` remain unchanged because the print statement does not affect them. 

The Output State remains the same as the initial state: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string input, `curr_lat` is within the range [-90, 90]. If `dir` is 'North', then `curr_lat` is updated to `curr_lat + t / 111.195`. If `dir` is 'South', then `curr_lat` is updated to `curr_lat - t / 111.195`. For any other direction, `curr_lat` remains unchanged. Also, 'NO' has been printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string input, `curr_lat` is within the range [-90, 90]. If `dir` is 'North', then `curr_lat` is `curr_lat + t / 111.195`. If `dir` is 'South', then `curr_lat` is `curr_lat - t / 111.195`. For any other direction, `curr_lat` remains unchanged, and 'NO' has been printed.**
