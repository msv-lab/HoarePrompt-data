The value of `curr_lat` is decreased by `t / 111.195`. The initial value of `curr_lat` is 90, and `t` is the integer value of the first part of the input movement. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `curr_lat` is `90 - t / 111.195`, `t` is the integer value of the first part of the input movement, the direction `dir` is not 'North' and the current value of `dir` is 'South'.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `curr_lat` is `90 - t / 111.195`, `t` is the integer value of the first part of the input movement, the direction `dir` is not 'North' and the current value of `dir` is 'South'**
