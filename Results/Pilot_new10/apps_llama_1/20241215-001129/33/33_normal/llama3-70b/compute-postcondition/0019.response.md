The given code simply prints 'NO' to the console. This operation does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `n`, `t`, `dir`, and `curr_lat` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `t` is the integer value of the first part of the input movement, `dir` is either 'South' or neither, `curr_lat` is -90, and 'NO' has been printed to the console.**
