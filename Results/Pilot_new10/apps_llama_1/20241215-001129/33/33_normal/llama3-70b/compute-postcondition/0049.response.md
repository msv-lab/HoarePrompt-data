Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string input, if `dir` is 'South', then `curr_lat` is updated to `curr_lat` - `t` / 111.195, otherwise, the program moves to the next iteration of the loop without changing `curr_lat`, which remains within the range [-90, 90].**
