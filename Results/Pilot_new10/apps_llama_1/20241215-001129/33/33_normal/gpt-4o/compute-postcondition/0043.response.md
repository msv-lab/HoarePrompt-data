Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `t` is the integer part of the user's input, `dir` is the string part of the user's input. If `position` is less than 0 or greater than 20000, then `position` remains unchanged and `valid` is `False`. Otherwise, the state of `position` and `valid` depends on the previous state and direction: if `dir` is 'North', then `position` is `position - t`, and if `position - t` is less than 0, then `valid` is `False`; if `dir` is 'South', then `position` is `position + t`, and if `position + t` is greater than 20000, then `valid` is `False`; if `dir` is 'West' or 'East', the state of `position` and `valid` may change based on the direction, specifically, if `position` is 0 or 20000, `valid` is `False`; if `dir` is neither 'North', 'South', 'West', nor 'East', the state of `n`, `t`, `dir`, `position`, and `valid` remains unchanged.***
