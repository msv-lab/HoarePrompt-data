Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `t` is an integer representing the first part of the user's input, `dir` is the second part of the user's input, `_` is incremented by 1, and `n` is greater than `_`. If `dir` is 'North', then `position` is `position - t`, and if the new `position` is less than 0, then `valid` is `False`. If `dir` is 'South', then `position` is `position + t`, and if `position + t` is greater than 20000, then `valid` is `False`. If `dir` is 'West' or 'East', then `position` may have changed based on previous `dir` and `t`, and if `position` is 0 or 20000, then `valid` is `False`. If `dir` is neither 'North', 'South', 'West', nor 'East', then the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
