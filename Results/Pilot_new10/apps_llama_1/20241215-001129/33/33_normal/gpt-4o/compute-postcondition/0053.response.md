The code sets `valid` to `False`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
`n` is still a positive integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `t` is still an integer representing the first part of the user's input, `dir` is still the second part of the user's input, `position` may have changed based on previous `dir` and `t`, `_` is still incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than `_`. 
Since `valid` is now `False`, this is the only change to the output state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `t` is an integer representing the first part of the user's input, `dir` is the second part of the user's input, `position` may have changed based on previous `dir` and `t`, `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than `_`, and `valid` is `False`**
