The variable `t` is converted to an integer using the `int()` function, which takes the string input by the user and converts it to an integer. The previous value of `t` as a string is lost, and `t` now holds the integer value. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `position` is 0, `valid` is True, `t` is an integer input by the user, `dir` is a string input by the user**
