Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `dir` is 'North', `t` is an integer input by the user. If `position - t` is less than 0, `position` is 0 and `valid` is `False`. Otherwise, the state of `position` and `valid` remains unchanged as there is no else part to modify them.**
