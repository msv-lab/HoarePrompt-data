The value of `valid` is set to `False`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `position` is 0, `valid` is `False`, `t` is an integer greater than 0 input by the user, `dir` is 'North', and `t` is greater than `position`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `position` is 0, `valid` is `False`, `t` is an integer greater than 0 input by the user, `dir` is 'North'**
