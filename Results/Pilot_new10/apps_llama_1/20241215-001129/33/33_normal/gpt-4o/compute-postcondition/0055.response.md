Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `t` is an integer representing the first part of the user's input, `dir` is the second part of the user's input, if `dir` is 'West' or 'East', then `position` may have changed based on previous `dir` and `t`, `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than `_`, and if `position` is 0 or 20000, then `valid` is `False`. If `dir` is not 'West' or 'East', then the state of the variables remains unchanged as there is no else part to handle this case.***
