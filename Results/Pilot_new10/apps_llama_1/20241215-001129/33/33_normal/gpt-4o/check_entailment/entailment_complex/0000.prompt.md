You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: In this problem we assume the Earth to be a completely round ball and its surface a perfect sphere. The length of the equator and any meridian is considered to be exactly 40 000 kilometers. Thus, travelling from North Pole to South Pole or vice versa takes exactly 20 000 kilometers.

Limak, a polar bear, lives on the North Pole. Close to the New Year, he helps somebody with delivering packages all around the world. Instead of coordinates of places to visit, Limak got a description how he should move, assuming that he starts from the North Pole. The description consists of n parts. In the i-th part of his journey, Limak should move t_{i} kilometers in the direction represented by a string dir_{i} that is one of: "North", "South", "West", "East".

Limak isn’t sure whether the description is valid. You must help him to check the following conditions:  If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the North Pole, he can move only to the South.  If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the South Pole, he can move only to the North.  The journey must end on the North Pole. 

Check if the above conditions are satisfied and print "YES" or "NO" on a single line.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).

The i-th of next n lines contains an integer t_{i} and a string dir_{i} (1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 10^6, $\operatorname{dir}_{i} \in \{\text{North, South, West, East} \}$) — the length and the direction of the i-th part of the journey, according to the description Limak got.


-----Output-----

Print "YES" if the description satisfies the three conditions, otherwise print "NO", both without the quotes.


-----Examples-----

7500 South

Output
YES

Input

4000 East

Output
NO

Input

20000 South
1000 North
1000000 West
9000 North
10000 North

Output
YES

Input
3
20000 South
10 East
20000 North

Output
NO

Input
2
1000 North
1000 South

Output
NO

Input
4
50 South
50 North
15000 South
15000 North

Output
YES



-----Note-----

Drawings below show how Limak's journey would look like in first two samples. In the second sample the answer is "NO" because he doesn't end on the North Pole. [Image]
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of n, the number of journey parts, followed by n lines, each containing a distance t_i and a direction dir_i, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 1 ≤ t_i ≤ 10^6, and dir_i is one of "North", "South", "West", or "East".
def func():
    n = int(input())
    position = 0
    valid = True
    for _ in range(n):
        t, dir = input().split()
        
        t = int(t)
        
        if dir == 'North':
            if position - t < 0:
                valid = False
            position -= t
        elif dir == 'South':
            if position + t > 20000:
                valid = False
            position += t
        elif dir in ('West', 'East'):
            if position == 0 or position == 20000:
                valid = False
        
        if position < 0 or position > 20000:
            valid = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `position` is an integer between 0 and 20000 (inclusive) or out of bounds based on the user inputs, and `valid` is `True` if all movements were within bounds and did not attempt 'West' or 'East' at boundary positions, otherwise `False`.
    if (position != 0) :
        valid = False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), if `position` is not equal to 0, then `position` is an integer between 1 and 20000 (inclusive) and `valid` is `False`; otherwise, the state of `position` and `valid` remains as defined by the precondition, with `position` being 0.
    if valid :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `position` is 0, and if `valid` is `True`, then 'YES' has been printed, otherwise 'NO' has been printed to the console and `valid` is `False`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of movements defined by distance and direction, checks the validity of these movements based on given constraints (bounds and direction at boundary positions), and prints "YES" if all movements are valid and end at the starting position; otherwise, it prints "NO", covering all potential cases including invalid inputs and edge scenarios not explicitly handled by the function's logic.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
