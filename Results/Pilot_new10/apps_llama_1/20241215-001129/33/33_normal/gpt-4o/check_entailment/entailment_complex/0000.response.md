Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of how it meets the requirements:

1.  **Checking for valid movements at the North Pole**: The program checks if Limak is at the North Pole (position == 0) and attempts to move in any direction other than South. If this condition is met, it sets `valid` to `False`.
2.  **Checking for valid movements at the South Pole**: The program checks if Limak is at the South Pole (position == 20000) and attempts to move in any direction other than North. If this condition is met, it sets `valid` to `False`.
3.  **Checking for valid movements**: The program updates Limak's position based on the direction and distance of each movement. It also checks if the new position is within the valid range (0 to 20000). If the position goes out of bounds, it sets `valid` to `False`.
4.  **Checking if the journey ends at the North Pole**: After processing all movements, the program checks if Limak's final position is at the North Pole (position == 0). If it's not, it sets `valid` to `False`.
5.  **Printing the result**: Finally, the program prints "YES" if all movements are valid and the journey ends at the North Pole (`valid` is `True`), and "NO" otherwise.

The program correctly handles all potential cases, including:

*   Invalid inputs: The program checks for out-of-bounds positions and invalid movements, setting `valid` to `False` in these cases.
*   Edge scenarios: The program correctly handles movements that start or end at the North or South Pole, as well as movements that attempt to move in an invalid direction at these poles.

Overall, the program accurately implements the logic described in the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly.
