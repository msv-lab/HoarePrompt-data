Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `x` is a list of input integers, `y` is a list of input integers. If the sum of the elements in `x` is not equal to the sum of the elements in `y`, then 'No' has been printed to the console. If the sum of the elements in `x` is equal to the sum of the elements in `y`, then `x` and `y` are sorted lists, and if `x` is equal to `y`, 'Yes' has been printed; otherwise, 'No' has been printed to the console.**
