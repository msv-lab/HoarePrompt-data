The given Python code snippet is `print('No')`. This code prints the string 'No' to the console, but it does not modify any variables. Therefore, the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `x` is a sorted list of input integers, `y` is a sorted list of input integers, the sum of the elements in `x` is equal to the sum of the elements in `y`, `x` is not equal to `y`, and 'No' has been printed to the console.**
