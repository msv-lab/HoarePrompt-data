The function func accepts an integer n and two lists of n integers as input from the user. It checks if the sum of the elements in the two lists is equal. If the sums are not equal, it prints 'No'. If the sums are equal, it sorts the two lists and checks if they are equal. If the sorted lists are equal, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The functionality of the function is to compare two lists of integers based on their sums and sorted contents, and print 'Yes' if they are equivalent and 'No' otherwise, considering all potential edge cases such as lists with different lengths (which is not possible in this case since the length of the lists is defined by the input integer n), lists with negative numbers (which is not possible in this case since the input integers are between 0 and 1000), lists with non-integer numbers (which is not possible in this case since the input is defined as integers), and empty lists (which is not possible in this case since the length of the lists is at least 1).

Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer n and two lists of n integers as input, checks if their sums are equal, and if so, checks if the sorted lists are equal, printing 'Yes' if they are equivalent and 'No' otherwise. **
