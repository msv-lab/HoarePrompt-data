The code `y.sort()` sorts the list `y` in ascending order. The initial state specifies that `x` is a sorted list of input integers, and the sum of the elements in `x` is equal to the sum of the elements in `y`. After sorting `y`, it will also be in ascending order, just like `x`. However, this does not affect the sum of the elements in `y`, which remains equal to the sum of the elements in `x`. The value of `n` is not affected by the sorting operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `x` is a sorted list of input integers, `y` is a sorted list of input integers, and the sum of the elements in `x` is equal to the sum of the elements in `y`.**
