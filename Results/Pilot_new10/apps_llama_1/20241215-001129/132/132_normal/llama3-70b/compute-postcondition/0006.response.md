The given code sorts the list `x` in ascending order. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the list `y` is also unaffected. The sum of the elements in `x` is still equal to the sum of the elements in `y`, as sorting does not change the sum of the elements in a list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `x` is a sorted list of input integers, `y` is a list of input integers, and the sum of the elements in `x` is equal to the sum of the elements in `y`.**
