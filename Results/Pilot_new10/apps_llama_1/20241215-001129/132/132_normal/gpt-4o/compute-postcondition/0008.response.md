The code simply prints the string 'Yes' and does not modify any variables. Therefore, the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `total_x`, and `total_y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of integers read from the input, `total_x` is the sum of the integers in `x`, `total_y` is the sum of the integers in `y`, `total_y` is less than or equal to `total_x`, and the string 'Yes' has been printed**
