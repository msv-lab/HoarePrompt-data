The code `total_x = sum(x)` calculates the sum of all integers in the list `x` and assigns it to the variable `total_x`. 

Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), and `x` is a list of `n` integers, the sum of the integers in `x` can be any integer value depending on the actual integers in the list. 

The state of `y` is not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of integers read from the input, `total_x` is the sum of the integers in `x`.**
