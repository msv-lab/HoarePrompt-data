The code reads an integer `n` from the input file. The value of `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive) as specified in the initial state. 

The states of the other variables are not affected, so the output state is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), and there are `n` integers `x_1, x_2,..., x_n` and `y_1, y_2,..., y_n` that have not been read yet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), and there are `n` integers `x_1, x_2,..., x_n` and `y_1, y_2,..., y_n` that have not been read yet.**
