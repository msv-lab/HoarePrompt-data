Based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment seems to be accurate. The program checks if the total number of stones in the garden is reduced or remains the same after the jury members' actions, which aligns with the problem constraints that jury members can only take or move stones, not add them.

The annotated version of the code also confirms that the program is reading the input correctly and calculating the sums of the integers in each line. The if-else block is correctly implemented to print 'Yes' if the sum of the second line is less than or equal to the sum of the first line, and 'No' otherwise.

The reason why the original assessment is accurate is that the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The key insight here is that the jury members can only reduce the total number of stones (by taking them away) or redistribute them among the piles (by moving stones from one pile to another). Therefore, if the total number of stones in the second observation is less than or equal to the first, it is possible that the jury members' actions could have resulted in this change, and thus the program correctly outputs 'Yes'. Conversely, if the total number of stones increases, the program correctly outputs 'No' because this is impossible given the constraints on the jury members' actions.

The examples provided in the problem description also align with the program's output, further supporting the conclusion that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
