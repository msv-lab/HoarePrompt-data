Correctness: **True**

The code works as expected for every potential case. It checks if the total number of stones in the second observation is less than or equal to the total number of stones in the first observation. If it is, the code prints 'Yes', indicating that the records can be consistent. Otherwise, it prints 'No'. This is in line with the problem description, which states that jury members can either take one stone for themselves or move one stone from one pile to another.

The code handles all potential cases, including the examples provided in the problem description. For instance, in the first example, the total number of stones in the first observation is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15, and the total number of stones in the second observation is 2 + 1 + 4 + 3 + 5 = 15. Since the total number of stones in the second observation is equal to the total number of stones in the first observation, the code correctly prints 'Yes'.

In the second example, the total number of stones in the first observation is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5, and the total number of stones in the second observation is 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 3. Since the total number of stones in the second observation is less than the total number of stones in the first observation, the code correctly prints 'Yes'.

In the third example, the total number of stones in the first observation is 2 + 3 + 9 = 14, and the total number of stones in the second observation is 1 + 7 + 9 = 17. Since the total number of stones in the second observation is greater than the total number of stones in the first observation, the code correctly prints 'No'.

Overall, the code correctly implements the problem description and handles all potential cases.
