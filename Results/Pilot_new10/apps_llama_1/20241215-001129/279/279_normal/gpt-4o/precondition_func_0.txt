Input is provided in a specific format: the first line contains an integer n, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2*10^5, representing the number of skewers. The second line contains a sequence of integers p_1, p_2,..., p_n, where 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, representing the permutation according to which the skewers are moved. The third line contains a sequence of integers b_1, b_2,..., b_n, consisting of zeros and ones, representing when to reverse the skewers.
