#State of the program right berfore the function call: Input is provided in a specific format: the first line contains an integer n, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2*10^5, representing the number of skewers. The second line contains a sequence of integers p_1, p_2,..., p_n, where 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, representing the permutation according to which the skewers are moved. The third line contains a sequence of integers b_1, b_2,..., b_n, consisting of zeros and ones, representing when to reverse the skewers.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    p = list(map(int, data[1:n + 1]))
    b = list(map(int, data[n + 1:2 * n + 1]))
    visited = [False] * n
    cycles = []
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            cycle = []
            x = i
            while not visited[x]:
                visited[x] = True
                cycle.append(x)
                x = p[x] - 1
            cycles.append(cycle)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `data` contains the string representation of the original `n`, `p` and `b` are lists of integers, `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values where `True` indicates an element is part of a detected cycle, `cycles` is a list of lists containing the indices of detected cycles in the sequence defined by `p`.
    no_reverse_components = sum(all(b[x] == 0 for x in cycle) for cycle in cycles)
    if (len(cycles) == 1) :
        print(0)
    else :
        print(no_reverse_components if no_reverse_components > 0 else 1)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `data` contains the string representation of the original `n`, `p` and `b` are lists of integers, `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values, `cycles` is a list of lists containing the indices of detected cycles. If the number of cycles is 1, the value 0 has been printed. Otherwise, if `no_reverse_components` is greater than 0, `no_reverse_components` has been returned; otherwise, 1 has been returned.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads the number of skewers, a permutation sequence, and a reversal sequence from the standard input, identifies cycles in the permutation, calculates the number of cycles where no reversal is required, and prints 0 if there is only one cycle, the number of cycles where no reversal is required if this number is greater than 0, or 1 otherwise, assuming the input is in the specified format.
