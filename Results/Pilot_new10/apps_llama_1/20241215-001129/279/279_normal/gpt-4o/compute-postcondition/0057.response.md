To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and the initial state.

The initial state is: 
- `n` is an integer between 3 and 2*10^5,
- `data` contains the string representation of the original `n`,
- `p` and `b` are lists of integers,
- `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values where `visited[p[2] - 1]` is `True` and `visited[p[p[2] - 1] - 1]` is `True`,
- `cycles` is a list containing at least two elements,
- `i` is 2,
- `x` is `p[p[2] - 1] - 1`, and
- `cycle` is `[2, p[2] - 1]`.

The code snippet is:
```python
cycle.append(x)
```
This code appends the value of `x` to the `cycle` list.

Given that `x` is `p[p[2] - 1] - 1`, after executing the code, the `cycle` list will be updated to include this value. 

Therefore, the updated `cycle` list will be `[2, p[2] - 1, p[p[2] - 1] - 1]`.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 2*10^5, `data` contains the string representation of the original `n`, `p` and `b` are lists of integers, `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values where `visited[p[2] - 1]` is `True` and `visited[p[p[2] - 1] - 1]` is `True`, `cycles` is a list containing at least two elements, `i` is 2, `x` is `p[p[2] - 1] - 1`, and `cycle` is `[2, p[2] - 1, p[p[2] - 1] - 1]`.**
