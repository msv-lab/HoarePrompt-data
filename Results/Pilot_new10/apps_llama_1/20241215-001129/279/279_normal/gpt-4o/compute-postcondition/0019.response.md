To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop, which is `not visited[x]`. For the loop to execute again, this condition must be true, meaning `visited[x]` must be `False`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5,
- `data` is a list containing the string representation of `n`,
- `p` is a list of integers corresponding to `p_1`, `p_2`,..., `p_n` where `p[0]` is not equal to 1,
- `b` is a list of integers corresponding to `b_1`, `b_2`,..., `b_n`,
- `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values where `visited[0]` is `True` and `visited[p[0]-1]` is `True`,
- `cycles` is an empty list,
- `i` is 0,
- `x` is `p[p[0] - 1] - 1`, and
- `cycle` is a list containing two elements: 0 and `p[0] - 1`.

The critical part here is the value of `x` and the state of `visited[x]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `visited[x]` must be `False`. 

Since `x` is calculated as `p[p[0] - 1] - 1`, and we know that `visited[0]` and `visited[p[0]-1]` are `True`, we need to ensure that `x` does not point to an index in `visited` that is already `True` (except for the cases of `0` and `p[0]-1` which are already known to be `True`). 

However, without specific information on the values of `p` and how `x` evolves, we cannot definitively adjust `x` or `visited` directly based on the given information. But we know that for the loop to continue, `visited[x]` must be `False`.

Thus, the adjustment needed is that `x` must correspond to an index in `visited` that is currently `False`, or in other words, the value of `x` must be such that it points to an unvisited node.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `data` is a list containing the string representation of `n`, `p` is a list of integers corresponding to `p_1`, `p_2`,..., `p_n` where `p[0]` is not equal to 1, `b` is a list of integers corresponding to `b_1`, `b_2`,..., `b_n`, `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values where `visited[0]` is `True` and `visited[p[0]-1]` is `True` and `visited[x]` is `False`, `cycles` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `x` is `p[p[0] - 1] - 1`, and `cycle` is a list containing two elements: 0 and `p[0] - 1`**
