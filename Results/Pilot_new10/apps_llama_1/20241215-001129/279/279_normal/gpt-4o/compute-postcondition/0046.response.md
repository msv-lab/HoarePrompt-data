The value of `x` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 3 and 2*10^5, `data` contains the string representation of the original `n`, `p` and `b` are lists of integers, if `visited[i]` is `False`, then `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values where at least the indices corresponding to the detected cycle are `True`, `cycles` is a list containing at least two elements where the first element is the original detected cycle and the second element is the sequence of indices `cycle` representing the detected cycle, `i` is 2, `x` is 2, and `cycle` is an empty list `[]`.
