The code initializes an empty list called `cycle`. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `data` is a list containing the string representation of `n`, `p_1`, `p_2`,..., `p_n`, `p` is a list of integers corresponding to `p_1`, `p_2`,..., `p_n`, `b_1`, `b_2`,..., `b_n` are either 0 or 1, `b` is a list of integers corresponding to `b_1`, `b_2`,..., `b_n`, `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values, `cycles` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `visited[i]` is `False`, and a new variable `cycle` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `data` is a list containing the string representation of `n`, `p_1`, `p_2`,..., `p_n`, `p` is a list of integers corresponding to `p_1`, `p_2`,..., `p_n`, `b_1`, `b_2`,..., `b_n` are either 0 or 1, `b` is a list of integers corresponding to `b_1`, `b_2`,..., `b_n`, `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values, `cycles` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `visited[i]` is `False`, and `cycle` is an empty list**
