The function `func_1` accepts no explicit parameters but rather relies on input provided in a specific format: 

1. An integer `n`, where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2*10^5, representing the number of skewers.
2. A sequence of integers `p_1, p_2,..., p_n`, where 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ `n`, representing the permutation according to which the skewers are moved.
3. A sequence of integers `b_1, b_2,..., b_n`, consisting of zeros and ones, representing when to reverse the skewers.

However, since the function `func_1()` does not explicitly accept these as parameters but rather presumably reads them from an input source (like standard input), the description of its functionality must account for how it processes this input. 

Given the nature of the problem, the function likely returns a result based on the provided permutation and reversal instructions. Without specific details on the output, we can infer that the functionality involves processing the skewers according to the given permutation and reversal sequence.

Functionality: **The function reads the number of skewers, a permutation sequence, and a reversal sequence, and returns a result based on processing the skewers according to the provided permutation and reversal instructions.**
