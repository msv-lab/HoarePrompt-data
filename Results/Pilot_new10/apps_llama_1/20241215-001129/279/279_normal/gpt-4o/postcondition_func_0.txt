The function reads the number of skewers, a permutation sequence, and a reversal sequence from the standard input, identifies cycles in the permutation, calculates the number of cycles where no reversal is required, and prints 0 if there is only one cycle, the number of cycles where no reversal is required if this number is greater than 0, or 1 otherwise, assuming the input is in the specified format.
