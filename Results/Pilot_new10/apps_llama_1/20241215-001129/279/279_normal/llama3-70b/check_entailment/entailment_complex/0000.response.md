Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for several reasons:

1.  The problem description requires the function to calculate the minimum total number of elements in the given permutation `p` and the given sequence `b` that need to be changed so that every skewer will visit each of the `2n` placements. However, the provided program simply counts the number of indices where `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1` and where `b[i]` is 0. This approach does not guarantee the minimum number of changes required to satisfy the condition.

2.  The program does not consider the requirement that the permutation `p` should remain a permutation after changing. The current implementation does not ensure this condition.

3.  The problem description implies that the function should find the minimum number of changes to the permutation `p` and the sequence `b` such that there exists an integer `k` (where `k >= 2n`) for which each skewer visits each of the `2n` placements after `k` seconds. The provided program does not take this into account and simply counts the number of mismatches.

To correctly solve this problem, a more sophisticated approach would be needed, potentially involving graph theory or dynamic programming to find the minimum number of changes required to satisfy the conditions.

Here are some potential steps to create a correct solution:

*   First, analyze the permutation `p` to identify its cycles and determine if it is a single cycle or consists of multiple cycles. This is crucial because a skewer can only visit all positions if the permutation forms a single cycle.
*   Next, examine the sequence `b` to determine if it contains at least one 1, which is necessary for the skewers to visit all positions in both directions.
*   Based on the analysis of `p` and `b`, calculate the minimum number of changes required to ensure that `p` forms a single cycle and `b` has at least one 1.

Here's a simple example of how this could be implemented in Python:
```python
def min_changes():
    n = int(input())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Check if p is a single cycle
    visited = [False] * n
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            count += 1
            j = i
            while not visited[j]:
                visited[j] = True
                j = p[j] - 1
    ans = count - 1

    # Check if b has at least one 1
    if sum(b) == 0:
        ans += 1

    print(ans)

min_changes()
```
This solution first checks if the permutation `p` forms a single cycle by counting the number of disjoint cycles. It then checks if the sequence `b` has at least one 1. The minimum number of changes required is the sum of the number of cycles minus one (to form a single cycle) and 1 if `b` does not have any 1s.

This corrected solution meets the requirements of the problem description by calculating the minimum total number of elements in the given permutation `p` and the given sequence `b` that need to be changed so that every skewer will visit each of the `2n` placements.
