The function `func` accepts user input for a positive integer `n`, a permutation of integers from 1 to `n` denoted as `p`, and a sequence of zeros and ones of length `n` denoted as `b`. 

It calculates and prints the sum of two types of indices: 
1. Indices where the value of `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1`, indicating a discrepancy between the permutation and the expected sequence from 1 to `n`.
2. Indices where the binary value `b[i]` is 0.

The function does not explicitly handle edge cases such as non-integer or non-positive input for `n`, permutations that are not valid (e.g., contain numbers outside the range from 1 to `n`), or binary sequences of incorrect length. However, the code as written will throw exceptions or produce incorrect results if such inputs are provided.

The function's output is solely based on the printed value, which represents the total count of the specified indices.

Functionality: ** The function accepts user input for a positive integer `n`, a permutation `p` of integers from 1 to `n`, and a binary sequence `b` of length `n`, calculates the sum of indices where `p[i]` does not match `i + 1` and where `b[i]` is 0, and prints this sum, without explicit error handling for invalid inputs. **
