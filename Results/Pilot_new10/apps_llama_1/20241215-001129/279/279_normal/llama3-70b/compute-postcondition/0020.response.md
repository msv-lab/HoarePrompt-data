Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 2, `p` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers of length `n` containing binary digits, `i` is 2. If `b[i]` is 0, then `ans` has been increased by 1. The state of `ans` is determined by the conditions `p[i]` not equal to `i + 1` and `b[i]` equal to 0.***
