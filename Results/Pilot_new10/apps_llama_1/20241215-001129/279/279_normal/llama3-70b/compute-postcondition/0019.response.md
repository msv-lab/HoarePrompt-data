The value of `ans` is increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. The initial state condition "If `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1`, then `ans` is increased by 1" is already satisfied because `ans` is increased by 1 in the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `p` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers of length `n` containing binary digits, `i` is 2, and `ans` is increased by 1 from its previous state.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 2, `p` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers of length `n` containing binary digits, `i` is 2, and `ans` has been increased by 1**
