Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `p` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers of length `n` containing binary digits, `i` is 0. The current value of `b` at index `i` is 0, `p` at index `i` may or may not be equal to `i + 1`, if it is not equal then the current value of `ans` is 1 otherwise the state of `ans` remains unchanged.**
