You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters. You may apply some operations to this string: in one operation you can delete some contiguous substring of this string, if all letters in the substring you delete are equal. For example, after deleting substring bbbb from string abbbbaccdd we get the string aaccdd.

Calculate the minimum number of operations to delete the whole string $s$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 500$) — the length of string $s$.

The second line contains the string $s$ ($|s| = n$) consisting of lowercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the minimal number of operation to delete string $s$.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
abaca

Output
3
Input
8
abcddcba

Output
4
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    operations = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[i - 1]:
            operations += 1
    print(operations)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The given program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to delete a string by removing contiguous substrings of equal characters. The logic is based on the observation that each time a different character is encountered in the string, a new operation is needed to delete the substring of the previous character.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program works correctly:

1. The variable `operations` is initialized to 1, assuming that the first character (or group of contiguous identical characters) will be deleted in the first operation.

2. The program then iterates over the rest of the string. Whenever it encounters a character that is different from the previous one, it increments the `operations` counter. This is because the current character (or group of contiguous identical characters) will require a new operation to be deleted.

3. The program prints the total number of operations required to delete the entire string.

The given examples demonstrate the correctness of the program:

- For the input "abaca", the operations will be: delete "a", delete "b", delete "aca". So, the output is 3.

- For the input "abcddcba", the operations will be: delete "a", delete "b", delete "c", delete "ddcba". So, the output is 4.

In general, the program handles all possible cases correctly, including:

- Strings with a single unique character (e.g., "aaaa") will require only 1 operation.
- Strings with alternating characters (e.g., "ababab") will require 2 operations (one for each character).
- Strings with a mix of unique and repeating characters (e.g., "abcddcba") will require the correct number of operations based on the sequence of characters.

Since the program handles all these cases correctly and produces the expected output, its correctness can be confirmed.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function takes an integer `n` and a string `s` as input from the user, calculates the number of transitions between different consecutive characters in the string `s`, and prints this count. If `n` is 1 or less, it prints 1. The function does not check if `n` is within the range of 1 to 500 or if `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
