The given code `n = int(input())` assigns the integer value from the input to the variable `n`. The initial state mentions that the input consists of an integer `n` where `1 <= n <= 500`, and a string `s` of length `n`. 

The code does not affect the string `s` but updates the value of `n` with the input integer value. However, since `n` is also defined by the input and must be within the range `1 <= n <= 500`, the updated value of `n` must still adhere to this range as per the initial state's constraints.

Therefore, after the code is executed, `n` will hold the value of the input integer, and `s` remains a string of length `n`, consisting only of lowercase Latin letters.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where `1 <= n <= 500`, `s` is a string of length `n`, consisting only of lowercase Latin letters.**
