The function `func` accepts two inputs, an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`, from the user. It iterates over the string, incrementing a counter `ans` whenever it encounters a character that is different from the previous one. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` as inputs from the user, counts the number of segments of continuous characters in `s`, and prints this count, which is at least 1 and increases by 1 for each transition to a different character in `s`. **
