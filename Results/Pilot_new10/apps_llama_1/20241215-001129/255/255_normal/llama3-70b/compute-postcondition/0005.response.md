The code increments the value of `ans` by 1. The initial value of `ans` is 1. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. `n` is still an integer where `n > 1` and `n <= 500`, `s` is still the input string of length `n`, and `i` is still `1`. The current value of `s[i]` is still not equal to the current value of `s[i - 1]`. 

Given that `ans` is initially 1 and is incremented by 1, the new value of `ans` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where `n > 1` and `n <= 500`, `s` is the input string of length `n`, `ans` is 2, `i` is `1`, and the current value of `s[i]` is not equal to the current value of `s[i - 1]`.**
