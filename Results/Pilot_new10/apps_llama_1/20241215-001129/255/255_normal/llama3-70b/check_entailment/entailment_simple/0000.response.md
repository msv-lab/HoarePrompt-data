Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations to delete the whole string $s$. 

Here's why it always does what the problem description says:

1. The problem statement requires the calculation of the minimum number of operations to delete the whole string $s$ by deleting contiguous substrings with equal characters.
2. The provided program starts by initializing the `ans` variable to 1, which is the minimum number of operations required to delete a string with only one distinct character.
3. The program then iterates over the string $s$ using a for loop. For each character, it checks if the current character is different from the previous one.
4. If the current character is different from the previous one, it increments the `ans` variable by 1. This effectively counts the number of transitions to a different character in the string.
5. After the loop, the `ans` variable represents the number of segments of continuous characters in the string, which is equivalent to the minimum number of operations required to delete the whole string.
6. The program then prints the value of `ans`, which is the required output according to the problem statement.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the required logic to solve the problem. The key insight here is that the minimum number of operations to delete a string by removing contiguous substrings with equal characters is equal to the number of segments of continuous characters in the string. The program correctly counts these segments and prints the result.

There are no obvious edge cases or potential issues with the program. It correctly handles strings with a single character, strings with no repeated characters, and strings with repeated characters. It also correctly handles strings of length 1 and strings of length up to 500, as specified in the problem statement.
