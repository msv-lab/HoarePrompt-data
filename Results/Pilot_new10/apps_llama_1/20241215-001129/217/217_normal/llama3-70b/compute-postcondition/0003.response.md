The given code initializes two new variables, `b` and `c`, to 0. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and `a` is a list of `n` integers between -100 and 100 (inclusive), sorted in descending order.

The introduction of `b` and `c` does not affect the values of `n` and `a`, so their states remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers between -100 and 100 (inclusive), sorted in descending order, `b` is 0, and `c` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers between -100 and 100 (inclusive), sorted in descending order, `b` is 0, and `c` is 0**
