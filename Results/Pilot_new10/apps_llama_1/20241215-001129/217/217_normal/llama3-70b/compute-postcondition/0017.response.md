Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and `n` is greater than the current `i` plus 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers between -100 and 100 (inclusive), sorted in descending order, `i` is the previous `i` plus 1, if `i` is even, `b` is increased by the value of the integer at index `i-1` in list `a`, otherwise, `c` is increased by the value of the integer at index `i-1` in list `a`.**
