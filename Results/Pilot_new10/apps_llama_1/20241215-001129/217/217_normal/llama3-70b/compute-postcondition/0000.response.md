The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input integer to the variable `n`. The input integer represents the number of elements in the sequence. 

Given the initial state that the input is a sequence of integers, where the first integer represents the number of elements in the sequence (n), and the subsequent integers represent the elements of the sequence, we know that `n` will be an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), because 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.

The other parts of the initial state, such as the range of the elements in the sequence (-100 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100), are still valid and have not been changed by the code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), the subsequent integers in the input sequence represent the elements of the sequence (a_1, a_2,..., a_{n}), such that -100 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100**
