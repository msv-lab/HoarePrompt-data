You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a sequence a consisting of n integers. You may partition this sequence into two sequences b and c in such a way that every element belongs exactly to one of these sequences. 

Let B be the sum of elements belonging to b, and C be the sum of elements belonging to c (if some of these sequences is empty, then its sum is 0). What is the maximum possible value of B - C?


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in a.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 100 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100) — the elements of sequence a.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible value of B - C, where B is the sum of elements of sequence b, and C is the sum of elements of sequence c.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
1 -2 0

Output
3

Input
6
16 23 16 15 42 8

Output
120



-----Note-----

In the first example we may choose b = {1, 0}, c = { - 2}. Then B = 1, C =  - 2, B - C = 3.

In the second example we choose b = {16, 23, 16, 15, 42, 8}, c = {} (an empty sequence). Then B = 120, C = 0, B - C = 120.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    (b, c) = (0, 0)
    for i in range(n):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            b += a[i]
        else:
            c += a[i]
    print(b - c)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The provided Python program attempts to solve the problem by sorting the sequence in descending order and then distributing the elements into sequences b and c in an alternating manner. However, this approach does not guarantee the maximum possible value of B - C.

A counterexample can be constructed as follows: Consider the input sequence [-100, 99]. The program will sort the sequence to [-100, 99], then distribute the elements into sequences b and c as follows: b = [-100], c = [99]. The sums will be B = -100 and C = 99, resulting in B - C = -199.

However, the optimal solution would be to choose b = [99] and c = [-100], resulting in B = 99 and C = -100, and therefore B - C = 199.

This demonstrates that the provided program does not work correctly for all potential cases, specifically when the input sequence contains a mix of large positive and negative numbers. 

The correct program should consider all possible combinations of elements in sequences b and c to find the maximum value of B - C, not just an alternating distribution after sorting. 

For example, a correct program could use a brute-force approach with bit manipulation to generate all possible subsets of the input sequence and calculate B - C for each subset. 

Here's a simple example of how this could be implemented:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_diff = float('-inf')
    for mask in range(1 << n):
        b = 0
        c = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if (mask & (1 << i)):
                b += a[i]
            else:
                c += a[i]
        max_diff = max(max_diff, b - c)
    print(max_diff)
```

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a sequence of integers as input, where the first integer represents the count of subsequent integers, sorts these integers in descending order, calculates the sum of elements at even indices and the sum of elements at odd indices, and then prints the difference between these two sums, without explicit validation for input format or range, assuming the input adheres to specified constraints. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
