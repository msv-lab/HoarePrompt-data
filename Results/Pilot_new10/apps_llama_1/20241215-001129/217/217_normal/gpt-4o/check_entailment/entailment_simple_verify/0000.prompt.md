You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a sequence a consisting of n integers. You may partition this sequence into two sequences b and c in such a way that every element belongs exactly to one of these sequences. 

Let B be the sum of elements belonging to b, and C be the sum of elements belonging to c (if some of these sequences is empty, then its sum is 0). What is the maximum possible value of B - C?


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in a.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 100 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100) — the elements of sequence a.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible value of B - C, where B is the sum of elements of sequence b, and C is the sum of elements of sequence c.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
1 -2 0

Output
3

Input
6
16 23 16 15 42 8

Output
120



-----Note-----

In the first example we may choose b = {1, 0}, c = { - 2}. Then B = 1, C =  - 2, B - C = 3.

In the second example we choose b = {16, 23, 16, 15, 42, 8}, c = {} (an empty sequence). Then B = 120, C = 0, B - C = 120.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    B = sum((x for x in a if x > 0))
    C = sum((x for x in a if x < 0))
    result = B - C
    print(result)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The program works by calculating the sum of all positive numbers in the sequence `a` and assigning it to `B`. Then, it calculates the sum of all negative numbers in the sequence `a` and assigns it to `C`. Finally, it calculates `B - C` and prints the result.

This approach works because the problem allows us to partition the sequence `a` into two sequences `b` and `c` in such a way that every element belongs exactly to one of these sequences. To maximize `B - C`, we should include all positive numbers in `b` and all negative numbers in `c`, which is exactly what the program does.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including when the sequence `a` contains only positive numbers, only negative numbers, or a mix of both. It also handles the case when the sequence `a` is empty, although this case is not explicitly mentioned in the problem description.

The time complexity of the program is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the sequence `a`, because it needs to iterate over all elements in the sequence to calculate the sums. The space complexity is also O(n) because it needs to store all elements in the sequence `a`.

Overall, the program is correct and efficient, and it solves the problem as described.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is a sequence of n integers, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and each integer in the sequence is in the range -100 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    B = sum(x for x in a if x > 0)
    C = sum(x for x in a if x < 0)
    result = B - C
    print(result)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
