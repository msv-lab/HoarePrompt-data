To determine the output state after executing the given Python code, we need to understand what the code does. The code calculates the sum of all negative integers in the list `a` and assigns this sum to the variable `C`.

Given:
- `n` is an input integer between 1 and 100.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between -100 and 100.
- `B` is the sum of all positive integers in `a`.

The code:
```python
C = sum(x for x in a if x < 0)
```
This line of code generates a sum of all elements `x` in the list `a` where `x` is less than 0, effectively summing all the negative integers in the list `a`. The result of this sum is assigned to `C`.

The previous values of the affected variables:
- `n` remains unchanged as it's not modified by the code.
- `a` remains unchanged; it's still a list of `n` integers.
- `B` remains unchanged; it's still the sum of all positive integers in `a`.
- `C` is introduced as the sum of all negative integers in `a`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between -100 and 100, `B` is the sum of all positive integers in `a`, and `C` is the sum of all negative integers in `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between -100 and 100, `B` is the sum of all positive integers in `a`, and `C` is the sum of all negative integers in `a`.**
