The input is a sequence of integers that is stored in `a`. Each integer in the sequence is in the range -100 â‰¤ a_i â‰¤ 100, and `n` is an input integer between 1 and 100, representing the number of integers in the sequence.
The new list `a` will have `n` integers.
The value of `a` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer is between -100 and 100.
The value of `n` remains an input integer between 1 and 100.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer is between -100 and 100**
