The value of `result` is assigned the value `B - C`, where `B` is the sum of all positive integers in `a` and `C` is the sum of all negative integers in `a`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between -100 and 100, `B` is the sum of all positive integers in `a`, `C` is the sum of all negative integers in `a`, and `result` is equal to `B - C`.**
