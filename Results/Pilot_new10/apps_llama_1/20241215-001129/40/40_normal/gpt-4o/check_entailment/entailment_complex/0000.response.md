Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. 

Here's why:

1. The program checks if the input string `s` is not a palindrome using the function `func_1(s)`. If `s` is not a palindrome, it prints the length of `s`, which is the length of the longest substring that is not a palindrome.

2. If `s` is a palindrome, it then checks the substrings `s[1:]` and `s[:-1]`. If either of these substrings is not a palindrome, it prints the length of the longest non-palindrome substring, which is `len(s) - 1`.

3. If all substrings of `s` are palindromes (including the empty substring), it prints `0`, as specified in the problem description.

The program correctly handles cases where the input string has a length of 1 or less, in which case it prints `0`.

The function `func_1(s)` correctly checks if a string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse (`s[::-1]`).

The problem description requires that the program print the length of the longest substring that is not a palindrome, and the program does this for all possible cases.

However, it's worth noting that the program does not explicitly check all substrings of `s`, but instead relies on the fact that if a string is a palindrome, its substrings will also be palindromes. This allows it to efficiently handle strings of length up to 50. 

Overall, the program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description, and therefore its correctness is **True**.
