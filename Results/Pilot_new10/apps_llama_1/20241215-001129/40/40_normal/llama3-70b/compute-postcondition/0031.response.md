Postcondition: **`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than `i + 2`, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `j` is `i + 3`, `substr` is `s[i:i+3]`. If `substr` is not equal to its reverse, then `max_len` is at least 3. If `substr` is equal to its reverse, then no additional conditions are imposed on `max_len`.**
