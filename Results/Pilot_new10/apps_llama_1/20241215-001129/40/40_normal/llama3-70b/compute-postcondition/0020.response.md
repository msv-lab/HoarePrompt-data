`substr` is assigned the value of the substring of `s` from index `i` to `j`, where `j` is `i + 1`. This means `substr` is a single character string, `s[i]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 0, `i` is less than `n`, `max_len` is the length of the longest substring of `s` that is not a palindrome, or 0 if all substrings of `s` are palindromes, `j` is `i + 1`, and `substr` is `s[i]`.**
