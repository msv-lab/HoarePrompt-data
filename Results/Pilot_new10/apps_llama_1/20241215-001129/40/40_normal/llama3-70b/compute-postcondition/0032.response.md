To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the provided output states for the first few iterations.

The loop code is:
```python
for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
    substr = s[i:j]
    if substr!= substr[::-1]:
        max_len = max(max_len, len(substr))
```
Initially, `i` is `n+1`, but the loop will not execute because `j` starts from `i+1` which is `n+2` and the range function will not produce any values. However, this can change if `i` is updated before the loop starts.

Assuming `i` was updated before the loop starts and became less than `n+1`, then:

- The loop iterates over the range from `i+1` to `n+1`.
- For each iteration, it extracts a substring `substr` from `s` starting at index `i` and ending at index `j`.
- It checks if `substr` is not equal to its reverse (`substr[::-1]`).
- If `substr` is not a palindrome, it updates `max_len` to be the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr`.

From the output states after the loop executes a few times, we can see that:
- `s` remains unchanged as a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters.
- `n` remains the length of `s` and is greater than 0.
- `i` starts at `n+1` but must be less than `n+1` for the loop to execute.
- `j` iterates from `i+1` to `n+1`.
- `substr` is the substring of `s` from index `i` to `j`.
- `max_len` is updated whenever a non-palindromic substring is found and its length is greater than the current `max_len`.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, considering that `i` was initially `n+1` but had to be less than `n+1` for the loop to execute, and given that the loop updates `max_len` based on the lengths of non-palindromic substrings, we can deduce the final state:

- `s` remains a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters.
- `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 0.
- `i` would have been updated before the loop started and is less than `n+1` for the loop to have executed.
- `max_len` will be the length of the longest non-palindromic substring found in `s` during the loop's execution, or 0 if all substrings of `s` are palindromes.

Given that the loop does not update `s` or `n`, and considering the behavior of `max_len`, we conclude:

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 0, `i` is less than or equal to `n`, and `max_len` is the length of the longest substring of `s` that is not a palindrome, or 0 if all substrings of `s` are palindromes.**
