To calculate the result, we should follow the given steps and analyze the impact of the code on the program.


The given code is `max_len = max(max_len, len(substr))`. This line of code updates the value of `max_len` to be the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr`. Since `substr` is `s[i:i+2]`, its length is always 2, given that `i` is less than `n` and `n` is the length of `s` which is greater than `i + 1`.


Thus, if the initial value of `max_len` is less than 2, it will be updated to 2. If `max_len` is initially 2 or greater, its value will not change.


The states of the other variables (`s`, `n`, `i`, `j`, and `substr`) are not affected by the given code.


Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i + 2`, `substr` is `s[i:i+2]`, and `max_len` is the maximum of its previous value and 2.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i + 2`, `substr` is `s[i:i+2]`, and `max_len` is the maximum of its previous value and 2**
