Postcondition: **`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 0, `i` is less than `n`, `max_len` is the length of the longest substring of `s` that is not a palindrome, or 0 if all substrings of `s` are palindromes, `j` is `i + 1`, and the current value of `substr` is `s[i]`. The current value of `substr` is not equal to its reverse, meaning `substr` is not a palindrome.**
