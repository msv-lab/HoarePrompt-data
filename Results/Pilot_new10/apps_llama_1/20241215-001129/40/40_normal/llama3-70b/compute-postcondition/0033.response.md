According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 0, `i` is less than or equal to `n`, and `max_len` is the length of the longest substring of `s` that is not a palindrome, or 0 if all substrings of `s` are palindromes. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and must be less than `n`. Therefore, `i` is now less than or equal to `n` but since it was less than or equal to `n` before it must be now less than `n`. Also, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than `n`, so `n` must be greater than `i`. Since `i` was less than or equal to `n` before, and now it is increased by 1, `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than `i`, `i` is less than `n`, and `max_len` is the length of the longest substring of `s` that is not a palindrome, or 0 if all substrings of `s` are palindromes**
