Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than `i`, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i + 1`. If the substring from index `i` to `j` is not a palindrome, then `max_len` is the maximum of its previous value and the length of `substr`.***
