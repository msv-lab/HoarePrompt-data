Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `j` is `i + 2`, and `substr` is `s[i:i+2]`. If `substr` is not equal to its reverse, then `max_len` is at least 2, specifically `max_len` equals `max(previous max_len, 2)`, and this value has been returned at the output state.***
