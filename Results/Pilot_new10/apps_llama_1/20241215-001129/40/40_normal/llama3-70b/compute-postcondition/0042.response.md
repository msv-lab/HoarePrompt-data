Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i + 2`, `substr` is `s[i:i+2]`. If `substr` is not a palindrome, then `max_len` is the maximum of its previous value and 2.***
