The code updates the value of `substr` to be a slice of `s` from index `i` to `j`. Given that `i` is 0 and `j` is 3, `substr` will be `s[0:3]`. 

Since `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters and `n` is the length of `s` which is greater than 3, the initial condition that `substr` is `s[0:3]` is now updated to the same value. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `substr` is `s[0:3]`. If `s[0:3]` is not equal to its reverse, then `max_len` is at least 3.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `substr` is `s[0:3]`. If `s[0:3]` is not equal to its reverse, then `max_len` is at least 3**
