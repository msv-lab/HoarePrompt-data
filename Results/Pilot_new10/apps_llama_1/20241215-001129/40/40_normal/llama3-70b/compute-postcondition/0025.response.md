The code `substr = s[i:j]` updates the value of `substr` to be a substring of `s` starting at index `i` and ending at index `j-1`. Given that `j` is `i + 2`, this means `substr` will now hold a substring of `s` that is 2 characters long, starting from the character at index `i`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `j` is `i + 2`, and `substr` is `s[i:i+2]`.**
