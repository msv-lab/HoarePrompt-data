According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, with a length not exceeding 100, which ensures that the loop will execute. However, the state needs to be adjusted to include the condition that `i` is 0, which is the starting index of the loop.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `max_jump` is 1, `prev_pos` is -1, `i` is 0**
