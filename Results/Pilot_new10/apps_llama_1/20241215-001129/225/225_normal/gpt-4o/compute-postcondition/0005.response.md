The code updates the value of `max_jump` to be the maximum of its current value and the difference between the current position `i` and the previous position `prev_pos`.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, with a length not exceeding 100.
- `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}.
- `max_jump` is 1.
- `prev_pos` is -1.
- `i` is 0.
- The current character at position `i` in `s` is a vowel.

The difference `i - prev_pos` is `0 - (-1) = 1`. Therefore, `max_jump` will be updated to the maximum of its current value, which is 1, and the calculated difference, which is also 1.

So, `max_jump` remains 1 because the maximum of 1 and 1 is 1.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `max_jump` is 1, `prev_pos` is -1, `i` is 0**
