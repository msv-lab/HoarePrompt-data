You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One day, the Grasshopper was jumping on the lawn and found a piece of paper with a string. Grasshopper became interested what is the minimum jump ability he should have in order to be able to reach the far end of the string, jumping only on vowels of the English alphabet. Jump ability is the maximum possible length of his jump. 

Formally, consider that at the begginning the Grasshopper is located directly in front of the leftmost character of the string. His goal is to reach the position right after the rightmost character of the string. In one jump the Grasshopper could jump to the right any distance from 1 to the value of his jump ability. [Image] The picture corresponds to the first example. 

The following letters are vowels: 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U' and 'Y'.


-----Input-----

The first line contains non-empty string consisting of capital English letters. It is guaranteed that the length of the string does not exceed 100. 


-----Output-----

Print single integer a — the minimum jump ability of the Grasshopper (in the number of symbols) that is needed to overcome the given string, jumping only on vowels.


-----Examples-----
Input

Output
4
Input
AAA

Output
1
Program:
```
s = input()
print(func_1(s))

def func_1(s):
    vowels = {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}
    max_jump = 1
    prev_pos = -1
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] in vowels:
            max_jump = max(max_jump, i - prev_pos)
            prev_pos = i
    max_jump = max(max_jump, len(s) - prev_pos)
    return max_jump


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to find the minimum jump ability required by the Grasshopper to reach the end of the string, jumping only on vowels.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. The function `func_1(s)` initializes a set of vowels and a `max_jump` variable to 1.
2. It then iterates over the string `s`. Whenever it encounters a vowel, it calculates the distance from the previous vowel (or the start of the string, if this is the first vowel) and updates `max_jump` if this distance is greater.
3. After iterating over the entire string, it calculates the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string and updates `max_jump` if necessary.
4. Finally, it returns `max_jump`, which represents the minimum jump ability required to reach the end of the string.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* Strings with only vowels
* Strings with only consonants (in which case `max_jump` will be equal to the length of the string plus one, but since we can't jump out of the string, it will simply be the length of the string)
* Strings with a mix of vowels and consonants
* Strings with consecutive vowels or consonants

The program also correctly handles edge cases, such as an empty string (although this is not a valid input according to the problem description) or a string with a single character.

Overall, the program accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem, and it correctly handles all potential cases and edge cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
s = input()
print(func_1(s))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, with a length not exceeding 100.
def func_1(s):
    vowels = {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}
    max_jump = 1
    prev_pos = -1
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] in vowels:
            max_jump = max(max_jump, i - prev_pos)
            prev_pos = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `max_jump` is the maximum distance between any two vowels in `s` if `s` contains vowels, otherwise it is 1, and `prev_pos` is the position of the last vowel in `s` if `s` contains vowels, otherwise it is -1.
    max_jump = max(max_jump, len(s) - prev_pos)
    return max_jump
    #The program returns max_jump, which is the maximum of its previous value and the difference between the length of string `s` and the position of the last vowel in `s` (or -1 if `s` does not contain vowels), reflecting the maximum jump considering the string's length and vowel positions.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-empty string `s` of capital English letters, with a length not exceeding 100, and returns the maximum distance between any two consecutive vowels in `s`, including the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string, or the length of `s` plus one if `s` does not contain any vowels.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
