Correctness: **False**

The given program does not follow the problem description accurately. The issue lies in the calculation of the maximum jump ability.

The problem description states that the Grasshopper's goal is to reach the position right after the rightmost character of the string, jumping only on vowels of the English alphabet. The jump ability is defined as the maximum possible length of his jump.

The provided program attempts to calculate the maximum possible jump between two vowels in the string. However, it does not consider the fact that the Grasshopper can jump from any position to a vowel, not just from one vowel to another.

For example, if the input string is "AAAAA", the program correctly calculates the maximum jump as 1. However, if the input string is "ABAAAA", the program incorrectly calculates the maximum jump as 1. The correct maximum jump in this case is 2, because the Grasshopper needs to be able to jump from the 'B' to the first 'A'.

To correctly calculate the minimum jump ability, the program needs to keep track of the maximum distance between any two consecutive positions that are either vowels or the end of the string.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    s = input()
    vowels = 'AEIOUY'
    n = len(s)
    max_jump = 0
    last_vowel = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] in vowels:
            if last_vowel == -1:
                max_jump = max(max_jump, i + 1)
            else:
                max_jump = max(max_jump, i - last_vowel)
            last_vowel = i
    if last_vowel!= n - 1:
        max_jump = max(max_jump, n - last_vowel)
    print(max_jump)
```
This corrected program calculates the maximum distance between any two consecutive positions that are either vowels or the end of the string, which is the minimum jump ability required for the Grasshopper to reach the end of the string.
