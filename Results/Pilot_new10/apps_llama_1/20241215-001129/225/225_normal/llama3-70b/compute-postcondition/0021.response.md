The value of `max_jump` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `i + 1`. Since `i` is 2, `i + 1` equals 3. Therefore, `max_jump` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and 3. Given that `max_jump` is initially at least 1, after the update, `max_jump` will be at least 3 if its initial value is less than 3; otherwise, it remains its initial value if that value is already greater than or equal to 3.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s` and is at least 3, `i` is 2, if `s[i]` is in `vowels`, then `last_vowel` is 2, and `max_jump` is at least 3.
