The code `n = len(s)` assigns the length of the string `s` to the variable `n`. Since `s` is a non-empty string with a length not exceeding 100, the value of `n` will be a positive integer between 1 and 100, inclusive.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', and `n` is the length of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', and `n` is the length of `s`**
