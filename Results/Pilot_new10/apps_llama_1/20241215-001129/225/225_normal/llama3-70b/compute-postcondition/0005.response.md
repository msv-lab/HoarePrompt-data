According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `s` is a non-empty string, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s`, `max_jump` is 0, and `last_vowel` is -1. Since `s` is non-empty and `n` is the length of `s`, it implies that `n` must be greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0 and `i` is now set to the first index of the range, which is 0.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `max_jump` is 0, `last_vowel` is -1, `i` is 0**
