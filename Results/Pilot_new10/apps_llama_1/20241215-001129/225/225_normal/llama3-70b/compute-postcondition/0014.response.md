To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the given loop statement and the current state.

Given loop statement:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```
Current state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100.
- `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'.
- `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- If the current character of `s` at index `i` is a vowel, then `last_vowel` is 0 and `max_jump` is 1.

To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 because that's how a for loop in Python works. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `0 + 1 = 1`.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1 since `i` is now 1.

The states of `s`, `vowels`, `last_vowel`, and `max_jump` are not directly affected by the loop counter `i` or the loop condition itself but by the operations within the loop body, which are not provided. However, since we are only concerned with the conditions that allow the loop to execute again, we focus on `n` and `i`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 1, `i` is 1**
