The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It takes a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100 as input from the user. The function calculates the maximum possible jump between two vowels in the string, where the jump is defined as the distance between two vowels divided by 2 plus 1. If the string does not contain any vowels, the function returns 0. If the last character of the string is not a vowel, the function also considers the distance between the last vowel and the end of the string as a possible jump. The function then prints the maximum possible jump.
