To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100.
- `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'.
- `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.

The code snippet is:
```python
max_jump = max(max_jump, i + 1)
```

Given that `i` is 1, `i + 1` equals 2. The `max` function will choose the larger value between the current `max_jump` and 2. However, since the initial value of `max_jump` is not specified, we can only conclude that `max_jump` will be updated to be at least 2, assuming `max_jump` was less than 2. If `max_jump` was already 2 or greater, it will remain unchanged.

The states of `s`, `vowels`, `n`, and `i` are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100.
- `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'.
- `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `max_jump` is at least 2.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `max_jump` is at least 2**
