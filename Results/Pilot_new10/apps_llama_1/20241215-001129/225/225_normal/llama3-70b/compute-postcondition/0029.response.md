Postcondition: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is `n-1`. If the last character of `s` is not a vowel, then `last_vowel` is the index of the last vowel in `s` or -1 if `s` does not contain any vowels, and `max_jump` is the maximum of its previous value and `(n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`. If the last character of `s` is a vowel, then `last_vowel` and `max_jump` retain their previous values.**
