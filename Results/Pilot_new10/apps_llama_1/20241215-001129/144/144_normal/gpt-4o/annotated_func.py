#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no arguments, but it is implied that the input consists of two lines, the first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2,..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9).
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    mex = 1
    for num in a:
        if num >= mex:
            mex += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `mex` is the smallest positive integer not present in `a` plus one, and `num` is the last element in `a`.
    print(mex)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two lines of input: an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers, sorts the list, and then calculates the smallest positive integer not present in the sorted list, printing this value as the result, handling various edge cases including empty lists, lists with single or duplicate elements, and lists containing zeros or negative numbers.
