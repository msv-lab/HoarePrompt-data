The value of `mex` is incremented by 1. The initial values of `n`, `a`, and `num` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, `n` is still an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers that must have at least 2 elements, and `num` is the second element in the list `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers that must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element in the list `a`, and `mex` is increased by 1**
