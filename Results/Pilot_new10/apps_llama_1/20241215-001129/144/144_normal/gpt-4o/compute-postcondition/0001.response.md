The given code statement is executed, which assigns the input integers to the list `a`. The length of the list `a` will be `n`, and its elements will be the input integers `a_1, a_2,..., a_{n}`. 

The impact of this code on the program is the creation of a new list `a` and the assignment of the input integers to this list. The previous condition that `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000 is still valid because `n` has not been modified.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, `a` is a list of `n` integers from the input, where each integer is between 1 and 10^9.**
