The value of `mex` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `mex` is unknown. `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers that must have at least 3 elements, and `num` is the third element in the list `a`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers that must have at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element in the list `a`, and `mex` is increased by 1**
