According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list `a` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Since `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers and `n` is between 1 and 100,000 (inclusive), `a` must have at least 1 element for the loop to execute. Additionally, `num` will be the first element in the list `a` at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 element, `mex` is 1, `num` is the first element in the list `a`**
