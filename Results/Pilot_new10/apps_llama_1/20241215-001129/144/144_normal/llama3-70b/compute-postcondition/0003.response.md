The code initializes a variable `mex` to 1. This does not affect the values of `n` and `arr`. The value of `n` remains an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, and `arr` remains a sorted list of n integers in ascending order where for each integer a_i, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `arr` is a sorted list of n integers in ascending order where for each integer a_i, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `mex` is 1**
