Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `arr` is a sorted list of n integers in ascending order where for each integer a_i, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and arr has at least 1 element. If `num` equals `mex`, then `mex` is 2 and `num` is 1. If `num` does not equal `mex`, then `mex` remains 1 and `num` is the first element in `arr` and is not equal to `mex`; if `num` is greater than `mex`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
