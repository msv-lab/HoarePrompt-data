Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `arr` is a sorted list of n integers in ascending order where for each integer a_i, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `arr` has at least 2 elements, `num` is equal to `arr[1]`. If `num` is greater than `mex`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise, there are no further changes.***
