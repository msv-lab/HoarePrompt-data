Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `arr` is a sorted list of n integers in ascending order where for each integer a_i, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and arr has at least 1 element, `mex` is 1, the current value of `num` is equal to `mex` (which is 1), meaning the first element in `arr` is 1**
