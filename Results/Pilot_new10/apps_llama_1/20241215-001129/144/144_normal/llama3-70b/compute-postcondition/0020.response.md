Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `arr` is a sorted list of n integers in ascending order where for each integer a_i, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and arr has at least 3 elements, `num` is equal to `arr[2]`. If `num` is greater than the minimum excluded value (`mex`), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the execution continues.***
