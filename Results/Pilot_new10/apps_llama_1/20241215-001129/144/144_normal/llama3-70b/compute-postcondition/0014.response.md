The `break` statement is executed, but since there is no loop or conditional statement provided in the given code snippet, we can only consider its general effect. In this case, the `break` statement will exit the innermost loop or the `if` statement it is directly inside, if any. However, since no specific loop or conditional structure is provided around this `break` statement, we cannot specify a loop or condition that is being exited. The values of the variables do not change due to the `break` statement alone.

Given the initial state: `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `arr` is a sorted list of n integers in ascending order where for each integer a_i, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and `arr` has at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element in `arr`.

Since `num` is defined as the second element in `arr`, and given that `arr` is sorted and has at least two elements, `num` is equal to `arr[1]`. The `break` statement does not change these conditions or the values of `n`, `arr`, or `num`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `arr` is a sorted list of n integers in ascending order where for each integer a_i, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `arr` has at least 2 elements, `num` is equal to `arr[1]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
