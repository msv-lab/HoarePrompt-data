According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr`. If `arr` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `arr` is a sorted list of n integers in ascending order, `arr` has at least 1 element, and `num` is the first element in `arr`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must have at least 2 elements. Since `arr` is a sorted list, when the loop executes again, `num` will be the second element in `arr`. 

Additionally, the conditions related to `mex` will be re-evaluated based on the new value of `num`. If `num` equals `mex`, then `mex` is 2 and `num` is 1. However, since we're moving to the next element in the sorted list, it's not possible for `num` to be 1 again if it was already the first element. 

If `num` does not equal `mex`, then `mex` remains 1, but since we're considering the next iteration, `num` will be the next element in the sorted list `arr`. 

However, given the initial conditions about `mex` and `num`, we should focus on what changes when we move to the next element in `arr`. The relationship between `mex` and `num` will be re-evaluated based on the loop body, which isn't provided. But based on the given loop and initial conditions, we adjust the state by moving to the next element in `arr`.

State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `arr` is a sorted list of n integers in ascending order where for each integer a_i, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and arr has at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element in `arr`**
