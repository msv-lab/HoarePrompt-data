Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `arr` is a sorted list of n integers in ascending order where for each integer a_i, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and `arr` has at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element in `arr`. If `num` is equal to `mex`, then `mex` is increased by 1 from its previous value. Otherwise, if `num` is greater than `mex`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise, the execution continues.**
