The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. The values of the variables `n`, `arr`, and `num` do not change. 

Since `num` is the third element in `arr`, and `arr` has at least 3 elements and is sorted in ascending order, `num` is still equal to `arr[2]`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `arr` is a sorted list of n integers in ascending order where for each integer a_i, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and arr has at least 3 elements, `num` is equal to `arr[2]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
