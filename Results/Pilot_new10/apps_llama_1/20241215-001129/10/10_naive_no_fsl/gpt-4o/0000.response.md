Correctness: **False**

The given program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The condition checks in the program for determining the left, right, top, and bottom counts are incorrect. 

The conditions should be checking if any part of sofa i is to the left, right, top, or bottom of any part of sofa j. However, the current conditions only check if the entire sofa i is to the left, right, top, or bottom of the entire sofa j.

For example, consider two sofas with coordinates (1, 1, 1, 2) and (2, 1, 2, 2). The current program would not count the second sofa as being to the right of the first sofa, because the entire second sofa is not to the right of the entire first sofa. However, the second sofa should be counted as being to the right of the first sofa, because part of the second sofa (the part at x=2) is to the right of part of the first sofa (the part at x=1).

Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    d = int(input().strip())
    (n, m) = map(int, input().strip().split())
    sofas = []
    for _ in range(d):
        (x1, y1, x2, y2) = map(int, input().strip().split())
        sofas.append((x1, y1, x2, y2))
    (cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b) = map(int, input().strip().split())
    left_count = [0] * d
    right_count = [0] * d
    top_count = [0] * d
    bottom_count = [0] * d
    for i in range(d):
        (x1, y1, x2, y2) = sofas[i]
        for j in range(d):
            if i == j:
                continue
            (x1_j, y1_j, x2_j, y2_j) = sofas[j]
            if max(x1, x2) < min(x1_j, x2_j):
                right_count[i] += 1
            if min(x1, x2) > max(x1_j, x2_j):
                left_count[i] += 1
            if max(y1, y2) < min(y1_j, y2_j):
                bottom_count[i] += 1
            if min(y1, y2) > max(y1_j, y2_j):
                top_count[i] += 1
    target_sofa = -1
    for i in range(d):
        if left_count[i] == cnt_l and right_count[i] == cnt_r and (top_count[i] == cnt_t) and (bottom_count[i] == cnt_b):
            target_sofa = i + 1
            break
    print(target_sofa)
