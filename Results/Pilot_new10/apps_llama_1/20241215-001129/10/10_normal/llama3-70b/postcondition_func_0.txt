The function accepts a sofa and a list of sofas, and returns the number of sofas that are to the right, left, top, and bottom of the given sofa, with the same y-coordinate or x-coordinate, respectively, but with the correct interpretation of the counters being that `left` counts sofas to the right and `right` counts sofas to the left, due to the discrepancy between the annotations and the actual code.
