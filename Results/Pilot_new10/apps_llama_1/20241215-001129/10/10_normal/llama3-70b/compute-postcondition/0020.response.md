Postcondition: **`sofa` is a list of four integers, `sofas` is a list of lists with at least two sofas, `s` is the second sofa in `sofas`. If the first element of the first tuple in `sofa` is greater than the first element of the first tuple in `s` and the second element of the first tuple in `sofa` is equal to the second element of the first tuple in `s`, then both `left` and `right` are increased by 1. If this condition is not met, the state of `left` and `right` remains unchanged.**
