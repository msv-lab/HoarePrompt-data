Postcondition: **`sofa` is a list of four integers, `sofas` is a list of lists with at least 3 sofas, `s` is the third sofa in `sofas`. If the first element of the first sub-list in `sofa` is greater than the first element of the first sub-list in `s` and the second element of the first sub-list in `sofa` is equal to the second element of the first sub-list in `s`, then `right` is increased by 1. Additionally, if the first element of the first sub-list in `sofa` is less than the first element of the first sub-list in `s` and the second element of the first sub-list in `sofa` is equal to the second element of the first sub-list in `s`, then `left` is increased by 1. In all cases, the condition regarding the first and second elements of `sofa` and `s` is evaluated, and the corresponding variables are updated accordingly.**
