Postcondition: **`sofa` is a list of four integers, `sofas` is a list of lists that must have at least one sofa, `s` is the first sofa in `sofas`, `s` is not equal to `sofa`. The first element of the first pair in `sofa` is equal to the first element of the first pair in `s`, and the second element of the first pair in `sofa` is less than the second element of the first pair in `s`. Given the initial conditions, if the first element of the first pair in `sofa` is less than the first element of the first pair in `s` and the second element of the first pair in `sofa` is equal to the second element of the first pair in `s`, then the current value of `left` is 1, `right` is 0, `top` is 0, and `bottom` is 0. If the first element of the first pair in `sofa` is greater than the first element of the first pair in `s` and the second element of the first pair in `sofa` is equal to the second element of the first pair in `s`, then `left` is 0, `right` is 1, and `top` and `bottom` are integers where their current values depend on the conditions given in the precondition. However, as the if condition is met, `left` and `right` must be updated according to the if condition: since `sofa[0][1] < s[0][1]` and `sofa[0][0] == s[0][0]`, this implies `left` is 1 and `right` is 0 because this is the condition where the first element of `sofa` and `s` are equal and the second element of `sofa` is less than the second element of `s`. `top` and `bottom` remain 0 if the initial conditions for `left` and `right` are not met, but given the if condition, the conditions for `left` and `right` are now aligned with the if statement, thus `top` and `bottom` are 0. The current values of `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` after entering the if condition are: `left` is 1, `right` is 0, and `top` and `bottom` are 0, while `sofa`, `sofas`, and `s` maintain their initial properties.**
