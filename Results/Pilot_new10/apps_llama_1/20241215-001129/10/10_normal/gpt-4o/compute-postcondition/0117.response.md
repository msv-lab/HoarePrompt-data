To determine the output state, we analyze the given code and its impact on the variables provided in the initial state.

The code `left_count[i] += 1` increments the value of `left_count` at index `i` by 1. This implies that the number of sofas to the left of the sofa at index `i` in the `sofas` list has increased by one.

Given the initial state:
- `d` is a non-negative integer,
- `j` is 0,
- `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse,
- `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse,
- `sofas` is a list containing at least `d+2` tuples of sofa coordinates,
- `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are input integers,
- `left_count`, `right_count`, `top_count`, `bottom_count` are lists with specific roles and containing at least `d+2` values,
- `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are coordinates related to `sofas[i]`,
- `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are coordinates related to `sofas[j]`,

And the conditions:
- `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and `x2` is greater than `x2_j`,

After executing `left_count[i] += 1`, the value of `left_count` at index `i` increases by 1, indicating an additional sofa is now considered to be to the left of the sofa at index `i`.

The rest of the variables and conditions remain unchanged as the code snippet only modifies `left_count[i]`.

Output State: **`d` is a non-negative integer, `j` is 0, `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d+2` tuples of sofa coordinates, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are input integers, `left_count` is a list where `left_count[i]` has been incremented by 1, `right_count` is a list containing at least `d+2` values representing the number of sofas to the right of each sofa, `top_count` is a list containing at least `d+2` values representing the number of sofas below each sofa, `bottom_count` is a list containing at least `d+2` values representing the number of sofas above each sofa, `x1` equals the first element of `sofas[i]`, `y1` equals the second element of `sofas[i]`, `x2` equals the third element of `sofas[i]`, `y2` equals the fourth element of `sofas[i]`, `x1_j` equals the first element of `sofas[j]`, `y1_j` equals the second element of `sofas[j]`, `x2_j` equals the third element of `sofas[j]`, `y2_j` equals the fourth element of `sofas[j]`, and `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and `x2` is greater than `x2_j`.**
