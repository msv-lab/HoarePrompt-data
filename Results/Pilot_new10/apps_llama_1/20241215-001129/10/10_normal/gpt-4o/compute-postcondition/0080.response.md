Postcondition: **`d` is at least 1, `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d+1` tuples of sofa coordinates, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are input integers, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the coordinates of the first sofa in `sofas`, `j` is 0, `left_count` is a list containing at least `d+1` values representing the number of sofas to the right of each sofa, `right_count` is a list containing at least `d+1` values representing the number of sofas to the left of each sofa, if `y1` is greater than `y2_j` and `y2` is greater than `y2_j`, then `top_count` is a list containing at least `d+1` values where `top_count[i]` is incremented by 1, otherwise `top_count` remains unchanged, and `bottom_count` is a list containing at least `d+1` values where its values are determined based on previous conditions.**
