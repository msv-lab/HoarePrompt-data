Postcondition: ***`d` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `j` is 1, `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d+2` tuples of sofa coordinates, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are input integers, `x1` equals the first element of `sofas[i]`, `y1` equals the second element of `sofas[i]`, `x2` equals the third element of `sofas[i]`, `y2` equals the fourth element of `sofas[i]`, `x1_j` equals the first element of `sofas[j]`, `y1_j` equals the second element of `sofas[j]`, `x2_j` equals the third element of `sofas[j]`, `y2_j` equals the fourth element of `sofas[j]`. If `y1` > `y2_j` and `y2` > `y2_j`, then `top_count[i]` is incremented by 1. Additionally, if `y1` is less than `y1_j` and `y2` is less than `y1_j`, and `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and `x2` is greater than `x2_j`, then `left_count` at index `i` is incremented by 1 and `bottom_count[i]` is incremented by 1; if `y1` is less than `y1_j` and `y2` is less than `y1_j` but `x1` is not greater than `x2_j` or `x2` is not greater than `x2_j`, then `bottom_count[i]` is incremented by 1. If `y1` is not greater than `y2_j` or `y2` is not greater than `y2_j`, then `top_count`, `left_count`, `right_count`, `bottom_count` remain unchanged, and the conditions based on `y1`, `y2`, `x1`, `x2`, `y1_j`, `x2_j` are applied as initially given in the precondition.***
