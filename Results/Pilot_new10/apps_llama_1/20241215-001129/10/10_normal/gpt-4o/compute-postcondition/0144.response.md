Postcondition: **`d` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `j` is 2, `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d+2` tuples of sofa coordinates, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are input integers, `x1` equals the first element of `sofas[i]`, `y1` equals the second element of `sofas[i]`, `x2` equals the third element of `sofas[i]`, `y2` equals the fourth element of `sofas[i]`, `x1_j` equals the first element of `sofas[j]`, `y1_j` equals the second element of `sofas[j]`, `x2_j` equals the third element of `sofas[j]`, `y2_j` equals the fourth element of `sofas[j]`. If `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and `x2` is greater than `x2_j`, then `left_count[i]` is increased by 1 from its previous value. Additionally, if `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`, then `right_count[i]` is increased by 1 from its previous value, otherwise the state remains unchanged.**
