Postcondition: ***`d` is at least 2, `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d+1` tuples of sofa coordinates, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are input integers, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the coordinates of the second sofa in `sofas`, `j` is 1, `left_count` is a list containing at least `d+1` values representing the number of sofas to the right of each sofa, `right_count` is a list containing at least `d+1` values representing the number of sofas to the left of each sofa, `top_count` and `bottom_count` are lists containing at least `d+1` values, and if `i` equals `j`, we move to the next iteration of the loop, otherwise the program state remains unchanged***
