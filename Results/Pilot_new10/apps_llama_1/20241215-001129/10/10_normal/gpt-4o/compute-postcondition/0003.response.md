To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given loop statement:

```python
for _ in range(d):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Here, `_` is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan on using later (often used when we need a variable to fulfill the syntax requirements but don't intend to use its value), and `d` represents the number of sofas.

Given the loop depends on `d`, for the loop to execute, `d` must be greater than 0. If `d` is 0, the loop will not execute at all. Therefore, the state needs to reflect that `d` must be at least 1 for the loop to initiate.

Considering the initial state:

- `d` is the number of sofas,
- `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse,
- `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse,
- The coordinates of each sofa, and the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of Grandpa Maks's sofa are pending,
- `sofas` is an empty list.

For the loop to start executing, the critical adjustment is that `d` must be greater than 0. The loop does not directly depend on `n`, `m`, the specific coordinates of the sofas, the relative positions of sofas to Grandpa Maks's sofa, or the contents of the `sofas` list, as these factors are not mentioned in the loop condition. However, since `sofas` is an empty list and the loop iterates `d` times, we can infer that `d` represents the number of iterations, likely related to the number of sofas to be processed or added to the `sofas` list or another data structure during the loop.

State: **`d` must be greater than 0, `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, the coordinates of each sofa and the relative positions are pending, `sofas` is an empty list**
