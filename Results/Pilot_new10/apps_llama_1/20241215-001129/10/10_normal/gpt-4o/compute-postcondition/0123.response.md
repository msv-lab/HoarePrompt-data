The value of `top_count[i]` is incremented by 1, where `i` is the current index. The states of the other variables are not affected. The value of `d` remains a non-negative integer, `j` remains 0, `n` remains the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` remains the number of columns of the storehouse, `sofas` remains a list containing at least `d+2` tuples of sofa coordinates, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` remain input integers, `x1` remains equal to the first element of `sofas[i]`, `y1` remains equal to the second element of `sofas[i]`, `x2` remains equal to the third element of `sofas[i]`, `y2` remains equal to the fourth element of `sofas[i]`, `x1_j` remains equal to the first element of `sofas[j]`, `y1_j` remains equal to the second element of `sofas[j]`, `x2_j` remains equal to the third element of `sofas[j]`, `y2_j` remains equal to the fourth element of `sofas[j]`, `left_count` remains with the current value of `bottom_count[i]` incremented by 1 if `y1` is less than `y1_j` and `y2` is less than `y1_j`, and `right_count` remains a list containing at least `d+2` values representing the number of sofas to the right of each sofa, and `bottom_count` remains a list containing at least `d+2` values representing the number of sofas above each sofa. The condition that the current value of `y1` is greater than `y2_j` and the current value of `y2` is greater than `y2_j` remains valid.
