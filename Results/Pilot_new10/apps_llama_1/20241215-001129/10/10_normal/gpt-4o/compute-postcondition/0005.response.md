The code appends a tuple of `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` to the `sofas` list. 
`d` is still greater than 0, `n` is still the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is still the number of columns of the storehouse, and `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are still input integers. 
However, `sofas` is now a list containing one tuple of sofa coordinates, which is `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`.

Output State: **`d` is greater than 0, `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, `sofas` is a list containing one tuple of sofa coordinates `[(x1, y1, x2, y2)]`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are input integers**
