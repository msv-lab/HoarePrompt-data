To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

The loop statement is `for _ in range(d):`, which means the loop will execute `d` times. Since we are considering the state at the end of the previous iteration, we know that the loop has already executed at least once.

Given states at the end of the previous iteration:
- `d` is greater than 1
- `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse
- `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse
- `sofas` is a list containing two tuples of sofa coordinates `[(x1, y1, x2, y2), (x1, y1, x2, y2)]`

Since the loop counter is not explicitly mentioned in the given states, but we know the loop iterates `d` times, we need to consider how `d` affects the loop's execution. For the loop to execute one more time, `d` must be at least 2 because the loop has already executed once (at the end of the previous iteration).

Other variables like `n`, `m`, and `sofas` do not directly influence the loop's condition for execution in the provided context. Their states might change within the loop body, but based on the information given, we're focusing on what's necessary for the loop to execute again, which is the value of `d`.

However, considering the loop structure `for _ in range(d):`, the variable `_` is a throwaway variable that is often used when the loop variable is not actually used in the loop body. The important factor here is `d`, which governs how many times the loop will execute.

For the loop to execute one more time after the previous iteration, `d` should be at least 2. Since we're adjusting states for the next iteration and given that `d` is greater than 1, we can imply that `d` must be decremented by 1 in the loop's context to reflect the progression of iterations, but since `d` itself isn't directly changed by the loop statement (it's the range that's defined by `d`), we focus on the fact that for another iteration to occur, the conditions set by `d` must still be met.

State: **`d` is at least 2, `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, `sofas` is a list containing two tuples of sofa coordinates**
