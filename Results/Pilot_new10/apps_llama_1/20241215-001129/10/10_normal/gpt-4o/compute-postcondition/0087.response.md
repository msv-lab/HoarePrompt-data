The value of `left_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `left_count[i]` is unknown, but it is a part of the list `left_count` which contains at least `d+1` values. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`d` is at least 2, `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d+1` tuples of sofa coordinates, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are input integers, `j` is 1, `left_count` is a list containing at least `d+1` values where `left_count[i]` is incremented by 1, `right_count` is a list where the second element is `right_count[1] + 1` if `x1 < x1_j` and `x2 < x1_j`, otherwise `right_count` remains unchanged, `top_count` and `bottom_count` are lists containing at least `d+1` values, `x1_j = sofas[1][0]`, `y1_j = sofas[1][1]`, `x2_j = sofas[1][2]`, `y2_j = sofas[1][3]`.**
