The values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are assigned the value of the elements of the `i-th` tuple in the `sofas` list. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is at least one more than its current non-negative integer value, `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d+1` tuples of sofa coordinates, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are input integers, `left_count` is a list containing at least `d+1` values representing the number of sofas to the right of each sofa, `right_count` is a list containing at least `d+1` values representing the number of sofas to the left of each sofa, `top_count` is a list containing at least `d+1` values representing the number of sofas below each sofa, `bottom_count` is a list containing at least `d+1` values representing the number of sofas above each sofa, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the coordinates of the `i-th` sofa.
