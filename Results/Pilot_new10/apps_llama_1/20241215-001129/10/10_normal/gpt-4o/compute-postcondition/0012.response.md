To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the provided output states for the first few iterations.

The loop code is:
```python
for _ in range(d):
    x1, y1, x2, y2 = map(int, input().strip().split())
    sofas.append((x1, y1, x2, y2))
```
Here's what we can infer from the loop code:

* The loop will execute `d` times.
* In each iteration, four integers `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` will be input and appended as a tuple to the `sofas` list.
* The `_` variable is a throwaway variable, meaning its value is not used anywhere in the loop.

From the output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times, we can see that:

* `d` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.
* `n` and `m` remain unchanged throughout the loop, as they are not modified within the loop.
* The `sofas` list will contain `d` tuples of sofa coordinates after the loop finishes executing.

Now, let's think about what happens when the loop finishes executing. If `d` is 0, the loop will not execute at all, and the `sofas` list will remain empty. If `d` is greater than 0, the loop will execute `d` times, and the `sofas` list will contain `d` tuples of sofa coordinates.

Therefore, the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished is:

Output State: **`d` is a non-negative integer, `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples of sofa coordinates, where each tuple contains four integers representing the coordinates of a sofa**
