The given code snippet is unpacking the `i-th` tuple from the `sofas` list into four variables: `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`. This means the values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` will be the coordinates of the `i-th` sofa.

Output State: **`d` is at least `d + 1`, `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d+2` tuples of sofa coordinates, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are input integers, `left_count` is a list containing at least `d+2` values representing the number of sofas to the left of each sofa, `right_count` is a list containing at least `d+2` values representing the number of sofas to the right of each sofa, `top_count` is a list containing at least `d+2` values representing the number of sofas below each sofa, `bottom_count` is a list containing at least `d+2` values representing the number of sofas above each sofa, `x1` equals the first element of `sofas[i]`, `y1` equals the second element of `sofas[i]`, `x2` equals the third element of `sofas[i]`, `y2` equals the fourth element of `sofas[i]`.**
