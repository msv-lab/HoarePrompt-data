The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. In this case, since we are not provided with any loop information in the given code snippet, we will assume it is part of a loop. 

The `continue` statement does not change any variable values but skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves to the next iteration.

Output State: **`d` is a positive integer, `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples of sofa coordinates, `cnt_l` is an input integer, `cnt_r` is an input integer, `cnt_t` is an input integer, `cnt_b` is an input integer, `left_count` is a list containing `d` zeros, `right_count` is a list containing `d` zeros, `top_count` is a list containing `d` zeros, `bottom_count` is a list containing `d` zeros, `i` is 0, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the coordinates of the first sofa in `sofas`, `j` is 0, `i` equals `j`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
