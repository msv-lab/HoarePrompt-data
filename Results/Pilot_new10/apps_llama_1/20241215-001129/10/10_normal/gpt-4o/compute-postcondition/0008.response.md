The code appends another tuple of sofa coordinates to the existing list `sofas`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`d` is greater than 1, `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, `sofas` is a list containing two tuples of sofa coordinates `[(x1, y1, x2, y2), (x1, y1, x2, y2)]`**
