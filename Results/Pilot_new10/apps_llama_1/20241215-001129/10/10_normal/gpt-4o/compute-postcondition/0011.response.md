The code `sofas.append((x1, y1, x2, y2))` adds a new tuple containing the coordinates `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` to the end of the `sofas` list. 

The previous value of `sofas` was a list containing two tuples of sofa coordinates. Now, it will contain three tuples: the original two and the newly added tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`.

The values of `d`, `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are not changed by the code.

Output State: **`d` is at least 2, `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are input integers, `sofas` is a list containing three tuples of sofa coordinates**.
