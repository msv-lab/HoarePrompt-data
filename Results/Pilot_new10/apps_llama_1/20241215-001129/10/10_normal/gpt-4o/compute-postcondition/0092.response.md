Postcondition: **`d` is at least 2, `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d+1` tuples of sofa coordinates, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are input integers, `j` is 1, `x1_j = sofas[1][0]`, `y1_j = sofas[1][1]`, `x2_j = sofas[1][2]`, `y2_j = sofas[1][3]`. If `y1 > y2_j` and `y2 > y2_j`, then `top_count[i]` is incremented by 1. Additionally, if `y1 < y1_j` and `y2 < y1_j`, then `bottom_count[i]` is incremented by 1. If `x1 > x2_j` and `x2 > x2_j`, then `left_count[i]` is incremented by 1, and if `x1 < x1_j` and `x2 < x1_j`, then `right_count[1]` is incremented by 1, otherwise `right_count` remains unchanged. Otherwise, when `y1 > y2_j` and `y2 > y2_j` is not met, the lists `top_count`, `bottom_count`, `left_count`, and `right_count` remain unchanged.**
