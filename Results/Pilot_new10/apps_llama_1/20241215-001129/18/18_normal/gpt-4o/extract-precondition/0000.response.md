It seems like the function definition provided doesn't match the problem description. Based on the problem description, the function definition should be:
```python
def mexican_wave(n, k, t):
```
Here is the precondition:

Precondition: **n, k, and t are integers, 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k.**
