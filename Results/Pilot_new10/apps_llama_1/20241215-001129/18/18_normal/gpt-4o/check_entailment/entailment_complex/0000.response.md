Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. 

Here's how the program works:
- If `t` is less than or equal to `k`, the program prints `t`. This is correct because at any time `t` less than or equal to `k`, there will be `t` spectators standing.
- If `t` is larger than `k` but less than or equal to `n`, the program prints `k`. This is also correct because at any time `t` between `k+1` and `n`, the first (`t-k`) spectators will sit down, but a new spectator will stand up, and the total number of standing spectators remains constant at `k`.
- If `t` is larger than `n`, the program prints `n + k - t`. This is correct because at any time `t` larger than `n`, the first (`t-n`) spectators will have sat down, leaving `k - (t - n)` spectators standing, which simplifies to `n + k - t`.

The program handles all possible cases correctly as specified by the problem description. The problem description explains how the spectators stand and sit at different times, and the program accurately implements this logic to calculate the number of standing spectators at any given time `t`. 

For example, if we take the input `10 5 3`, the program will print `3`, which is correct according to the problem description. Similarly, for inputs `10 5 7` and `10 5 12`, the program will print `5` and `3` respectively, which are again correct according to the problem description.

The program's logic aligns with the problem description, making it correct for all potential cases.
