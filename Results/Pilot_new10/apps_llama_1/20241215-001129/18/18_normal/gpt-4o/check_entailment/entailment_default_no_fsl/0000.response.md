Correctness: **True**

The code correctly implements the logic to determine the number of spectators standing at time `t`. 

Here's a breakdown of the code and how it aligns with the problem description:

- If `t` is less than or equal to `k`, the number of spectators standing is equal to `t`. This is because the first `t` spectators stand consecutively without any sitting.

- If `t` is larger than `k` but less than or equal to `n`, the number of spectators standing remains `k`. This is because the wave has not yet reached the end of the stadium, and new spectators are standing while the first ones are sitting, maintaining a total of `k` standing spectators.

- If `t` is larger than `n`, the number of spectators standing starts to decrease. The formula `n + k - t` calculates this decrease correctly. The code correctly handles all the potential cases based on the constraints of `n`, `k`, and `t`.

The provided examples also demonstrate the correctness of the code:

- For `n = 10`, `k = 5`, and `t = 3`, the output is `3`, which is correct because at time `3`, the first `3` spectators are standing.

- For `n = 10`, `k = 5`, and `t = 7`, the output is `5`, which is correct because at time `7`, the wave has reached its maximum height, and `5` spectators are standing.

- For `n = 10`, `k = 5`, and `t = 12`, the output is `3`, which is correct because at time `12`, some spectators have started sitting, resulting in `3` spectators standing.

The code is well-structured, readable, and aligns perfectly with the problem description. It handles all the potential cases based on the relative values of `n`, `k`, and `t`, making it correct for every potential case.
