The code snippet `n, k, t = map(int, input().split())` is assigning new values to the variables `n`, `k`, and `t`. The `map(int, input().split())` function takes an input string, splits it into a list of strings using space as a delimiter, and then converts each string to an integer.

The initial condition states that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`, `1 ≤ k ≤ n`, and `1 ≤ t < n + k`, but the code updates the values of `n`, `k`, and `t` based on the user's input.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `t` are input integers, `n` is an input integer between 1 and 10^9, `k` is an input integer between 1 and `n`, `t` is an input integer between 1 and `n + k - 1` (because it was less than `n + k`) and `n`, `k` and `t` will be returned as integers at the output state**
