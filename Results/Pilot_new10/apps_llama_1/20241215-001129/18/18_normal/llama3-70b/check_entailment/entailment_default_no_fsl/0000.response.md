Correctness: **True**

The code accurately implements the problem description, taking into account the special cases for time `t` before and after `n`. 

For `t <= n`, the number of spectators standing is indeed `min(t, k)`, since the wave reaches its maximum at `k` and remains there until `t = n`. If `t > n`, the sitting spectators are counted from the beginning of the wave, with `(t - n) % k` spectators sitting, resulting in `k - (t - n) % k` standing spectators.

The examples provided in the problem description agree with the behavior of the code. For instance, when `n = 10`, `k = 5`, and `t = 3`, `min(3, 5) = 3` spectators are standing. When `t = 7`, `min(7, 5) = 5` spectators are standing. When `t = 12`, `k - (12 - 10) % 5 = 5 - 2 = 3` spectators are standing.

No cases have been found where the code does not work as expected according to the problem description, including edge cases and the provided examples. Therefore, the program appears to be correct and works as expected for every potential case.
