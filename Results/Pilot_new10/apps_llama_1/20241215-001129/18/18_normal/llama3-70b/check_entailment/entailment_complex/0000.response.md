To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the provided problem description, let's analyze both the problem description and the annotated program.

### Problem Description Analysis

The problem describes a scenario where there are `n` spectators in a stadium. At each time step `t`, a specific number of spectators are standing. The pattern follows these rules:
- At time `1`, the first spectator stands.
- At time `2`, the second spectator stands.
- This pattern continues until at time `k`, `k` spectators are standing.
- After time `k`, each subsequent time step adds one more standing spectator and removes the first spectator who stood, until all `n` spectators have stood.
- Once `n` spectators have stood (at time `n`), the pattern continues with removing one more spectator who stood in earlier time steps until all spectators sit down again.

The goal is to find out how many spectators are standing at time `t`, given `n`, `k`, and `t`.

### Program Analysis

The given Python program is as follows:
```python
def func():
    n, k, t = map(int, input().split())
    print(min(t, k) if t <= n else k - (t - n) % k)
```
This program takes three integers `n`, `k`, and `t` as inputs and prints the number of spectators standing at time `t` based on two conditions:
1. If `t` is less than or equal to `n`, it prints the minimum of `t` and `k`. This correctly represents the initial phase where spectators stand up until `k` spectators are standing, and then this number remains constant because the first spectators start sitting down.
2. If `t` is greater than `n`, it calculates `k - (t - n) % k`. This represents the phase where all `n` spectators have stood, and the number of standing spectators starts to decrease as earlier-standing spectators sit down.

### Correctness Evaluation

The program's logic aligns with the problem description for the following reasons:
- For `t <= n`, the program correctly calculates the number of standing spectators as the minimum of `t` and `k`. This matches the problem description's initial phase where the number of standing spectators increases to `k` and then remains constant as spectators sit and stand in a cycle.
- For `t > n`, the calculation `k - (t - n) % k` correctly models the later phase where the number of standing spectators decreases. The expression `(t - n) % k` calculates how many cycles of `k` spectators have been completed after time `n`, and subtracting this from `k` gives the correct number of spectators standing at time `t`.

### Conclusion

Given the problem description and the program's logic, it appears that the program correctly implements the rules defined for the Mexican wave scenario. The use of `min(t, k)` for `t <= n` and `k - (t - n) % k` for `t > n` accurately models the behavior described in the problem.

Correctness: **True**
