The values of `n`, `k`, and `t` are updated based on the input. The `input().split()` function splits the input into three separate integers, which are then assigned to `n`, `k`, and `t` respectively. 

The preconditions that `n`, `k`, and `t` are integers and that 1 <= n, 1 <= k, and 1 <= t are still valid. However, the updated values of `n`, `k`, and `t` are now input integers.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `t` are input integers, where `n` equals the first input integer, `k` equals the second input integer, and `t` equals the third input integer**
