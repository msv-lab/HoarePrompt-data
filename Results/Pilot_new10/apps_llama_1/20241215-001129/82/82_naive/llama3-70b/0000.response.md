Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not correctly solve the problem of finding the smallest non-negative integer `k` such that the least common multiple of `a+k` and `b+k` is the smallest possible. 

The problem with this code is that it stops as soon as it finds a `k` for which the least common multiple of `a+k` and `b+k` is not less than the least common multiple of `a+(k-1)` and `b+(k-1)`. However, this does not necessarily mean that `k-1` is the optimal solution.

For example, consider the case where `a = 6` and `b = 8`. The code will try `k = 0`, `k = 1`, and then since `lcm(6+2, 8+2)` is not less than `lcm(6+1, 8+1)`, it will stop and print `k = 1`. However, `k = 2` might be the optimal solution, but the code does not check this.

To fix this, we need to modify the code to try all possible `k` values until we are certain that we have found the optimal solution. 

Here is an example of how the code could be modified:
```python
import math

def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)

(a, b) = map(int, input().split())
min_lcm = float('inf')
optimal_k = 0
for k in range(10**6): # we can stop at a sufficiently large k
    lcm = func_2(a + k, b + k)
    if lcm < min_lcm:
        min_lcm = lcm
        optimal_k = k
    elif lcm > min_lcm: # if lcm is greater than min_lcm, we can break
        break
print(optimal_k)
```
This modified code checks all possible `k` values until it is certain that it has found the optimal solution. However, please note that this is still not the most efficient solution, especially for large inputs, because it has to try all possible `k` values. A more efficient solution would involve finding a mathematical formula to calculate the optimal `k` directly.
