To determine the necessary states before the for loop executes, we must analyze the given loop statement and the provided initial state.

The loop statement is:
```python
for candidate in [k, diff // k]:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Given the initial state:
- `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9 and `a` is not equal to `b`.
- `diff` is at least 1.
- `min_lcm` is positive infinity.
- `min_k` is 0.
- The current value of `k` is 1.
- The current value of `diff` is a multiple of `k`, meaning `diff` is divisible by 1.

For the loop to execute, it needs to iterate over the list `[k, diff // k]`. This implies that the list must not be empty, and both elements must be defined.

1. **`k` must be defined and an integer:** Since `k` is given as 1, this condition is already met.

2. **`diff // k` must be defined and an integer:** Given that `diff` is at least 1 and a multiple of `k`, and since `k` is 1, `diff // k` will always be an integer because any integer divided by 1 is itself.

3. **The list `[k, diff // k]` must not be empty:** Since both `k` and `diff // k` are defined and integers, and given that `k` is 1 and `diff` is at least 1, the list will always have at least one element. If `diff` equals `k` (which is 1 in this case), the list will still contain one unique element because `[1, 1]` is a valid list.

However, for the loop to start executing, we consider the conditions under which the loop will iterate. The loop iterates over two values: `k` and `diff // k`. Given that both are defined and that `k` is 1, we only need to ensure that the division `diff // k` results in an integer, which it will since `k` is 1 and `diff` is a multiple of `k`.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts needs to reflect that:
- `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9 and `a` is not equal to `b`.
- `diff` is at least 1 and a multiple of `k`.
- `min_lcm` is positive infinity.
- `min_k` is 0.
- The current value of `k` is 1.
- The loop is set to iterate over `[k, diff // k]`, with `k` being 1 and `diff // k` being an integer because `diff` is divisible by `k`.

State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9 and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is at least 1 and a multiple of `k`, `min_lcm` is positive infinity, `min_k` is 0, `k` is 1, and the loop iterates over `[k, diff // k]`.**
