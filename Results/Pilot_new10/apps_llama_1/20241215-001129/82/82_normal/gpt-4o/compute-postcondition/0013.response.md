To calculate the output state, we consider the impact of the given code on the program. The code assigns the value of `current_lcm` to `min_lcm`. 

Given that `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9 and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is at least 1 and a multiple of `k`, `min_lcm` is positive infinity, `min_k` is 0, `k` is 1, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` is `func_2((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate, (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate)`. 

The condition for the update is that the current value of `current_lcm` is less than the current value of `min_lcm`, or the current value of `current_lcm` is equal to the current value of `min_lcm` and the current value of `candidate` is less than the current value of `min_k`.

After executing the code, `min_lcm` becomes equal to `current_lcm`, which is `func_2((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate, (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate)`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9 and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is at least 1 and a multiple of `k`, `min_lcm` is `func_2((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate, (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate)`, `min_k` is 0, `k` is 1, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` is `func_2((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate, (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate)`**
