Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is a positive integer, `k` is 2. If `diff` is divisible by `k`, then `min_lcm` is the smallest LCM of the smallest multiples of `k` and `diff // k` that are greater than or equal to `a` and `b`, and `min_k` is the candidate (`k` or `diff // k`) that results in `min_lcm`. If `diff` is not divisible by `k`, then the state of the program remains unchanged as there is no else part to handle this case.***
