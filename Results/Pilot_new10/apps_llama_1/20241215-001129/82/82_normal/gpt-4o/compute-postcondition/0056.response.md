Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is a positive integer greater than 0, if `diff` is divisible by `k`, then `min_lcm` is the smallest achievable LCM of `(a + k - 1) // k * k` and `(b + k - 1) // k * k`, and `min_k` is the factor of `diff` that yields `min_lcm`, otherwise the state remains unchanged***
