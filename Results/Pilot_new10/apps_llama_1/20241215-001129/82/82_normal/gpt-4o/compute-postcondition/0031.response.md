Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9 and `a` is not equal to `b`, if `diff` is divisible by `k`, then `min_lcm` is the smallest achievable LCM of `new_a` and `new_b` for any candidate factor of `diff`, and `min_k` is the factor of `diff` that yields `min_lcm`.***
