The code calculates the `current_lcm` using the function `func_2` with `new_a` and `new_b` as arguments. The values of `new_a` and `new_b` are calculated based on `a`, `b`, and `candidate`. However, the value of `candidate` is not provided in the initial state, but we can infer that it's related to the loop that iterates over `[k, diff // k]`. 

Since `k` is 1, the loop iterates over `[1, diff]`. The `current_lcm` is calculated as `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, where `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate` and `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9 and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is at least 1 and a multiple of `k`, `min_lcm` is positive infinity, `min_k` is 0, `k` is 1, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and `current_lcm` is `func_2((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate, (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate)`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9 and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is at least 1 and a multiple of `k`, `min_lcm` is positive infinity, `min_k` is 0, `k` is 1, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` is `func_2((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate, (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate)`**
