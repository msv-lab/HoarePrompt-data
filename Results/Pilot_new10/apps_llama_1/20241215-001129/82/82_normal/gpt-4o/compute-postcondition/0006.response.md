To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the conditions and variables involved in the loop statement. The loop is defined as `for k in range(1, int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1)`, which means it will iterate over values of `k` from 1 up to the integer value of the square root of `diff` plus one.

Given the initial state:
- `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9 and `a` is not equal to `b`.
- `diff` is a positive integer equal to `abs(a - b)`.
- `min_lcm` is positive infinity.
- `min_k` is 0.

For the loop to execute, we need `diff` to be greater than 0 since we are taking its square root. Since `diff` is defined as `abs(a - b)` and we already know `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` will indeed be greater than 0. This condition is inherently satisfied by the initial state.

The loop variable `k` starts at 1 and goes up to `int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1`. This implies that for the loop to execute at least once, `int(math.sqrt(diff))` must be greater than or equal to 1, which is guaranteed if `diff` is at least 1. Given that `diff` is the absolute difference between two distinct positive integers `a` and `b`, `diff` will be at least 1, satisfying this condition.

Therefore, the initial state needs to reflect that `diff` must be at least 1 (which is guaranteed by the definition of `diff` and the fact that `a` and `b` are distinct), and `k` is about to start its iteration from 1.

State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9 and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is at least 1, `min_lcm` is positive infinity, `min_k` is 0, `k` is 1**
