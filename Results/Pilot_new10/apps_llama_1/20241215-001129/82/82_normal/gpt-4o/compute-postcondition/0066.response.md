According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list of candidates, which is `[k, diff // k]`. If the current candidate is `k`, then for the loop to execute again, the candidate must be `diff // k`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is 2, `candidate` is `k` or `diff // k`, `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and `current_lcm` is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`. If `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or if `current_lcm` equals `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`, then `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm` and `min_k` is `candidate` (either `k` or `diff // k`).

So for the loop to be executed one more time, the candidate must be the other value in the list, i.e., if the last candidate was `k`, then the new candidate is `diff // k` and vice versa.
State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is 2, `candidate` is the other candidate (`diff // k` if the previous candidate was `k`, or `k` if the previous candidate was `diff // k`), `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and `current_lcm` is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`.**
