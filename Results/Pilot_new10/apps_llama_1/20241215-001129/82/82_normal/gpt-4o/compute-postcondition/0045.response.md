`min_lcm` is assigned the value of `current_lcm`. The value of `current_lcm` is the least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b`. `new_a` equals `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate` and `new_b` equals `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. The values of `a`, `b`, `diff`, `k`, `new_a`, `new_b`, and `current_lcm` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9 and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is in the range from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1`, `diff` is divisible by `k`, `new_a` equals `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` equals `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` equals the least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b`, and `min_lcm` equals `current_lcm`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9 and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is in the range from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1`, `diff` is divisible by `k`, `new_a` equals `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` equals `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` equals the least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b`, and `min_lcm` equals the least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b`.**
