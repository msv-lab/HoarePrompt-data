The code `min_lcm = current_lcm` assigns the value of `current_lcm` to `min_lcm`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is 2, `candidate` is either `k` or `diff // k`, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`, and `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is 2, `candidate` is either `k` or `diff // k`, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`, and `min_lcm` is equal to the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`.**
