To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\).
   - `diff` is at least 1.
   - `candidate` is equal to `diff`.
   - `k` is 1.
   - `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`.
   - `new_b` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` (or `diff`) that is greater than or equal to `b`.

2. **Code Execution**: 
   - The code executes the function `func_2(new_a, new_b)` and assigns its result to `current_lcm`.

Given that `func_2` likely calculates the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers (based on typical naming conventions and the context of the variables involved), the `current_lcm` will be the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`.

3. **Output State**:
   - `a` and `b` remain positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\).
   - `diff` is at least 1.
   - `candidate` equals `diff`.
   - `k` is 1.
   - `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`.
   - `new_b` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` (or `diff`) that is greater than or equal to `b`.
   - `current_lcm` is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`, which can be expressed as `lcm(new_a, new_b)`.

Since `new_a` and `new_b` are multiples of the same number (`candidate` or `diff`), their LCM (`current_lcm`) will also be a multiple of `candidate`. However, without knowing the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `diff`, we cannot determine the exact value of `current_lcm` beyond it being the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\), `diff` is at least 1, `candidate` equals `diff`, `k` is 1, `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` (or `diff`) that is greater than or equal to `b`, and `current_lcm` equals `lcm(new_a, new_b)`**
