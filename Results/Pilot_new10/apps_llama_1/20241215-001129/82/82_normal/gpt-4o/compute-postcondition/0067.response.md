The value of `new_a` is updated to be the smallest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a`, which is calculated as `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
`a` and `b` are still positive integers, `diff` is still a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is still 2, `candidate` is still the other candidate (`diff // k` if the previous candidate was `k`, or `k` if the previous candidate was `diff // k`), `new_b` is still `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, but `new_a` is now `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. Since `new_a` and `new_b` have changed (only `new_a` in this case), `current_lcm` is no longer the LCM of the old `new_a` and `new_b`, it should be recalculated with the new `new_a` and the existing `new_b` to get the new LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is 2, `candidate` is the other candidate (`diff // k` if the previous candidate was `k`, or `k` if the previous candidate was `diff // k`), `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and `current_lcm` is the LCM of `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate` and `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`**.
