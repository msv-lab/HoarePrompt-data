Postcondition: ***`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is 2, `candidate` is `diff // 2`, `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is `(b + diff // 2 - 1) // (diff // 2) * (diff // 2)`, if `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or (`current_lcm` equals `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`), then `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm` and `min_k` is `diff // 2`, otherwise, `min_lcm` and `min_k` remain unchanged, and `current_lcm` is equal to `func_2(new_a, new_b)`***
