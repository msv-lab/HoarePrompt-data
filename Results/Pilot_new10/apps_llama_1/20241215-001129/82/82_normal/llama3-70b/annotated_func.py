    #The program returns the absolute value of the original 'a', which is the GCD of the original 'a' and 'b' where 'b' is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, calculates their greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm, and returns the GCD.

def func_2(a, b):

    #The program returns the floor division of the product of two positive integers `a` and `b` by the return value of `func_1(a, b)`, where `func_1(a, b)` is an undefined function.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, attempts to calculate the floor division of their product by the return value of an undefined function `func_1(a, b)`, but instead raises a `NameError` due to the undefined function.
