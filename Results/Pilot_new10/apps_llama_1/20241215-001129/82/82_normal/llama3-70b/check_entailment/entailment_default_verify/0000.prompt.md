You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Neko loves divisors. During the latest number theory lesson, he got an interesting exercise from his math teacher.

Neko has two integers $a$ and $b$. His goal is to find a non-negative integer $k$ such that the least common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible. If there are multiple optimal integers $k$, he needs to choose the smallest one.

Given his mathematical talent, Neko had no trouble getting Wrong Answer on this problem. Can you help him solve it?


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \le a, b \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Print the smallest non-negative integer $k$ ($k \ge 0$) such that the lowest common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible.

If there are many possible integers $k$ giving the same value of the least common multiple, print the smallest one.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 10

Output
2
Input
21 31

Output
9
Input
5 10

Output
0


-----Note-----

In the first test, one should choose $k = 2$, as the least common multiple of $6 + 2$ and $10 + 2$ is $24$, which is the smallest least common multiple possible.
Program:
```
import math

(a, b) = map(int, input().split())
k = 0
min_lcm = func_2(a, b)
while True:
    if func_2(a + k, b + k) < min_lcm:
        min_lcm = func_2(a + k, b + k)
    else:
        break
    k += 1
print(k - 1)

def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not correctly solve the problem of finding the smallest non-negative integer `k` such that the least common multiple of `a+k` and `b+k` is the smallest possible. 

The problem with this code is that it stops as soon as it finds a `k` for which the least common multiple of `a+k` and `b+k` is not less than the least common multiple of `a+(k-1)` and `b+(k-1)`. However, this does not necessarily mean that `k-1` is the optimal solution.

For example, consider the case where `a = 6` and `b = 8`. The code will try `k = 0`, `k = 1`, and then since `lcm(6+2, 8+2)` is not less than `lcm(6+1, 8+1)`, it will stop and print `k = 1`. However, `k = 2` might be the optimal solution, but the code does not check this.

To fix this, we need to modify the code to try all possible `k` values until we are certain that we have found the optimal solution. 

Here is an example of how the code could be modified:
```python
import math

def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)

(a, b) = map(int, input().split())
min_lcm = float('inf')
optimal_k = 0
for k in range(10**6): # we can stop at a sufficiently large k
    lcm = func_2(a + k, b + k)
    if lcm < min_lcm:
        min_lcm = lcm
        optimal_k = k
    elif lcm > min_lcm: # if lcm is greater than min_lcm, we can break
        break
print(optimal_k)
```
This modified code checks all possible `k` values until it is certain that it has found the optimal solution. However, please note that this is still not the most efficient solution, especially for large inputs, because it has to try all possible `k` values. A more efficient solution would involve finding a mathematical formula to calculate the optimal `k` directly.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, calculates their greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm, and returns the GCD. 

Output hint for function_2: The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, attempts to calculate the floor division of their product by the return value of an undefined function `func_1(a, b)`, but instead raises a `NameError` due to the undefined function. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
