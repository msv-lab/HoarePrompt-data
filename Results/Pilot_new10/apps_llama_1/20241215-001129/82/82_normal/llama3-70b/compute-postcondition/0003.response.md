To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code step by step:

1. The initial state is that `a` is equal to the initial `b`, and `b` must be non-zero. This also implies that the initial `a` is not a multiple of the initial `b` since `a` equals `b`.

2. The code `a, b = b, a % b` simultaneously updates the values of `a` and `b`. 
   - The new value of `a` becomes the old value of `b`.
   - The new value of `b` becomes the remainder of the old `a` divided by the old `b`, which is `a % b`.

Given that initially `a` equals `b`, when we calculate `a % b`, we're essentially calculating `b % b`, which will always be `0` because any number modulo itself is `0`.

So, after the execution of the code:
- The new value of `a` is the old value of `b`.
- The new value of `b` is `0`, because `a % b` equals `b % b` which is `0`.

However, the condition that `b` must be non-zero is part of the initial state, and the operation `a, b = b, a % b` changes `b` to `0`, which contradicts the initial condition that `b` must be non-zero. 

Given the specific initial condition that `a` equals `b` and `b` is non-zero, the code's execution leads to a state where `b` becomes `0`, which seems to violate the premise. But, following the code's execution literally:

- `a` takes the value of the original `b` (which was also the value of `a`).
- `b` becomes `0` because `a % b` (or `b % b`) is `0`.

Thus, the output state, considering the direct result of the code's execution but acknowledging the contradiction with the initial non-zero condition for `b`, is:

Output State: **`a` is equal to the initial value of `b`, `b` is 0**
