To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

Given the Initial State: `a` and `b` are positive integers.

The code snippet is:
```python
return a * b // func_1(a, b)
```

Here, `a` and `b` are known to be positive integers, but the function `func_1(a, b)` is not defined in the provided information. However, since the task asks us to describe the output state based on the given information, we will proceed with what we know.

The operation `a * b` will result in the product of `a` and `b`, which will be a positive integer because both `a` and `b` are positive integers.

The `//` operator performs floor division, which means it divides the number before it by the number after it and returns the largest whole number less than or equal to the result.

However, without knowing the specifics of `func_1(a, b)`, we cannot determine the exact value of `a * b // func_1(a, b)`. All we know is that `func_1(a, b)` is being called with two positive integer arguments, `a` and `b`, but its return value or behavior is unspecified.

Thus, the output state will be the result of the division of the product of `a` and `b` by the return value of `func_1(a, b)`, which remains undefined based on the provided information.

Output State: **The program returns the floor division of the product of two positive integers `a` and `b` by the return value of `func_1(a, b)`, where `func_1(a, b)` is an undefined function.**
