According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is truthy (i.e., not 0), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is 0, which means it is falsy. For the loop to execute one more time, `b` needs to be adjusted to a non-zero value.

State: **`a` is equal to the initial value of `b`, `b` must be non-zero**
