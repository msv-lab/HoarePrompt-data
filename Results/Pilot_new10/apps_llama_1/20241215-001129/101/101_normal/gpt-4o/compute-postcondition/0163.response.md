The given Python code is executed on the provided initial state. The code affects the `result` variable, which is a 2D list of characters where each inner list is a copy of the corresponding row in `screen`. 

`result[i][j]` is assigned the value `'+'`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `result` and all other variables are not changed except for `result[i][j]`.

Given that `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` is an integer, `j` is `right`, `left` is less than or equal to `right`, `right` is greater than `j`, `top` and `bottom` are the minimum and maximum row indices of all 'w' characters in `screen` with `bottom` being at least `top + 1`, `frame_height` is at least 2, `frame_width` is at least 2, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, the output state is: 
`n` is a positive integer, 
`m` is a positive integer, 
`screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, 
`i` is an integer, 
`j` is `right`, 
`left` is less than or equal to `right`, 
`right` is greater than `j`, 
`top` and `bottom` are the minimum and maximum row indices of all 'w' characters in `screen` with `bottom` being at least `top + 1`, 
`frame_height` is at least 2, 
`frame_width` is at least 2, 
`result` is a 2D list of characters where each inner list is a copy of the corresponding row in `screen` except for `result[i][j]` which is `'+'`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` is an integer, `j` is `right`, `left` is less than or equal to `right`, `right` is greater than `j`, `top` and `bottom` are the minimum and maximum row indices of all 'w' characters in `screen` with `bottom` being at least `top + 1`, `frame_height` is at least 2, `frame_width` is at least 2, `result` is a 2D list of characters where each inner list is a copy of the corresponding row in `screen` except for `result[i][j]` which is `'+'`**
