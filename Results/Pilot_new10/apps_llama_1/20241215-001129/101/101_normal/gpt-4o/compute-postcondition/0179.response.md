The value of `result[i][j]` is updated to `'+'`. The value of `j` is `left + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
`result[i][j]` is now `'+'`, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `left` plus one must be less than or equal to `right`, `top` plus one must be less than or equal to `bottom`, `frame_height` and `frame_width` are at least 2, and `j` is `left + 1`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `left` plus one must be less than or equal to `right`, `top` plus one must be less than or equal to `bottom`, `frame_height` and `frame_width` are at least 2, `result` is a 2D list of characters where `result[i][left + 1]` is '+', `j` is `left + 1`**
