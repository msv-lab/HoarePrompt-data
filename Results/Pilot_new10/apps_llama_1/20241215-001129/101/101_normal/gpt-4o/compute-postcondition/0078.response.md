Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `top` is 1, and since the condition `j < left` will always be false when `j` equals 1 and `left` is 1 or more, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
