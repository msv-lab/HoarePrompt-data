Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `left` plus one must be less than or equal to `right`, `top` plus one must be less than or equal to `bottom`, `frame_height` and `frame_width` are at least 2, `result` is a 2D list of characters, `j` is `left + 1`, if `i` is equal to `top`, `bottom`, or `j` is equal to `left` or `right`, then if `result[i][left + 1]` is '.', no change occurs, otherwise `result[i][left + 1]` is '+'.***
