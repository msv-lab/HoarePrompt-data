Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, the first element of the first row of `screen` is 'w', the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', `top` is either 1 or its previous value, if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then the current value of `bottom` is 1, otherwise, the current value of `bottom` remains unchanged, and the current values of `left` and `right` remain as previously determined based on the first row of `screen`. The current value of `j` is less than the current value of `left`.**
