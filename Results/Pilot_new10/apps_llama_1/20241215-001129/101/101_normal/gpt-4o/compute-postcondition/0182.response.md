To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the given loop statement and the current state. 

The loop statement is `for j in range(left, right + 1):`, which means the loop will iterate over the range from `left` to `right` (inclusive). 

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `left + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `j` should be incremented by 1. 

So, the new state of `j` should be `left + 2`. 

All other variables (`n`, `m`, `screen`, `left`, `right`, `top`, `bottom`, `frame_height`, `frame_width`, `result`, and `i`) remain unchanged as their values do not affect the loop's condition to execute again.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `left` plus two must be less than or equal to `right`, `top` plus one must be less than or equal to `bottom`, `frame_height` and `frame_width` are at least 2, `result` is a 2D list of characters, `j` is `left + 2`, if `i` is equal to `top`, `bottom`, or `j` is equal to `left` or `right`, then if `result[i][left + 2]` is '.', no change occurs, otherwise `result[i][left + 2]` is '+'**
