Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 2, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2. If `screen[i][j]` equals 'w', then the values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are updated based on the conditions: if `top` is None, `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `left` is 2, `right` is 2; if `j` is greater than `right`, `bottom` is 1, `right` is 2; if `j` is less than `left`, `left` equals `j`; otherwise, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and the values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain determined by their initial relationships with `i` and `j`.***
