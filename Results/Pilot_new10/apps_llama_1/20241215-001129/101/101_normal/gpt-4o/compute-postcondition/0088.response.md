The given code `bottom = i` assigns the value of `i` to the variable `bottom`. Since `i` is 1, `bottom` is assigned the value 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 2, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `bottom` is 1**
