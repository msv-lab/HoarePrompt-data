The variables `left` and `right` are assigned the value of `j`. Since `j` equals 1, `left` and `right` are both assigned the value 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` equals 2, `j` equals 1, `top` equals 2, `bottom` equals 2, `left` equals 1, `right` equals 1**
