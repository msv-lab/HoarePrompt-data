Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, if `i` is less than `top`, then `i` equals 2, `j` equals 1, and `top` equals 2, otherwise, the state remains as `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` equals 2, `j` equals 1***
