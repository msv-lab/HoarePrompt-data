According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 2. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` equals 2, `j` equals 2, `left` equals 1, `top` equals 2, `bottom` equals 2, `right` equals 1**
