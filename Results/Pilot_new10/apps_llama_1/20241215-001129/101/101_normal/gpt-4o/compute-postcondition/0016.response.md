Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, where each string consists of only "." and "w" characters. If the original value of `i` was less than `top`, then the current value of `i` is 0, the current value of `j` is 0 if `j` is less than `left`, `top` is 0, `right` is `None`, `left` is 0 if `j` is less than `left`, otherwise `left` is equal to `j`, and the current value of `screen` at position `(0, 0)` is 'w'. Otherwise, `i`, `j`, `top`, `right` retain their original values, `left` is equal to `j` if `j` is less than the original value of `left`, and `screen` also retains its original state. If the original value of `i` was greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` is updated to be equal to the original value of `i`, and the current value of `i` is greater than or equal to the new value of `bottom`.***
