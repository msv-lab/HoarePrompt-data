The code assigns the value of `i` to both `top` and `bottom`. Since `i` equals 2, both `top` and `bottom` will be equal to 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` equals 2, `j` equals 1, `top` equals 2, `bottom` equals 2**
