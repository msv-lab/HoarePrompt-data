Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `left` plus two must be less than or equal to `right`, `top` plus one must be less than or equal to `bottom`, `frame_height` and `frame_width` are at least 2, `result` is a 2D list of characters, if `i` is equal to `top`, `bottom`, or `j` is equal to `left` or `right`, then `result[i][left + 2]` is '+', otherwise `result[i][j]` remains unchanged if it is not '.', and if `result[i][j]` is '.', then `result[i][left + 2]` is '+'**
