Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 2, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`. If `top` is None, then `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `left` is 2, `right` is 2. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than `right`, then `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `bottom` is 1, `right` is 2; if `j` is less than `left`, then `left` equals `j`. If neither condition is met, the state of the variables remains as initially described in the precondition, with `i` being 1, `j` being 2, and the values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` being determined by their initial relationships with `i` and `j`, specifically if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `bottom` is 1, and if `j` is less than `left`, then `left` is equal to `j`, otherwise `left` is 2 if `i` is greater than `bottom`.**
