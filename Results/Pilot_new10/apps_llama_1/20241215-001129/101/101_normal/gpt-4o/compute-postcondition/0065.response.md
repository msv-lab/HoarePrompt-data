Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` is 1, the first element of the first row of `screen` is 'w', the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', `top` is either 1 or its previous value, if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` is 1, otherwise, `bottom` remains unchanged, and `right` remains as previously determined based on the first row of `screen`. If `j` is less than `left`, then `left` is 0 and `j` is equal to `left`. The current value of `j` is greater than the current value of `right`.**
