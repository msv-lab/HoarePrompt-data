Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain as previously determined based on the first row of `screen`, `screen[i][j]` is 'w', and if `i` is less than `top`, then `top` is 1; otherwise, the state remains unchanged since there's no else condition modifying the state.**
