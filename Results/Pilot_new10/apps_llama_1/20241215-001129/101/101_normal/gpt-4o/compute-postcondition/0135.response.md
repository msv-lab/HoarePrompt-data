Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `j` equals 2, `left` equals 1, `bottom` equals 2, `right` equals 1, and if `i` is less than `top`, then `i` equals 2, otherwise no changes are made to `i` since there is no else part to handle the condition when `i` is not less than `top`.**
