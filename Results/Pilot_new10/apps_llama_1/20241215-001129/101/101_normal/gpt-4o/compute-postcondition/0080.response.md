Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `top` is 1, and since `j` is 1, it will always be less than or equal to `right`, the state of the variables remains unchanged as the condition `j > right` will always be false when `j` equals 1 and `right` is 1 or more.**
