The code assigns the value of `j` to both `left` and `right`. The value of `j` is given as 2 in the initial state. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 2, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `left` is 2, `right` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 2, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `left` is 2, `right` is 2**
