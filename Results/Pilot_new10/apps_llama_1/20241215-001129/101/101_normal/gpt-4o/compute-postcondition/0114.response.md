The value of `right` is updated to be equal to `j`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` equals 2, `top` is the minimum row index of 'w' characters in the first row of `screen` or 2 if `i` is less than `top`, `left` is 0, `right` is `j`, `bottom` is 2 if `i` is greater than its original value, otherwise its original value, and the value of `screen` at index `[i][j]` is 'w' if `i` is greater than `bottom`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` equals 2, `top` is the minimum row index of 'w' characters in the first row of `screen` or 2 if `i` is less than `top`, `left` is 0, `right` is `j`, `bottom` is 2 if `i` is greater than its original value, otherwise its original value, and the value of `screen` at index `[i][j]` is 'w' if `i` is greater than `bottom`**
