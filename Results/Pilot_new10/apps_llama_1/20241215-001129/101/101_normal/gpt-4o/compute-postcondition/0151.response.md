Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are the minimum and maximum row and column indices of all 'w' characters in `screen`, `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1`, `frame_width` is `right - left + 1`. The current value of `frame_height` is less than 2 or the current value of `frame_width` is less than 2.**
