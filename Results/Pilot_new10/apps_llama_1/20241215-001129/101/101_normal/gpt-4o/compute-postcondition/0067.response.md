Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` is 1, the first element of the first row of `screen` is 'w', the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', `top` is either 1 or its previous value, if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` is 1, otherwise, `bottom` remains unchanged. If `j` is greater than the previous value of `right`, then `right` is updated to `j` and `left` is 0. Otherwise, `right` and `left` remain as previously determined based on the first row of `screen`.***
