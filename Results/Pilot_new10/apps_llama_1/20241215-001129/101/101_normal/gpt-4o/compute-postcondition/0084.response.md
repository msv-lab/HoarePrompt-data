The code snippet `top = bottom = i` assigns the value of `i` to both `top` and `bottom`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1. Therefore, both `top` and `bottom` will be assigned the value 1.

The values of `n`, `m`, `screen`, and `j` are not affected by this code snippet. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 2, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1**
