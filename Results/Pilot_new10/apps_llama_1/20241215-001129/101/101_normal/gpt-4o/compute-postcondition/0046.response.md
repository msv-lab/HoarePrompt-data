Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`. If `top` is None, then `top` is equal to `i`, `bottom` is equal to `i`, `left` is equal to `j`, and `right` is equal to `j`. If `top` is not None, then `right` is updated to `j` if `j` is greater than the previous `right`, and `left` is updated to `j` if `j` is less than the previous `left`. Additionally, `top` is updated to `i` if `i` is less than the previous `top`, and `bottom` is updated to `i` if `i` is greater than the previous `bottom`.***
