The code initializes four variables: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`, and assigns them a value of `None`. The initial state of `n`, `m`, and `screen` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, where each string consists of only "." and "w" characters, `top` is `None`, `bottom` is `None`, `left` is `None`, and `right` is `None`**
