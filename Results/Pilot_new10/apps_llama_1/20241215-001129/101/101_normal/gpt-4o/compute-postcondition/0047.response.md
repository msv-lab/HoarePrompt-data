Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`. If `screen[i][j]` is 'w', then `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are updated accordingly to encapsulate the newfound 'w' within their bounds, specifically: if `top` is None, `top` equals `i`, `bottom` equals `i`, `left` equals `j`, and `right` equals `j`; if `top` is not None, `right` is updated to `j` if `j` is greater than the previous `right`, `left` is updated to `j` if `j` is less than the previous `left`, `top` is updated to `i` if `i` is less than the previous `top`, and `bottom` is updated to `i` if `i` is greater than the previous `bottom`; if `screen[i][j]` is not 'w', no changes are made.**
