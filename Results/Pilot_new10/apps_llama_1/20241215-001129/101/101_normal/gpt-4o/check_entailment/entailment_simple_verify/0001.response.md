The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it does not verify if all white pixels of the monitor are located on the frame and does not handle the case where there are multiple frames with the same minimum size. 

However, the provided annotated version of the code helps to clarify the program's logic and state at different points. The annotated version shows that the program does attempt to find the bounding box of all white pixels and then constructs a frame around it. 

After re-examining the code and the annotations, it becomes clear that the original assessment is indeed accurate. The program does not correctly check if all white pixels are on the frame, and it does not handle the case where there are multiple frames with the same minimum size. 

The annotated version of the code confirms that the program only finds the bounding box of all white pixels and then constructs a frame around it, without verifying if all white pixels are actually on the frame. This is evident from the fact that the program does not check if there are any white pixels outside the constructed frame or if there are any white pixels inside the frame that are not on the border.

Therefore, the final correctness of the program based on the problem description is that the program is incorrect. 

The reason for this is that the program does not correctly solve the problem as stated in the problem description. The problem description requires that the program find such a possible square frame that all white pixels of the monitor are located on the frame, the frame doesn't go beyond the borders of the screen, and of all frames that satisfy the previous conditions, the required frame must have the smallest size. However, the program does not correctly check if all white pixels are on the frame and does not handle the case where there are multiple frames with the same minimum size.

Final: **False**
