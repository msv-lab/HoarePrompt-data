Correctness: **False**

The code does not work correctly for every potential case. The problem description requires finding the smallest possible square frame that contains all white pixels, but the code only finds the bounding box of all 'w' characters. 

For example, if the input is:
```
5 5
.....
..w..
..w..
..w..
.....
```
The code will output:
```
.....
..+..
..+..
..+..
.....
```
But the correct output should be a square frame of size 3:
```
.....
..+..
.+++.
..+..
.....
```
The code does not consider the case where the white pixels are not aligned in a square shape, and it does not find the smallest possible square frame. 

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
