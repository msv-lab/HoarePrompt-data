The given code snippet prints the second row in `pixels`. This operation does not change any variable values, it simply prints the value of `row`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer with `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`, `m` is an integer with `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a non-empty 2D list of size `n x m` with at least 2 rows, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels`, `min_x` and `max_x` are the smallest and largest x-coordinates in `white_pixels`, `min_y` and `max_y` are the smallest and largest y-coordinates in `white_pixels`, `frame_size` equals `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1` and is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `row` is the second row in `pixels`, and the second row in `pixels` has been printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer with `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`, `m` is an integer with `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a non-empty 2D list of size `n x m` with at least 2 rows, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels`, `min_x` and `max_x` are the smallest and largest x-coordinates in `white_pixels`, `min_y` and `max_y` are the smallest and largest y-coordinates in `white_pixels`, `frame_size` equals `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1` and is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `row` is the second row in `pixels`, and the string representation of the second row in `pixels` has been printed.**
