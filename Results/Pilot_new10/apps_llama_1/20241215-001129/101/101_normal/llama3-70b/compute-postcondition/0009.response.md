To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state. The code provided is:
```
max_x, max_y = max(max_x, x), max(max_y, y)
```
Given the initial state:
- `n` and `m` are integers with `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`
- `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where each element is either "." or "w"
- `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels` that must have at least 2 coordinates
- `min_x` is the minimum of the initial `x` and the x-coordinate of the second 'w' pixel
- `min_y` is the minimum of the initial `y` and the y-coordinate of the second 'w' pixel
- `max_x` is `x`
- `max_y` is `y`

The code updates `max_x` and `max_y` to be the maximum of their current values and `x` and `y`, respectively. 

Since `max_x` is initially `x` and `max_y` is initially `y`, and considering the update rule, `max_x` will be set to `x` if `x` is greater than the initial `max_x` (which is `x`), otherwise it remains `x`. Similarly, `max_y` will be set to `y` if `y` is greater than the initial `max_y` (which is `y`), otherwise it remains `y`. However, given `max_x` and `max_y` are initially set to `x` and `y` respectively, the update essentially means `max_x` and `max_y` will always be `x` and `y` after this operation because they are being compared to themselves.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` and `m` are integers with `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`
- `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where each element is either "." or "w"
- `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels` that must have at least 2 coordinates
- `min_x` is the minimum of the initial `x` and the x-coordinate of the second 'w' pixel
- `min_y` is the minimum of the initial `y` and the y-coordinate of the second 'w' pixel
- `max_x` is `x`
- `max_y` is `y`

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers with `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where each element is either "." or "w", `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels` that must have at least 2 coordinates, `min_x` is the minimum of the initial `x` and the x-coordinate of the second 'w' pixel, `min_y` is the minimum of the initial `y` and the y-coordinate of the second 'w' pixel, `max_x` is `x`, `max_y` is `y`**
