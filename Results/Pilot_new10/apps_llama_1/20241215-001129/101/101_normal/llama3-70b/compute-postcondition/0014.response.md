To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

`frame_size = max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`

The code calculates `frame_size` as the maximum difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates or the maximum and minimum y-coordinates in `white_pixels`, plus 1.

From the initial state, we know:
- `n` and `m` are integers with `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`.
- `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where each element is either "." or "w".
- `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels`.
- `min_x` is the smallest x-coordinate in `white_pixels` if it is not empty, otherwise `float('inf')`.
- `min_y` is the smallest y-coordinate in `white_pixels` if it is not empty, otherwise `float('inf')`.
- `max_x` is the largest x-coordinate in `white_pixels` if it is not empty, otherwise `float('-inf')`.
- `max_y` is the largest y-coordinate in `white_pixels` if it is not empty, otherwise `float('-inf')`.

After executing the code, `frame_size` will be assigned the value `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`. This means `frame_size` will be equal to the maximum of the differences between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates and the maximum and minimum y-coordinates, plus 1.

The states of `n`, `m`, `pixels`, `white_pixels`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` are not affected by this code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is:
`n` and `m` are integers with `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`, 
`pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where each element is either "." or "w", 
`white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels`, 
`min_x` is the smallest x-coordinate in `white_pixels` if it is not empty, otherwise `float('inf')`, 
`min_y` is the smallest y-coordinate in `white_pixels` if it is not empty, otherwise `float('inf')`, 
`max_x` is the largest x-coordinate in `white_pixels` if it is not empty, otherwise `float('-inf')`, 
`max_y` is the largest y-coordinate in `white_pixels` if it is not empty, otherwise `float('-inf')`, 
`frame_size` is equal to `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers with `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where each element is either "." or "w", `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels`, `min_x` is the smallest x-coordinate in `white_pixels` if it is not empty, otherwise `float('inf')`, `min_y` is the smallest y-coordinate in `white_pixels` if it is not empty, otherwise `float('inf')`, `max_x` is the largest x-coordinate in `white_pixels` if it is not empty, otherwise `float('-inf')`, `max_y` is the largest y-coordinate in `white_pixels` if it is not empty, otherwise `float('-inf')`, `frame_size` is equal to `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`**
