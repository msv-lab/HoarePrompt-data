The given code reads `n` lines of `m` characters each from the input and stores them in the `pixels` variable as a 2D list. 

`pixels` is assigned the value of a 2D list where each inner list represents a line of pixels. Each inner list contains `m` characters, either "." (representing a black pixel) or "w" (representing a white pixel).

The states of `n` and `m` are not affected by this code, so they remain integers with `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`, representing the resolution of the monitor.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are integers with `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`, `n` and `m` represent the resolution of the monitor, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where each element is either "." or "w".
Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers with `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`, `n` and `m` represent the resolution of the monitor, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where each element is either "." or "w"**
