To calculate the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the provided output states for the first few iterations.

The loop code checks each pixel in the `pixels` 2D list. If the current pixel is on the border of the frame (i.e., `i` equals the current value of `min_x` or `i` equals the current value of `max_x` or `j` equals the current value of `min_y` or `j` equals the current value of `max_y`) and the pixel is '.', it sets the pixel to '+'. If the pixel is 'w', it skips to the next iteration. If the pixel is neither 'w' nor on the border, it ensures the pixel remains '.'.

Given that `i` is always 0 (as observed from the initial state and the loop code, which does not update `i`), the loop essentially checks each column of the `pixels` 2D list from top to bottom but only updates the top row (`i = 0`).

- If a pixel at position `[0][j]` is '.' and it's on the border (meaning `j` equals `min_y` or `j` equals `max_y`), it will be set to '+'.

- If a pixel at position `[0][j]` is 'w', the loop will skip it, leaving it as 'w'.

- If a pixel is not 'w' and not on the border, it will remain '.'.

Since `i` is fixed at 0, the loop does not explore rows beyond the first one (`i = 0`). The values of `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, and `max_y` determine which pixels are considered on the border, but the loop only updates the top row of `pixels`.

After all iterations, `j` will have iterated over all columns of the `pixels` 2D list. 

The `white_pixels` list, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` remain unchanged by the loop as there's no code within the loop to update these variables based on the conditions or operations performed.

Thus, considering the loop code and the provided output states:

- `n` remains an integer with `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`.
- `m` remains an integer with `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000` and must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.
- `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where each element is either "." or "w" or '+', with the top row potentially updated based on border conditions.
- `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels`, unchanged by the loop.
- `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are the smallest and largest x and y coordinates in `white_pixels` if it's not empty, otherwise `float('inf')` and `float('-inf')`, respectively. These remain unchanged.
- `frame_size` equals `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`, remains less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, and is unchanged by the loop.

Output State: **`n` is an integer with `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`, `m` is an integer with `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000` and `m > 0`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where the first row has been updated according to border conditions, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels`, `min_x` and `max_x` are the smallest and largest x-coordinates in `white_pixels`, `min_y` and `max_y` are the smallest and largest y-coordinates in `white_pixels`, `frame_size` equals `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1` and is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`.**
