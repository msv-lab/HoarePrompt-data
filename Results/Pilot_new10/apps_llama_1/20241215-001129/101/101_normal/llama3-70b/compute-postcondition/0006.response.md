The code updates the values of `max_x` and `max_y` by comparing their current values with `x` and `y` and assigning the maximum values to `max_x` and `max_y`. 

The initial values of `max_x` and `max_y` are `float('-inf')`, which is negative infinity, so `x` and `y` will be greater than these initial values.

The values of `n`, `m`, `pixels`, `white_pixels`, `min_x`, and `min_y` are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers with `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where each element is either "." or "w", `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels` that must have at least 1 coordinate, `min_x` is `x`, `min_y` is `y`, `max_x` is `x`, `max_y` is `y`, `x` and `y` are the first coordinates in the `white_pixels` list**
