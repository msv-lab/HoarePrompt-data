According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `white_pixels` list. If the list has at least 3 coordinates, the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `white_pixels` has at least 2 coordinates, `min_x` is the minimum of the initial `x` and the x-coordinate of the second 'w' pixel, `min_y` is the minimum of the initial `y` and the y-coordinate of the second 'w' pixel, `max_x` is `x`, `max_y` is `y`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 3 coordinates. The `min_x` should be the minimum of the current `min_x` and the x-coordinate of the third 'w' pixel, and `min_y` should be the minimum of the current `min_y` and the y-coordinate of the third 'w' pixel. The `max_x` should be updated to the x-coordinate of the third 'w' pixel if it is greater than the current `max_x`, and `max_y` should be updated to the y-coordinate of the third 'w' pixel if it is greater than the current `max_y`.

However, considering the loop iterates over the `white_pixels` list and the current state is at the end of the previous iteration, the next iteration should start with the next coordinate in the `white_pixels` list, which is the third 'w' pixel.

State: **`n` and `m` are integers with `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where each element is either "." or "w", `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels` that must have at least 3 coordinates, `min_x` is the minimum of the current `min_x` and the x-coordinate of the third 'w' pixel, `min_y` is the minimum of the current `min_y` and the y-coordinate of the third 'w' pixel, `max_x` is the maximum of the current `max_x` and the x-coordinate of the third 'w' pixel, `max_y` is the maximum of the current `max_y` and the y-coordinate of the third 'w' pixel, `x` is the x-coordinate of the third 'w' pixel, `y` is the y-coordinate of the third 'w' pixel**
