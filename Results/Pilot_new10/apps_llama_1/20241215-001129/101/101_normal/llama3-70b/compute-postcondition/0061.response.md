The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. 

In this case, the `continue` statement will cause the loop to move on to the next iteration, skipping any remaining code inside the loop.

Therefore, the values of the variables do not change. 

The states of `n`, `m`, `pixels`, `white_pixels`, `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, `max_y`, `frame_size`, `i`, and `j` remain the same.

The loop continues to the next iteration.

Output State: **`n` is an integer with `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`, `m` is an integer with `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000` and `m > 2`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where the first row has been updated according to border conditions, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels`, `min_x` and `max_x` are the smallest and largest x-coordinates in `white_pixels`, `min_y` and `max_y` are the smallest and largest y-coordinates in `white_pixels`, `frame_size` equals `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1` and is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` is the next integer, `j` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
