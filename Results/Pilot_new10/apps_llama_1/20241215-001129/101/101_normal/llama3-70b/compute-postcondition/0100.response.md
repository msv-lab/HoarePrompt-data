The function `func` reads the resolution of a monitor and its pixel data from the input, where each pixel is either black (represented by ".") or white (represented by "w"). It identifies the bounding box of the white pixels and checks if the size of this box exceeds the maximum dimension of the monitor. If the box size is too large, it prints -1. Otherwise, it modifies the pixel data to draw a frame around the bounding box of the white pixels using "+" characters for the frame and leaves the white pixels as "w", while all other pixels are set to black ("."). Finally, it prints the modified pixel data to the console. The function assumes that there is at least one white pixel in the input data.

Functionality: ** The function reads monitor resolution and pixel data, identifies the bounding box of white pixels, and if the box size is within the monitor's dimensions, it prints the modified pixel data with a frame around the white pixels; otherwise, it prints -1. **
