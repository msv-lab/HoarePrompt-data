According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `m` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. 

State: **`n` is an integer with `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`, `m` is an integer with `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000` and `m > 1`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where the first row has been updated according to border conditions, if ((`i` equals `min_x` or `i` equals `max_x` or `j` equals `min_y` or `j` equals `max_y`) and `pixels[i][j]` equals '.'), then `pixels[i][j]` is '+', `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels`, `min_x` and `max_x` are the smallest and largest x-coordinates in `white_pixels`, `min_y` and `max_y` are the smallest and largest y-coordinates in `white_pixels`, `frame_size` equals `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1` and is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` is the next integer, `j` is 1**
