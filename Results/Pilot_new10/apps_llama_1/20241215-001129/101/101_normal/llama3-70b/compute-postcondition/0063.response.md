Postcondition: **`n` is an integer with `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`, `m` is an integer with `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000` and `m > 2`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where if `pixels[i][j]` equals 'w', we continue to the next iteration of the loop, otherwise `pixels[i][j]` equals `'.'`, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels`, `min_x` and `max_x` are the smallest and largest x-coordinates in `white_pixels`, `min_y` and `max_y` are the smallest and largest y-coordinates in `white_pixels`, `frame_size` equals `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1` and is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` is the next integer, `j` is 2, and the border conditions have been applied if `pixels[i][j]` was not 'w'.**
