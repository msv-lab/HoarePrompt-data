According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `m` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `j` is `m-1`, which means the loop has not started yet, so `j` should be 0 for the loop to start executing. The loop will iterate over the range of `m`, so `j` will take values from 0 to `m-1`. 

The given conditions, `n` is an integer with `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000` and `n > i + 1`, `m` is an integer with `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000` and `m > 0`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m`, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels`, `min_x` and `max_x` are the smallest and largest x-coordinates in `white_pixels`, `min_y` and `max_y` are the smallest and largest y-coordinates in `white_pixels`, `frame_size` equals `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1` and is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` is the next integer after the loop's execution context plus one, are all conditions that must hold true before the loop starts. 

However, for the loop to execute, only `m` must be greater than 0 and `j` must be 0. The other conditions do not affect the execution of the loop directly.

State: **`n` is an integer with `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000` and `n > i + 1`, `m` is an integer with `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000` and `m > 0`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where if a cell is on the border defined by `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, and `min_y` and its original value is `'.'`, then its value is `'+'`, otherwise if its value is `'w'`, it remains `'w'`, and all other cells are `'.'`, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels`, `min_x` and `max_x` are the smallest and largest x-coordinates in `white_pixels`, `min_y` and `max_y` are the smallest and largest y-coordinates in `white_pixels`, `frame_size` equals `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1` and is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` is the next integer after the loop's execution context plus one, `j` is 0**
