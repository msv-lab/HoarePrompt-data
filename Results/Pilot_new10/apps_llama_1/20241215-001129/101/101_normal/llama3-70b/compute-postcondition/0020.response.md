Postcondition: **`n` is an integer with `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`, `m` is an integer with `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000` and `m` must be greater than 0, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where each element is either "." or "w", `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels`, the current value of `min_x` is the smallest x-coordinate in `white_pixels` if it is not empty, otherwise `float('inf')`, the current value of `min_y` is the smallest y-coordinate in `white_pixels` if it is not empty, otherwise `float('inf')`, the current value of `max_x` is the largest x-coordinate in `white_pixels` if it is not empty, otherwise `float('-inf')`, the current value of `max_y` is the largest y-coordinate in `white_pixels` if it is not empty, otherwise `float('-inf')`, `frame_size` is equal to `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and (`i` is equal to the current value of `min_x` or `i` is equal to the current value of `max_x` or `j` is equal to the current value of `min_y` or `j` is equal to the current value of `max_y`) and the current value of `pixels` at position `[i][j]` is "."**
