To determine the output state after all the iterations of the loop have finished, let's break down the information provided and analyze the loop's behavior.

1. **Loop Conditions and Updates**: The loop iterates over each column `j` in the 2D list `pixels` of size `n x m`. For each cell `pixels[i][j]`, it checks two conditions:
   - If the cell is on the border defined by `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, and `max_y` and its value is `'.'`, it updates the cell's value to `'+'`.
   - If the cell's value is `'w'`, it skips to the next iteration.
   - Otherwise, it sets the cell's value to `'.'`.

2. **Variables' Behavior**:
   - `n` and `m` are constants within the scope of this loop, defining the size of the `pixels` 2D list.
   - `pixels` is updated based on the loop's conditions. Cells that are on the defined borders and have a value of `'.'` are changed to `'+'`. All other cells (except those with `'w'`) are set to `'.'`.
   - `white_pixels`, `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` do not change within the loop. They are used to define the borders and conditions for updating `pixels`.
   - `i` is the row index, which is not explicitly incremented in the provided loop code. It seems to be an external variable that might represent the current row being processed, but its exact behavior depends on the broader context not shown here.
   - `j` iterates over each column in the `pixels` 2D list, from `0` to `m-1`.

3. **Output State Determination**:
   - After all iterations, `pixels` will have been updated according to the border conditions for each cell. Cells on the borders (as defined by `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, and `max_y`) with an original value of `'.'` will be `'+'`, cells with `'w'` will remain `'w'`, and all other cells will be `'.'`.
   - The values of `white_pixels`, `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` will remain unchanged as they are not updated within the loop.
   - The value of `i` will depend on its initial value and how it's updated outside the provided loop code. If it's intended to process each row, it would be incremented outside the loop shown.
   - The loop will execute `m` times, as it iterates over each column. Thus, `j` will end at `m-1` after the loop finishes.

4. **Special Conditions**:
   - If `m` is `0`, the loop will not execute at all. In this case, the state of `pixels` and other variables will remain unchanged.
   - The loop's behavior does not depend on the initial values of cells in `pixels` except for the border conditions and the presence of `'w'` values.

Based on this analysis, the output state after all iterations of the loop can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an integer with `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`, `m` is an integer with `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000` and `m > 0`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where if a cell is on the border defined by `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, and `min_y` and its original value is `'.'`, then its value is `'+'`, otherwise if its value is `'w'`, it remains `'w'`, and all other cells are `'.'`, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels`, `min_x` and `max_x` are the smallest and largest x-coordinates in `white_pixels`, `min_y` and `max_y` are the smallest and largest y-coordinates in `white_pixels`, `frame_size` equals `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1` and is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` is the next integer after the loop's execution context, `j` is `m-1`.**
