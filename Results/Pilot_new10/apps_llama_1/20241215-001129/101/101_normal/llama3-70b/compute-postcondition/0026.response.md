The code assigns `'.'` to `pixels[i][j]`. This assignment does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `white_pixels`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, `frame_size`, or `i` and `j` themselves, but it does change the value of the pixel at position `(i, j)` in the `pixels` 2D list.

Given that `pixels[i][j]` was not equal to `'w'` before the assignment (as it was equal to `'.'`), this assignment does not change the fact that `pixels[i][j]` is not `'w'`. However, since `pixels[i][j]` was already `'.'` and the assignment sets it to `'.'`, the state of `pixels[i][j]` itself does not actually change due to this assignment. 

The value of `i` is 0 and the value of `j` is 0. 

The output state after the execution of the code remains: 
- `n` is an integer with `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`, 
- `m` is an integer with `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000` and `m` must be greater than 0, 
- `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where each element is either "." or "w" and `pixels[0][0]` equals `'.'`, 
- `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels`, 
- `min_x` is the smallest x-coordinate in `white_pixels` if it is not empty, otherwise `float('inf')`, 
- `min_y` is the smallest y-coordinate in `white_pixels` if it is not empty, otherwise `float('inf')`, 
- `max_x` is the largest x-coordinate in `white_pixels` if it is not empty, otherwise `float('-inf')`, 
- `max_y` is the largest y-coordinate in `white_pixels` if it is not empty, otherwise `float('-inf')`, 
- `frame_size` is equal to `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`, 
- `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, 
- `i` is 0, 
- `j` is 0, and 
- it is the case that (`i` is not equal to `min_x` or `i` is not equal to `max_x` or `j` is not equal to `min_y` or `j` is not equal to `max_y`) because `pixels[i][j]` equals `'.'`.
