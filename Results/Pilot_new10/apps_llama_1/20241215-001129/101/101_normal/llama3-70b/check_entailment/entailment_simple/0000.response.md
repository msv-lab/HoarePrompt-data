Correctness: **False**

The program does not always meet the requirements specified in the problem description. The issue lies in the way it determines the position and size of the square frame.

According to the problem description, the frame should be a square with the smallest size possible, such that all white pixels are on the frame, and the frame does not go beyond the borders of the screen. However, the program simply calculates the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of the white pixels and uses these to draw the frame.

This approach does not guarantee that the frame is a square or that it has the smallest size possible. For example, if the white pixels form a diagonal line, the program will draw a rectangle instead of a square.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to find the smallest square that can enclose all the white pixels, while also ensuring that the frame does not go beyond the borders of the screen. This can be achieved by checking all possible square sizes and positions, and selecting the smallest one that meets the requirements.

Here is an example of a case where the program does not follow the problem description:

Input:
```
4 4
.....
.w..
..w.
.....
```
In this case, the program will output:
```
.....
+w..
..w.
.....
```
However, the correct output should be:
```
+w..
+w..
+w..
+w..
```
This is because the smallest square that can enclose all the white pixels is a 2x2 square, and the program should draw the frame accordingly.
