Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not consider all possible pairs of integers (a, b) where a and b are within the given range [l, r]. The program only considers pairs where a <= b, which means it misses pairs where b < a.

For example, if we input l = 1, r = 2, x = 1, y = 2, the program will only consider the pair (1, 2) and not the pair (2, 1), which is also a valid pair according to the problem description. This is because the program only loops over b in the range from a to r, not from l to r.

To fix this issue, the program should loop over b in the range from l to r, regardless of the value of a. This can be achieved by changing the inner loop to `for b in range(l, r + 1):`. This will ensure that all possible pairs of integers (a, b) are considered, and the program will produce the correct output for all inputs. 

Here is the corrected code:
```python
(l, r, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
count = 0
for a in range(l, r + 1):
    for b in range(l, r + 1):
        if func_1(a, b) == x and func_2(a, b) == y:
            count += 1
print(count)

def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)
```
