You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Today on Informatics class Nastya learned about GCD and LCM (see links below). Nastya is very intelligent, so she solved all the tasks momentarily and now suggests you to solve one of them as well.

We define a pair of integers (a, b) good, if GCD(a, b) = x and LCM(a, b) = y, where GCD(a, b) denotes the greatest common divisor of a and b, and LCM(a, b) denotes the least common multiple of a and b.

You are given two integers x and y. You are to find the number of good pairs of integers (a, b) such that l ≤ a, b ≤ r. Note that pairs (a, b) and (b, a) are considered different if a ≠ b.


-----Input-----

The only line contains four integers l, r, x, y (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

In the only line print the only integer — the answer for the problem.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 2 1 2

Output
2

Input
1 12 1 12

Output
4

Input
50 100 3 30

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example there are two suitable good pairs of integers (a, b): (1, 2) and (2, 1).

In the second example there are four suitable good pairs of integers (a, b): (1, 12), (12, 1), (3, 4) and (4, 3).

In the third example there are good pairs of integers, for example, (3, 30), but none of them fits the condition l ≤ a, b ≤ r.
Program:
```
import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    (l, r, x, y) = map(int, input().strip().split())
    print(func_1(l, r, x, y))

def func_1(l, r, x, y):
    if y % x != 0:
        return 0
    z = y // x
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(z)) + 1):
        if z % i == 0:
            a = i * x
            b = z // i * x
            if l <= a <= r and l <= b <= r and (math.gcd(a, b) == x) and (a * b // math.gcd(a, b) == y):
                if a == b:
                    count += 1
                else:
                    count += 2
    return count


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

I think the code is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. The program correctly counts the number of good pairs of integers (a, b) that satisfy the conditions l ≤ a, b ≤ r, GCD(a, b) = x, and LCM(a, b) = y.

Here's a breakdown of why the code is correct:

1. The code first checks if y is a multiple of x using the condition `y % x!= 0`. If y is not a multiple of x, it immediately returns 0, which is correct because the GCD of a and b cannot be x in this case.

2. The code then calculates z = y // x, which represents the factor that a and b must have in common to satisfy the LCM condition.

3. The code then iterates over all possible divisors of z, which correspond to the possible values of a and b. For each divisor i, it calculates the corresponding values of a and b as a = i * x and b = z // i * x.

4. The code checks if a and b satisfy the conditions l ≤ a ≤ r and l ≤ b ≤ r, and also checks if GCD(a, b) = x and LCM(a, b) = y using the formulas for GCD and LCM.

5. If a and b satisfy all the conditions, the code increments the count by 1 if a = b, and by 2 otherwise (to account for the pair (b, a)).

I have reviewed the code and could not find any potential cases where the program does not work as expected. The code correctly handles the boundary cases and the conditions specified in the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the code is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts integers `l`, `r`, `x`, and `y` and returns 0 if `y` is not divisible by `x`, or the total count of pairs `(a, b)` within the range `[l, r]` where `a = i * x`, `b = z // i * x` (where `z = y // x`), `math.gcd(a, b) == x`, and `a * b // math.gcd(a, b) == y`, with each pair contributing 1 to the count if `a == b` and 2 if `a!= b`. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
