The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `l`, `r`, `x`, and `y`, which are integers. The parameters are constrained such that `1 <= l <= r <= 10^9` and `1 <= x <= y <= 10^9`. After executing the function body, the function returns a value based on two cases: 
Case_1: The program returns 0.
Case_2: The program returns the total count of pairs (a, b) where a and b are within the range [l, r], a = i * x, b = z // i * x, math.gcd(a, b) == x, and a * b // math.gcd(a, b) == y, with each pair contributing 1 to count if a == b and 2 if a!= b.
Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept integers l, r, x, and y within the specified constraints, and return either 0 or the total count of pairs (a, b) based on the given conditions.
