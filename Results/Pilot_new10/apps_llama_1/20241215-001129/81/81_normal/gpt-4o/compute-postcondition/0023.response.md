Postcondition: ***`l`, `r`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that `1 <= l <= r <= 10^9` and `1 <= x <= y <= 10^9`, `y` is divisible by `x`, `z = y / x` and is at least 4, `i` is 2, `a = 2 * x`, and `b = y // 2`. If `l <= a <= r` and `l <= b <= r` and `math.gcd(a, b) == x` and `a * b // math.gcd(a, b) == y`, then if `a` equals `b`, `count` is increased by 1, otherwise `count` is increased by 2.***
