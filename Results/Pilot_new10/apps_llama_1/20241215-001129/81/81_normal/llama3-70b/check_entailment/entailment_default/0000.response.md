Correctness: **False**.

The problem is with the line `for b in range(a, r + 1):` in the code. This line only checks for pairs where `a <= b`, but the problem statement considers pairs `(a, b)` and `(b, a)` as different if `a!= b`. This means that the code is missing pairs where `b < a`. 

For example, when `l = 1`, `r = 2`, `x = 1`, and `y = 2`, the code will only check pairs `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`, but it will miss the pair `(2, 1)`, which is also a valid pair according to the problem statement.

To fix this issue, the code should be modified to also check for pairs where `b < a`. The correct code should be:
```python
(l, r, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
count = 0
for a in range(l, r + 1):
    for b in range(l, r + 1):
        if func_1(a, b) == x and func_2(a, b) == y:
            count += 1
print(count)
```
With this modification, the code will correctly count all valid pairs `(a, b)` regardless of whether `a <= b` or `b < a`.
