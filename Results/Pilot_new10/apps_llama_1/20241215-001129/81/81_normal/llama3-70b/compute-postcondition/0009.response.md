The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`. According to the code, it uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. The while loop continues until `b` becomes 0, at which point `a` is the GCD of the original `a` and `b`. 

However, the annotations and return postconditions seem to be incorrect or misleading, as they mention the GCD of `a` and 0, which is essentially the absolute value of `a`. But the code actually calculates the GCD of the original `a` and `b`, not `a` and 0. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function is to calculate and return the greatest common divisor of the two input integers `a` and `b`.

Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns their greatest common divisor **
