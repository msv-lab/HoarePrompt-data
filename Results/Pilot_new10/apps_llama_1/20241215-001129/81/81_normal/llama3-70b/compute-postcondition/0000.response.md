To determine the output state, we need to understand the given code and initial state. The initial state tells us that `a` and `b` are positive integers. The code snippet provided is:

```python
return a * b // func_1(a, b)
```

However, the definition or implementation of `func_1(a, b)` is not provided. Without knowing what `func_1(a, b)` does, we can only describe the operation in general terms.

The operation `a * b` multiplies the two positive integers `a` and `b`, resulting in their product. The `//` operator then performs integer division of this product by the result of `func_1(a, b)`. 

Since `a` and `b` are positive integers, their product `a * b` is also a positive integer. The result of `func_1(a, b)` must also be a positive integer for the division to be valid (since the problem does not specify what happens if `func_1(a, b)` returns zero, which would cause a division error, or a non-integer value).

Given that we do not have the definition of `func_1(a, b)`, we cannot calculate the exact result of the division. Therefore, we can only describe the return value in terms of the variables and operations involved.

Output State: **The program returns the integer result of the product of positive integers `a` and `b` divided by the result of `func_1(a, b)`**
