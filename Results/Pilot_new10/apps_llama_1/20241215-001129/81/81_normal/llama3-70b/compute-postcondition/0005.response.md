To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given code and its impact on the variables `a` and `b`.

Initially, `a` is the original value of `b`, and `b` is a non-zero remainder of the original `a` divided by the original `b`. This implies that `b` is the result of `a % b` before the code execution, but since `a` is now the original value of `b`, we can say `a` is the original `b` and `b` is the remainder of the original `a` (which is now `a`) divided by the original `b` (which is now `a`).

Given the code:
```python
a, b = b, a % b
```

This code simultaneously updates the values of `a` and `b`. The new value of `a` becomes the old value of `b`, and the new value of `b` becomes the remainder of the old `a` divided by the old `b`.

Since `a` is now the original value of `b`, and `b` is a non-zero remainder of the original `a` divided by the original `b`, after executing the code:

- The new `a` takes the value of the old `b`, which is the remainder of the original `a` divided by the original `b`.
- The new `b` becomes the remainder of the old `a` (which was the original `b`) divided by the old `b` (which is the remainder of the original `a` divided by the original `b`).

Thus, the new `b` is essentially the remainder of the original `b` divided by the remainder of the original `a` divided by the original `b`.

Given that `a` and `b` are integers, and `b` is a non-zero remainder, the process described is essentially a step in the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.

Output State: **`a` is the original remainder of `a` divided by `b`, and `b` is the remainder of the original `b` divided by the original remainder of `a` divided by `b`.**
