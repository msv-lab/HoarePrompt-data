Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not consider the case where `a` and `b` are different and also does not account for pairs `(b, a)` when `a` is not equal to `b`. The problem statement explicitly states that pairs `(a, b)` and `(b, a)` are considered different if `a` is not equal to `b`.

In the given program, the inner loop starts from `a` instead of `l`, which means it only considers pairs where `b` is greater than or equal to `a`. This is incorrect because it should consider all pairs `(a, b)` where `l <= a, b <= r`.

To fix this, the inner loop should start from `l` instead of `a`, and the condition should be checked for both `(a, b)` and `(b, a)`.

Additionally, it's worth noting that the program can be optimized by using mathematical properties of GCD and LCM to reduce the number of iterations. But the main issue here is with the loop iteration and not considering both pairs `(a, b)` and `(b, a)`. 

Here is a simple example where the program does not work as expected: 

For the input `1 2 1 2`, the program will output `1` instead of `2`, because it does not consider the pair `(2, 1)`. 

However, it's easy to fix by changing the loop to consider both pairs:

```python
(l, r, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
count = 0
for a in range(l, r + 1):
    for b in range(l, r + 1):
        if func_1(a, b) == x and func_2(a, b) == y:
            count += 1
```
