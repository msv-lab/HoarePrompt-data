To determine the output state of the loop, let's analyze the loop's condition and the changes made to the variables within the loop.

The loop continues as long as `(n + 1) % 10 == 0`, meaning the last digit of `n + 1` must be 0, which implies the last digit of `n` must be 9. In each iteration, `max_9s` is incremented by 1 (to count the number of trailing 9s found), and `n` is divided by 10 (effectively removing its last digit).

Given the output states after the loop executes a few times:

- After 1 time: `n` loses its last digit (which was 9), and `max_9s` is 1.
- After 2 times: `n` loses its last two digits (both being 9), and `max_9s` is 2.
- After 3 times: `n` loses its last three digits (all being 9), and `max_9s` is 3.

From this pattern, it's clear that the loop continues to remove the last digit of `n` as long as it's 9 and increments `max_9s` each time it does so. The loop stops when it encounters a digit other than 9 at the end of `n`.

Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have executed:

- `max_9s` will hold the count of consecutive 9s found at the end of the original `n`.
- `n` will be the original `n` with all trailing 9s removed.

Since the loop's condition is `(n + 1) % 10 == 0`, which checks for a trailing 0 in `n + 1` (hence a trailing 9 in `n`), once `n` no longer ends with a 9, the loop will stop. 

Given that `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, the loop will stop when it encounters a digit other than 9 at the end of `n`, or if `n` becomes 0 (in the case where `n` was originally a number made entirely of 9s, e.g., 9, 99, 999, etc.).

Output State: **`n` is the original `n` with all trailing 9s removed, `max_9s` is the number of trailing 9s in the original `n`.**
