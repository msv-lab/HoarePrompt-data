Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly calculate the number of pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with the maximum possible number of nines.

The program's logic is flawed because it assumes that the number of pairs is directly related to the number of trailing 9s in `n`. However, the problem description states that the goal is to find pairs of shovels whose total cost ends with the maximum possible number of nines, not the number of trailing 9s in `n`.

For example, consider the case where `n = 7`. The program would calculate `max_9s` as 0, because `n` does not end with a 9. Then, it would print `(n + 1) * max_9s = (7 + 1) * 0 = 0`, which is incorrect. The correct answer for `n = 7` is 3, because there are three pairs of shovels whose total cost ends with one 9: (2, 7), (3, 6), and (4, 5).

Another issue with the program is that it does not consider the actual costs of the shovels, which are `i` burles for the `i`-th shovel. The program only considers the value of `n`, which is the number of shovels.

To correctly solve the problem, a different approach is needed, such as iterating over all possible pairs of shovels and calculating their total cost, or using a mathematical formula to determine the maximum possible number of nines at the end of the total cost.

Here is an example of a correct solution:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    max_9s = 0
    max_pairs = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            total_cost = i + j
            count_9s = 0
            while total_cost % 10 == 9:
                count_9s += 1
                total_cost //= 10
            if count_9s > max_9s:
                max_9s = count_9s
                max_pairs = 1
            elif count_9s == max_9s:
                max_pairs += 1
    print(max_pairs)
```
This solution correctly calculates the number of pairs of shovels whose total cost ends with the maximum possible number of nines.
