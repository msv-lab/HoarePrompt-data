The code snippet provided, `n = int(input())`, assigns the value of the input converted to an integer to the variable `n`. 

In the initial state, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of shovels in Polycarp's shop, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. However, after executing the given code, the value of `n` is updated to the integer value obtained from the input.

Therefore, `n` is now an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer**
