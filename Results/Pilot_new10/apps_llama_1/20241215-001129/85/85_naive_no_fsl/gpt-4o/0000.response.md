Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not work as expected for all cases. It incorrectly assumes that the maximum number of 9s at the end of the total cost of two shovels is determined by the number of trailing zeros in `n + 1`. However, this approach does not consider all possible pairs of shovels.

For example, when `n = 10`, the program will output `0`, but the correct answer is `1` because the pair `(5, 5)` has a total cost of `10`, which ends with one `0`, but we should consider the number of `9`s, and in this case, there is no pair with a total cost that ends with one `9`. However, when `n = 10`, the pair `(9, 1)` and `(8, 2)`, `(7, 3)`, `(6, 4)`, `(5, 5)` are all valid pairs where the sum of costs can end with `0` which is the maximum number of nines for `n = 10` that can be obtained.

However, let's take another example, for `n = 8`, the maximum possible number of nines at the end is one, the pairs are `(1, 8)` and `(2, 7)` and `(3, 6)` and `(4, 5)`. For `n = 8`, `(n + 1)` is `9`, the program will calculate `max_9s` as `1`, and `pairs` as `9 * 1 = 9` which is incorrect.

Another example would be `n = 100`, the program will output `0`, but the correct answer should consider all pairs that result in the total cost ending with the maximum number of nines, which for `n = 100` would be pairs like `(50, 50)` and other similar pairs.

The correct approach should involve iterating over all pairs of shovels and finding the maximum number of 9s that can be obtained at the end of their total cost. The code provided does not achieve this.

The issue in this program arises from the incorrect assumption that `(n + 1)` can directly determine the maximum number of `9`s, which is not true in all cases. A correct solution would involve iterating over all pairs of numbers and calculating the total cost to find the maximum number of trailing `9`s. 

In conclusion, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated, and thus its correctness is **False**.
