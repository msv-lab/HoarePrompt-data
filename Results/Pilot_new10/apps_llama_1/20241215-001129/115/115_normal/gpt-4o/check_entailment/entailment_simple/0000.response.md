Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly follow the problem description. It attempts to find a sequence of operations to make matrix `B` equal to matrix `A` by iterating over all 2x2 sub-matrices of `A` and checking if all elements are 1. If they are, it sets the corresponding elements of `B` to 1 and adds the operation to the list of operations.

However, this approach has several issues:

1. It does not handle the case where a 1 in `A` is not part of a 2x2 sub-matrix with all elements equal to 1. In this case, it should return -1, but it does not.
2. It does not check if the operations it finds are actually valid. It assumes that setting a 2x2 sub-matrix of `B` to 1 will not affect any other elements of `B` that have already been set to 1, which is not necessarily true.
3. It does not optimize the sequence of operations. It simply finds all 2x2 sub-matrices with all elements equal to 1 and adds them to the list of operations, without considering whether some of these operations could be combined or removed.

To correctly follow the problem description, the program should:

1. Check if each 1 in `A` is part of a 2x2 sub-matrix with all elements equal to 1. If it is not, return -1.
2. Find a sequence of valid operations that sets all elements of `B` to 1 where the corresponding element of `A` is 1.
3. Optimize the sequence of operations to minimize the number of operations.

Here is an example of a case where the program does not follow the problem description:
```
Input:
3 3
1 0 1
1 0 1
0 0 0

Output:
-1 (correct)
```
However, the program does not correctly handle this case. It will simply return -1 without checking if the operations it found are actually valid.

```
Input:
3 3
1 1 0
1 1 0
0 0 0

Output:
1
1 1
```
However, the program does not correctly handle this case. It will find a sequence of operations that sets the first 2x2 sub-matrix of `B` to 1, but it does not check if this operation is actually valid. The correct output should be -1, because there is no way to make `B` equal to `A` using only 2x2 sub-matrix operations.
