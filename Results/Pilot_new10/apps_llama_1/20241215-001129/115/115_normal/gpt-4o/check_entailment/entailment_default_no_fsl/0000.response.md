Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle all potential cases correctly. The problem description states that the goal is to make matrix B equal to matrix A by performing operations on 2x2 submatrices of B. However, the code only checks for 2x2 submatrices in A where all four elements are 1, and performs an operation on B if such a submatrix is found.

The issue with this approach is that it does not consider cases where a 2x2 submatrix in A has only one, two, or three elements that are 1. In such cases, the code does not perform any operations, even if an operation would be necessary to make B equal to A.

For example, consider the input:
```
3 3
1 0 1
1 1 1
0 1 1
```
In this case, the code will not perform any operations on the 2x2 submatrix at position (0,0) because not all four elements are 1. However, an operation should be performed on this submatrix to make B equal to A.

Therefore, the code does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases, and its correctness is **False**.
