Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not fully address the problem description for every potential case. 

The problem description asks to make matrix B equal to matrix A by performing operations on 2x2 submatrices of B. However, the provided code only checks for 2x2 submatrices in A where all four elements are 1, and if so, it sets the corresponding submatrix in B to 1 and adds the operation to the list. This approach does not consider cases where a single element in A is 1 but is part of two different 2x2 submatrices.

For example, if A is:

```
1 0
0 1
```

The program will not be able to make B equal to A because it only checks for 2x2 submatrices with all four elements as 1. In this case, no such submatrix exists, so the program will not perform any operations and will incorrectly return that it is impossible to transform B into A.

Another issue is that the code does not handle the case when there are two adjacent 1s in the same row or column but not in a 2x2 submatrix with all four elements as 1. The code will not perform the necessary operations to transform B into A in these cases.

The code also lacks a mechanism to handle cases where a 1 in A is part of two overlapping 2x2 submatrices. In such cases, the code may not perform the necessary operations to transform B into A.

The provided code only checks for a very specific condition (all four elements of a 2x2 submatrix being 1) and does not attempt to find a more general solution that could handle all possible cases. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential case. 

This means that while the code may work for some specific examples, it is not a general solution and will fail for other cases, leading to the conclusion that the Correctness is **False**.
