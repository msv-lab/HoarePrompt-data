The code `operations.append((i + 1, j + 1))` appends a new tuple to the `operations` list. Given that `i` is 1 and `j` is 0, the new tuple will be `(1 + 1, 0 + 1)` which equals `(2, 1)`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `A[1][0]` equals 1, `A[1][1]` equals 1, `A[2][0]` equals 1, and `A[2][1]` equals 1, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[0][j]`, `B[0][j+1]`, `B[1][j]`, and `B[1][j+1]` are 1 for all `j` where `A[0][j]` equals 1 and `A[0][j+1]` equals 1 and `A[1][j]` equals 1 and `A[1][j+1]` equals 1, and specifically `B[1][0]` equals 1, `B[1][1]` equals 1, `B[2][0]` equals 1, and `B[2][1]` equals 1, `operations` is a list containing tuples `(1, j+1)` for each such `j` and also contains the tuple `(2, 1)`, `i` is 1, `j` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `A[1][0]` equals 1, `A[1][1]` equals 1, `A[2][0]` equals 1, and `A[2][1]` equals 1, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[0][j]`, `B[0][j+1]`, `B[1][j]`, and `B[1][j+1]` are 1 for all `j` where `A[0][j]` equals 1 and `A[0][j+1]` equals 1 and `A[1][j]` equals 1 and `A[1][j+1]` equals 1, and specifically `B[1][0]` equals 1, `B[1][1]` equals 1, `B[2][0]` equals 1, and `B[2][1]` equals 1, `operations` is a list containing tuples `(1, j+1)` for each such `j` and also contains the tuple `(2, 1)`, `i` is 1, `j` is 0**
