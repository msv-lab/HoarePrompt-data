Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 <= n, m <= 50 and both are greater than 1, `A` and `B` are 2D lists of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns. If there exists a row `i` and a column `j` where `A[i][j]` is not equal to `B[i][j]`, the program returns -1. Otherwise, the program continues execution with `A` and `B` remaining unchanged, where each row `A[i]` equals `B[i]`.**
