According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 1. The loop will execute again if `j` (which is now 1) is less than `m`, so `m` must be greater than 1. Since `m` is already greater than or equal to 2, the state of `m` does not need to change. The other variables do not affect this loop, so their states remain the same. 
State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `operations` is a list containing tuples, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, and either the program has returned -1 (in which case `A` and `B`'s states are unchanged), or `A[1]` is equal to `B[1]`. Additionally, `A[2][1]` is equal to `B[2][1]`.**
