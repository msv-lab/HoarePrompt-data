To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial conditions step by step.

1. `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50.
2. `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50.
3. `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each integer is either 0 or 1.
4. `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where all integers are 0.
5. `operations` is an empty list.
6. `i` is 0.
7. `j` is 0.
8. The current values of `i` and `j` are such that `i` is less than `n-1` and `j` is less than `m-1`.
9. The current value of `A[i][j]` is 1, the current value of `A[i][j + 1]` is 1, the current value of `A[i + 1][j]` is 1, and the current value of `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1.

Given the code:
```python
B[i][j] = B[i][j + 1] = B[i + 1][j] = B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1
```
This code assigns the value 1 to the elements of `B` at positions `[i][j]`, `[i][j + 1]`, `[i + 1][j]`, and `[i + 1][j + 1]`.

After executing this code:

- The values of `n`, `m`, `A`, `operations`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged because the code does not modify them.
- The values of `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are updated to 1.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50.
- `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50.
- `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each integer is either 0 or 1, and specifically `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are 1.
- `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, where `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are 1, and all other elements are 0 (as initially stated).
- `operations` is an empty list.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are 1, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are 1, `operations` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
