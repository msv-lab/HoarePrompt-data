Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[0][j]`, `B[0][j+1]`, `B[1][j]`, and `B[1][j+1]` are 1 for all `j` where `A[0][j]` equals 1 and `A[0][j+1]` equals 1 and `A[1][j]` equals 1 and `A[1][j+1]` equals 1, and for `i` = 1, `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j+1]`, `B[i+1][j]`, and `B[i+1][j+1]` are 1 for all `j` where `A[i][j]` equals 1, `A[i][j+1]` equals 1, `A[i+1][j]` equals 1, and `A[i+1][j+1]` equals 1, `operations` is a list containing tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for each such `j`, if `A[i][j]` equals 1, `A[i][j + 1]` equals 1, `A[i + 1][j]` equals 1, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` equals 1, then `B[i][j]` equals 1, `B[i][j+1]` equals 1, `B[i+1][j]` equals 1, `B[i+1][j+1]` equals 1 and `(i + 1, j + 1)` is in `operations`, `i` is 2, `j` is 0**
