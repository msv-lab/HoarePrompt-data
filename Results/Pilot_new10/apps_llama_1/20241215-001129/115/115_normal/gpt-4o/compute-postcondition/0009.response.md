The values of `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are updated to 1. Given that `i` is 0 and `j` is 1, this means `B[0][1]`, `B[0][2]`, `B[1][1]`, and `B[1][2]` are set to 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 50 and m is at least 3, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[0][1]`, `B[0][2]`, `B[1][1]`, and `B[1][2]` are 1, `operations` is a list, `i` is 0, `j` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 50 and m is at least 3, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[0][1]`, `B[0][2]`, `B[1][1]`, and `B[1][2]` are 1, `operations` is a list, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
