The program returns -1, which means that the states of `A` and `B` remain unchanged. The value of `n` is between 3 and 50 (inclusive), the value of `m` is between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `A` and `B` are 2D lists with `n` rows and `m` columns, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and `A[i][j]` is not equal to `B[i][j]`.
Output State: **The program returns -1, `A` and `B`'s states are unchanged, `n` is an integer between 3 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` and `B` are 2D lists with `n` rows and `m` columns, `i` is 2, `j` is 0**
