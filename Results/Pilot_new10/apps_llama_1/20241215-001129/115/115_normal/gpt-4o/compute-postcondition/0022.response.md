Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[0][j]`, `B[0][j+1]`, `B[1][j]`, and `B[1][j+1]` are 1 for all `j` where `A[0][j]` equals 1 and `A[0][j+1]` equals 1 and `A[1][j]` equals 1 and `A[1][j+1]` equals 1. If `A[1][0]` equals 1, `A[1][1]` equals 1, `A[2][0]` equals 1, and `A[2][1]` equals 1, then `B[1][0]` equals 1, `B[1][1]` equals 1, `B[2][0]` equals 1, and `B[2][1]` equals 1, and `operations` contains the tuple `(2, 1)`. `i` is 1, `j` is 0.***
