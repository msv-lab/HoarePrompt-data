To determine the output state, let's analyze the given Python code snippet and the initial state.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50
- `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 50
- `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns
- `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[0][1]`, `B[0][2]`, `B[0][3]`, `B[1][1]`, `B[1][2]`, and `B[1][3]` are 1
- `operations` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 2)`
- `i` is 0
- `j` is 2

The Python code snippet is:
```python
operations.append((i + 1, j + 1))
```

Now, analyzing the impact of the code:
- The `operations` list is modified by appending a new tuple.
- The new tuple is created by adding 1 to `i` and `j`, resulting in `(0 + 1, 2 + 1)` which equals `(1, 3)`.
- The states of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `A`, `B`, `i`, `j`) are not affected by this operation.

After executing the code snippet, the state of `operations` changes to include the new tuple `(1, 3)` in addition to its initial content `(1, 2)`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50
- `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 50
- `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns
- `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[0][1]`, `B[0][2]`, `B[0][3]`, `B[1][1]`, `B[1][2]`, and `B[1][3]` are 1
- `operations` is a list containing the tuples `(1, 2)` and `(1, 3)`
- `i` is 0
- `j` is 2

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[0][1]`, `B[0][2]`, `B[0][3]`, `B[1][1]`, `B[1][2]`, and `B[1][3]` are 1, `operations` is a list containing the tuples `(1, 2)` and `(1, 3)`, `i` is 0, `j` is 2**
