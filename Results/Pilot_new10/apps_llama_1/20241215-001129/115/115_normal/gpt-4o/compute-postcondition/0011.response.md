Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns. If `A[0][1]` is 1, `A[0][2]` is 1, `A[1][1]` is 1, and `A[1][2]` is 1, then `B[0][1]`, `B[0][2]`, `B[1][1]`, and `B[1][2]` are 1 and `operations` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 2)`, `i` is 0, `j` is 1. Otherwise, the state remains as in the precondition.***
