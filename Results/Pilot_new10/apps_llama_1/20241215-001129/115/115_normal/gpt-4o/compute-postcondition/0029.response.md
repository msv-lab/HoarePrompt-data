The code `operations.append((i + 1, j + 1))` appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `operations`. 

The initial value of `i` is 1, and the initial value of `j` is 2. 
So, `i + 1` equals 2 and `j + 1` equals 3. 
The tuple `(2, 3)` is appended to the list `operations`.

The state of the other variables is not affected. 

`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 50, 
`m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 50 and `m` must be greater than 3, 
`A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, 
`B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[0][j]`, `B[0][j+1]`, `B[1][j]`, and `B[1][j+1]` are 1 for all `j` where `A[0][j]` equals 1 and `A[0][j+1]` equals 1 and `A[1][j]` equals 1 and `A[1][j+1]` equals 1, 
`B[1][2]` equals 1, 
`B[1][3]` equals 1, 
`B[2][2]` equals 1, 
and `B[2][3]` equals 1, 
if `A[1][0]` equals 1, `A[1][1]` equals 1, `A[2][0]` equals 1, and `A[2][1]` equals 1, 
then `B[1][0]` equals 1, `B[1][1]` equals 1, `B[2][0]` equals 1, and `B[2][1]` equals 1, 
`i` is 1, 
`j` is 2, 
and `operations` contains the tuples `(2, 1)`, `(2, 2)`, `(2, 3)` and `(3, 2)` and `(3, 3)`.

After the code is executed, `operations` contains the tuples `(2, 1)`, `(2, 2)`, `(2, 3)`, `(3, 2)`, `(3, 3)` and `(2, 3)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 50 and `m` must be greater than 3, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[0][j]`, `B[0][j+1]`, `B[1][j]`, and `B[1][j+1]` are 1 for all `j` where `A[0][j]` equals 1 and `A[0][j+1]` equals 1 and `A[1][j]` equals 1 and `A[1][j+1]` equals 1, `B[1][2]` equals 1, `B[1][3]` equals 1, `B[2][2]` equals 1, and `B[2][3]` equals 1, if `A[1][0]` equals 1, `A[1][1]` equals 1, `A[2][0]` equals 1, and `A[2][1]` equals 1, then `B[1][0]` equals 1, `B[1][1]` equals 1, `B[2][0]` equals 1, and `B[2][1]` equals 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `operations` contains the tuples `(2, 1)`, `(2, 2)`, `(2, 3)`, `(3, 2)`, `(3, 3)` and `(2, 3)`**
