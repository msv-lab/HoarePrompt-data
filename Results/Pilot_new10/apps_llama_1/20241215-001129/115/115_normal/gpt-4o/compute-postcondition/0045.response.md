Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 50 and `m` must be at least 4, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where if `A[2][2]` equals 1, `A[2][3]` equals 1, `A[3][2]` equals 1, and `A[3][3]` equals 1, then `B[2][2]` equals 1, `B[2][3]` equals 1, `B[3][2]` equals 1, `B[3][3]` equals 1 and `(3, 3)` is in `operations`, otherwise `B` and `operations` remain unchanged, `i` is 2, `j` is 2***
