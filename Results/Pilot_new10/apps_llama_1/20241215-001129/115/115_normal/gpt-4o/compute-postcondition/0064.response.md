Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50, `m` must be greater than 0, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `operations` is a list containing tuples, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and either all elements of `A` and `B` at index `i` are equal, or the program has returned -1. If the program has not returned -1, then `A[i]` is equal to `B[i]`. Additionally, `A[i][j]` is equal to `B[i][j]`.**
