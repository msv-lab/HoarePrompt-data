Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `operations` is a list containing tuples, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and either the program has returned -1 (in which case `A` and `B`'s states are unchanged), or `A[1]` is equal to `B[1]`. Additionally, `A[i][j]` is equal to `B[i][j]`.**
