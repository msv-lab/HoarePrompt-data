Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `j` is an integer such that `j` is at least 1 and less than `m`. If there exists an `i` where `A[i][j]` is not equal to `B[i][j]`, the program returns -1. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
