Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns. If `A[i][j]` is not equal to `B[i][j]`, the program returns -1, with `A` and `B`'s states unchanged. If `A[i][j]` is equal to `B[i][j]`, then either the program has returned -1 (in which case `A` and `B`'s states are unchanged), or `A[1]` is equal to `B[1]` and `A[2][1]` is equal to `B[2][1]`.***
