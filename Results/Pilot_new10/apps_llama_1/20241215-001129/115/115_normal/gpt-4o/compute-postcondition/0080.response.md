According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is not specified but we know that `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `j` is an integer such that `j` is at least 1 and less than `m`**
