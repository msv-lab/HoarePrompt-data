According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 50. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 50 and n > 2, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[0][j]`, `B[0][j+1]`, `B[1][j]`, and `B[1][j+1]` are 1 for all `j` where `A[0][j]` equals 1 and `A[0][j+1]` equals 1 and `A[1][j]` equals 1 and `A[1][j+1]` equals 1, and for `i` = 1, `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j+1]`, `B[i+1][j]`, and `B[i+1][j+1]` are 1 for all `j` where `A[i][j]` equals 1, `A[i][j+1]` equals 1, `A[i+1][j]` equals 1, and `A[i+1][j+1]` equals 1, `operations` is a list containing tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for each such `j`, `i` is 2, `j` is `m - 1`** 

Since n > 2, n can be any value between 3 and 50.
