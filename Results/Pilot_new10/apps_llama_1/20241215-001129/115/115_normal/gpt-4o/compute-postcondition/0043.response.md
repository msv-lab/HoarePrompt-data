The given code affects the values of `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]`. The values of `B` are updated based on the given condition. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Given `i` is 2 and `j` is 2, the code updates `B[2][2]`, `B[2][3]`, `B[3][2]`, and `B[3][3]` to 1.

The initial state specifies the conditions for `B[0][j]`, `B[0][j+1]`, `B[1][j]`, and `B[1][j+1]` to be 1, and for `i` = 1, `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j+1]`, `B[i+1][j]`, and `B[i+1][j+1]` to be 1. However, these are not directly affected by the given code.

The value of `n` is still an integer such that 3 <= n <= 50, `m` is still an integer such that 3 <= m <= 50 and `m` must be at least 4, `A` is still a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, and `operations` is still a list containing tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for each such `j`.

Since we only have information about `i` = 2 and `j` = 2, and we cannot determine the exact values of `A[2][2]`, `A[2][3]`, `A[3][2]`, and `A[3][3]` from the given information, we consider that `B[2][2]`, `B[2][3]`, `B[3][2]`, and `B[3][3]` have been updated to 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 50 and `m` must be at least 4, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[2][2]` equals 1, `B[2][3]` equals 1, `B[3][2]` equals 1, `B[3][3]` equals 1, and `operations` is a list containing tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for each such `j`, `i` is 2, `j` is 2**
