The code appends a new tuple to the `operations` list. The tuple contains the values `i + 1` and `j + 1`, where `i` is 2 and `j` is 2. So, `i + 1` equals 3 and `j + 1` equals 3. 

Therefore, the tuple `(3, 3)` is appended to the `operations` list. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 50 and `m` must be at least 4, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[2][2]` equals 1, `B[2][3]` equals 1, `B[3][2]` equals 1, `B[3][3]` equals 1, and `operations` is a list containing tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for each such `j`, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, and `operations` includes the tuple `(3, 3)`**
