The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `A`. `n` and `m` are integers such that 2 <= `n` <= 50 and 2 <= `m` <= 50. `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each integer is either 0 or 1. 

After executing the function body, the function will return -1 in all cases. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept integers `n` and `m`, and a 2D list `A` with specific constraints and return -1.
Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, and A, and returns -1.**
