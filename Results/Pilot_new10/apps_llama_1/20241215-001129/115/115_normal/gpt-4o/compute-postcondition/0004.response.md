Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each integer is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where all integers are 0, `operations` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `j` is 0. The current values of `i` and `j` are such that `i` is less than `n-1` and `j` is less than `m-1`. The current value of `A[i][j]` is 1, the current value of `A[i][j + 1]` is 1, the current value of `A[i + 1][j]` is 1, and the current value of `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1**
