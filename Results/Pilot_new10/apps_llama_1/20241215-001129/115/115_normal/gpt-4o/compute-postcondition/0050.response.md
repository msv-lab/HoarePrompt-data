Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `operations` is a list containing tuples, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and the current value of `A` at position `(i, j)` is not equal to the current value of `B` at position `(i, j)`**
