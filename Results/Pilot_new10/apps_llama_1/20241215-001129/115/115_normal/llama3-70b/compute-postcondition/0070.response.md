To calculate the output state after running the given Python code, we first need to understand the impact of the code on the program and then evaluate the result based on the initial state provided.


The given code snippet is:
```python
print(op[0], op[1])
```
Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive)
- `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive)
- `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers and must have at least one 2x2 sub-matrix with at least one 1 but not all 1s
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `j` is `m - 1`
- `ops` is a list of tuples with at least one operation
- The length of `ops` is less than or equal to 2499


Upon examining the code snippet `print(op[0], op[1])`, it appears that this line is intended to print the first two elements of a tuple `op`. However, based on the provided initial state, there's no explicit mention of `op`, but it seems like `op` could be an element from the `ops` list, given that `ops` is a list of tuples.


The code does not modify any of the variables provided in the initial state. It only prints the values of `op[0]` and `op[1]`. However, since the actual content of `op` or how it relates to `ops` isn't specified, we must infer that this operation doesn't directly change the values of `n`, `m`, `A`, `i`, `j`, or `ops` themselves.


Therefore, considering the provided initial state and the nature of the code snippet, the output state remains largely unchanged in terms of variable assignments, but we acknowledge that `op[0]` and `op[1]` have been printed, indicating some form of operation or reporting based on the elements within the `ops` list or a similar construct.


Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers and must have at least one 2x2 sub-matrix with at least one 1 but not all 1s, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `m - 1`, `ops` is a list of tuples with at least one operation, the length of `ops` is less than or equal to 2499, and the values of `op[0]` and `op[1]` have been printed.**
