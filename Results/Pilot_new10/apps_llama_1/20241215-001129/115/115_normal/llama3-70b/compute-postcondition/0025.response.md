The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. In this case, since the 2x2 sub-matrix at position `(i, j)` in `A` contains all 1s, the current iteration will be skipped.

The values of the variables do not change, but we skip the rest of the code for the current iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and `m` must be at least 2, `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `ops` contains tuples `(1, k)` for each column index `k` where the corresponding 2x2 sub-matrix in `A` has at least one 1 but not all 1s, and we skip the rest of the code for the current iteration.
