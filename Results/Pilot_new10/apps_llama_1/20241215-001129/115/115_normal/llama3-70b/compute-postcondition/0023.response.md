According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `m` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Since `j` is initialized to `m - 1` before the loop, and the loop iterates over `range(m - 1)`, it means `j` will take values from 0 to `m - 2`. For the loop to execute at least once, `m` must be at least 2. 

Given that `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers, `i` is 1, and `ops` contains tuples `(1, k)` for each column index `k` where the corresponding 2x2 sub-matrix in `A` has at least one 1 but not all 1s, we need to adjust the state so that `m` is at least 2 and `j` is within the range of the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and `m` must be at least 2, `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `ops` contains tuples `(1, k)` for each column index `k` where the corresponding 2x2 sub-matrix in `A` has at least one 1 but not all 1s**
