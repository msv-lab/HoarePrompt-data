The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration. Since the `continue` statement does not affect the values of variables, the values of `n`, `m`, `A`, `i`, `j`, and `ops` remain unchanged. 

The only effect is that we skip to the next iteration of the loop, if there is one. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 4 and 50 (inclusive), `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `ops` contains tuples `(1, k)` for each column index `k` where the corresponding 2x2 sub-matrix in `A` has at least one 1 but not all 1s, and if at least one of the following is 1: `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]`, then `ops` also contains `(2, 1)` and `(2, 2)` if the condition is met, and we move to the next iteration of the loop.**
