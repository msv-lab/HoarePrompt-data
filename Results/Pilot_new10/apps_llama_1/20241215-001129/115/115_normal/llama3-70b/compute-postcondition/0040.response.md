To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the patterns observed in the output states after the loop executes a few times.

The loop code checks each 2x2 sub-matrix in the 2D list `A` and appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to `ops` if the sub-matrix contains at least one 1 but not all 1s. The loop iterates over each column index `j` in the range `m - 1`.

From the output states after the loop executes a few times, we can observe that:

* `n` remains an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive).
* `m` must be at least 2, 3, 4, and so on, for the loop to execute 1, 2, 3, and so on, times, respectively.
* `A` remains a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers.
* `i` remains 1.
* `j` increments by 1 after each iteration, starting from 0 and ending at `m - 2`.
* `ops` initially contains tuples `(1, k)` for each column index `k` where the corresponding 2x2 sub-matrix in `A` has at least one 1 but not all 1s. After each iteration, if the current 2x2 sub-matrix contains at least one 1 but not all 1s, a new tuple `(2, j + 1)` is appended to `ops`.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, the final output state can be determined as follows:

* `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive).
* `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive).
* `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers.
* `i` is 1.
* `j` is `m - 1` (since it increments by 1 after each iteration and ends at `m - 2`).
* `ops` contains its original tuples `(1, k)` for each column index `k` where the corresponding 2x2 sub-matrix in `A` has at least one 1 but not all 1s, plus additional tuples `(2, k)` for each column index `k` where the corresponding 2x2 sub-matrix contains at least one 1 but not all 1s.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers, `i` is 1, `j` is `m - 1`, and `ops` contains tuples `(1, k)` for each column index `k` where the corresponding 2x2 sub-matrix in `A` has at least one 1 but not all 1s, plus tuples `(2, k)` for each column index `k` where the corresponding 2x2 sub-matrix contains at least one 1 but not all 1s.**
