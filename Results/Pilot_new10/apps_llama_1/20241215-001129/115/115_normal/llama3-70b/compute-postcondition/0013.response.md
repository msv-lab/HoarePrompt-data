Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and must be at least 2, `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 1)` if any of the conditions are met, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and if `A[i][j] == 1` and `A[i + 1][j] == 1` and `A[i][j + 1] == 1` and `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1`, then we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop, otherwise the program continues with the current state.**
