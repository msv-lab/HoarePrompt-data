The input consists of two integers `n` and `m` (2 <= `n`, `m` <= 50) representing the number of rows and columns in matrices A and B, followed by `n` lines, each containing `m` integers (either 0 or 1) representing the elements of matrix A.

After the execution of the given code, 
`n` and `m` are assigned the values of the first and second integers from the input respectively. 

The rest of the input (the elements of matrix A) has not been processed yet, so it remains as part of the input.

The Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) representing the number of rows, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) representing the number of columns, the rest of the input remains the same (the elements of matrix A).
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) representing the number of rows, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) representing the number of columns, the rest of the input remains the same (the elements of matrix A)**
