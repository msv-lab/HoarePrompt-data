According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m - 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 2. Also, `m` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive) and must be at least 3, `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers, `i` is 0, `j` is 2**
