The given code initializes an empty list `ops`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, or `A`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers, `ops` is an empty list**
