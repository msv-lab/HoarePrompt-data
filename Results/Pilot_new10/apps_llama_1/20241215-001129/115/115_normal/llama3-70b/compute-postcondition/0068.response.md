The given Python code snippet is `print(op[0], op[1])`. However, based on the initial state provided, it seems there might be a slight misunderstanding or typo in the code snippet because the variables defined are `ops` (a list of tuples) and `i`, `j` as indices. Assuming the intention was to print the first operation in `ops`, which would be `ops[0]`, and given the structure of `ops` as a list of tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)`, printing `op[0]` and `op[1]` directly does not align with the provided initial state.

However, given the structure of `ops` and assuming the code actually intends to print the first operation, we should consider `ops[0]` which is a tuple. Thus, `op[0]` would refer to the first element of the first tuple in `ops`, and `op[1]` would refer to the second element of the first tuple in `ops`. Since the first operation has been processed, we're looking at the remaining operations or the state after this print statement without any alterations to the variables' values due to the print operation.

Given `ops` is a list of tuples and the first operation has been processed, we consider the impact:

- `n` remains an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive).
- `m` remains an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive).
- `A` remains a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers and must have at least one 2x2 sub-matrix with at least one 1 but not all 1s.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `j` is `m - 1`.
- `ops` remains a non-empty list of tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for every position `(i, j)` where the corresponding 2x2 sub-matrix in `A` has at least one 1 but not all 1s, with the length of `ops` less than or equal to 2499.
- The first operation has been processed, but since the code provided only prints and does not modify any variables, the state of all variables remains unchanged except for the fact that we've acknowledged the first operation's processing.

Thus, the output state after running the given Python code snippet, considering the correction and interpretation above, is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers and must have at least one 2x2 sub-matrix with at least one 1 but not all 1s, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `m - 1`, `ops` is a non-empty list of tuples with the first operation processed, and the length of `ops` is less than or equal to 2499.**
