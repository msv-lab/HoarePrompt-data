Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, if at least one of `A[2][0]`, `A[3][0]`, `A[2][1]`, or `A[3][1]` is 1, then `ops` contains tuples based on conditions related to 2x2 sub-matrices in `A` and also contains the tuple `(3, 1)`. Otherwise, `ops` contains tuples based on conditions related to 2x2 sub-matrices in `A` and no changes were made to `A`, `i`, `j`, or `ops`.***
