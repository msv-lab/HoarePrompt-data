The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It does not change the values of any variables. 

Since `i` is 0 and `j` is 2, and there is no change in these values due to the `continue` statement, the Output State remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive) and must be at least 3, `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers, `i` is 0, `j` is 2 and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop.**
