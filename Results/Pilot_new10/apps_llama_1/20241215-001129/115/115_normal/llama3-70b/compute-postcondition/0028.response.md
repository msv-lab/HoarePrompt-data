The code `ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))` adds a new tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the `ops` list. Given the initial state, `i` is 1 and `j` is 0, so the new tuple added to `ops` is `(2, 1)`.

Since `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and `m` must be at least 2, `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and the current value of at least one of the following is 1: `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]`, the states of these variables are not affected.

The value of `ops` is updated by appending the new tuple `(2, 1)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and `m` must be at least 2, `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `ops` contains tuples `(1, k)` for each column index `k` where the corresponding 2x2 sub-matrix in `A` has at least one 1 but not all 1s and also contains `(2, 1)`, and the current value of at least one of the following is 1: `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]`.**
