The given code creates a 2D list `A` of size `n x m` where each element is an integer input from the user. The number of rows `n` and the number of columns `m` are integers between 2 and 50 (inclusive). 

`A` is assigned the value of a list of `n` lists, where each inner list is created by mapping the `int` function to the result of `input().split()`, effectively reading a line of space-separated integers from the input. This process is repeated `n` times.

The states of `n` and `m` are not affected by this code, so they remain integers between 2 and 50 (inclusive). 

The value of `A` becomes a 2D list where each inner list represents a row of the input matrix and each element in the inner list is an integer. The size of `A` is `n x m`, and the elements are the input integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers**
