To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the given loop code and the initial state of the variables.

The loop code iterates over each column in the 2D list `A` (except the last one), and checks the values of the current and next column in the current and next row. If all four values are 1, it skips to the next iteration. If at least one of the four values is 1, it appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the `ops` list.

The output state after the loop executes some number of times provides hints about the relationships between the variables. 

After analyzing the loop code and the output states, we can determine the final output state:

- `n` remains an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), as it is not modified in the loop.
- `m` remains an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), as it is not modified in the loop.
- `A` remains a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers, as it is not modified in the loop.
- `i` remains 2, as it is not modified in the loop.
- `j` will be `m - 1` after the loop finishes, as the loop iterates over the range `range(m - 1)`.
- `ops` will contain tuples based on the conditions related to 2x2 sub-matrices in `A`. Specifically, for each column index `j` where the corresponding 2x2 sub-matrix has at least one 1 but not all 1s, the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` will be appended to `ops`.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers, `i` is 2, `j` is `m - 1`, `ops` contains tuples `(3, k)` for each column index `k` where the corresponding 2x2 sub-matrix in `A` has at least one 1 but not all 1s.**
