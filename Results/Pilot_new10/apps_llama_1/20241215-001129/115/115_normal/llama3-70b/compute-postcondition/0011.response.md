According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m - 1`, the loop can execute again, but since the loop is defined as `range(m - 1)`, it means `j` will go up to `m - 2` before the loop ends. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1. 

Given the conditions and the fact that the loop body is omitted, the state of `n`, `m`, `A`, `ops`, and `i` remains unchanged as `j` increments. However, since the loop iterates over `j`, we only need to consider the change in `j`.

Since `j` starts at 0 and the loop goes up to `m - 2`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be 1.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and must be at least 2, `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 1)` if any of the conditions are met, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
