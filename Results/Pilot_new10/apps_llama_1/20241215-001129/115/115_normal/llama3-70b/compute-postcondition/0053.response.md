Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, if at least one of `A[2][0]`, `A[3][0]`, `A[2][1]`, or `A[3][1]` is 1, then `ops` contains tuples based on conditions related to 2x2 sub-matrices in `A` and also contains the tuples including `(3, 1)` and `(3, 2)`. If `A[i][j]` is 1 and `A[i + 1][j]` is 1 and `A[i][j + 1]` is 1 and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, then we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `ops` contains tuples based on conditions related to 2x2 sub-matrices in `A` and no changes were made to `A`, `i`, `j`, except for `ops` now containing `(3, 2)`.***
