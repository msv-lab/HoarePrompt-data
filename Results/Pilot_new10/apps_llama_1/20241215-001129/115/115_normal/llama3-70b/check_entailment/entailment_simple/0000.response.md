Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description requires the program to determine if it is possible to make matrix B equal to matrix A by performing operations on matrix B, and if it is possible, print the sequence of operations. 

The program checks for each 2x2 submatrix in matrix A if at least one element is 1 but not all elements are 1. If such a submatrix is found, it adds the corresponding operation to the list of operations. However, this approach does not guarantee that the resulting sequence of operations will make matrix B equal to matrix A.

One issue with the program is that it does not check if the operations it adds to the list are actually necessary or if they would result in any 0 elements in matrix A being overwritten with 1. The program also does not handle the case where a 2x2 submatrix in matrix A has all elements as 0, in which case no operation should be performed on that submatrix.

For example, consider the input:

3 3
1 0 1
1 0 1
0 0 0

The program will add operations for the submatrices [(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)] and [(1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3)], even though these operations would result in the 0 elements in matrix A being overwritten with 1. The correct output for this input should be -1, as it is impossible to make matrix B equal to matrix A.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
