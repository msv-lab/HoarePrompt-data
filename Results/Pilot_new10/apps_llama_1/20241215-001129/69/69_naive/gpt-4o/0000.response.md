Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the way it updates the position map and checks for the target position. 

One potential case where the program does not work correctly is when the target position is not directly reachable from the current position by changing a subsegment of the operations. The program only checks if the target position is in the position map, but it does not consider the case where the target position can be reached by changing a subsegment of the operations that does not include the current position.

Another issue is that the program does not handle the case where the target position is reachable from the initial position (0, 0) without changing any operations, but the program still needs to change some operations to reach the target position because the sequence of operations does not lead to the target position. 

For example, consider the input:

```
5
RURUU
-2 3
```

The program returns 3, which is correct, but this is more by chance than by design. A proper implementation should correctly handle all possible cases and return the correct minimum length of subsegment that can be changed. 

To correctly solve the problem, we would need to use a more sophisticated approach, such as dynamic programming or a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm, to find the minimum length of subsegment that can be changed to reach the target position. 

Here's a suggested approach to solve the problem correctly:
- Initialize the initial state of the robot (0, 0) and the target state (x, y).
- Use BFS to explore all possible states and keep track of the minimum length of subsegment that can be changed to reach each state.
- If the target state is reachable, return the minimum length of subsegment that can be changed to reach it.
- If the target state is not reachable, return -1.

Here is a simple example of how the algorithm could be implemented in Python:
```python
from collections import deque

def func_1(n, operations, x, y):
    def bfs():
        queue = deque([(0, 0, 0, [])])
        visited = set((0, 0, 0))
        while queue:
            current_x, current_y, length, changed = queue.popleft()
            if (current_x, current_y) == (x, y):
                return length
            for i, op in enumerate(operations):
                new_x, new_y = current_x, current_y
                if op == 'U':
                    new_y += 1
                elif op == 'D':
                    new_y -= 1
                elif op == 'L':
                    new_x -= 1
                elif op == 'R':
                    new_x += 1
                new_length = length + (i not in changed)
                if (new_x, new_y, new_length) not in visited:
                    visited.add((new_x, new_y, new_length))
                    queue.append((new_x, new_y, new_length, changed | {i}))
        return -1

    return bfs()

n = int(input())
operations = input().strip()
(x, y) = map(int, input().split())
result = func_1(n, operations, x, y)
print(result)
```
