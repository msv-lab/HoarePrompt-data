To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state. 

The initial state provides the following information:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `operations` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R'.
- `x` is an integer.
- `y` is an integer.
- `final_x` is the difference between the counts of 'R' and 'L' operations in `operations`.
- `final_y` is the difference between the counts of 'U' and 'D' operations in `operations`.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
dx = x - final_x
```
This line of code calculates the difference between the current value of `x` and `final_x` and assigns it to a new variable `dx`.

Given the initial state and the code, we can deduce the following:
- The value of `n` remains unchanged as it's not affected by the code.
- The string `operations` also remains unchanged.
- The values of `x` and `y` remain as they are since the code does not modify them directly.
- `final_x` and `final_y` are based on the counts of operations in the string `operations`, which does not change, so their values also remain the same.
- A new variable `dx` is introduced, which is equal to `x - final_x`.

Therefore, the output state, considering all the given information and the effect of the code, is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `final_x` is the difference between the counts of 'R' and 'L' operations in `operations`, `final_y` is the difference between the counts of 'U' and 'D' operations in `operations`, and `dx` is equal to `x - final_x`**
