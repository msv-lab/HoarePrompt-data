The value of `dy` is assigned the difference between `y` and `final_y`. The initial state variables `n`, `operations`, `x`, `y`, `final_x`, and `final_y` are not changed by this operation. However, `dx` is equal to `x - final_x` and this relationship remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `final_x` is the difference between the counts of 'R' and 'L' operations in `operations`, `final_y` is the difference between the counts of 'U' and 'D' operations in `operations`, `dx` is equal to `x - final_x`, and `dy` is equal to `y - final_y`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `final_x` is the difference between the counts of 'R' and 'L' operations in `operations`, `final_y` is the difference between the counts of 'U' and 'D' operations in `operations`, `dx` is `x - final_x`, and `dy` is `y - final_y`**
