The value of `target_pos` is assigned the expression `current_x + dx, current_y + dy`. Given that `dx` is `x - final_x` and `dy` is `y - final_y`, we can substitute these values into the expression for `target_pos`. Therefore, `target_pos` becomes `(current_x + x - final_x), (current_y + y - final_y)`.

Since `final_x` is the difference between the counts of 'R' and 'L' operations in `operations`, and `final_y` is the difference between the counts of 'U' and 'D' operations in `operations`, the values of `final_x` and `final_y` remain unchanged as the provided code does not modify `operations` or recalculate `final_x` and `final_y`.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this assignment, so their values remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and greater than the new `i`, `operations` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `final_x` is the difference between the counts of 'R' and 'L' operations in `operations`, `final_y` is the difference between the counts of 'U' and 'D' operations in `operations`, `dx` is `x - final_x`, `dy` is `y - final_y`, `position_map` contains updated positions including (`current_x`, `current_y`) with the value of the previous `i`, `target_pos` is (`current_x + x - final_x`, `current_y + y - final_y`), and `i` is the previous `i` plus one.**
