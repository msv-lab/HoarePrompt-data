The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n`, a string of operations of length `n` containing 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', and integers `x` and `y`. The function calculates the net movement in the x and y directions based on the operations and then checks if the target position (`x`, `y`) is equal to the final position after all operations. If they are equal, it returns 0. Otherwise, it tries to find the minimum distance between revisits to any position that is `dx` away from the current position in the x direction and `dy` away from the current position in the y direction. If such revisits occur, it returns the minimum distance; otherwise, it returns -1.

Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n`, a string of operations, and integers `x` and `y`, and returns 0 if the target position is the final position after all operations, or the minimum distance between revisits to any position that is `dx` and `dy` away from the current position if such revisits occur, otherwise returns -1, handling all potential edge cases including non-revisitable positions and initial positions. **
