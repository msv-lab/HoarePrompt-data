The code `current_x -= 1` decrements the value of `current_x` by 1. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer and greater than the new `i`
- `operations` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R'
- `x` is an integer
- `y` is an integer
- `final_x` is the difference between the counts of 'R' and 'L' operations in `operations`
- `final_y` is the difference between the counts of 'U' and 'D' operations in `operations`
- `dx` is `x - final_x`
- `dy` is `y - final_y`
- `position_map` contains updated positions including (`current_x`, `current_y`) with the value of the previous `i`
- `i` is the previous `i` plus one

After executing `current_x -= 1`, we update `current_x` to be `current_x - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and greater than the new `i`, `operations` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `final_x` is the difference between the counts of 'R' and 'L' operations in `operations`, `final_y` is the difference between the counts of 'U' and 'D' operations in `operations`, `dx` is `x - final_x`, `dy` is `y - final_y`, `position_map` contains updated positions including (`current_x - 1`, `current_y`) with the value of the previous `i`, and `i` is the previous `i` plus one**
