Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and greater than 1, `operations` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `final_x` is the difference between the counts of 'R' and 'L' operations in `operations`, `final_y` is the difference between the counts of 'U' and 'D' operations in `operations`, `dx` is `x - final_x`, `dy` is `y - final_y`, `position_map` is a dictionary containing positions as keys and their corresponding values, with the initial position (0, 0) having a value of -1 and (`dx`, `dy`) having a value of `i`, `i` is 1, if `target_pos` is in `position_map`, then `min_length` is the minimum of its previous value and `1 - position_map[target_pos]`.***
