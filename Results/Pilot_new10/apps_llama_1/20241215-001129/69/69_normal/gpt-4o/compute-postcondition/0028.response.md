To determine the output state after executing the given Python code snippet, we'll follow the provided guidelines step by step.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `operations` is a non-empty string of length at least `n` containing only the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R'.
- `x` and `y` are integers with values resulting from the previous operation.

The code to execute is:
```python
final_y += 1
```

Now, analyzing the impact of the code:
- The code increments the value of `final_y` by 1. 
- The variables `n`, `operations`, `x`, and `y` are not directly affected by this operation.

However, it seems there might be a confusion in the variable names used in the task description and the code snippet. The code snippet refers to `final_y`, but the initial state describes `y`. Assuming `final_y` and `y` are intended to refer to the same variable or the task implies that `final_y` is a separate variable that has been previously defined (though its initial state is not explicitly given as `y`'s), we proceed with the understanding that `final_y` (or `y`) is the variable being incremented.

Thus, if we consider `final_y` as the variable in question, and assuming it was previously equal to `y` (given the context might imply `final_y` is a continuation or separate entity from `y`, but without explicit initial value, we align it with `y` for this analysis), the new value of `final_y` (or `y`, if they are considered the same) would be `y + 1`.

The output state, considering the corrections and assumptions for clarity, would reflect the change in `final_y` (or `y`), while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a non-empty string of length at least `n` containing only the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R`, `x` remains an integer from the previous operation, and `final_y` (or `y`) is incremented by 1 to `y + 1`.**
