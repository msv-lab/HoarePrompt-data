The value of `current_x` is decreased by 1, but the previous value of `current_x` is unknown, it is actually `dx`. 
`n` is still a positive integer and greater than 1. 
`operations` is still a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R'.
`x` is still an integer.
`y` is still an integer.
`final_x` is still the difference between the counts of 'R' and 'L' operations in `operations`.
`final_y` is still the difference between the counts of 'U' and 'D' operations in `operations`.
`dx` is still `x - final_x`.
`dy` is still `y - final_y`.
`position_map` is still a dictionary containing positions as keys and their corresponding values, with the initial position (0, 0) having a value of -1 and (`dx`, `dy`) having a value of `i`.
`i` is still 1.
`target_pos` is either `dx - 1, 1 + dy` or `dx - 1, -1 + dy` or `dx - 2, dy` or `dx, dy` depending on the character at index `i` of `operations`, because `current_x` has been decreased by 1. 
`current_x` is `dx - 1`.
Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` is a positive integer and greater than 1, 
`operations` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', 
`x` is an integer, 
`y` is an integer, 
`final_x` is the difference between the counts of 'R' and 'L' operations in `operations`, 
`final_y` is the difference between the counts of 'U' and 'D' operations in `operations`, 
`dx` is `x - final_x`, 
`dy` is `y - final_y`, 
`position_map` is a dictionary containing positions as keys and their corresponding values, with the initial position (0, 0) having a value of -1 and (`dx`, `dy`) having a value of `i`, 
`i` is 1, 
`target_pos` is either `dx - 1, 1 + dy` or `dx - 1, -1 + dy` or `dx - 2, dy` or `dx, dy` depending on the character at index `i` of `operations`, 
`current_x` is `dx - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and greater than 1, `operations` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `final_x` is the difference between the counts of 'R' and 'L' operations in `operations`, `final_y` is the difference between the counts of 'U' and 'D' operations in `operations`, `dx` is `x - final_x`, `dy` is `y - final_y`, `position_map` is a dictionary containing positions as keys and their corresponding values, with the initial position (0, 0) having a value of -1 and (`dx`, `dy`) having a value of `i`, `i` is 1, `target_pos` is either `dx - 1, 1 + dy` or `dx - 1, -1 + dy` or `dx - 2, dy` or `dx, dy` depending on the character at index `i` of `operations`, `current_x` is `dx - 1`.**
