To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `operations` is a non-empty string of length at least `n-1` containing only the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R'
- `x` is an integer
- `y` is an integer

The given code is:
```python
final_x += 1
```

However, there seems to be a discrepancy in the problem statement as `final_x` is not mentioned in the initial state. Assuming the intention was to increment `x` (as `final_x` is not defined initially), the analysis would proceed as follows:

The code increments `x` by 1. Therefore, the new value of `x` is `x + 1`. The values of `n`, `operations`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a non-empty string of length at least `n-1` containing only the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `x` is `x + 1`, `y` is an integer**
