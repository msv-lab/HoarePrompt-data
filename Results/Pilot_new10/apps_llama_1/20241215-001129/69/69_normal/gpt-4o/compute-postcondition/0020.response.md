The value of `final_y` is decreased by 1. However, `final_y` is not defined in the initial state. Assuming `final_y` is a separate variable from `y`, the state of `y` is not affected. The states of the other variables are also not affected. 

However, considering `final_y` is intended to represent the final value of `y`, then `y` would be decreased by 1. Therefore, `y` becomes `y - 1`. 

Since `n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a non-empty string of length at least `n-1` containing only the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `x` is an integer, these variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a non-empty string of length at least `n-1` containing only the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `x` is an integer, `y` is `y - 1`**
