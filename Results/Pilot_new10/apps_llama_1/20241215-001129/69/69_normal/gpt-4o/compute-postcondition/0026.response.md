Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a non-empty string of length at least `n-1` containing only the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `x` and `y` are integers. If the current operation `op` is 'U', then `y` is incremented by 1. If `op` is 'D', then `y` is decremented by 1. If `op` is 'L', then `x` is decremented by 1. If `op` is 'R', then `x` is incremented by 1.**
