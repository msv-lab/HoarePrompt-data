The function accepts input from the user, including the number of operations `n`, a string of `n` operations where each operation is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', and two integers `x` and `y`. It calculates the net movement in the x and y directions based on the operations and checks if the destination (`x`, `y`) is reachable. If the destination is not reachable, it returns `-1`. Otherwise, it returns the number of operations that cannot be performed without overshooting the destination. The function assumes that the input is provided in the correct format and does not handle cases where the input is invalid or where the net movement is very large.
