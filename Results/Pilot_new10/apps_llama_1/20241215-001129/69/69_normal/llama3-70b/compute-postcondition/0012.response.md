The code `ux += 1` increments the value of `ux` by 1. Initially, `ux` is 0, so after the increment, `ux` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

The current value of `op` is 'R', which confirms that the first operation is to move to the right. This information, along with the values of `n`, `ops`, `x`, `y`, `uy`, `lx`, and `ly`, remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' and must have at least 1 character, `x` and `y` are input integers, `ux` is 1, `uy` is 0, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, the first character in `ops` is 'R', the current value of `op` is 'R', `op` is not 'U' and not 'D'**
