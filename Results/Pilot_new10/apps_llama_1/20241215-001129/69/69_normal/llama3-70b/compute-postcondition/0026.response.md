Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' and must have at least 2 characters. If `op` is 'R', then `x` is the input integer plus 1 and `y` is the input integer. If `op` is 'L', then `x` is the input integer minus 1 and `y` remains the input integer.***
