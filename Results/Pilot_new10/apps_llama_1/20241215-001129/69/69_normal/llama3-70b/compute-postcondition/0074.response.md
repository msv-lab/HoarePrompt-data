The value of `dy` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `dy` is not specified, but since `dy` is updated based on the next operation in `ops`, its new value is `dy + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' and `ops` has at least one more character, `x` and `y` are input integers, `ux` is updated based on the next operation in `ops`, `uy` is updated based on the next operation in `ops`, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, `dy` is `dy + 1`**
