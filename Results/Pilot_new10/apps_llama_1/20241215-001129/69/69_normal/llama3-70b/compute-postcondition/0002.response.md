The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` assigns the values of two input integers to `x` and `y` respectively. The `map(int, input().split())` expression splits the input string into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and returns them as a map object. The values of `n` and `ops` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', and `x` and `y` are input integers**
