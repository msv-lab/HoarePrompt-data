The code provided is `uy += 1`, but it seems there's a typo in the variable name. Given the context, it's likely that the variable name should be `y` instead of `uy` because `x` and `y` are mentioned as input integers that have been updated based on the first operation in `ops`. Therefore, I will proceed with the assumption that the correct code is `y += 1`.

Given this correction, the value of `y` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `y` is an input integer that has been updated based on the first operation in `ops`, but its exact value is not specified. The values of `n`, `ops`, and `x` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' and must have at least 2 characters, `x` is an input integer that has been updated based on the first operation in `ops`, `y` is the updated input integer plus 1, `ops` must have at least 2 characters remaining**
