The given code simply prints the value of `res`. It does not modify any variables. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are input integers, `ux` is the net number of 'R' operations minus the net number of 'L' operations in `ops`, `uy` is the net number of 'U' operations minus the net number of 'D' operations in `ops`, `dx` is the final difference between `x` and the net 'R' and 'L' operations, `dy` is the final difference between `y` and the net 'U' and 'D' operations, `res` is the total number of operations that do not meet the conditions for updating `dy` or `dx`, and the value of `res` has been returned at the output state. If `n` is 0, then `dx` is `x - ux`, `dy` is `y - uy`, and `res` is 0.**
