Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are input integers, `ux` is the net number of 'R' operations minus the net number of 'L' operations in `ops`, `uy` is the net number of 'U' operations minus the net number of 'D' operations in `ops`, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, if `op` equals 'L' and `dx` is less than 0, then `dx` is 0 and `x` equals `ux`, otherwise `res` is 1, `dx` is `x - ux` and is greater than or equal to 0, `dy` is `y - uy` and is greater than or equal to 0, and either `op` is not 'D' or `dy` is greater than or equal to 0, and either `op` is not 'U' or `dy` is 0, and either `op` is not 'R' or `dx` is less than or equal to 0, and the first character `op` in `ops` is either not 'L' or `dx` is greater than or equal to 0.**
