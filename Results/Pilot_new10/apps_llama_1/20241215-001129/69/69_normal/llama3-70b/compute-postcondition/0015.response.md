The value of `ux` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `ux` is 0, so the new value of `ux` is -1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' and must have at least 1 character, `x` and `y` are input integers, `ux` is -1, `uy` is 0, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, the first character in `ops` is `op` and it is 'L'.**
