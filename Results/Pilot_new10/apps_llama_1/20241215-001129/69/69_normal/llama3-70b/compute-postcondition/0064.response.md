The value of `dy` is incremented by 1. The previous values of `n`, `ops`, `x`, `y`, `ux`, `uy`, `lx`, and `ly` are not affected, so they remain the same. 
The value of `dy` is increased by 1 from its previous value. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are input integers, `ux` is updated based on the next operation in `ops`, `uy` is updated based on the next operation in `ops`, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, `dy` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are input integers, `ux` is updated based on the next operation in `ops`, `uy` is updated based on the next operation in `ops`, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, `dy` is increased by 1**
