Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' and must have at least 2 characters, if the current operation `op` is 'L', then `x` is decremented by 1 from its previous value which was updated based on the first operation in `ops`, and `y` remains the same as it was after the first operation in `ops`. If `op` is not 'L', the postcondition is not explicitly defined for this part, implying that `x` and `y` retain the values they had after the first operation in `ops`, since there is no else part to modify them further.**
