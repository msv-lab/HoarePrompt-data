Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' and must have at least 2 characters. If `op` is 'L', then `x` is the input integer minus 1 and `y` remains the input integer; otherwise, the postcondition is not defined for other cases as there is no else part specified.**
