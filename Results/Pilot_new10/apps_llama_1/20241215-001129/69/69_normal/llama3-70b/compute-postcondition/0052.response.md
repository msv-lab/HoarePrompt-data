The value of `dx` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `dx` was greater than 0, so the new value of `dx` is `dx - 1` which is still greater than or equal to 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are input integers, `ux` is the net number of 'R' operations minus the net number of 'L' operations in `ops`, `uy` is the net number of 'U' operations minus the net number of 'D' operations in `ops`, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, `dx` is `x - ux - 1` and is greater than or equal to 0, `dy` is `y - uy` and is greater than or equal to 0, `res` is 0, `op` is 'R', and either `op` is not 'D' or `dy` is greater than or equal to 0, and either `op` is not 'U' or `dy` is 0**
