The value of `dx` is decremented by 1. However, the initial state does not mention `dx`, it mentions `x`, `y`, `ux`, `uy`, `lx`, and `ly`. Since `dx` is not defined in the initial state, we assume it is a variable that was previously defined but not included in the initial state description. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are input integers, `ux` is updated based on the next operation in `ops`, `uy` is updated based on the next operation in `ops`, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, and `dx` is decreased by 1**
