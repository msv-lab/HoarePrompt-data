There is no variable named `ux` in the initial state, so it seems there is a typo in the code. Assuming the code is `x += 1`, 

The value of `x` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' and must have at least 2 characters, `x` is an input integer plus 1, `y` is an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' and must have at least 2 characters, `x` is an input integer plus 1, `y` is an input integer**
