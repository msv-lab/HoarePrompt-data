Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect. The issue lies in the way it calculates the minimum length of the changed subsegment. The program only considers changing the operations from the beginning of the sequence, whereas the problem statement allows changing any subsegment of the sequence.

A case where the program does not work correctly is when the sequence of operations is "DDDD" and the target coordinates are (0, 0). The program will return -1, indicating that it's impossible to change the sequence to reach the target coordinates. However, it is possible to change the sequence to "UUUU" or "DDDD" with a changed subsegment of length 0 or 4, respectively.

To fix this issue, the program needs to consider all possible subsegments of the sequence and calculate the minimum length of the changed subsegment for each one. This can be done by iterating over all possible start and end indices of the subsegment and calculating the minimum length of the changed subsegment for each one.

Here's an example of how the program could be modified to fix this issue:

```python
def func_1(n, operations, x, y):
    final_x = 0
    final_y = 0
    for op in operations:
        if op == 'U':
            final_y += 1
        elif op == 'D':
            final_y -= 1
        elif op == 'L':
            final_x -= 1
        elif op == 'R':
            final_x += 1
    dx = x - final_x
    dy = y - final_y
    if dx == 0 and dy == 0:
        return 0
    min_length = float('inf')
    for start in range(n):
        for end in range(start, n):
            new_operations = list(operations)
            new_x = 0
            new_y = 0
            for i in range(start):
                if operations[i] == 'U':
                    new_y += 1
                elif operations[i] == 'D':
                    new_y -= 1
                elif operations[i] == 'L':
                    new_x -= 1
                elif operations[i] == 'R':
                    new_x += 1
            remaining_x = x - new_x
            remaining_y = y - new_y
            length = end - start + 1
            if abs(remaining_x) + abs(remaining_y) <= length:
                min_length = min(min_length, length)
    return min_length if min_length!= float('inf') else -1
```
This modified program considers all possible subsegments of the sequence and calculates the minimum length of the changed subsegment for each one. However, this program may not be efficient for large inputs due to its O(n^3) time complexity. A more efficient solution would involve using dynamic programming to calculate the minimum length of the changed subsegment.
