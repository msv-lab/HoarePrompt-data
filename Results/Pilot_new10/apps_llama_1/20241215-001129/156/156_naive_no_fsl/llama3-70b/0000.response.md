Correctness: **True**

The given program appears to be correct and follows the problem description. It correctly calculates Lara's position after she moves k times in the given 2D matrix.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. It first takes the input of n, m, and k.
2. It then calculates the effective number of steps by taking the modulus of k with (n * 2 - 2). This is because Lara's path repeats every (n * 2 - 2) steps.
3. If the effective number of steps is less than (n - 1), it means Lara is still moving down the leftmost column. So, it prints the current row (k + 1) and column (1).
4. If the effective number of steps is greater than or equal to (n - 1) but less than (n * 2 - 2), it means Lara is moving in the snake fashion. It calculates the current row and column based on the number of steps and prints them.
5. If the effective number of steps is equal to (n * 2 - 2), it means Lara has completed one full cycle of her path and is back at the starting point of the next cycle, which is (1, 2).

The program seems to handle all the edge cases correctly and follows the problem description. After analyzing the code and the problem description, I couldn't find any case where the program would not work as expected. Therefore, the program is correct.
