The function `func` accepts three parameters `n`, `m`, and `k` as input from the user, where `n` and `m` are positive integers, `n` is even, and `k` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= k < n*m`. 

Upon analyzing the code, we can see that `k` is then taken modulo `n * 2 - 2`, effectively reducing its range to `0 <= k < n * 2 - 2`. 

If `k` is less than `n - 1`, the function prints `k + 1` and `1`. 

If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1` and less than `n * 2 - 2`, the function prints `n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1` and `(k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1`. 

However, if `k` equals `n * 2 - 2`, the function prints `1` and `2`. 

It seems there's a discrepancy between the annotated code and the actual return postconditions, as the annotated code does not explicitly state what the function returns in case of an invalid `k` index. 

Upon closer inspection of the code, it appears the function does not handle cases where `n` is odd, or where `k` is out of range (`k >= n*m`). 

The code provided only handles the printing of certain values based on the input parameters and does not return any messages (success or error) as stated in the overall description of the function.

Functionality: ** The function accepts three parameters `n`, `m`, and `k` as input from the user, where `n` and `m` are positive integers and `k` is a non-negative integer, then prints specific values based on the reduced range of `k` modulo `n * 2 - 2`, without handling cases where `n` is odd or `k` is out of range, and without returning any messages. **
