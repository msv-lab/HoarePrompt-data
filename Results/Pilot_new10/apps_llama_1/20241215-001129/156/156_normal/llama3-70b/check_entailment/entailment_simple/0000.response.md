Correctness: **False**

The program provided does not accurately implement the logic described in the problem description. 

Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of k**: The program attempts to reduce `k` by taking the modulus of `k` with `n * 2 - 2`. This reduction is incorrect because it does not properly account for the snake-like movement pattern described in the problem.

2. **Failure to Account for Snake Movement Pattern**: After the initial downward movement, Lara moves in a snake-like pattern (right, up, left, up,...). The program does not correctly calculate the row and column based on this pattern.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of Row and Column**: The program calculates the row and column incorrectly. For example, when `k` is between `n-1` and `n*2-2`, the program calculates the row as `n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1` and the column as `(k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1`. However, this calculation does not accurately reflect the snake-like movement pattern.

To correctly implement the problem description, the program needs to properly handle the snake-like movement pattern and calculate the row and column accordingly.

Here is a high-level outline of the correct approach:

1. Calculate the number of complete cycles of the snake-like movement pattern.
2. Determine the remaining movements after the complete cycles.
3. Based on the remaining movements, calculate the final row and column.

The provided program does not follow this approach and therefore does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. 

Here is an example of a correct Python implementation:

```python
def func():
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    
    # Calculate the number of complete cycles
    cycle_length = 2 * (n - 1)
    cycles = k // cycle_length
    
    # Calculate the remaining movements
    remaining = k % cycle_length
    
    # Calculate the row and column
    if remaining < n - 1:
        row = remaining + 1
        col = 1
    else:
        remaining -= n - 1
        row = n - remaining % (n - 1)
        col = (remaining // (n - 1)) * 2 + 2
    
    print(row, col)
```

This implementation correctly handles the snake-like movement pattern and calculates the row and column based on the remaining movements.
