Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code seems to be correct and follows the problem description. The function reduces the range of `k` modulo `n * 2 - 2`, which is the total number of steps in one complete cycle of Lara's path. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, it means Lara is still moving down the first column, so the function prints the current row and column 1. If `k` is between `n - 1` and `n * 2 - 2`, it means Lara is moving in a snake-like fashion, so the function calculates the current row and column based on the reduced value of `k`.

The output hints agree with the code and do not indicate any incorrect handling of cases. The code also handles the examples provided in the problem description correctly. For example, when the input is `4 3 0`, the code prints `1 1`, which is the starting position of Lara. When the input is `4 3 11`, the code prints `1 2`, which is the position of Lara after she moves 11 times.

The code assumes that `n` is always even, which is stated in the problem description. It also handles the case where `k` is out of range by reducing it modulo `n * 2 - 2`. Therefore, the code seems to be correct and handles all potential cases as described in the problem description.
