Since the given code snippet is `print(row, col)`, this statement doesn't modify the values of any variables. It only prints the current values of `row` and `col`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an even positive integer and `2 <= n <= 10^9`
- `m` is a positive integer and `2 <= m <= 10^9`
- `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n * m`
- `full_rows` equals `k // (m - 1)`
- `remaining_steps` equals `k % (m - 1)`
- If `full_rows` is even, then `row` equals `n - full_rows` and is even, `col` equals `2 + remaining_steps`
- If `full_rows` is odd, then `row` equals `n - full_rows` and is odd, `col` equals `m - remaining_steps`

The `print` statement doesn't change any of these conditions or values. Therefore, after executing the `print` statement, the output state remains the same as the initial state but with the additional action that the value of `row` and `col` has been printed.

Output State: **`n` is an even positive integer and `2 <= n <= 10^9`, `m` is a positive integer and `2 <= m <= 10^9`, `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n * m`, `full_rows` equals `k // (m - 1)`, `remaining_steps` equals `k % (m - 1)`, if `full_rows` is even, then `row` equals `n - full_rows` and is even, `col` equals `2 + remaining_steps`, if `full_rows` is odd, then `row` equals `n - full_rows` and is odd, `col` equals `m - remaining_steps`, and the values of `row` and `col` have been printed**
