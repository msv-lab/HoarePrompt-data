The value of `col` is assigned as `m - remaining_steps`. Given that `remaining_steps` equals `k % (m - 1)`, we can substitute this into the equation for `col` to get `col = m - (k % (m - 1))`. 

Since `full_rows` equals `k // (m - 1)` and is odd, `row` equals `n - full_rows` and is also odd, and the relationship between `n`, `m`, `k`, `full_rows`, `remaining_steps`, and `row` remains unaffected by the introduction of `col`, these conditions remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is an even positive integer and `2 <= n <= 10^9`, `m` is a positive integer and `2 <= m <= 10^9`, `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n * m`, `full_rows` equals `k // (m - 1)` and is odd, `remaining_steps` equals `k % (m - 1)`, `row` equals `n - full_rows` and is odd, `col` equals `m - (k % (m - 1))`**
