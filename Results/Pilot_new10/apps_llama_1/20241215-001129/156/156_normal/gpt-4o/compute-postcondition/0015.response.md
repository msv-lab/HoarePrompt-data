The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `k`. `n` and `m` are positive integers where `n` is even and both are within the range of 2 to 10^9 inclusive. `k` is a non-negative integer within the range of 0 to `n * m - 1`. 

To describe the return value, we need the output details which have not been provided in the prompt. However, based on the given parameter constraints, the functionality can be partially described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, and k, where n and m are positive integers with n being even and within the range 2 to 10^9, and k is a non-negative integer less than n * m, and returns a value based on these inputs.**
