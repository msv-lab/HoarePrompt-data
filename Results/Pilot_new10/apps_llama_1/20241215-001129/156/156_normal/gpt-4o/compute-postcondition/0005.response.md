To solve this, let's consider the given initial state and the provided Python code.

Given Initial State:
- `n` is an even positive integer and `2 <= n <= 10^9`.
- `m` is a positive integer and `2 <= m <= 10^9`.
- `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n * m`.
- `full_rows` equals `k // (m - 1)`.

The code provided is:
```python
remaining_steps = k % (m - 1)
```

This line of code calculates the remainder of `k` divided by `(m - 1)` and assigns it to the variable `remaining_steps`.

Considering the initial state and the effect of the code:

- The value of `n` remains unchanged; it is still an even positive integer within the range `2 <= n <= 10^9`.
- The value of `m` remains unchanged; it is still a positive integer within the range `2 <= m <= 10^9`.
- The value of `k` remains unchanged; it is still a non-negative integer less than `n * m`.
- The value of `full_rows` remains unchanged; it equals `k // (m - 1)`.
- A new variable `remaining_steps` is introduced, which equals `k % (m - 1)`, representing the remainder of `k` divided by `(m - 1)`.

Therefore, the output state after executing the given Python code is:
Output State: **`n` is an even positive integer and `2 <= n <= 10^9`, `m` is a positive integer and `2 <= m <= 10^9`, `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n * m`, `full_rows` equals `k // (m - 1)`, and `remaining_steps` equals `k % (m - 1)`**.
