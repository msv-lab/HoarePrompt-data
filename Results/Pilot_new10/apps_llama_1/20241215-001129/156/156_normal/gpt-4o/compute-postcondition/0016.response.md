The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `k`, where `n` is an even positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, and `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n * m`. 

Upon analyzing the code, it can be observed that the function prints a pair of values based on the value of `k`. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, the function prints `(k + 1, 1)`. 

For `k >= n - 1`, the function calculates `full_rows` and `remaining_steps` based on `k` and `m`. Then, depending on whether `full_rows` is even or odd, it calculates `row` and `col` and prints the values of `row` and `col`.

There are no return statements in the function; therefore, the function does not return any value. It only prints the calculated values based on the input parameters.

Functionality: ** The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `k`, where `n` is an even positive integer and `2 <= n, m <= 10^9`, and `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n * m`, and prints a pair of values based on the value of `k`: `(k + 1, 1)` if `k < n - 1`, or `(n - full_rows, 2 + remaining_steps)` if `full_rows` is even, or `(n - full_rows, m - remaining_steps)` if `full_rows` is odd, where `full_rows = k // (m - 1)` and `remaining_steps = k % (m - 1)`. **
