The code assigns a new value to `col`. The value of `col` is now `2 + remaining_steps`. Since `remaining_steps` equals `k % (m - 1)`, the value of `col` can also be expressed as `2 + k % (m - 1)`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an even positive integer and `2 <= n <= 10^9`, `m` is a positive integer and `2 <= m <= 10^9`, `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n * m`, `full_rows` equals `k // (m - 1)` and is an even number, `remaining_steps` equals `k % (m - 1)`, `row` equals `n - full_rows` and is an even number, `col` equals `2 + k % (m - 1)` or `2 + remaining_steps`**
