The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `k`, where `n` is an even positive integer and `2 <= n, m <= 10^9`, and `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n * m`, and prints a pair of values based on the value of `k`: `(k + 1, 1)` if `k < n - 1`, or `(n - full_rows, 2 + remaining_steps)` if `full_rows` is even, or `(n - full_rows, m - remaining_steps)` if `full_rows` is odd, where `full_rows = k // (m - 1)` and `remaining_steps = k % (m - 1)`.
