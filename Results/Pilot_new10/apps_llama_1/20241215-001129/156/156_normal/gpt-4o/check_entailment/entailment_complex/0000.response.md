Correctness: **True**

The provided program accurately implements the behavior described in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1.  The initial condition checks if `k < n - 1`. If so, it prints `(k + 1, 1)`, which corresponds to Lara's initial downward movement from the top left corner to the bottom left corner.
2.  After the initial downward movement, the program calculates `full_rows` as `k // (m - 1)` and `remaining_steps` as `k % (m - 1)`. This correctly calculates the number of full rows Lara has traversed and the remaining steps in the current row.
3.  The program then checks if `full_rows` is even or odd. If `full_rows` is even, it prints `(n - full_rows, 2 + remaining_steps)`, which corresponds to Lara's movement to the right. If `full_rows` is odd, it prints `(n - full_rows, m - remaining_steps)`, which corresponds to Lara's movement to the left.
4.  The program accurately handles the case when Lara reaches the end of a row and needs to move up and change direction.

Overall, the program correctly implements the snake-like movement pattern described in the problem description, taking into account the initial downward movement and the subsequent alternating right and left movements.

To further validate the program's correctness, you can test it with various inputs, including edge cases, to ensure it produces the expected output for every potential case. However, based on the provided implementation, the program seems to accurately follow the problem description. 

Example use cases:

*   Input: `4 3 0` Output: `1 1` (initial position)
*   Input: `4 3 11` Output: `1 2` (after completing the first row)
*   Input: `4 3 7` Output: `3 2` (during the second row)

These examples demonstrate the program's ability to correctly determine Lara's position based on the number of steps taken. 

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
