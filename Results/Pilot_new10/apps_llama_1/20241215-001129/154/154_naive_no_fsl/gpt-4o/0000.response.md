Correctness: **True**

The provided program seems to correctly solve the problem described. It iterates through all possible numbers of complete tasks, calculates the remaining time, and then tries to solve as many subtasks as possible with the remaining time. It also correctly limits the number of subtasks that can be solved to the number of remaining tasks.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program is correct:

1. The program iterates through all possible numbers of complete tasks, from 0 to n. This ensures that it considers all possible cases where some tasks are completely solved and some are not.

2. For each number of complete tasks, it calculates the time used to solve these tasks and the remaining time. If the time used exceeds the total available time M, it breaks the loop because solving more tasks would only use more time.

3. The program then calculates the points earned for the completely solved tasks and tries to solve as many subtasks as possible with the remaining time.

4. It correctly limits the number of subtasks that can be solved to the number of remaining tasks. This is done by the line `subtasks_solved = min(subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k)`.

5. Finally, it updates the maximum points if the current points (points for complete tasks + points for subtasks) are greater than the current maximum.

The program seems to handle all possible cases correctly, including edge cases where n = 1, k = 1, or M = 0. It also correctly handles cases where it's optimal to solve some tasks completely and then solve some subtasks from the remaining tasks.

I couldn't find any case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
