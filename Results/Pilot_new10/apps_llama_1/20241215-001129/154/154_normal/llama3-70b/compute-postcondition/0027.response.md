The value of `dp[i][j]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`. Given that `i` is 2 and `j` is 2, `dp[2][2]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value (`dp[2][1]`) and `dp[1][2 - t[1]] + 1`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an input integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45) and must be greater than 1, `M` is an input integer (0 ≤ M ≤ 2*10^9) and must be greater than 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers representing the time in minutes required to solve each subtask in ascending order, `dp` is a `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` 2D list where `dp[2][2]` equals the maximum of `dp[2][1]` and `dp[1][2 - t[1]] + 1`, `i` is 2, `j` is 2.
