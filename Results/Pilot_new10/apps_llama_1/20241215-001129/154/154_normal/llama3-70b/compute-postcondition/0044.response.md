According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `M`. If `j` is less than `M`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, `M` is an input integer. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `j` must be less than or equal to `M`.
State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an input integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45) and must be greater than 2, `M` is an input integer (1 ≤ M ≤ 2*10^9), `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers representing the time in minutes required to solve each subtask in ascending order, `dp` is a `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` 2D list where if `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`, then `dp[3][2]` equals the maximum of `dp[3][2]` and `dp[2][2 - t[2]] + 1`, `i` is 3, `j` is 3**
