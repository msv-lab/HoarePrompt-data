The given code updates the value of `dp[i][j]` by taking the maximum of its current value and the value of `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]]` plus 1. 

So, `dp[i][j]` is now the maximum of its previous value and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`. 

Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: 
`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), 
`k` is an input integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45) and must be greater than 0, 
`M` is an input integer (1 ≤ M ≤ 2*10^9) and must be greater than 3, 
`t` is a sorted list of `k` integers representing the time in minutes required to solve each subtask in ascending order, 
`dp` is a `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` 2D list where `dp[1][3]` equals `dp[1][2]` and `dp[i][j]` equals the maximum of its previous value and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`, 
`i` is 1, 
`j` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an input integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45) and must be greater than 0, `M` is an input integer (1 ≤ M ≤ 2*10^9) and must be greater than 3, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers representing the time in minutes required to solve each subtask in ascending order, `dp` is a `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` 2D list where `dp[1][3]` equals `dp[1][2]` and `dp[1][3]` equals the maximum of its previous value and `dp[0][3 - t[0]] + 1`, `i` is 1, `j` is 3**
