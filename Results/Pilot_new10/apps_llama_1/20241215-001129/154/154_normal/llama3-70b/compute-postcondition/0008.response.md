The value of `dp[i][j]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`. The value of `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]]` is either 0 or a previously computed value. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

The precondition that `j` is greater than or equal to the time required to solve the subtask at index `i - 1` in `t` is still valid because this condition is necessary for `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]]` to be a valid index.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an input integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45) and must be greater than 0, `M` is an input integer (1 ≤ M ≤ 2*10^9), `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers representing the time in minutes required to solve each subtask in ascending order, `dp` is a `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` 2D list where `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and the current value of `j` is greater than or equal to the time required to solve the subtask at index `i - 1` in `t`.
