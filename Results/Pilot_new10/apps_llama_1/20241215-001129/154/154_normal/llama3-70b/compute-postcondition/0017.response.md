Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an input integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45) and must be greater than 0, `M` is an input integer (1 ≤ M ≤ 2*10^9) and must be greater than 3, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers representing the time in minutes required to solve each subtask in ascending order, `dp` is a `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` 2D list where `dp[1][3]` equals `dp[1][2]`, `i` is 1, `j` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`, then `dp[1][3]` equals the maximum of its previous value and `dp[0][3 - t[0]] + 1`.***
