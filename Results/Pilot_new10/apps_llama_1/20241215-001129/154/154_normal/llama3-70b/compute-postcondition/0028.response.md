Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an input integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45) and must be greater than 1, `M` is an input integer (0 ≤ M ≤ 2*10^9) and must be greater than 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers representing the time in minutes required to solve each subtask in ascending order, `dp` is a `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` 2D list where if `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`, then `dp[2][2]` equals the maximum of `dp[2][1]` and `dp[1][2 - t[1]] + 1`, `i` is 2, `j` is 2***
