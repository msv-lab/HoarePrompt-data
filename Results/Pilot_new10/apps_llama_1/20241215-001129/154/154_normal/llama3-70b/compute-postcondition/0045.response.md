The code `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]` updates the value of `dp[i][j]` to be equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 3 and `j` is 3. 

The value of `dp[3][3]` becomes equal to `dp[3][2]`. The value of `dp[3][2]` may have been updated earlier based on the condition `if j is greater than or equal to t[i - 1]`, but since `i` and `j` are fixed at 3, we are looking at the specific cell `dp[3][3]` and its relation to `dp[3][2]`.

Other variables are not affected by this update. The states of `n`, `k`, `M`, `t`, and the rest of the `dp` table remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an input integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45) and must be greater than 2, `M` is an input integer (1 ≤ M ≤ 2*10^9), `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers representing the time in minutes required to solve each subtask in ascending order, `dp` is a `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` 2D list where `dp[3][3]` equals `dp[3][2]`, `i` is 3, `j` is 3**
