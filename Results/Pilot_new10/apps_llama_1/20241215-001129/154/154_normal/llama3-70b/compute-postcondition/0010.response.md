According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `M`. If `j` is less than `M`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `M` is an input integer, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers, `dp` is a `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` 2D list, `i` is 1, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` becomes 2.
State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an input integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45) and must be greater than 0, `M` is an input integer (1 ≤ M ≤ 2*10^9), `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers representing the time in minutes required to solve each subtask in ascending order, `dp` is a `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` 2D list, `i` is 1, `j` is 2**
