According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `M`. If `j` is less than `M`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, `M` is an input integer. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `M` must be greater than 3, but `M` remains unchanged because its value is given as input, it just needs to be greater than the new value of `j`. 

State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an input integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45) and must be greater than 0, `M` is an input integer (1 ≤ M ≤ 2*10^9) and must be greater than 3, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers representing the time in minutes required to solve each subtask in ascending order, `dp` is a `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` 2D list, `i` is 1, `j` is 3**
