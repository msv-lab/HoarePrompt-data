Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an input integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45) and must be greater than 1, `M` is an input integer (0 ≤ M ≤ 2*10^9) and must be greater than 3, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers representing the time in minutes required to solve each subtask in ascending order, `i` is 2, `j` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`, then `dp[2][3]` equals the maximum of `dp[2][2]` and `dp[1][3 - t[1]] + 1`***
