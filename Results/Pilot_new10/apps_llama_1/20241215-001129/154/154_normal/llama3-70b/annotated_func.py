#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, k, and M are integers, where n is the number of tasks (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), k is the number of subtasks in each task (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), and M is the total time in minutes (0 ≤ M ≤ 2*10^9), and t_j (1 ≤ t_j ≤ 1000000) is the time in minutes required to solve the j-th subtask of any task, for j = 1 to k.
def func():
    n, k, M = map(int, input().split())
    t = list(map(int, input().split()))
    t.sort()
    dp = [([0] * (M + 1)) for _ in range(k + 1)]
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        for j in range(1, M + 1):
            dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]
            if j >= t[i - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an input integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), `M` is an input integer (0 ≤ M ≤ 2*10^9), `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers representing the time in minutes required to solve each subtask in ascending order, `dp` is a `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` 2D list where `dp[k][j]` is the maximum number of subtasks that can be solved within `j` minutes, considering all `k` subtasks, or remains unchanged if `M` is 0.
    print(sum(dp[i][M] for i in range(k + 1)) + sum(1 for i in range(k + 1) if 
    dp[i][M] == i))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts input parameters n (number of tasks), k (number of subtasks per task), M (total available time), and a list of subtask times t, sorts the subtask times, and uses dynamic programming to determine the maximum number of subtasks that can be completed within the given time M. It then calculates and prints a value based on the number of subtasks that can be completed within M and the number of subtasks where all previous subtasks can also be completed within M, effectively assessing the feasibility of completing tasks under given time constraints, albeit with a focus on subtask completion rather than task completion as a whole.
