You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp takes part in a math show. He is given n tasks, each consists of k subtasks, numbered 1 through k. It takes him t_{j} minutes to solve the j-th subtask of any task. Thus, time required to solve a subtask depends only on its index, but not on the task itself. Polycarp can solve subtasks in any order.

By solving subtask of arbitrary problem he earns one point. Thus, the number of points for task is equal to the number of solved subtasks in it. Moreover, if Polycarp completely solves the task (solves all k of its subtasks), he recieves one extra point. Thus, total number of points he recieves for the complete solution of the task is k + 1.

Polycarp has M minutes of time. What is the maximum number of points he can earn?


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integer numbers n, k and M (1 ≤ n ≤ 45, 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9).

The second line contains k integer numbers, values t_{j} (1 ≤ t_{j} ≤ 1000000), where t_{j} is the time in minutes required to solve j-th subtask of any task.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum amount of points Polycarp can earn in M minutes.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4 11
1 2 3 4

Output
6

Input
5 5 10
1 2 4 8 16

Output
7



-----Note-----

In the first example Polycarp can complete the first task and spend 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 minutes. He also has the time to solve one subtask of the second task in one minute.

In the second example Polycarp can solve the first subtask of all five tasks and spend 5·1 = 5 minutes. Also he can solve the second subtasks of two tasks and spend 2·2 = 4 minutes. Thus, he earns 5 + 2 = 7 points in total.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k, M) = map(int, input().split())
    t = list(map(int, input().split()))
    t.sort()
    dp = [[0] * (M + 1) for _ in range(k + 1)]
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        for j in range(1, M + 1):
            dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]
            if j >= t[i - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)
    print(sum((dp[i][M] for i in range(k + 1))) + sum((1 for i in range(k + 1) if dp[i][M] == i)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. 

One issue with the program is that it tries to solve the problem by calculating the maximum number of subtasks that can be completed within the given time limit for a single task. However, the problem allows Polycarp to solve subtasks in any order and from any task. 

The program does not consider the optimal strategy of solving the subtasks with the smallest time requirements first, regardless of the task they belong to. 

For example, if we have three tasks with subtasks (1, 2, 3), (1, 4, 5), and (1, 6, 7), and a time limit of 10, the program will not correctly calculate the maximum number of points that can be earned.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to calculate the total time required to solve all subtasks in each task, then use dynamic programming to find the optimal combination of tasks and subtasks that can be completed within the given time limit.

Here's an example of how the program can be corrected:

```python
def func():
    (n, k, M) = map(int, input().split())
    t = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix_sum = [0] * (k + 1)
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + t[i - 1]
    dp = [0] * (M + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(M, -1, -1):
            for l in range(1, k + 1):
                if j >= prefix_sum[l]:
                    dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j - prefix_sum[l]] + l + (1 if l == k else 0))
    print(dp[M])
```

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, k, and M are integers, where n is the number of tasks (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), k is the number of subtasks in each task (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), and M is the total time in minutes (0 ≤ M ≤ 2*10^9), and t_j (1 ≤ t_j ≤ 1000000) is the time in minutes required to solve the j-th subtask of any task, for j = 1 to k.
def func():
    n, k, M = map(int, input().split())
    t = list(map(int, input().split()))
    t.sort()
    dp = [([0] * (M + 1)) for _ in range(k + 1)]
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        for j in range(1, M + 1):
            dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]
            if j >= t[i - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an input integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), `M` is an input integer (0 ≤ M ≤ 2*10^9), `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers representing the time in minutes required to solve each subtask in ascending order, `dp` is a `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` 2D list where `dp[k][j]` is the maximum number of subtasks that can be solved within `j` minutes, considering all `k` subtasks, or remains unchanged if `M` is 0.
    print(sum(dp[i][M] for i in range(k + 1)) + sum(1 for i in range(k + 1) if 
    dp[i][M] == i))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts input parameters n (number of tasks), k (number of subtasks per task), M (total available time), and a list of subtask times t, sorts the subtask times, and uses dynamic programming to determine the maximum number of subtasks that can be completed within the given time M. It then calculates and prints a value based on the number of subtasks that can be completed within M and the number of subtasks where all previous subtasks can also be completed within M, effectively assessing the feasibility of completing tasks under given time constraints, albeit with a focus on subtask completion rather than task completion as a whole.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
