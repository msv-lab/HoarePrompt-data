Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description for every potential case. One of the main reasons is that it calculates the number of subtasks that can be solved with the remaining time after completing some tasks, but it does not consider the optimal order of subtasks.

In the problem description, it is mentioned that Polycarp can solve subtasks in any order. However, the program assumes that the subtasks are solved in the order they appear in the input list `t`. This can lead to suboptimal solutions.

For example, consider the input `n = 3, k = 4, M = 11` and `t = [1, 2, 3, 4]`. The program will first complete the first task and then try to solve remaining subtasks with the remaining time. However, it will solve the subtasks in the order of `t`, which may not be the optimal order.

To fix this, the program should consider all possible orders of subtasks and choose the one that maximizes the number of points earned.

Another issue with the program is that it calculates the number of subtasks that can be solved with the remaining time by dividing the remaining time by the time required to solve each subtask. However, this can lead to incorrect results if the remaining time is not exactly divisible by the time required to solve a subtask.

To fix this, the program should use a more sophisticated algorithm to calculate the number of subtasks that can be solved with the remaining time, such as a greedy algorithm that always chooses the subtask that requires the least amount of time.

Overall, the program does not meet the problem description for every potential case, and it needs to be modified to consider the optimal order of subtasks and to use a more sophisticated algorithm to calculate the number of subtasks that can be solved with the remaining time.

Here is a possible correction for the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(n, k, M, t):
    t.sort()  # Sort the subtasks by their time requirements
    max_points = 0
    
    for complete_tasks in range(n + 1):
        time_used = complete_tasks * sum(t)
        
        if time_used > M:
            break
        
        points = complete_tasks * (k + 1)
        
        remaining_time = M - time_used
        
        subtasks_solved = 0
        
        for subtask_time in t:
            max_subtasks_for_this_task = remaining_time // subtask_time
            subtasks_solved += max_subtasks_for_this_task
            remaining_time -= max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time
            if remaining_time <= 0:
                break
        
        subtasks_solved = min(subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k)
        
        max_points = max(max_points, points + subtasks_solved)
    
    return max_points
```

This corrected function sorts the subtasks by their time requirements and then tries to solve as many subtasks as possible with the remaining time. It also breaks out of the loop when the remaining time becomes less than or equal to zero, which prevents unnecessary iterations.
