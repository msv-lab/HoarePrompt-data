#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, M is a non-negative integer, and t is a list of k positive integers representing the time required to solve each subtask, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 45, 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, 0 ≤ M ≤ 2*10^9, and 1 ≤ t_j ≤ 1000000 for all 1 ≤ j ≤ k.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `M` is a non-negative integer, `t` is a list of `k` positive integers, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, `complete_tasks` is between 0 and `n` (inclusive), `max_points` is the maximum of `points + subtasks_solved` for all iterations, `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of the total number of subtasks that can be solved with the available time and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`, and `remaining_time` is 0 if `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task` is less than or equal to the sum of all `subtask_time` in `t`, otherwise it is `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task - subtasks_solved * subtask_time`. If the loop does not execute, `complete_tasks` is 0, `max_points` is 0, `points` is 0, `subtasks_solved` is 0, and `remaining_time` is `M`.
    return max_points
    #The program returns max_points which is the maximum of points + subtasks_solved for all iterations. Here, points is the product of complete_tasks and (k + 1), and subtasks_solved is the minimum of the total number of subtasks that can be solved with the available time and (n - complete_tasks) * k. The available time is determined by the remaining time M and the time required to complete tasks, which depends on total_time_per_task and the number of complete_tasks.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates the maximum points achievable by completing tasks and solving subtasks within a given time constraint, considering various combinations of task completion and subtask solving, and returns this maximum value, handling potential edge cases such as minimal input values and invalid input parameters.
