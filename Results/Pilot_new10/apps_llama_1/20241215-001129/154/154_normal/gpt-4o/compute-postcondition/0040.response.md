The value of `remaining_time` is decreased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time`. Since `max_subtasks_for_this_task` equals `floor((M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) / subtask_time)` and `remaining_time` is `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, we can substitute these expressions into the equation.

Given that `remaining_time` equals `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task` and `max_subtasks_for_this_task` equals `floor((M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) / subtask_time)`, when we subtract `max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time` from `remaining_time`, we are essentially subtracting the largest possible multiple of `subtask_time` that is less than or equal to `remaining_time`.

Therefore, after the subtraction, `remaining_time` will be equal to `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task - max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time`, which simplifies to a value that represents the remaining time after subtracting the maximum number of subtask times that fit into the original remaining time.

Since `max_subtasks_for_this_task` equals `floor((M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) / subtask_time)`, which is also equal to `subtasks_solved`, we can simplify this to `remaining_time` being decreased by `subtasks_solved * subtask_time`.

Additionally, given that `subtasks_solved` is `floor((M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) / subtask_time)`, after subtracting `max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time` from `remaining_time`, `subtasks_solved` should be updated accordingly as it directly depends on `remaining_time`.

The new `remaining_time` is essentially the remainder after removing the time used for the maximum number of subtasks that can fit into the original `remaining_time`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `M` is a non-negative integer, `t` is a list of `k` positive integers, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `subtasks_solved` is updated based on the new `remaining_time`, `complete_tasks` is increased by 1, `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `remaining_time` is `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task - max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time`, `subtask_time` is the first element in `t`**
