According to the code, the loop will execute if the list `t` has at least one element. Since `t` is a list of `k` positive integers, `k` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute. At the start of the loop, `subtask_time` will be the first element in the list `t`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer and `k` must be greater than 0, `M` is a non-negative integer, `t` is a list of `k` positive integers and must have at least 1 element, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `max_points` is 0, `complete_tasks` is 0, `remaining_time` is `M - time_used`, `subtasks_solved` is 0, `subtask_time` is the first element in `t`, and if `time_used` is higher than `M`, the loop or if statement is terminated, otherwise, the program continues**
