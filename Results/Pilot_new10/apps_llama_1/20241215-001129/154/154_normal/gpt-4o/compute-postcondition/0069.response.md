To calculate the output state, we need to consider the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet. The code snippet is:

```
max_subtasks_for_this_task = remaining_time // subtask_time
```

The initial state provides the following information:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `k` is a positive integer
- `M` is a non-negative integer
- `t` is a list of `k` positive integers that must have at least 2 elements
- `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`
- `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`
- `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `points`
- `complete_tasks` is at least 1
- `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`
- `subtasks_solved` is 1
- `remaining_time` is `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`
- `subtask_time` is the second element of `t`

Given this information, the only variable affected by the code snippet is `max_subtasks_for_this_task`. The value of `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is calculated as the integer division of `remaining_time` by `subtask_time`.

Since `remaining_time` is `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task` and `subtask_time` is the second element of `t`, we can express `max_subtasks_for_this_task` as:

`max_subtasks_for_this_task = (M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) // t[1]`

The states of the other variables are not changed by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `M` is a non-negative integer, `t` is a list of `k` positive integers that must have at least 2 elements, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `points`, `complete_tasks` is at least 1, `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `subtasks_solved` is 1, `remaining_time` is `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `subtask_time` is the second element of `t`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `(M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) // t[1]`**
