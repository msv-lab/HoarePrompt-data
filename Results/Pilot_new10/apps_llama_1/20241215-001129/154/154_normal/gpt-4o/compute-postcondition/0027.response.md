The given code line `subtasks_solved = min(subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k)` updates the value of `subtasks_solved` to be the minimum of its current value and the product of `(n - complete_tasks)` and `k`. 

The states of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `M`, `t`, `total_time_per_task`, `points`, `max_points`, `complete_tasks`, and `remaining_time`) are not affected by this code line.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` is a positive integer, 
`k` is a positive integer, 
`M` is a non-negative integer, 
`t` is a list of `k` positive integers, 
`total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, 
`points` is 0, 
`max_points` is 0, 
`complete_tasks` is 0, 
`remaining_time` is `(M - time_used)` minus the total time used to solve all possible subtasks, 
and `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its previous value and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `M` is a non-negative integer, `t` is a list of `k` positive integers, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, `points` is 0, `max_points` is 0, `complete_tasks` is 0, `remaining_time` is `(M - time_used)` minus the total time used to solve all possible subtasks, and `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its previous value and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`**
