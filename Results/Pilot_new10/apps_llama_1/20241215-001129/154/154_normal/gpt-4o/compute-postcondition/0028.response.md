The value of `max_points` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the sum of `points` and `subtasks_solved`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `M` is a non-negative integer, `t` is a list of `k` positive integers, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, `points` is 0, `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `points + subtasks_solved`, `complete_tasks` is 0, `remaining_time` is `(M - time_used)` minus the total time used to solve all possible subtasks, and `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its previous value and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`.
