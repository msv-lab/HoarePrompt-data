The code `remaining_time -= max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time` decreases the value of `remaining_time` by the product of `max_subtasks_for_this_task` and `subtask_time`. 

Given that `subtask_time` is the first element in `t`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `(M - time_used) // (first element in `t`)`, and `remaining_time` is `M - time_used`, the new value of `remaining_time` can be expressed as `M - time_used - ((M - time_used) // (first element in `t`)) * (first element in `t`)`.

Since `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is an integer division of `(M - time_used)` by `(first element in `t`)`, the product `max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time` will be equal to `(M - time_used)` minus the remainder of `(M - time_used)` divided by `(first element in `t`)`. 

Thus, `remaining_time` becomes the remainder of `(M - time_used)` divided by `(first element in `t`)`, i.e., `(M - time_used) % (first element in `t`)`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer and `k` must be greater than 0, `M` is a non-negative integer, `t` is a list of `k` positive integers and must have at least 1 element, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `max_points` is 0, `complete_tasks` is 0, `subtask_time` is the first element in `t`, `remaining_time` is `(M - time_used) % (first element in `t`)`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `(M - time_used) // (first element in `t`)`, `subtasks_solved` is `subtasks_solved + (M - time_used) // t[0]`.
