According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `t`. If the list has at least 2 elements, the loop executes again for the next element. At the end of the last iteration, `t` has at least 2 elements. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `t` must have at least 3 elements and `subtask_time` is the next element in the list.

Since `t` is a list of `k` positive integers and `k` must be greater than 1, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be greater than 2 (because we've already processed one element in the previous iteration, and we need at least one more element to process).

Also, since we are processing the next element in the list `t`, `total_time_per_task` remains the same as it is the sum of all elements in `t`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer and `k` must be greater than 2, `M` is a non-negative integer, `t` is a list of `k` positive integers and must have at least 3 elements, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `max_points` is 0, `complete_tasks` is 0**
