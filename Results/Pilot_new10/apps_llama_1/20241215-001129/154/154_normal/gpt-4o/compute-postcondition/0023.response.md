The value of `subtasks_solved` is incremented by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`. The previous value of `subtasks_solved` is not explicitly stated, but it is implied to be an existing variable. Since `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is the integer part of `remaining_time // subtask_time`, the new value of `subtasks_solved` is the old value of `subtasks_solved` plus the integer part of `remaining_time // subtask_time`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer and `k` must be greater than 2, `M` is a non-negative integer, `t` is a list of `k` positive integers and must have at least 3 elements, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `max_points` is 0, `complete_tasks` is 0, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is the integer part of `remaining_time // subtask_time`, and `subtasks_solved` is the old value of `subtasks_solved` plus `max_subtasks_for_this_task`**
