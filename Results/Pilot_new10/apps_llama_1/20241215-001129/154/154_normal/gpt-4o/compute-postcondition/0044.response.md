The code increments `subtasks_solved` by the value of `max_subtasks_for_this_task`. The value of `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is calculated as `remaining_time // subtask_time`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` is a positive integer, 
`k` is a positive integer, 
`M` is a non-negative integer, 
`t` is a list of at least `k-1` positive integers, 
`total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, 
`points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, 
`max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, 
`complete_tasks` remains the same as it was updated in the last iteration, 
`time_used` remains the same, 
`remaining_time` is `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, 
`subtask_time` is the next element in `t`, 
`max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `remaining_time // subtask_time`, 
`subtasks_solved` is incremented by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `M` is a non-negative integer, `t` is a list of at least `k-1` positive integers, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `complete_tasks` remains the same, `time_used` remains the same, `remaining_time` is `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `subtask_time` is the next element in `t`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `remaining_time // subtask_time`, `subtasks_solved` is the previous value of `subtasks_solved` plus `max_subtasks_for_this_task`**
