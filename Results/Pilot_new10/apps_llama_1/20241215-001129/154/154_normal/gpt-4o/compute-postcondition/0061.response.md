The value of `subtasks_solved` is set to 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
`n` is still a positive integer, `k` is still a positive integer, `M` is still a non-negative integer, `t` is still a list of `k` positive integers, `total_time_per_task` is still the sum of all elements in `t`, `points` is still `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `max_points` is still the maximum of its previous value and `points + subtasks_solved`, `complete_tasks` is still at least 1 more than its previous value, `time_used` is still `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `remaining_time` is still `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `M` is a non-negative integer, `t` is a list of `k` positive integers, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `points`, `complete_tasks` has been incremented by at least 1 and is now at least 1 more than its previous value, `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `subtasks_solved` is 0, `remaining_time` is `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`**
