Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer and `k` must be greater than 0, `M` is a non-negative integer, `t` is a list of `k` positive integers and must have at least 1 element, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `max_points` is 0, `complete_tasks` is 0, if `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, then `remaining_time` is `(M - time_used) % (first element in `t`)`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `(M - time_used) // (first element in `t`)`, and `subtasks_solved` is `subtasks_solved + (M - time_used) // t[0]`; otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
