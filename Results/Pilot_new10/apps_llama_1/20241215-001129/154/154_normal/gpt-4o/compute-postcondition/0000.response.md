The variable `total_time_per_task` is assigned the value of the sum of all elements in the list `t`, which represents the total time required to solve all subtasks. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 
So, n is still a positive integer, k is still a positive integer, M is still a non-negative integer, and t is still a list of k positive integers.

Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, M is a non-negative integer, t is a list of k positive integers, and total_time_per_task is the sum of all elements in t**
