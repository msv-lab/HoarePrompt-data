To determine the output state, we need to consider the impact of the given code on the program. The code updates the value of `max_points` by taking the maximum of its current value and the sum of `points` and `subtasks_solved`.

Given:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `k` is a positive integer
- `M` is a non-negative integer
- `t` is a list of `k` positive integers
- `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`
- `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`
- `max_points` is initially the maximum of its previous value and `points`
- `complete_tasks` is at least 1
- `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`
- `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of the total number of subtasks that can be solved with the available time `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task` and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`
- `remaining_time` is 0 if `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task` is less than or equal to the sum of all `subtask_time` in `t`, otherwise it is `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task - subtasks_solved * subtask_time`

The code line `max_points = max(max_points, points + subtasks_solved)` updates `max_points` to be the maximum of its current value and the sum of `points` and `subtasks_solved`. This means `max_points` will either remain the same if `points + subtasks_solved` is less than or equal to the current `max_points`, or it will increase to `points + subtasks_solved` if this sum is greater than the current `max_points`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `k` is a positive integer
- `M` is a non-negative integer
- `t` is a list of `k` positive integers
- `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`
- `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`
- `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `points + subtasks_solved`
- `complete_tasks` is at least 1
- `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`
- `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of the total number of subtasks that can be solved with the available time `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task` and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`
- `remaining_time` is 0 if `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task` is less than or equal to the sum of all `subtask_time` in `t`, otherwise it is `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task - subtasks_solved * subtask_time`

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `M` is a non-negative integer, `t` is a list of `k` positive integers, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `points + subtasks_solved`, `complete_tasks` is at least 1, `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of the total number of subtasks that can be solved with the available time `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task` and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`, `remaining_time` is 0 if `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task` is less than or equal to the sum of all `subtask_time` in `t`, otherwise it is `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task - subtasks_solved * subtask_time`**
