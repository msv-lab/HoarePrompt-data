Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `M` is a non-negative integer, `t` is a list of at least `k` positive integers, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `complete_tasks` remains the same, `time_used` remains the same, `subtask_time` is the next element in `t`. If `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, then `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `remaining_time // subtask_time`, `subtasks_solved` is `subtasks_solved + max_subtasks_for_this_task`, and `remaining_time` is `remaining_time - max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time`. Otherwise, the values of `max_subtasks_for_this_task`, `subtasks_solved`, and `remaining_time` remain unchanged.***
