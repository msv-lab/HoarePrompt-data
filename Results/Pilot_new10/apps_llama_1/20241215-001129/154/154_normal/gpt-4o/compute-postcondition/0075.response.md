The given code increments the `subtasks_solved` variable by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`. The value of `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `remaining_time // t[1]`. 

`subtasks_solved` is initially `1 + (M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) // t[1]`, and it becomes `1 + (M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) // t[1] + remaining_time // t[1]`. 

The `remaining_time` is initially `(M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) % t[1]`. After the increment operation, `remaining_time` will be decreased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task * t[1]`, which equals `remaining_time - (remaining_time // t[1]) * t[1]`, but since `remaining_time // t[1]* t[1]` equals the integer part of `remaining_time`, `remaining_time` becomes `remaining_time % t[1]`. Since `remaining_time` is the remainder when divided by `t[1]`, `remaining_time % t[1]` equals `remaining_time`. 

However, because `subtasks_solved` has been increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`, this means that `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task` has been decreased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task * t[1]`. This implies that the new value of `remaining_time` should be calculated using the updated value of `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`. 

The new `remaining_time` is `(M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task - max_subtasks_for_this_task * t[1]) % t[1]`, but since `max_subtasks_for_this_task * t[1]` is the integer part of `remaining_time`, the new `remaining_time` becomes `remaining_time - (remaining_time // t[1]) * t[1]`, which equals `remaining_time % t[1]`. But since `remaining_time` is already the remainder, `remaining_time % t[1]` equals `remaining_time`. 

However, because `max_subtasks_for_this_task * t[1]` has been subtracted from `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, the correct calculation should consider this. 

`remaining_time` initially equals `(M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) % t[1]`, which means `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task` equals `remaining_time + k * t[1]` for some integer `k`. 

Then, `max_subtasks_for_this_task * t[1]` equals `remaining_time - remaining_time % t[1]`, so when this is subtracted, `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task` becomes `remaining_time + k * t[1] - (remaining_time - remaining_time % t[1])`, which simplifies to `remaining_time % t[1] + k * t[1]`. 

Finally, `remaining_time` becomes `(remaining_time % t[1] + k * t[1]) % t[1]`, which equals `remaining_time % t[1]`. But this is just `remaining_time`, because `remaining_time` is already the remainder when divided by `t[1]`. 

However, since we have `remaining_time` and `max_subtasks_for_this_task`, and `max_subtasks_for_this_task` equals `remaining_time // t[1]`, `remaining_time` equals `max_subtasks_for_this_task * t[1] + remaining_time % t[1]`. 

After the subtraction, `remaining_time` becomes `remaining_time % t[1]`. 

The new `subtasks_solved` is `1 + (M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) // t[1] + max_subtasks_for_this_task`. 

Given that `max_subtasks_for_this_task` equals `remaining_time // t[1]`, the new `subtasks_solved` equals `1 + (M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) // t[1] + (remaining_time // t[1])`, which equals `1 + ((M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) + remaining_time) // t[1]`. 

Since `remaining_time` equals `(M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) % t[1]`, we have `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task + remaining_time` equals `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task + (M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) % t[1]`. 

However, because `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task` equals `remaining_time + k * t[1]` for some integer `k`, we have `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task + remaining_time` equals `remaining_time + k * t[1] + remaining_time`, which equals `2 * remaining_time + k * t[1]`. 

The new `subtasks_solved` equals `1 + (2 * remaining_time + k * t[1]) // t[1]`, which equals `1 + 2 * (remaining_time // t[1]) + k`. 

Since `remaining_time` equals `remaining_time % t[1]` after the subtraction, `remaining_time // t[1]` equals `0`, so `2 * (remaining_time // t[1])` equals `0`. 

Then, `subtasks_solved` equals `1 + k`, where `k` is an integer such that `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task` equals `remaining_time + k * t[1]`. 

The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged.
