The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `k`, `M`, and `t`, where `n` and `k` are positive integers, `M` is a non-negative integer, and `t` is a list of `k` positive integers. 

Based on the provided code, the function calculates the maximum points achievable by completing tasks and solving subtasks within the given time constraint `M`. 

The function iterates over the possible number of complete tasks from 0 to `n`, and for each complete task, it calculates the time used and the remaining time. 

It then calculates the maximum number of subtasks that can be solved with the remaining time and adds this to the points earned from completing tasks.

The function returns the maximum points achievable across all iterations.

However, there are potential edge cases to consider, such as when `n` or `k` is 1, or when `M` is 0. 

In these cases, the function will still return the maximum points achievable, but the calculation may be simplified.

Additionally, the function assumes that the input parameters are valid, i.e., `n` and `k` are positive integers, `M` is a non-negative integer, and `t` is a list of `k` positive integers. 

If the input parameters are not valid, the function may not work correctly.

Functionality: ** The function calculates the maximum points achievable by completing tasks and solving subtasks within a given time constraint, considering various combinations of task completion and subtask solving, and returns this maximum value, handling potential edge cases such as minimal input values and invalid input parameters. **
