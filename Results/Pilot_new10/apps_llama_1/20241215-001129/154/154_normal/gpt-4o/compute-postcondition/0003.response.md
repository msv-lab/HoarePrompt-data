To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `k` is a positive integer
- `M` is a non-negative integer
- `t` is a list of `k` positive integers
- `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`
- `max_points` is 0
- `complete_tasks` is 0

The given code is:
```python
time_used = complete_tasks * total_time_per_task
```

The impact of the code is to introduce a new variable `time_used` and calculate its value based on `complete_tasks` and `total_time_per_task`. Since `complete_tasks` is 0, the value of `time_used` will be 0 regardless of the value of `total_time_per_task`.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `k` is a positive integer
- `M` is a non-negative integer
- `t` is a list of `k` positive integers
- `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`
- `max_points` is 0
- `complete_tasks` is 0
- `time_used` is 0

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `M` is a non-negative integer, `t` is a list of `k` positive integers, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, `max_points` is 0, `complete_tasks` is 0, `time_used` is 0**
