To calculate the output state, we first note that the code given is `remaining_time = M - time_used`. 

- `n` is a positive integer.
- `k` is a positive integer.
- `M` is a non-negative integer.
- `t` is a list of `k` positive integers.
- `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`.
- `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`.
- `max_points` is 0.
- `complete_tasks` is 0.
- The condition regarding `time_used` and `M` affects the program flow but does not directly alter the variable values.

The new variable `remaining_time` is introduced, which equals `M - time_used`. 

Given that `time_used` is not defined in the initial state, `remaining_time` will be `M - time_used`, whatever `time_used` is. Since `M` is a non-negative integer, the value of `remaining_time` depends on `M` and `time_used`. 

However, since `time_used` is mentioned in the context of being compared to `M` for program termination or continuation, it implies `time_used` has a value but is not specified in the initial state.

Therefore, the output state, including all information from the precondition that is still valid and updating the values of variables changed by the code, is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `M` is a non-negative integer, `t` is a list of `k` positive integers, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `max_points` is 0, `complete_tasks` is 0, `remaining_time` is `M - time_used`, and if `time_used` is higher than `M`, the loop or if statement is terminated, otherwise, the program continues**
