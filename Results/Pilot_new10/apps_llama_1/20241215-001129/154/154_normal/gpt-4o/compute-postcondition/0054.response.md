The code updates the value of `max_points`. The new value of `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and the sum of `points` and `subtasks_solved`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `M` is a non-negative integer, `t` is a list of `k` positive integers, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, `points` is determined by external conditions, `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `points + subtasks_solved`, `complete_tasks` has been incremented by at least 1, `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its previous value and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`, and `remaining_time` is updated based on the solved subtasks**
