Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `M` is a non-negative integer, `t` is a list of `k` positive integers, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `complete_tasks` is increased by 1, `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, if `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, then `subtasks_solved` is updated based on the new `remaining_time` and `remaining_time` is `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task - max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time`. If `remaining_time` is less than `subtask_time`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged except for `complete_tasks` and `time_used` which are still updated, and `remaining_time` is `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`.***
