Correctness: **False**.

The program is not correct for all potential cases. It incorrectly assumes that the subtasks that can be solved with the remaining time are always the ones with the smallest time requirement. This is not necessarily true.

For example, consider the case where `n = 2`, `k = 2`, `M = 5`, and `t = [1, 4]`. The optimal solution is to solve the first subtask of both tasks, which takes a total of 2 minutes, and then solve the second subtask of one task, which takes 4 minutes. This gives a total of 3 + 1 = 4 points. However, the program will not consider this solution because it only considers solving the subtasks in the order of their time requirement.

A more correct approach would be to use dynamic programming to find the maximum number of points that can be earned for each possible remaining time. This would allow the program to consider all possible solutions, not just the ones that involve solving the subtasks in the order of their time requirement.

Here is an example of a case where the program does not work correctly:

Input:
```
2 2 5
1 4
```
Expected output: 4
Actual output: 3

In this case, the program only considers solving the first subtask of both tasks, which gives 2 points, and does not consider solving the second subtask of one task, which would give an additional 2 points.
