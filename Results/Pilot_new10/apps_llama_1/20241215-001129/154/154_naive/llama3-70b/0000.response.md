Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The program attempts to use dynamic programming to find the maximum number of points Polycarp can earn, but it has a few issues.

One of the main issues with the program is that it does not consider the fact that Polycarp can solve subtasks from different tasks. The program only considers solving subtasks from a single task, which is not the case in the problem description. The problem states that Polycarp can solve subtasks in any order, which means he can switch between tasks.

Another issue with the program is that it does not correctly calculate the maximum number of points Polycarp can earn. The program uses a dynamic programming approach, but it does not consider the bonus point that Polycarp receives for completing a task.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider all possible combinations of subtasks that Polycarp can solve within the given time limit. We need to use a more sophisticated dynamic programming approach that takes into account the fact that Polycarp can solve subtasks from different tasks and that he receives a bonus point for completing a task.

A correct solution to this problem would involve using a 3D dynamic programming array, where the dimensions represent the number of tasks, the number of subtasks, and the time limit, respectively. The program would then need to iterate over all possible combinations of subtasks and tasks, and calculate the maximum number of points Polycarp can earn within the given time limit.

For example, if we consider the input `3 4 11` and `1 2 3 4`, the program should return `6`, because Polycarp can complete the first task and solve one subtask from the second task. However, the given program does not produce the correct output for this input.

Here is an example of a correct solution in Python:
```python
import itertools

def func():
    (n, k, M) = map(int, input().split())
    t = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_points = 0

    for subtasks in itertools.product(range(k + 1), repeat=n):
        time = 0
        points = 0
        for i, task_subtasks in enumerate(subtasks):
            for j in range(task_subtasks):
                time += t[j]
                points += 1
                if time > M:
                    break
            if time <= M and task_subtasks == k:
                points += 1
            if time > M:
                break
        max_points = max(max_points, points)

    print(max_points)

func()
```
This solution uses the `itertools.product` function to generate all possible combinations of subtasks, and then calculates the maximum number of points Polycarp can earn within the given time limit.
