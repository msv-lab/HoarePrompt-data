The value of `s` is updated to be the input string. The length of `s` is no longer necessarily equal to `n`, as `n` is now an input integer and `s` can be of any length. The states of the other variables, `n` and `k`, are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is an input string.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is an input string**
