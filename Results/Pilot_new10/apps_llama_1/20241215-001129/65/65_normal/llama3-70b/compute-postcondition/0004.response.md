Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least 1 character, `color_count` is a dictionary that initially was empty, `c` is the first character in the string. The current value of `c` is a key in the `color_count` dictionary, meaning the first character of the string `s` has been added to the dictionary `color_count` at some point before this condition.**
