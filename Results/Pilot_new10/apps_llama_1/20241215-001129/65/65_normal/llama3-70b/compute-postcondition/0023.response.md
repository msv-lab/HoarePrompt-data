Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `c` is the last character in `s` if `s` is not empty, otherwise `c` is undefined, `color_count` is a dictionary where each key is a unique character from `s` and the value associated with each key is the frequency of that character in `s`, and `max_color_count` is the maximum value in `color_count.values()`. If `max_color_count` is less than or equal to `k`, 'YES' has been printed to the output. Otherwise, 'NO' has been printed to the console.**
