Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 100, `s` is a string of length `n` with at least one character, `color_count` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair. If the frequency of the first character in `s` is higher than `k`, then `can_distribute` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
