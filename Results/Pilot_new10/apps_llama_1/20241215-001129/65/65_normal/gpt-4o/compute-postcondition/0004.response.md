Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 100, `s` is a string of length `n` with at least 1 character,  `color` is the first character in the string `s`, `color_count` is a dictionary that initially was empty but now contains at least one key which is the current value of `color`. The current value of `color` is a key in `color_count`.**
