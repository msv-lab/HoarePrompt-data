Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 100, `s` is a string of length `n` with at least 1 character, `color` is the first character in the string `s`, and `color_count` is a dictionary where if `color` was already a key, its count is incremented by 1, otherwise `color` is added as a key with a count of 1***
