The function reads two integers `n` and `k`, and a string `s` of length `n`, then checks if the frequency of each character in `s` is less than or equal to `k`. If all frequencies are within the limit, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO', covering all potential cases based on the actual code execution
