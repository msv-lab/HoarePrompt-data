Correctness: **True**

The provided code seems to be correct and follows the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` to calculate the decimal value of a number in the golden system notation. This function uses the formula for the decimal value of the golden system, which is the sum of the digits weighted by powers of `q`, where `q` is approximately 1.618033988749895.

The code correctly handles the input strings, calculates the decimal values of the two numbers, and compares them to determine which one is larger. The output hints agree with the code, and the function `func_1` correctly handles the conversion of the golden system numbers to decimal values.

The code also correctly handles the case where the input strings are empty, as it will return 0 for an empty string. However, it does not explicitly check for empty strings, as the `enumerate` function will simply not iterate over anything if the string is empty.

The code does not explicitly handle the case where the input strings contain characters other than '0' and '1', but it will raise a ValueError when trying to convert such characters to integers. While this is not the most elegant solution, it does prevent the function from returning incorrect results in such cases.

The examples provided in the problem description are also correctly handled by the code. For instance, the code correctly determines that the decimal value of "1000" is less than the decimal value of "111", and that the decimal values of "00100" and "11" are equal.

Overall, the code seems to be correct and follows the problem description. It correctly handles all the potential cases, including empty strings and strings containing characters other than '0' and '1'.
