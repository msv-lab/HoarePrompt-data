The original assessment of the program's correctness as **True** is accurate. The provided code correctly implements the functionality to compare two numbers in the golden system notation. It uses the given formula to convert each number to its decimal equivalent and then compares them. 

The function `func_1(s)` correctly calculates the decimal equivalent of a number in the golden system notation. It iterates over each digit in the string, converts it to an integer, and multiplies it by the corresponding power of `q`. This is in line with the problem description.

The output hints also confirm that the function `func_1(s)` works as expected. It accepts a string `s` consisting of '0' and '1' characters and returns the sum of the decimal values of the characters in string `s` weighted by powers of a constant `q`.

One potential point of concern is that the function `func_1(s)` does not explicitly handle the case where the input string is empty. However, according to the problem description, the input will always be a non-empty string. Therefore, this is not a case where the program would not work as expected according to the problem description.

The output hints also mention that if the string contains characters other than '0' and '1', it raises a ValueError. However, according to the problem description, the input will always be a string consisting of '0' and '1' characters. Therefore, this is not a case where the program would not work as expected according to the problem description.

In conclusion, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, the original assessment of the program's correctness as **True** is accurate.

Final: **True**
