Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly compares two numbers written in the golden system notation. The function `func_1(s)` calculates the decimal value of a given number in the golden system by summing up the weighted '1's, where each '1' is weighted by the golden ratio raised to the power of its position from the end of the string.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the code works correctly:

1. The program defines the golden ratio `q` using the formula `(5 ** 0.5 + 1) / 2`.
2. The function `func_1(s)` initializes a variable `value` to 0 and calculates the length `n` of the input string `s`.
3. The function then iterates over the characters in the string `s`. If a character is '1', it adds the weighted value of '1' to the `value`, where the weight is `q` raised to the power of `n - i - 1`.
4. The program calculates the decimal values of the two input numbers using the `func_1(s)` function and compares them to determine the output.

The program correctly handles all the examples provided in the problem description, including the edge cases where the input numbers are equal. The output hints also agree with the code and do not reveal any potential cases where the program may not work correctly.

In terms of potential edge cases, the program handles strings of varying lengths and containing only '0's and '1's as specified in the problem description. It also correctly handles the case where the input numbers have different lengths.

Overall, the program correctly implements the required functionality and works as expected for all potential cases.
