You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Piegirl got bored with binary, decimal and other integer based counting systems. Recently she discovered some interesting properties about number $q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2}$, in particular that q^2 = q + 1, and she thinks it would make a good base for her new unique system. She called it "golden system". In golden system the number is a non-empty string containing 0's and 1's as digits. The decimal value of expression a_0a_1...a_{n} equals to $\sum_{i = 0}^{n} a_{i} \cdot q^{n - i}$.

Soon Piegirl found out that this system doesn't have same properties that integer base systems do and some operations can not be performed on it. She wasn't able to come up with a fast way of comparing two numbers. She is asking for your help.

Given two numbers written in golden system notation, determine which of them has larger decimal value.


-----Input-----

Input consists of two lines — one for each number. Each line contains non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters. The length of each string does not exceed 100000.


-----Output-----

Print ">" if the first number is larger, "<" if it is smaller and "=" if they are equal.


-----Examples-----
Input
1000
111

Output
<

Input
00100
11

Output
=

Input
110
101

Output
>



-----Note-----

In the first example first number equals to $((\sqrt{5} + 1) / 2)^{3} \approx 1.618033988^{3} \approx 4.236$, while second number is approximately 1.618033988^2 + 1.618033988 + 1 ≈ 5.236, which is clearly a bigger number.

In the second example numbers are equal. Each of them is  ≈ 2.618.
Program:
```
s1 = input().strip()
s2 = input().strip()
value1 = func_1(s1)
value2 = func_1(s2)
if value1 > value2:
    print('>')
elif value1 < value2:
    print('<')
else:
    print('=')

def func_1(s):
    q = (5 ** 0.5 + 1) / 2
    value = 0
    n = len(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '1':
            value += q ** (n - i - 1)
    return value


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program accurately compares two numbers written in the golden system notation and prints whether the first number is larger, smaller, or equal to the second number.

Here's an explanation of why the code is correct:

1. The `func_1` function calculates the decimal value of a number written in the golden system notation. It does this by iterating over each digit in the string, and for each '1', it adds the corresponding power of `q` to the total value.

2. The powers of `q` are calculated as `q ** (n - i - 1)`, where `n` is the length of the string and `i` is the current index. This corresponds to the formula provided in the problem description: $\sum_{i = 0}^{n} a_{i} \cdot q^{n - i}$.

3. The program then compares the decimal values of the two input numbers and prints the correct output based on the comparison.

After reviewing the code, I was unable to find any potential cases where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The program correctly handles the conversion from the golden system to decimal and makes the correct comparisons between the two input numbers. 

Therefore, the code appears to be correct for all possible inputs.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a non-empty string s consisting of '0' and '1' characters and returns the sum of weighted '1's, where each '1' is weighted by the golden ratio raised to the power of its position from the end of the string, ignoring any '0's and other characters. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
