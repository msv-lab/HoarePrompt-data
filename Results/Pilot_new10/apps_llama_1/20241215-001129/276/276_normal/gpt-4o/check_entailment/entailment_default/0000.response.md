Correctness: **True**

The provided code accurately implements the golden system, which is a unique counting system based on the golden ratio q = (sqrt(5) + 1) / 2. The code calculates the decimal value of two input numbers written in this system and compares them.

The function `func_1(s)` correctly calculates the decimal value of a given golden system number `s`. It does this by iterating over the string `s`, checking each character. If the character is '1', it adds the weighted value of that '1' to the total value. The weighted value is the golden ratio `q` raised to the power of the position of the '1' from the end of the string.

The main part of the code then compares the decimal values of the two input numbers and prints the appropriate comparison symbol ('>', '<', or '=').

The output hints agree with the code and provide a clear explanation of how the `func_1(s)` function works. They also help confirm that the code correctly handles the conversion from the golden system to decimal.

The examples given in the problem description also work correctly with the provided code. For instance, in the first example, the code correctly determines that the decimal value of '1000' is less than the decimal value of '111'. In the second example, it correctly determines that the decimal values of '00100' and '11' are equal.

Overall, the code accurately implements the golden system and correctly compares the decimal values of two input numbers. Therefore, it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
