#State of the program right berfore the function call: s1 and s2 are non-empty strings consisting of '0' and '1' characters, with lengths not exceeding 100000.
def func_1(s):
    q = (5 ** 0.5 + 1) / 2
    value = 0
    n = len(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '1':
            value += q ** (n - i - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s1` and `s2` are non-empty strings consisting of '0' and '1' characters with lengths not exceeding 100000, `q` is `(5*len(s1)+3*len(s2))`, `n` is either `len(s1)` or `len(s2)` and is greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, and `value` is the sum of `(5*len(s1)+3*len(s2))` raised to the power of `(n - i - 1)` for each '1' encountered in the string `s` being iterated over.
    return value
    #The program returns the sum of weighted '1's in either string `s1` or `s2`, where each '1' is weighted by `(5*len(s1)+3*len(s2))` raised to the power of its position from the end of the string, reflecting a calculation dependent on the lengths of `s1` and `s2` and the distribution of '1's in the iterated string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-empty string s consisting of '0' and '1' characters and returns the sum of weighted '1's, where each '1' is weighted by the golden ratio raised to the power of its position from the end of the string, ignoring any '0's and other characters.
