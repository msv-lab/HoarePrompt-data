You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: As you know, every birthday party has a cake! This time, Babaei is going to prepare the very special birthday party's cake.

Simple cake is a cylinder of some radius and height. The volume of the simple cake is equal to the volume of corresponding cylinder. Babaei has n simple cakes and he is going to make a special cake placing some cylinders on each other.

However, there are some additional culinary restrictions. The cakes are numbered in such a way that the cake number i can be placed only on the table or on some cake number j where j < i. Moreover, in order to impress friends Babaei will put the cake i on top of the cake j only if the volume of the cake i is strictly greater than the volume of the cake j.

Babaei wants to prepare a birthday cake that has a maximum possible total volume. Help him find this value.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of simple cakes Babaei has.

Each of the following n lines contains two integers r_{i} and h_{i} (1 ≤ r_{i}, h_{i} ≤ 10 000), giving the radius and height of the i-th cake.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum volume of the cake that Babaei can make. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 6}.

Namely: let's assume that your answer is a, and the answer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct, if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1, b)} \leq 10^{-6}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
2
100 30
40 10

Output
942477.796077000

Input
4
1 1
9 7
1 4
10 7

Output
3983.539484752



-----Note-----

In first sample, the optimal way is to choose the cake number 1.

In second sample, the way to get the maximum volume is to use cakes with indices 1, 2 and 4.
Program:
```
import sys
import math

input = sys.stdin.read
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

def func_1(n, cakes):
    volumes = [math.pi * r * r * h for (r, h) in cakes]
    dp = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = volumes[i]
        for j in range(i):
            if volumes[j] < volumes[i]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + volumes[i])
    return max(dp)

def func_2():
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    cakes = [(int(data[2 * i + 1]), int(data[2 * i + 2])) for i in range(n)]
    result = func_1(n, cakes)
    print(f'{result:.6f}')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program seems to correctly implement the solution to the problem. Here's why:

1. The program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the maximum volume of the cake that can be made by stacking the simple cakes. This function uses dynamic programming to find the optimal solution.

2. The dynamic programming table `dp` is initialized with the volumes of the individual cakes. Then, for each cake, it iterates through all the previous cakes and checks if the current cake can be stacked on top of the previous cake (i.e., if the volume of the previous cake is less than the volume of the current cake).

3. If a cake can be stacked on top of a previous cake, the program updates the maximum volume of the current cake to be the maximum of its current volume and the sum of its volume and the maximum volume of the previous cake.

4. Finally, the program returns the maximum volume of all the cakes, which is the maximum value in the `dp` table.

5. The `func_2` function reads the input data and calls the `func_1` function to calculate and print the maximum volume of the cake.

The program seems to handle all the edge cases correctly, including:

* If there is only one cake, the program returns its volume.
* If there are multiple cakes, the program correctly stacks them to find the maximum volume.
* If a cake cannot be stacked on top of any previous cake, the program still returns the correct maximum volume.

After analyzing the code and the problem description, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work correctly. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
input = sys.stdin.read
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

import sys
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, cakes is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the radius and height of a cake, and the length of cakes is equal to n.
def func_1(n, cakes):
    volumes = [(math.pi * r * r * h) for r, h in cakes]
    dp = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = volumes[i]
        
        for j in range(i):
            if volumes[j] < volumes[i]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + volumes[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `cakes` is a list of tuples, `volumes` is a list of `n` positive floating-point numbers, and `dp` is a list of `n` values where each `dp[i]` represents the maximum volume that can be stacked using the first `i+1` volumes under the condition that each volume must be smaller than the one it is stacked on. If `n` is 0, `dp` is a list of zeros.
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the maximum volume that can be stacked using the volumes in the list `volumes` under the condition that each volume must be smaller than the one it is stacked on, which is the maximum value in the list `dp`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, cakes is a list of n tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the radius and height of a cake.
def func_2():
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    cakes = [(int(data[2 * i + 1]), int(data[2 * i + 2])) for i in range(n)]
    result = func_1(n, cakes)
    print(f'{result:.6f}')


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
