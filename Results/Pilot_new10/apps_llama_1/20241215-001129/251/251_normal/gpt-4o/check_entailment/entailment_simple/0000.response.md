Correctness: **True**

The program follows the problem description and correctly calculates the maximum volume of the cake that can be made by stacking cakes with strictly increasing volumes.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The program reads the input correctly and initializes the variables `n` and `cakes` as required.
2. The function `func_1` calculates the volumes of the cakes and initializes a dynamic programming table `dp` to store the maximum volume that can be stacked using the first `i+1` cakes.
3. The program then iterates over the cakes and for each cake, it checks all previous cakes with smaller volumes. If it finds a previous cake with a smaller volume, it updates the `dp` value for the current cake to be the maximum of its current volume and the volume of the previous cake plus the volume of the current cake.
4. The program finally returns the maximum value in the `dp` table, which represents the maximum volume of the cake that can be made.
5. The function `func_2` calls `func_1` with the correct parameters and prints the result with the required precision.

The program correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem, and it checks all possible combinations of cakes to ensure that the maximum volume is calculated correctly. The program also handles the constraints of the problem, such as the requirement that each cake must be placed on top of a cake with a smaller volume.

The time complexity of the program is O(n^2), where n is the number of cakes, which is acceptable for the given constraints. The space complexity is O(n), which is also reasonable.

Overall, the program is correct and efficiently solves the problem as described in the problem description.
