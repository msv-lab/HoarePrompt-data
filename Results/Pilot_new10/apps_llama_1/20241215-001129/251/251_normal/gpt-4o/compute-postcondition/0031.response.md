Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `cakes` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `volumes` is a list of `n+1` positive floating-point numbers, `dp` is a list of `n+1` values where `dp[n]` is equal to `volumes[n]`, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is 0, and the current value of `volumes` at index `j` is less than the current value of `volumes` at index `i`.**
