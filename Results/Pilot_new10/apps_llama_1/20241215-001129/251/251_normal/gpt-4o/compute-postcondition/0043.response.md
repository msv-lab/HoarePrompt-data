The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `cakes`. `n` is a positive integer, and `cakes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the radius and height of a cake, and the length of `cakes` is equal to `n`. After executing the function body, the function returns the maximum volume that can be stacked using the volumes in the list under the condition that each volume must be smaller than the one it is stacked on. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n and cakes, where n is the number of cakes and cakes is a list of cake dimensions, and returns the maximum stackable volume of the cakes.**
