Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` must be greater than 0, `cakes` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `volumes` is a list of `n` positive floating-point numbers with at least one volume, `dp` is a list of `n` values where `dp[0]` is equal to `volumes[0]` and if there exists a `j` in the range from 0 to `i-1` such that `volumes[j]` is less than `volumes[i]`, then `dp[i]` is the maximum of 0 and `volumes[0] + volumes[i]`, otherwise `dp[i]` remains unchanged, `j` is in the range from 0 to `i-1`***
