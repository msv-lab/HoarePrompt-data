You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: As you know, every birthday party has a cake! This time, Babaei is going to prepare the very special birthday party's cake.

Simple cake is a cylinder of some radius and height. The volume of the simple cake is equal to the volume of corresponding cylinder. Babaei has n simple cakes and he is going to make a special cake placing some cylinders on each other.

However, there are some additional culinary restrictions. The cakes are numbered in such a way that the cake number i can be placed only on the table or on some cake number j where j < i. Moreover, in order to impress friends Babaei will put the cake i on top of the cake j only if the volume of the cake i is strictly greater than the volume of the cake j.

Babaei wants to prepare a birthday cake that has a maximum possible total volume. Help him find this value.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of simple cakes Babaei has.

Each of the following n lines contains two integers r_{i} and h_{i} (1 ≤ r_{i}, h_{i} ≤ 10 000), giving the radius and height of the i-th cake.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum volume of the cake that Babaei can make. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 6}.

Namely: let's assume that your answer is a, and the answer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct, if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1, b)} \leq 10^{-6}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
2
100 30
40 10

Output
942477.796077000

Input
4
1 1
9 7
1 4
10 7

Output
3983.539484752



-----Note-----

In first sample, the optimal way is to choose the cake number 1.

In second sample, the way to get the maximum volume is to use cakes with indices 1, 2 and 4.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is a list of pairs of positive integers, where each pair represents the radius and height of a cake, and the total number of cakes, also a positive integer, is provided as input.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    cakes = []
    for _ in range(n):
        r, h = map(int, input().split())
        
        cakes.append((math.pi * r * r * h, r, h))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `cakes` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains the volume, radius, and height of a cake, calculated as `(math.pi * r * r * h, r, h)` for each input pair `(r, h)`.
    cakes.sort(reverse=True)
    dp = [0.0] * n
    dp[0] = cakes[0][0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        dp[i] = cakes[i][0]
        
        for j in range(i):
            if cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1] and cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + cakes[i][0])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given information and the loop code.
    #
    #1. **Initial Conditions**: 
    #   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
    #   - `cakes` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains the volume, radius, and height of a cake, calculated as `(math.pi * r * r * h, r, h)`, sorted in descending order by volume.
    #   - `dp` is a list of `n` floats, where `dp[0]` equals `cakes[0][0]` and the rest of `dp` equals `0.0`.
    #
    #2. **Loop Code**:
    #   ```python
    #   for i in range(1, n):
    #       dp[i] = cakes[i][0]
    #       for j in range(i):
    #           if cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1] and cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]:
    #               dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + cakes[i][0])
    #   ```
    #
    #3. **Loop Execution**:
    #   - The loop iterates over the range from `1` to `n-1`.
    #   - For each `i`, it first sets `dp[i]` to `cakes[i][0]`.
    #   - Then, for each `j` less than `i`, it checks if the radius and height of the cake at index `i` are both less than those of the cake at index `j`. If so, it updates `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and the sum of `dp[j]` and `cakes[i][0]`.
    #
    #**Key Observations**:
    #- The loop does not update `n`.
    #- `i` iterates from `1` to `n-1`.
    #- `cakes` remains unchanged as a list of `n` tuples.
    #- `dp` is updated based on the comparisons made between elements of `cakes` at indices `i` and `j`.
    #
    #**Determining the Final State**:
    #- `n` remains a non-negative integer.
    #- `i` will be `n-1` after the loop, as it's the last value it takes during the iteration.
    #- `cakes` remains a list of `n` tuples, sorted in descending order by volume.
    #- For each `i`, `dp[i]` will be the maximum value considering all possible combinations where `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]` for any `j` less than `i`, added to `cakes[i][0]`, or its initial value `cakes[i][0]` if no such conditions are met.
    #
    #**Special Case: Loop Does Not Execute**:
    #- If `n` is `0`, the loop does not execute, and `dp` remains an empty list (or a list with a single element `0.0` if `dp` was preinitialized with a size of `n`).
    #- If `n` is `1`, the loop also does not execute, and `dp` remains a list with a single element equal to `cakes[0][0]`.
    #
    #**Output State**: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` equals `n-1` if `n` is greater than 0, `cakes` is a list of `n` tuples representing cakes sorted in descending order by volume, and for each `i`, `dp[i]` is the maximum of `cakes[i][0]` and the sum of `cakes[i][0]` and `dp[j]` for any `j` less than `i` where `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]`, or `dp` is a list with `n` elements where `dp[0]` equals `cakes[0][0]` and the rest are `0.0` if the loop does not execute.**
    print(dp[-1])

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
