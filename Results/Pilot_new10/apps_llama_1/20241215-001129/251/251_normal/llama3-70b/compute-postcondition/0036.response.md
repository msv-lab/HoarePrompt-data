Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is greater than 0, `cakes` is a list of at least `n+1` tuples, `j` is 1. If `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]`, then `dp[i]` equals `max(max(cakes[n][0], dp[0] + cakes[i][0]), dp[j] + cakes[i][0])`, otherwise `dp[i]` equals `max(cakes[n][0], dp[j] + cakes[i][0])`. If neither condition is met, `dp[i]` remains unchanged, where `dp[i]` equals `cakes[n][0]`.***
