The values of `r` and `h` are reassigned to be the two integers input by the user. The state of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `cakes` is a list containing a tuple `(math.pi * r * r * h, r, h)`, `r` is an input integer, `h` is an input integer.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `cakes` is a list containing a tuple `(math.pi * r * r * h, r, h)`, `r` is an input integer, `h` is an input integer**
