The value of `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + cakes[i][0]`. Since `i` equals `n-1`, `dp[n-1]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + cakes[n-1][0]`. The value of `j` is 1, so `dp[n-1]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[1] + cakes[n-1][0]`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` equals `n-1`, `cakes` is a list of at least `n+1` tuples, `j` is 1, `dp[n-1]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[1] + cakes[n-1][0]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` equals `n-1`, `cakes` is a list of at least `n+1` tuples, `j` is 1, `dp[n-1]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[1] + cakes[n-1][0]`.**
