According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `n` is already stated to be a positive integer, it meets this condition. The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable, meaning its value is not used within the loop, so we do not need to assign it a specific value. However, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, which is consistent with it being a positive integer.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, input is a list of pairs of positive integers, `cakes` is an empty list `[]`**
