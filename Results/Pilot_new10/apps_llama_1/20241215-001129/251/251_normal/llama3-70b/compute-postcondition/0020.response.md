Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `cakes` is a list of at least 2 tuples representing cakes sorted in descending order by volume, `dp` is a list of at least 2 floats where `dp[0]` equals the volume of the first cake (`cakes[0][0]`) and `dp[1]` equals the volume of the second cake (`cakes[1][0]`), if `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]`, then `dp[i]` equals the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + cakes[i][0]`, and `j` is 0, otherwise the state of `dp`, `n`, `i`, `cakes`, and `j` remains unchanged***
