According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `j`. If `j` is less than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, `i` equals `n-1`, `cakes` is a list of at least `n+1` tuples, `j` is 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` must be increased by 1, hence `j` is 1. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `i`. 
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` equals `n-1`, `cakes` is a list of at least `n+1` tuples, `j` is 1**
