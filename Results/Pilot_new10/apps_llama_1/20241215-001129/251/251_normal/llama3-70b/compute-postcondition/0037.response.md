According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `j` is less than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `i` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 2. Since `j` is now 2, for the loop to execute again `i` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is greater than 2, `cakes` is a list of at least `n+1` tuples, `j` is 2**
