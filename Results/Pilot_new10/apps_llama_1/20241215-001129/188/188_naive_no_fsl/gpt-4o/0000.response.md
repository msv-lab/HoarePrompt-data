Correctness: **True**

The program provided seems to correctly determine whether a fair game is possible according to the given problem description. Here's why:

1. **Handling cases with less than two unique numbers:** The program correctly identifies that if there are less than two unique numbers on the cards, a fair game is impossible because Petya and Vasya must choose distinct numbers. This is handled by `if len(unique_numbers) < 2: print('NO')`.

2. **Identifying the condition for a fair game:** A fair game requires that each player gets exactly half of the cards. The program checks if the two most common numbers (which are likely to have the highest counts) together can make a fair game by comparing their counts to `n // 2`. If the highest two counts match this condition, it prints 'YES' along with the two numbers that Petya and Vasya should choose.

3. **Handling cases where a fair game is not possible:** If the counts of the two most frequent numbers do not match `n // 2`, the program prints 'NO', correctly handling cases where it's impossible to divide the cards fairly between two distinct numbers chosen by Petya and Vasya.

The logic appears sound for all potential cases:
- It handles the edge case of fewer than two unique numbers.
- It identifies potential fair game scenarios by focusing on the counts of numbers that could lead to an equal split.
- It correctly concludes that a fair game is impossible if the conditions for an equal split are not met.

Given the explanations and examples provided, the program seems to accurately implement the logic required to determine whether a fair game is possible according to the problem description. Therefore, without finding any case that contradicts the problem description, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
