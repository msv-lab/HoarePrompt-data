Correctness: **True**

The program correctly determines whether Petya and Vasya can choose integer numbers before the game so that the game is fair. 

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first reads the number of cards `n` and the numbers on each card `a`.
2. It then creates a dictionary `d` to store the frequency of each number on the cards.
3. The program then iterates through the dictionary `d` to find numbers that appear exactly `n // 2` times.
4. If it finds two such numbers, it prints 'YES' and the two numbers. If not, it prints 'NO'.

The program's logic is sound and it handles all possible cases correctly. For example:

- If there are two numbers that appear exactly `n // 2` times, the program correctly prints 'YES' and the two numbers.
- If there is only one number that appears `n` times, the program correctly prints 'NO' because Petya and Vasya need to choose distinct numbers.
- If there are no numbers that appear exactly `n // 2` times, the program correctly prints 'NO'.

The program's use of a dictionary to store the frequency of each number is efficient, and its logic is easy to follow. Overall, the program is correct and works as expected.
