You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Petya and Vasya decided to play a game. They have n cards (n is an even number). A single integer is written on each card.

Before the game Petya will choose an integer and after that Vasya will choose another integer (different from the number that Petya chose). During the game each player takes all the cards with number he chose. For example, if Petya chose number 5 before the game he will take all cards on which 5 is written and if Vasya chose number 10 before the game he will take all cards on which 10 is written.

The game is considered fair if Petya and Vasya can take all n cards, and the number of cards each player gets is the same.

Determine whether Petya and Vasya can choose integer numbers before the game so that the game is fair. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) — number of cards. It is guaranteed that n is an even number.

The following n lines contain a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (one integer per line, 1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100) — numbers written on the n cards.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible for Petya and Vasya to choose numbers in such a way that the game will be fair, print "NO" (without quotes) in the first line. In this case you should not print anything more.

In the other case print "YES" (without quotes) in the first line. In the second line print two distinct integers — number that Petya should choose and the number that Vasya should choose to make the game fair. If there are several solutions, print any of them.


-----Examples-----

3

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example the game will be fair if, for example, Petya chooses number 11, and Vasya chooses number 27. Then the will take all cards — Petya will take cards 1 and 4, and Vasya will take cards 2 and 3. Thus, each of them will take exactly two cards.

In the second example fair game is impossible because the numbers written on the cards are equal, but the numbers that Petya and Vasya should choose should be distinct.

In the third example it is impossible to take all cards. Petya and Vasya can take at most five cards — for example, Petya can choose number 10 and Vasya can choose number 20. But for the game to be fair it is necessary to take 6 cards.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function operates on a predefined set of input where the first input is an even integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of cards, and the subsequent n inputs are integers a_1, a_2,..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100) representing the numbers written on the cards.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = []
    for i in range(n):
        a.append(int(input()))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing `n` integer elements where each element is an input integer, `i` is `n-1`.
    d = {}
    for i in a:
        if i in d:
            d[i] += 1
        else:
            d[i] = 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the final output state of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the loop code step by step.
    #
    #1. **Initial State**: 
    #   - `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive).
    #   - `a` is a list containing `n` integer elements.
    #   - `i` is `n-1`.
    #   - `d` is an empty dictionary.
    #
    #2. **Loop Code**:
    #   ```
    #   for i in a:
    #       if i in d:
    #           d[i] += 1
    #       else:
    #           d[i] = 1
    #   ```
    #   This loop iterates over each element `i` in list `a`. For each `i`, it checks if `i` is already a key in dictionary `d`. If `i` is in `d`, it increments the value associated with `i` by 1. If `i` is not in `d`, it adds `i` as a new key with a value of 1.
    #
    #3. **Output States after Few Iterations**:
    #   - After 1 iteration, `i` is the first element in `a`, and `d` contains this element as a key with a value indicating its frequency.
    #   - After 2 iterations, `i` equals the second element in `a`, and `d` contains at least the first two elements of `a` as keys.
    #   - After 3 iterations, `i` equals the third element in `a`, and `d` contains at least the first three elements of `a` as keys, with their respective frequencies updated.
    #
    #4. **Analyzing the Pattern**:
    #   - The loop will iterate `n` times because it iterates over each element in list `a`, which contains `n` elements.
    #   - After all iterations, `i` will be the last element in `a` because the loop iterates over `a` in order.
    #   - Dictionary `d` will contain each unique element from `a` as a key, with its corresponding value being the frequency of that element in `a`.
    #
    #5. **Final Output State**:
    #   - The loop will execute `n` times, where `n` is the number of elements in `a`.
    #   - `i` will be the last element in `a`.
    #   - `d` will be a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `a`, and its value is the frequency of that element in `a`.
    #   - Since `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and `a` contains `n` integer elements, the final state of `n` and `a` does not change; `n` remains an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and `a` remains a list containing `n` integer elements.
    #
    #**Output State: ** `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing `n` integer elements, `i` is the last element in `a`, and `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `a` and its value is the frequency of that element in `a`.
    c = 0
    a1, a2 = -1, -1
    for i in d:
        if d[i] == n // 2:
            if c == 0:
                a1 = i
                c += 1
            else:
                a2 = i
                break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing `n` integer elements, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `a` and its value is the frequency of that element in `a`, `i` is the last key in `d`, `c` is 0 or 1, `a1` is the first element in `a` with a frequency of `n // 2` or -1, and `a2` is the second element in `a` with a frequency of `n // 2` or -1.
    if (a1 != -1 and a2 != -1) :
        print('YES')
        print(a1, a2)
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing `n` integer elements, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `a` and its value is the frequency of that element in `a`, `i` is the last key in `d`, `c` is 0 or 1, if there are at least two elements in `a` with a frequency of `n // 2`, then `a1` and `a2` are the first and second elements in `a` with a frequency of `n // 2`, 'YES' has been printed to the console, and `a1` and `a2` have been printed to the console. Otherwise, `a1` is the first element in `a` with a frequency of `n // 2` or -1, `a2` is the second element in `a` with a frequency of `n // 2` or -1, and 'NO' has been printed to the console, indicating that either `a1` is -1 or `a2` is -1, or both are -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an even integer `n` and `n` integers, counts the frequency of each integer, and prints 'YES' followed by the first two integers that appear exactly `n // 2` times if such integers exist, otherwise prints 'NO', assuming the input meets certain criteria, but does not perform error checking on the input.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
