Based on the problem description, the original code, and the annotated version of the code, I have carefully examined the program's correctness.

The original assessment states that the program is correct, and after analyzing the code and the annotations, I agree with this assessment. The program correctly determines whether Petya and Vasya can choose integer numbers before the game so that the game is fair. It correctly counts the frequency of each integer, and if there are at least two integers that appear exactly `n // 2` times, it prints 'YES' followed by these two integers. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The annotations provided do not reveal any errors or inaccuracies in the original assessment. The annotations describe the state of the program at different points, which aligns with the expected behavior of the program.

Therefore, based on the available information, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.

Final: **True**
