The code `d[i] = 1` updates the value of `d` at the key `i`. Since `i` equals `a[2]`, this is equivalent to `d[a[2]] = 1`. 

The states of `n`, `a`, and `i` are not affected, so they remain the same. The state of `d` is affected, but only at the key `i` (or `a[2]`), which is now equal to 1.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing `n` integer elements, `i` equals `a[2]`, `d` is a dictionary containing at least `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]` as keys, and `d[i]` (or `d[a[2]]`) equals 1**
