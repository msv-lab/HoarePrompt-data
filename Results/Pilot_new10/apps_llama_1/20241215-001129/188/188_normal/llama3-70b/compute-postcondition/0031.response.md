The value of `c` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `c` is 0, so the new value of `c` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing `n` integer elements and has at least 1 unique element, `d` is a dictionary with at least 1 key where each key is a unique element from `a` and its value is the frequency of that element in `a`, `c` is 1, `a1` is the first key in `d`, `a2` is -1, `i` is the first key in `d`**
