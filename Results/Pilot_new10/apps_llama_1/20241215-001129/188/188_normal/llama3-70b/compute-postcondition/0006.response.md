According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2. Since `n` is an even integer and the loop has executed once, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2, but since `n` is even and between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `n` can be any even integer greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an even integer between 4 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing two integer elements where the first element is an input integer and the second element is another input integer, `i` is 2**
