Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing `n` integer elements, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `a` and its value is the frequency of that element in `a`, `i` is the last key in `d`, `c` is 0 or 1, if there are at least two elements in `a` with a frequency of `n // 2`, then `a1` and `a2` are the first and second elements in `a` with a frequency of `n // 2`, 'YES' has been printed to the console, and `a1` and `a2` have been printed to the console. Otherwise, `a1` is the first element in `a` with a frequency of `n // 2` or -1, `a2` is the second element in `a` with a frequency of `n // 2` or -1, and 'NO' has been printed to the console, indicating that either `a1` is -1 or `a2` is -1, or both are -1.***
