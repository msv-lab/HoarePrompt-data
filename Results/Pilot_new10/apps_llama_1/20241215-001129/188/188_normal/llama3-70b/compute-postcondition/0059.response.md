The function `func` operates on a predefined set of input where the first input is an even integer `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100) representing the number of cards, and the subsequent `n` inputs are integers `a_i` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100) representing the numbers written on the cards. 

It first reads the input `n` and the `n` integers, and stores them in the list `a`. Then, it counts the frequency of each integer in `a` and stores the frequency in the dictionary `d`. 

After that, it iterates through `d` to find the integers that appear exactly `n // 2` times. If it finds at least two such integers, it prints 'YES' followed by these two integers. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The function assumes that the input `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive) and the integers `a_i` are between 1 and 100 (inclusive). However, it does not perform any error checking on the input, so if the input does not meet these assumptions, the function may not work as expected.

In particular, if `n` is not an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), or if any of the `a_i` are not integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), the function may produce unexpected results. Additionally, if there are more than two integers that appear exactly `n // 2` times, the function will only print the first two it finds.

Functionality: ** The function reads an even integer `n` and `n` integers, counts the frequency of each integer, and prints 'YES' followed by the first two integers that appear exactly `n // 2` times if such integers exist, otherwise prints 'NO', assuming the input meets certain criteria, but does not perform error checking on the input. **
