Postcondition: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing `n` integer elements, `i` is the first element in `a`, if `i` is already a key in `d`, then `d` is a dictionary containing at least `i` as a key with `d[i]` incremented by 1; otherwise, `d` is a dictionary containing one entry where the key is `i` and the value is `1`, and `i` is a key in `d`.**
