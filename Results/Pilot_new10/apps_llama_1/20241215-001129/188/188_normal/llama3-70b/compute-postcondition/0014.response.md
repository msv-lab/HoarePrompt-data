The code `d[i] = 1` adds an entry to the dictionary `d` where the key is the value of `i` (the first element in list `a`) and the value is `1`. 

Given that `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing `n` integer elements, `i` is the first element in `a`, `d` is an empty dictionary, and `i` is not a key in `d`, the state of `n`, `a`, and the fact that `i` is the first element in `a` remain unchanged. The dictionary `d`, which was initially empty, now contains one entry where the key is `i` and the value is `1`.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing `n` integer elements, `i` is the first element in `a`, `d` is a dictionary containing one entry where the key is `i` and the value is `1`, and `i` is a key in `d`.**
