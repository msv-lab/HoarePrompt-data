The code `a.append(int(input()))` appends an integer input by the user to the list `a`. The previous values of `n` and `i` are not affected by this operation. The value of `a` changes from an empty list to a list containing one integer element, which is the input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing one integer element which is an input integer, `i` is 0**
