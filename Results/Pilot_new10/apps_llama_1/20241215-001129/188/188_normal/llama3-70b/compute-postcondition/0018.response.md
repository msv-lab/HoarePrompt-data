The code `d[i] = 1` updates the value associated with the key `i` in the dictionary `d` to 1. The value of `i` is the second element in the list `a`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Given that `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing `n` integer elements, and `d` is a dictionary containing at least the first element of `a` as a key, after executing the code, the output state is: 
`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing `n` integer elements, `i` is the second element in `a`, `d` is a dictionary containing at least the first element of `a` as a key and `i` as a key with a value of 1.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing `n` integer elements, `i` is the second element in `a`, `d` is a dictionary containing at least the first element of `a` as a key and `i` as a key with a value of 1**
