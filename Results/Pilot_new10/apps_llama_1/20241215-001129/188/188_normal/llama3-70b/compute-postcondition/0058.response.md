The function `func` accepts a set of parameters where the first parameter is an even integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of cards, and the subsequent `n` parameters are integers `a_1`, `a_2`,..., `a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the numbers written on the cards. However, since the function definition provided is `def func():`, it does not explicitly accept any parameters. Therefore, we must infer that the function operates on predefined or globally accessible variables that match the given parameter constraints.

To accurately describe the functionality based on the given constraints and without specific output details, we must acknowledge the oversight in the provided function definition. Normally, the function would be defined with parameters to accept the given inputs, such as `def func(n, *cards):` where `n` is the number of cards and `*cards` represents the variable number of card values (`a_1`, `a_2`,..., `a_n`).

Given the parameter constraints and assuming the function operates with the defined inputs (`n` and `a_1` through `a_n`), but without explicit output details, we can only describe the input parameters and infer that the function would return a value based on the operations performed on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function operates on a predefined set of inputs including an even integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of cards and n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing card values, returning an unspecified output based on these inputs.**
