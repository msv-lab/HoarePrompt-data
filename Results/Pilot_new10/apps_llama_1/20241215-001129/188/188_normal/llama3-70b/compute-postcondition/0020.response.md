To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given:
- `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive).
- `a` is a list containing `n` integer elements.
- `i` equals `a[1]`.
- `d` is a dictionary containing at least `a[0]` and `i` as keys.

Loop Statement:
```python
for i in a:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` has taken the value of the second element of `a` (since `i` equals `a[1]`).
- For the loop to execute again, `i` must take the next value from `a`.
- Since `a` contains `n` elements and `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and assuming that the loop has not yet iterated over all elements in `a`, the next value of `i` must be the next integer element in `a` after `a[1]`.
- Given that list indices in Python start at 0, if `i` is currently `a[1]`, the next iteration would see `i` as `a[2]`.
- The dictionary `d` contains at least `a[0]` and `i` as keys. If `i` is in `d`, then `d[i]` equals the previous value of `d[i]` plus one. Otherwise, `d` contains `i` as a key with a value of 1. This logic will apply with the new value of `i` (`a[2]`) in the next iteration.

Adjusting the state for the loop to execute one more time:
- `n` remains the same, an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), because `n` does not change within the loop.
- `a` remains the same list containing `n` integer elements.
- `i` will be the next element in `a`, so `i` will now be `a[2]`.
- `d` will contain at least `a[0]`, the previous `i` (`a[1]`), and the new `i` (`a[2]`) as keys, with their respective values updated according to the logic provided.

State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing `n` integer elements, `i` equals `a[2]`, `d` is a dictionary containing at least `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]` as keys**
