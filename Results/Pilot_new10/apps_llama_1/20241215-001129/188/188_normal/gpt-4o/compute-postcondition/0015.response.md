To determine the functionality of the function, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Input**: The function starts by reading an integer `n` from the input, which represents the number of cards. Then, it reads `n` integers representing the numbers on the cards.

2. **Constraints**: The annotations specify that `n` should be an even number between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and each card number should be between 1 and 100 (inclusive). However, the code does not explicitly check for these constraints, so it will process any input it receives.

3. **Counting Card Numbers**: The function uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each card number. This creates a dictionary where the keys are the unique card numbers and the values are their respective counts.

4. **Sorting Unique Numbers**: It then sorts the unique card numbers based on their counts in ascending order.

5. **Main Logic**: The function checks if there are less than 2 unique card numbers. If so, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it checks if the counts of the two most frequent card numbers (the last two elements in the sorted list, since lists are 0-indexed) are both equal to `n // 2`. If this condition is met, it prints 'YES' along with these two numbers. If not, it prints 'NO'.

6. **Handling Edge Cases**: The code does not explicitly handle edge cases where `n` is odd, or where there are not exactly two card numbers with counts equal to `n // 2`. However, based on the logic, if `n` is odd, the condition `count[unique_numbers[-1]] == n // 2 and count[unique_numbers[-2]] == n // 2` will not be met because the division of an odd number by 2 will result in a non-integer value, but since `n // 2` performs integer division, this scenario will simply result in 'NO' being printed, assuming `n` was mistakenly considered even or the condition was not dependent on `n` being even. For cases where `n` is indeed even but the counts do not meet the specified condition, the function will correctly identify and handle these by printing 'NO'.

7. **Missing Functionality**: There's no explicit error handling for cases like invalid inputs (non-integer inputs, out-of-range values), but based on the given code, such inputs would likely result in errors or unexpected behavior.

Considering all potential cases and focusing on what the code actually does, the functionality of the function is to read a list of integers representing card numbers, determine if the list can be divided into two equal groups based on the counts of the two most frequent numbers, and print 'YES' with these numbers if possible, or 'NO' otherwise, under the conditions that the total count of cards is even and the two most frequent card numbers have counts equal to half the total count of cards.

Functionality: ** The function reads an even number of integers, counts the occurrences of each, and checks if the counts of the two most frequent numbers are equal to half the total count. If so, it prints 'YES' with these numbers; otherwise, it prints 'NO', handling cases implicitly based on the counts and total number of cards. **
