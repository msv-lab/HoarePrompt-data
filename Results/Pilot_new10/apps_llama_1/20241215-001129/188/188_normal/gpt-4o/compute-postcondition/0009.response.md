The provided Python code prints the values of `unique_numbers[-1]` and `unique_numbers[-2]`. Since the number of unique integers in `unique_numbers` is 2 or more, `unique_numbers[-1]` and `unique_numbers[-2]` are the last two elements in the list, which are the two unique integers with the highest and second-highest counts, respectively.

Given that `count[unique_numbers[-1]]` equals `n // 2` and `count[unique_numbers[-2]]` equals `n // 2`, we know that these two unique integers have the same count, which is half of the total number of integers `n`. 

The code does not modify any variables; it only prints the values of `unique_numbers[-1]` and `unique_numbers[-2]`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `cards` is a list of `n` input integers, `count` is a dictionary where keys are the unique integers from `cards` and values are their respective counts, `unique_numbers` is a list of unique integers from `cards` sorted by their counts, the number of unique integers in `unique_numbers` is 2 or more, `count[unique_numbers[-1]]` equals `n // 2`, `count[unique_numbers[-2]]` equals `n // 2`, 'YES' has been printed to the console, and `unique_numbers[-1]` and `unique_numbers[-2]` have been printed to the console**
