You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Anton has the integer x. He is interested what positive integer, which doesn't exceed x, has the maximum sum of digits.

Your task is to help Anton and to find the integer that interests him. If there are several such integers, determine the biggest of them. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains the positive integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^18) — the integer which Anton has. 


-----Output-----

Print the positive integer which doesn't exceed x and has the maximum sum of digits. If there are several such integers, print the biggest of them. Printed integer must not contain leading zeros.


-----Examples-----
Input
100

Output
99

Input
48

Output
48

Input
521

Output
499
Program:
```
x = int(input().strip())
x_str = str(x)
n = len(x_str)
if x_str[0] != '1':
    candidate = int(x_str[0]) - 1
    candidate = str(candidate) + '9' * (n - 1)
else:
    candidate = '9' * (n - 1)
candidate = int(candidate)
sum_x = func_1(x)
sum_candidate = func_1(candidate)
if sum_candidate > sum_x:
    print(candidate)
else:
    print(x)

def func_1(n):
    return sum((int(digit) for digit in str(n)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect. It does not work correctly for cases when the input number starts with '1' and has other digits greater than '9'. 

For example, the input 199 should output 199, but the given code will output 9 * (number of digits - 1) = 9. However, a more significant issue arises in cases like 1099. The code will output 99 (by just taking 9 * (number of digits - 1)), whereas the correct output should be 999.

The problem with the code is in its approach to find the candidate number. It only checks two cases: one where the first digit of the input number is '1', and one where it's not. When the first digit is '1', the code simply appends '9's to get the candidate, which is incorrect as shown above. 

To correctly solve the problem, the code should find the largest number with the maximum sum of digits that is less than or equal to the input number. If the code checked all possible numbers less than or equal to the input number, it would be able to find the correct answer. However, due to time complexity, this approach might not be practical.

Another potential issue is that the function `func_1` is called after it is used, which would lead to a NameError. The function definition should be placed before its first usage.

Here is an example where the code does not work as expected: 

Input:
1099

Expected output:
999

Actual output:
99

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts an integer `n` and returns the sum of its digits, without any explicit input validation for non-integer or non-positive values, and works for any integer by summing its digits. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
