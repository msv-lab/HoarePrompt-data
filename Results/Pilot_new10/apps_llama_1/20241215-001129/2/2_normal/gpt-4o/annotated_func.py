#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^18.
def func_1(n):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))
    #The program returns the sum of the digits of `n`, which can range from 1 to 171, depending on the digits of `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` and returns the sum of its digits, without any explicit input validation for non-integer or non-positive values, and works for any integer by summing its digits.
