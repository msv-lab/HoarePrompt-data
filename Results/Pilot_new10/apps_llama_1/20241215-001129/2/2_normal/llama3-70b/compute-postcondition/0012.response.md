The code `max_num = i` updates the value of `max_num` to be equal to `i`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so `max_num` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `i` is 2, `digit_sum` is 2, `max_sum` is 2, `max_num` is 2**
