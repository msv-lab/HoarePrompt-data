The code initializes a new variable `max_sum` and assigns it the value `0`. The initial state of `x` is still valid after this code execution, which is a positive integer input by the user, such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18. 

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer input by the user, such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, and `max_sum` is 0**
