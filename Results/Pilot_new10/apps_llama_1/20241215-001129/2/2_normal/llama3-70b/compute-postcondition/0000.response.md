The code `x = int(input())` assigns the value of the input to `x` after converting it to an integer. Given that the input is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^18, the new value of `x` will be this input integer.

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer input by the user, such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, which has been converted to an integer and assigned to `x`.**
