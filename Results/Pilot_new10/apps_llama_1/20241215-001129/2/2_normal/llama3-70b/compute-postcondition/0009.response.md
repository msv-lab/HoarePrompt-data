According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x + 1`, the loop can execute again, which means `i` should be less than or equal to `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2. Since `i` is now 2, for the loop to execute again, `x` must be at least 2.

The values of `digit_sum`, `max_sum`, and `max_num` do not affect whether the loop can execute, but their values at the start of the next iteration should be considered based on the previous iteration's state. Since `digit_sum` is 1, and it is greater than `max_sum` (which is 0), `max_sum` and `max_num` have been updated to 1 in the previous iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `max_sum` is 1 and `max_num` is 1.

State: **`x` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `i` is 2, `digit_sum` is reset for the new iteration, `max_sum` is 1, `max_num` is 1**
