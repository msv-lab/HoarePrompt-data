The value of `max_sum` is updated to be equal to `digit_sum`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Since `digit_sum` is 3, `max_sum` is also updated to 3. 

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer such that 3 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `i` is 3, `digit_sum` is 3, `max_sum` is 3, `max_num` is 3**
