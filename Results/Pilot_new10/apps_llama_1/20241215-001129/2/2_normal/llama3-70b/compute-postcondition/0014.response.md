According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `x` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 3. For the loop to execute again, `x` must be greater than or equal to 3 to allow `i` to take the value 3.

The values of `digit_sum`, `max_sum`, and `max_num` depend on conditions within the loop body which are not specified here. However, based on the initial state provided, if `digit_sum` > `max_sum`, then `digit_sum` is 2, `max_sum` is 2, and `max_num` is 2. If `digit_sum` is not greater than `max_sum`, then the values remain as 2, 1, and 1 respectively. Since we do not have information on how `digit_sum`, `max_sum`, and `max_num` are updated within the loop, we will focus on the condition that allows the loop to execute again, which is `i` < `x`. Given that `x` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, for the loop to execute again with `i` being 3, `x` must be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`x` is a positive integer such that 3 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `i` is 3, if `digit_sum` > `max_sum`, then `digit_sum` is 2, `max_sum` is 2, `max_num` is 2. If `digit_sum` is not greater than `max_sum`, then the values of `digit_sum`, `max_sum`, and `max_num` remain unchanged as 2, 1, and 1 respectively.**
