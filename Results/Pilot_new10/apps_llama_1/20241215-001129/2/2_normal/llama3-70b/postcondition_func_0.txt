The function prompts the user for a positive integer input `x`, calculates the sum of digits for each number from 1 to `x`, and prints the number with the maximum sum of digits; it assumes the input is valid and within the range 1 to 10^18, without explicitly handling edge cases of invalid inputs or very large numbers.
