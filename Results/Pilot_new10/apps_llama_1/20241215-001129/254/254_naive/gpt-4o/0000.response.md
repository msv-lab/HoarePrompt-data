Correctness: **False**.

The program is checking if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three garland intervals is 1. However, this approach is not correct. The GCD being 1 does not guarantee that there will always be at least one lit garland. A counterexample is when the intervals are 2, 4, and 3. The GCD of these numbers is 1, but if the garlands are switched on at the same time, there will be some seconds when no garland is lit.

In the given program, it is only considering the GCD of the three intervals, which is not sufficient to solve this problem. The problem description requires that there should be at least one lit garland at every second after the maximum of the switch-on times, which is not guaranteed by the given program.

For example, if the input is 2 4 3, the program will output 'YES' because the GCD of 2, 4, and 3 is 1. However, if we switch on the garlands at the same time, there will be some seconds when no garland is lit, which is not in accordance with the problem description. 

To solve this problem, we need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of the intervals, not the GCD. We need to check if the LCM of any two intervals can be covered by the third interval. If yes, then we can switch on the garlands in such a way that at least one garland will be lit at every second after the maximum of the switch-on times. 

Here's a correct approach to solve this problem:
```python
import math

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)

def func():
    (k1, k2, k3) = map(int, input().split())
    if math.gcd(lcm(k1, k2), k3) == 1 or math.gcd(lcm(k1, k3), k2) == 1 or math.gcd(lcm(k2, k3), k1) == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```
This program calculates the LCM of each pair of intervals and checks if the GCD of the LCM and the remaining interval is 1. If yes, it means that we can switch on the garlands in such a way that at least one garland will be lit at every second after the maximum of the switch-on times, so it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
