Correctness: **False**.

The program is attempting to solve the problem by calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of the three time intervals and then checking if the LCM is a multiple of each of the time intervals. However, this approach does not guarantee that there will be at least one lit garland during every second.

One potential case where the program does not work correctly is when the time intervals are 5, 5, and 3. In this case, the LCM of the three intervals is 15, which is a multiple of each of the intervals. However, if the garlands are switched on during seconds 1, 2, and 3, respectively, then there will be no lit garland during seconds 6, 9, 12, and so on.

A correct approach to solve this problem would involve checking all possible combinations of switch-on times and verifying if there is at least one lit garland during every second. The given program does not consider these combinations and therefore may produce incorrect results for certain inputs.

Another issue with the program is that the `func_1` function is not correctly implemented. The `func_1` function should calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, but the implementation is incorrect. The correct implementation of the GCD function should be:

```python
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a
```

However, this still does not solve the original problem correctly, as mentioned earlier. The correct solution would involve checking all possible combinations of switch-on times and verifying if there is at least one lit garland during every second.

A correct implementation of the solution could be:

```python
import math
import itertools

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

(k1, k2, k3) = map(int, input().split())

lcm12 = lcm(k1, k2)
lcm123 = lcm(lcm12, k3)

switch_on_times = [i for i in range(1, lcm123 + 1)]

possible_combinations = list(itertools.product(switch_on_times, repeat=3))

for combination in possible_combinations:
    x1, x2, x3 = combination
    max_time = max(x1, x2, x3)
    for time in range(max_time, lcm123 + 1):
        if time % k1 == x1 % k1 or time % k2 == x2 % k2 or time % k3 == x3 % k3:
            continue
        else:
            break
    else:
        print('YES')
        break
else:
    print('NO')
```

This solution correctly checks all possible combinations of switch-on times and verifies if there is at least one lit garland during every second.
