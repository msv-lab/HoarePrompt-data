Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The given code is trying to determine if it's possible to switch on the garlands such that during each second after switching them on, at least one garland will be lit. The code calculates the LCM of the three garland intervals and checks if the LCM is divisible by each interval. However, this approach does not guarantee that there will be at least one lit garland at every second.

For example, if we consider the input (4, 6, 12), the LCM will be 12. Since 12 is divisible by each of the intervals (4, 6, and 12), the code will print 'YES'. However, if we switch on the garlands at the same time (let's say at time 0), we will have lit garlands at times 0, 4, 6, and 12, but there will be no lit garland at times 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11. This shows that the code does not work correctly in this case. 

A correct approach to solve this problem would involve checking if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of any two intervals can be used to ensure that there is always at least one lit garland at every second. The code should also consider the possibility of switching on the garlands at different times to achieve this. 

In this case, since the code does not work correctly for every potential case, Correctness is **False**.
