The values of `a` and `b` are updated. Initially, `a` is 1 and `b` is not 0. After the update, `a` becomes `b` and `b` becomes the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, which is `1 % b`. Since `a` is initially 1, `1 % b` is always 1, regardless of the value of `b`. So, `b` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`k1`, `k2`, and `k3` are integers such that 1 ≤ `k1`, `k2`, `k3` ≤ 1500; `a` is equal to the initial value of `b`; `b` is 1**
