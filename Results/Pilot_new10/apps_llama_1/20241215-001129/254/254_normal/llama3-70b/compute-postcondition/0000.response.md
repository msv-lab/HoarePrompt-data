According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is `True`, the loop can execute. However, right before the loop, there is no information about the value of `b`. The given information only mentions that `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` are integers such that 1 ≤ `k1`, `k2`, `k3` ≤ 1500, which does not affect the execution of the loop directly.

For the loop to execute one more time, `b` needs to be adjusted to be `True`. The states of `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` do not need to be adjusted because they do not affect the loop condition.

State: **`k1`, `k2`, and `k3` are integers such that 1 ≤ `k1`, `k2`, `k3` ≤ 1500, and `b` must be `True`**
