#State of the program right berfore the function call: k1, k2, and k3 are integers such that 1 ≤ k1, k2, k3 ≤ 1500.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `b` is 0, and if the loop executed, `a` holds the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`; the values of `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
    return a
    #The program returns `a`, which holds the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, and since `b` is 0, it returns the original value of `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters, a and b, and returns their Greatest Common Divisor (GCD), which is calculated using the Euclidean algorithm; it handles cases where a and/or b are 0 or negative, and returns the absolute value of the GCD in these cases, although the code itself works with the actual values of a and b
