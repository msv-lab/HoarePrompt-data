Postcondition: **`k1` is an input integer, `k2` is an input integer, `k3` is an input integer, 1 <= `k1` <= 1500, 1 <= `k2` <= 1500, 1 <= `k3` <= 1500, `gcd_k1_k2` is the greatest common divisor of `k1` and `k2`, `gcd_all` is the greatest common divisor of `gcd_k1_k2` and `k3`, if `gcd_all` is 1, 'YES' has been printed, otherwise 'NO' has been printed to the output.**
