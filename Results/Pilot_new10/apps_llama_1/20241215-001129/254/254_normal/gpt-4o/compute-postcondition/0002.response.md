The value of `gcd_all` is assigned the greatest common divisor of `gcd_k1_k2` and `k3`. The initial state specifies that `gcd_k1_k2` is the greatest common divisor of `k1` and `k2`, and `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` are all input integers between 1 and 1500. Therefore, the Output State is: `k1` is an input integer, `k2` is an input integer, `k3` is an input integer, 1 <= `k1` <= 1500, 1 <= `k2` <= 1500, 1 <= `k3` <= 1500, `gcd_k1_k2` is the greatest common divisor of `k1` and `k2`, and `gcd_all` is the greatest common divisor of `gcd_k1_k2` and `k3`.

Output State: **`k1` is an input integer, `k2` is an input integer, `k3` is an input integer, 1 <= `k1` <= 1500, 1 <= `k2` <= 1500, 1 <= `k3` <= 1500, `gcd_k1_k2` is the greatest common divisor of `k1` and `k2`, `gcd_all` is the greatest common divisor of `gcd_k1_k2` and `k3`**.
