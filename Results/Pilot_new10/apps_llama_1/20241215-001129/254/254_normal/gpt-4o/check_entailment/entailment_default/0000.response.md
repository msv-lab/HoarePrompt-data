Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The code assumes that if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three input numbers is 1, then it is possible to switch on the garlands in such a way that at least one garland will be lit during each second. However, this assumption is not necessarily true.

The problem statement requires that each second after switching on the garlands, at least one garland should be lit. The code only checks if the GCD of the three numbers is 1, which is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the problem.

For example, consider the input (4, 2, 6). The GCD of these numbers is 2, so the code will print 'NO'. However, if we switch on the garlands at seconds 0, 1, and 2 respectively, the first garland will be lit during seconds 0, 4, 8,..., the second garland will be lit during seconds 1, 3, 5, 7,..., and the third garland will be lit during seconds 2, 8, 14,.... As we can see, this arrangement does satisfy the condition that each second after switching on the garlands, at least one garland will be lit.

Another example is the input (2, 4, 6), where the GCD is 2, but it's possible to find an arrangement that satisfies the problem statement. Therefore, the code does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. 

The code fails to account for cases where the GCD is not 1, but the problem can still be solved by choosing appropriate times to switch on the garlands. 

Moreover, we can also use the Chicken McNugget Theorem or the Frobenius coin problem to determine if it is possible to find an arrangement that satisfies the problem statement. According to this theorem, it is possible to find an arrangement if and only if the GCD of the two smallest numbers does not divide the third number, or the GCD of the two largest numbers does not divide the smallest number, and so on. The code does not take these cases into account. 

So, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case.
