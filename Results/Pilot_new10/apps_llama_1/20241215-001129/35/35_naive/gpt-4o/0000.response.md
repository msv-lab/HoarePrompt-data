Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. The function `func_1(n, a, b)` uses binary search to find the maximum number `x` such that `a // x + b // x >= n`. However, this approach does not consider the condition that each piece of each cake is put on some plate and no plate contains pieces of both cakes.

For example, if `n = 5`, `a = 2`, and `b = 9`, the program will return `2`, but this is not possible because you cannot distribute `2` pieces of cake to any plate, and then distribute the remaining pieces to the other plates. A correct solution should check all possible ways to distribute the cakes to the plates and ensure that each plate contains at least `x` pieces.

The `can_distribute` function also has a problem. It only checks if the number of plates that can be filled with at least `x` pieces from both cakes is greater than or equal to `n`. However, it does not consider the case where `a` and `b` are not divisible by `x`, and the remaining pieces cannot be distributed to the remaining plates.

To solve this problem, we need a more complex algorithm that takes into account all possible ways to distribute the cakes to the plates and ensures that each plate contains at least `x` pieces and no plate contains pieces of both cakes. 

One possible approach is to use a brute force algorithm that checks all possible ways to distribute the cakes to the plates and returns the maximum number `x` that satisfies the conditions.

Here is a simple counterexample to demonstrate that the provided program does not work correctly: 

Input: `n = 5, a = 7, b = 8`. The program may not return the expected result because it does not take into account the actual distribution of the cakes to the plates. 

To correctly solve this problem, we need to use a more complex algorithm that checks all possible ways to distribute the cakes to the plates. 

In this case, I will just give the example of where the program can fail. For a complete correct solution, you need to model the problem as a constraint satisfaction problem and use a search algorithm to find the maximum `x` that satisfies the conditions.
