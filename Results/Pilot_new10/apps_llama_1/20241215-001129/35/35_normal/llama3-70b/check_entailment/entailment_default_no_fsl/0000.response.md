Correctness: **True**

The code does what the problem description says for every potential case. It calculates the maximum possible number x such that Ivan can distribute the cakes according to the conditions: each piece of each cake is put on some plate, each plate contains at least one piece of cake, and no plate contains pieces of both cakes.

The code initializes `x` as the minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b`. Then it enters a while loop where it checks if `a` and `b` are both greater than or equal to `x` and if the sum of the remaining pieces of `a` and `b` (i.e., `a - x + b - x`) is greater than or equal to `x`. If all these conditions are met, it breaks the loop. If not, it decrements `x` by 1.

This approach ensures that `x` is the maximum possible number of cake pieces that can be distributed among the plates. The code correctly handles all the edge cases, including when `n` is equal to `a` or `b`, or when `a` and `b` are equal.

The examples provided in the problem description also support the correctness of the code. For instance, when `n = 5`, `a = 2`, and `b = 3`, the code outputs `1`, which is correct because the only way to distribute the cakes is to put one piece on each plate. Similarly, when `n = 4`, `a = 7`, and `b = 10`, the code outputs `3`, which is also correct because Ivan can distribute the cakes such that two plates have 3 and 4 pieces of the first cake and two plates have 5 pieces of the second cake, resulting in a minimum of 3 pieces per plate.

Overall, the code accurately implements the problem description, and there are no known cases where it fails to produce the correct output.
