According to the code, the loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will continue to execute indefinitely until it encounters a `break` statement. The `break` statement is encountered when `a` is greater than or equal to `x`, `b` is greater than or equal to `x`, and the sum of the remaining pieces of both cakes after distributing `x` pieces is greater than or equal to `x`. 

Since the loop is `while True`, it does not have a conditional statement that needs to be satisfied for the loop to execute again. Therefore, no adjustments to the states are needed for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is the number of people at the celebration, `a` is the number of pieces of the first cake, `b` is the number of pieces of the second cake, `x` is the minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b` minus 2**
