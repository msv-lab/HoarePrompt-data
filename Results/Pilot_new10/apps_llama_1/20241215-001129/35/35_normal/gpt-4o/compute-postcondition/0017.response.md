Postcondition: **`n` is an integer representing the number of plates, `a` and `b` are integers representing the number of pieces of cakes. If `can_distribute(mid)` is True, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1` and `high` remains unchanged. If `can_distribute(mid)` is False, then `high` is updated to `mid` and `low` remains less than `mid`. In both cases, the relationship between `low` and `high` has been altered, with `low` being greater than or equal to its initial `mid` value in the True case, and `high` being equal to `mid` in the False case.**
