The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`. `n` is an integer representing the number of plates, `a` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake, and `b` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake. The function returns a value that is one less than the maximum number of pieces that can be distributed into `n` plates, given the constraints that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, a, and b, where n is the number of plates and a and b are the number of pieces of two cakes, and returns a value one less than the maximum number of pieces that can be distributed into n plates.**
