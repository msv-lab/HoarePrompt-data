Postcondition: **`n` is an integer representing the number of plates, `a` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake, `b` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake, such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b, `low` is 1, `high` is `min(a, b) + 1`, `mid` is `(min(a, b) + 2) // 2`, and it cannot distribute the cakes with `mid` number of pieces, i.e., `(can_distribute(mid))` is False**
