Postcondition: **`n` is an integer representing the number of plates, `a` and `b` are integers representing the number of pieces of the cakes. If `can_distribute(mid)` is True, then `low` is updated to `mid` + 1. Otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid`, where `mid` = (`low` + `high`) // 2, and `low` < `high`.**
