To determine the output state, we need to consider the effect of the given code snippet on the variables `n`, `a`, `b`, `low`, and `high`, and calculate the result.

Given code:
```python
mid = (low + high) // 2
```

The given code calculates the middle value `mid` between `low` and `high` using integer division. 

The initial state is: `n` is an integer representing the number of plates, `a` and `b` are integers representing the number of pieces of the cakes such that the conditions for `low` and `high` updates are satisfied to ensure `low` < `high`.

After executing the given code, `mid` is assigned the value of the average of `low` and `high`, rounded down to the nearest integer. The states of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `low`, `high`) are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer representing the number of plates, `a` and `b` are integers representing the number of pieces of the cakes, `low` and `high` are updated as per the given conditions, and `mid` is the integer average of `low` and `high`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of plates, `a` and `b` are integers representing the number of pieces of the cakes, `low` < `high`, `mid` = (`low` + `high`) // 2**
