Correctness: **True**

The code provided implements a binary search algorithm to find the maximum possible number of pieces that can be placed on each plate. The `func_1` function performs the binary search, and the `can_distribute` function checks if it's possible to distribute the cakes into `n` plates with at least `x` pieces on each plate.

The logic of the `func_1` function is sound, as it iteratively refines the range of possible values for `x` by checking if it's possible to distribute the cakes with `mid` pieces on each plate. If it is possible, it increases the lower bound of the range; otherwise, it decreases the upper bound.

The `can_distribute` function also correctly checks if it's possible to distribute the cakes by calculating the total number of plates that can be filled with at least `x` pieces of each cake. If the total number of plates is greater than or equal to `n`, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

The examples provided in the problem description are also correctly handled by the code. For instance, when `n = 5`, `a = 2`, and `b = 3`, the code correctly returns `1`, as it's the maximum possible number of pieces that can be placed on each plate. Similarly, when `n = 4`, `a = 7`, and `b = 10`, the code correctly returns `3`, as it's the maximum possible number of pieces that can be placed on each plate.

In general, the code handles all potential cases correctly, as it systematically explores all possible values of `x` and checks if it's possible to distribute the cakes with that number of pieces on each plate. Therefore, I conclude that the code is correct and follows the problem description for every potential case.
