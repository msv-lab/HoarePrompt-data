Correctness: **False**

The given program does not always meet the problem description. 

In the `can_distribute(x)` function, the return statement is `return a // x + b // x >= n`. This line of code checks if the total number of plates that can be filled with at least `x` pieces of cake is greater than or equal to the number of plates `n`. 

However, the problem description states that "Each piece of each cake is put on some plate; Each plate contains at least one piece of cake; No plate contains pieces of both cakes." 

The current implementation of `can_distribute(x)` does not consider the constraint that each plate should contain at least one piece of cake and that no plate contains pieces of both cakes. 

For example, if `a = 10`, `b = 10`, and `n = 5`, `can_distribute(x)` with `x = 4` would return `True` because `a // x + b // x = 10 // 4 + 10 // 4 = 5 >= 5`, which is `n`. However, it is not possible to distribute the pieces such that each plate has at least `4` pieces of cake and no plate contains pieces of both cakes. 

A correct implementation of the `can_distribute(x)` function should consider the specific distribution of the cakes and check if it is possible to distribute the cakes into `n` plates such that each plate has at least `x` pieces of cake and no plate contains pieces of both cakes. 

The function should return `True` if such a distribution is possible, and `False` otherwise. 

Here is a correct implementation of the `can_distribute(x)` function:

```python
def can_distribute(x):
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if i + j == n and a >= i * x and b >= j * x:
                return True
    return False
```

This function iterates over all possible combinations of the number of plates with pieces from the first cake and the number of plates with pieces from the second cake. It checks if it is possible to distribute the pieces such that each plate has at least `x` pieces of cake and no plate contains pieces of both cakes. If such a distribution is possible, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

However, this function may not be efficient for large inputs because it has a time complexity of O(n^2). A more efficient solution would be to use a binary search approach with a modified `can_distribute(x)` function that checks if it is possible to distribute the pieces such that each plate has at least `x` pieces of cake and no plate contains pieces of both cakes. 

Here is the modified code with a more efficient solution:

```python
def can_distribute(x):
    max_a = a // x
    max_b = b // x
    return max_a + max_b >= n

def func_1(n, a, b):
    low, high = 1, min(a, b) + 1
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if can_distribute(mid):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
    return low - 1
```
