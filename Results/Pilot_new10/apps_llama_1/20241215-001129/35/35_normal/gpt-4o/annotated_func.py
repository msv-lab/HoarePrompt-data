#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of plates, a is an integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake, and b is an integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake, such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b.
def func_1(n, a, b):
    low, high = 1, min(a, b) + 1

    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `low` is equal to `high`, which is the maximum number of pieces that can be distributed into `n` plates, `n` remains unchanged, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, `low` and `high` are the same and represent the maximum number of pieces that can be distributed, given the original values of `a`, `b`, and `n`.

    #The program returns a value that is one less than the maximum number of pieces that can be distributed into `n` plates, given the original values of `a`, `b`, and `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts integers `n`, `a`, and `b`, where `n` is the number of plates and `a` and `b` are the number of pieces of two cakes, and returns a value one less than the maximum number of pieces that can be distributed into `n` plates, given the original values of `a`, `b`, and `n`, assuming that `n` is between 2 and `a + b` (inclusive) and `a` and `b` are between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and the distribution is possible according to the `can_distribute(mid)` function

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers representing the number of pieces of the first and second cakes, x is a positive integer representing the minimum number of pieces on each plate, and n is a positive integer representing the number of plates such that 2 <= n <= a + b and x <= min(a, b).
def can_distribute(x):
    return a // x + b // x >= n
    #The program returns True if the total number of plates that can be filled with cake pieces is greater than or equal to the number of plates, False otherwise.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer x, uses global variables a and b representing the number of pieces of the first and second cakes, and n representing the number of plates, and returns True if the total number of plates that can be filled with cake pieces is greater than or equal to the number of plates n, where the total number of plates is calculated as the integer division of a by x plus the integer division of b by x, and False otherwise, assuming 2 <= n <= a + b and x <= min(a, b)
