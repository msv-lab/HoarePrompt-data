Postcondition: **`n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, `m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 0, `k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0, `x` equals `input_x` - 1, `y` equals `input_y` - 1, the current value of `row` is 0 and equals `x`, the current value of `col` is 0 and equals `y`, `direction` equals 1, `sergei_questions` is calculated based on `x` and `full_cycles`, `full_cycles` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `min_questions` and `max_questions` are calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`**
