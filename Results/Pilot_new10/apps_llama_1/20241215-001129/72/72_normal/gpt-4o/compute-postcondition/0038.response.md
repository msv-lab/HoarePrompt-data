Postcondition: **`n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, `m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 0, `k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0, `x` equals `input_x` - 1, `y` equals `input_y` - 1, `full_cycles` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `min_questions` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `max_questions` is `max_questions - 1`, if `row` equals -1, then `direction` equals 1, `row` equals 2, `col` equals `y`, and if `x` equals `y` then `sergei_questions` equals `sergei_questions + 1`, otherwise `sergei_questions` remains unchanged; otherwise, `row`, `col`, `direction`, and `sergei_questions` remain unchanged, with `col` equals `y` and `direction` is not equal to 1.**
