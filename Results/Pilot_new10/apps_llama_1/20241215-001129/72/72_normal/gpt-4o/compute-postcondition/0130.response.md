Postcondition: **`n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, `m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 0, `k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0, if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `full_cycles`, `min_questions`, and `remaining_questions` are one less than their previous values, `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1, otherwise the values of `full_cycles`, `min_questions`, `remaining_questions`, and `sergei_questions` are unchanged, `max_questions` is updated based on the loop's iterations and boundary conditions, `row` and `direction` are updated based on the loop's boundary conditions, and `col` is 0, and the direction is not equal to 1**
