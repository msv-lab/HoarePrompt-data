The value of `row` is decreased by 2. The initial value of `row` is `x - 1`, so the new value of `row` is `x - 1 - 2` which is `x - 3`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, `m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 0, `k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0, `col` is `y + 1` and must be less than `m`, `row` is `x - 3`, `direction` is -1.

Output State: **`n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, `m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 0, `k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0, `col` is `y + 1` and must be less than `m`, `row` is `x - 3`, `direction` is -1**
