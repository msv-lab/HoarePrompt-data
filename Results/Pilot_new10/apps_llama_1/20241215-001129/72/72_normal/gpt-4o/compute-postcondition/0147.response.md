The code `row += direction` changes the value of `row` by adding `direction` to it. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, `m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 0, `k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0, `col` is increased by 1, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, `row` equals `row + direction`, if `row + direction` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1**
