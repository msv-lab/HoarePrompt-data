The value of `max_questions` is decreased by 1. The previous value of `max_questions` is not specified, so the output state is: `n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, `m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 0, `k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0, `full_cycles` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `min_questions` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `x` and `y` are updated based on the loop body, the current value of `row` equals the current value of `x`, the current value of `col` equals the current value of `y` and is 0, `direction` and `max_questions` are updated based on the loop body, `sergei_questions` is the previous value of `sergei_questions` plus 1; otherwise, the state remains unchanged, `direction` is not equal to 1, and `max_questions` is decreased by 1.
Output State: **`n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, `m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 0, `k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0, `full_cycles` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `min_questions` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `x` and `y` are updated based on the loop body, the current value of `row` equals the current value of `x`, the current value of `col` equals the current value of `y` and is 0, `direction` is not equal to 1, `max_questions` is the previous value of `max_questions` minus 1, and `sergei_questions` is the previous value of `sergei_questions` plus 1**
