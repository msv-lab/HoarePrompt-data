The value of `row` is incremented by `direction`. The previous value of `row` was `x`, and the value of `col` is `y` plus 1, and must be less than `m`. If `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1, and `max_questions` is increased by 1. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

So, the new value of `row` is `x + direction`.

The Output State is: `n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, `m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 0, `k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0, `col` is `y + 1` and must be less than `m`, `row` is `x + direction`, if `x + direction` equals `x` and `y + 1` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1, and `max_questions` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, `m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 0, `k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0, `col` is `y + 1` and must be less than `m`, `row` is `x + direction`, if `x + direction` equals `x` and `y + 1` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1, and `max_questions` is increased by 1**
