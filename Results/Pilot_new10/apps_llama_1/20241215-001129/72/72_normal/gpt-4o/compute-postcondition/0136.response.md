Postcondition: ***`n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, `m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 0, `k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0. If `row` is -1, then `row` is 1, `col` is 0, `direction` is 1, and `max_questions` is one less than its previous value, while `full_cycles`, `min_questions`, `remaining_questions`, and `sergei_questions` are unchanged from their previous values. If `row` is not -1, the values of `row`, `col`, `direction`, `full_cycles`, `min_questions`, `remaining_questions`, `sergei_questions`, and `max_questions` depend on the conditions specified in the precondition, which includes the changes when `row + direction` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`.***
