Postcondition: **`n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, `m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 0, `k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0, `col` is increased by 1 and must be less than `m`. If `direction` is 1, then `col` is `y + 1`, and if `row` equals `n`, then `row` is `x - 3` and `direction` is -1, otherwise, `row` is `x + direction`. If `direction` is not 1, then `max_questions` is decreased by 1, if `row` is -1, then `direction` is 1, `row` is `row + 3`, and if `row + 3` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1, otherwise, `row` is `row + direction` and if `row + direction` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1.**
