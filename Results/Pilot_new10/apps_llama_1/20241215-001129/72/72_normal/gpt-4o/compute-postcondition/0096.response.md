Postcondition: **`n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, `m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 1, `k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0, `full_cycles` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `min_questions` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `col` equals `y` and is 1, `max_questions` is increased by 1, `x` has its previous value, `y` has its previous value, if `row` equals `n`, then `row` is `row - 3` and `direction` equals -1, and if `row - 3` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1, otherwise `row` and `direction` retain their previous values relative to the condition, and `sergei_questions` is increased by 1 if the updated `row` and the current `col` match `x` and `y`.**
