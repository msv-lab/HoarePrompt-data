The value of `x` is decreased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
The new value of `x` is `input_x` - 1.
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` = input_n, `m` = input_m, `k` = input_k, `x` = input_x - 1, and `y` = input_y.
Output State: **`n` = input_n, `m` = input_m, `k` = input_k, `x` = input_x - 1, and `y` = input_y**
