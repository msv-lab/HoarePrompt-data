The value of `max_questions` is decreased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
`n` is still an integer greater than 0 and equals `input_n`, 
`m` is still an integer greater than 1 and equals `input_m`, 
`k` is still an integer greater than 0 and equals `input_k`, 
`full_cycles` is still calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, 
`min_questions` is still calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, 
`remaining_questions` is still greater than 1, 
`col` is still 2 and equals `y`, 
If `row` equals `x`, then `sergei_questions` is still increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, `m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 1, `k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0, `full_cycles` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `min_questions` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `col` equals `y` and is 2, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, If `row` equals `x`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1**
