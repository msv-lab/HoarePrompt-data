The value of `direction` is changed to -1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, 
`m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 0, 
`k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0, 
`x` equals `input_x - 1`, 
`row` equals `x + 1` which is `input_x`, 
`y` equals `input_y - 1`, 
`col` equals `y` which is `input_y - 1`, 
if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y` then `sergei_questions` equals `sergei_questions + 1` considering the new value of `row`, 
`full_cycles` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, 
`remaining_questions` is greater than 0, 
`min_questions` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, 
`max_questions` equals `max_questions + 1`, 
`direction` equals -1, 
and the current value of `row` is equal to `n`.
Output State: **`n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, `m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 0, `k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0, `x` equals `input_x - 1`, `row` equals `input_x`, `y` equals `input_y - 1`, `col` equals `input_y - 1`, if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y` then `sergei_questions` equals `sergei_questions + 1` considering the new value of `row`, `full_cycles` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `min_questions` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `max_questions` equals `max_questions + 1`, `direction` equals -1, and the current value of `row` is equal to `n`.**
