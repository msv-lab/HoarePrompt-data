The value of `row` is decreased by 2. The previous value of `row` is `n`. 

Output State: **`n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, `m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 0, `k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0, `full_cycles`, `min_questions`, `remaining_questions`, and `sergei_questions` are determined by whether `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, `max_questions` is one more than its previous value, `row` equals `n - 2`, `col` is 0, and `direction` is -1**
