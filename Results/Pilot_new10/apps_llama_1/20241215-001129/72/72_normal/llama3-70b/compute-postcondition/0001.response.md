To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given code and its impact on the variables.

The code provided is:

```python
max_asked = (k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)
```

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `m` are integers,
- `k` is a non-negative integer,
- `x` and `y` are integers.

Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. **Impact on `max_asked`:** The variable `max_asked` is assigned a value calculated from `k`, `n`. The formula `(k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)` implies a form of integer division that calculates a quotient in which the digits after the decimal point are not taken into account. The numerator of the division includes `k` (non-negative) and `n-1`, while the denominator is `2*n`.

2. **Previous Values of Affected Variables:** 
   - `k` is a non-negative integer.
   - `n` is an integer. 

3. **Calculation Result:**
   - Since `k` is non-negative and `n` is any integer, the expression `(k + (n - 1))` can yield any integer value depending on `k` and `n`.
   - The division by `(2 * n)` will result in an integer due to the `//` operator, which performs floor division. This operation will truncate any fractional part, leaving an integer.
   - The sign and value of `max_asked` depend on the signs and values of `k` and `n`. For example, if `n` is positive, `max_asked` will be non-negative. If `n` is negative, the expression's sign will depend on the relative magnitudes of `k` and `n`.

4. **States of Other Variables:**
   - The states of `m`, `x`, and `y` are not affected by this operation as they are not involved in the calculation.

Therefore, considering the initial state and the impact of the code, we can conclude that:
- `n` and `m` are integers,
- `k` is a non-negative integer,
- `x` and `y` are integers,
- `max_asked` is an integer calculated as `(k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)`, which can be positive, negative, or zero depending on the values of `k` and `n`.

Given the provided information and adhering strictly to the format:

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers, `k` is a non-negative integer, `x` and `y` are integers, `max_asked` is `(k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)`**
