The code snippet uses the `map` function to convert a string of space-separated integers into a list of integers, and then assigns these integers to the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y`. The `input` function accepts a string input from the user, and the `split` method splits this string into a list of substrings separated by spaces.

Given the initial state that `n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 100, `k` is a non-negative integer, and `x` and `y` are integers between 1 and `n` and 1 and `m` respectively, the code updates these variables with new integer values obtained from the input.

The updated values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` are integers, but their ranges are not restricted to the initial ranges. The value of `n` can be any integer, not just between 1 and 100. Similarly, `m` can be any integer, `k` can be any non-negative integer, and `x` and `y` can be any integers, not just within the ranges of `n` and `m` respectively.

However, since the initial state also restricts `x` and `y` in relation to `n` and `m`, after the update, the relationship that `x` is between 1 and `n` and `y` is between 1 and `m` may not hold if the new values of `n` and `m` are less than the new values of `x` and `y` respectively.

Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` are integers where `n` and `m` can be any integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, and `x` and `y` are integers. The relationship between `x`, `y` and `n`, `m` is not necessarily maintained as `x` and `y` may not be within the range of new values of `n` and `m`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers, `k` is a non-negative integer, `x` and `y` are integers**
