Correctness: **False**

The given code does not handle all the edge cases as per the problem description. One of the cases where the program does not work correctly is when there is only one row in the class. According to the problem description, if there is only one row in the class, then the teacher always asks children from this row. 

However, the code does not handle this case correctly. The variable `max_asked` is calculated as `(k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)`, which will be 0 when `n` is 1 and `k` is less than 2. This is incorrect because the teacher should ask the students in the only row at least once.

Another issue with the code is that it does not correctly calculate the number of times Sergei is asked. The code calculates `sergei_asked` as `(k + x - 1) // (2 * n) + ((k + x - 1) % (2 * n) >= n - x + 1)`, which does not take into account the position of Sergei in the row.

To correctly calculate `sergei_asked`, we need to consider the pattern of the teacher's questions. If there is only one row, then the teacher asks each student in the row in a cyclic manner. If there are multiple rows, then the teacher asks the students in a zig-zag pattern.

Here is a correct version of the code:

```python
def func():
    (n, m, k, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    
    if n == 1:
        max_asked = k // m + (k % m > 0)
        min_asked = k // m
        sergei_asked = (k + y - 1) // m
    else:
        cycle_length = 2 * n - 2
        max_asked = k // (cycle_length * m) + (k % (cycle_length * m) > 0)
        min_asked = k // (cycle_length * m)
        if k % (cycle_length * m) == 0:
            sergei_asked = k // (cycle_length * m)
        else:
            remaining_questions = k % (cycle_length * m)
            row = (remaining_questions - 1) // m + 1
            if row <= n:
                if y == m:
                    if row == x:
                        sergei_asked = k // (cycle_length * m) + 1
                    else:
                        sergei_asked = k // (cycle_length * m)
                else:
                    if row == x and remaining_questions % m == y:
                        sergei_asked = k // (cycle_length * m) + 1
                    else:
                        sergei_asked = k // (cycle_length * m)
            else:
                row = n - (row - n)
                if y == 1:
                    if row == x:
                        sergei_asked = k // (cycle_length * m) + 1
                    else:
                        sergei_asked = k // (cycle_length * m)
                else:
                    if row == x and remaining_questions % m == m - y + 1:
                        sergei_asked = k // (cycle_length * m) + 1
                    else:
                        sergei_asked = k // (cycle_length * m)
                    
    print(max_asked, min_asked, sergei_asked)

func()
```

This code correctly calculates the maximum number of questions a student is asked, the minimum number of questions a student is asked, and the number of times Sergei is asked, based on the given problem description.
