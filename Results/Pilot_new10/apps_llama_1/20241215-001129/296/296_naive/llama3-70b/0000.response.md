Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when the input is 4, the program should print "YES" and provide a sequence of fractions that sum to 1 - 1/4 = 3/4. However, the program prints "YES" and then prints "1 2" and "1 4", which corresponds to the fractions 1/2 and 1/4, respectively. The sum of these fractions is 3/4, which is correct, but the program does not always produce a correct sequence of fractions for all inputs.

Another issue with the program is that it always prints "1" as the numerator for both fractions. This is not correct, as the problem statement allows for any positive integers a_i and b_i such that 1 â‰¤ a_i < b_i.

For example, when the input is 6, the program prints "YES" and then prints "1 3" and "1 6". However, a correct sequence of fractions for this input could also be "1 2" and "1 3", as shown in the example in the problem description.

The program needs to be modified to correctly calculate the sequence of fractions for all possible inputs, and it should not always print "1" as the numerator for both fractions. 

One way to solve this problem is to find all the divisors of n and then use a subset sum problem to find the correct sequence of fractions. Here is an example of a correct solution in Python:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    if n == 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        k = 2
        print(k)
        print('1', n // 2)
        print('1', n)

        # Check if this sequence is correct
        sum_fractions = 1 / (n // 2) + 1 / n
        if sum_fractions!= 1 - 1 / n:
            print("Error in calculation")

func()
```

However, the previous code still does not work correctly for all cases. It only works for certain values of n where n // 2 and n are divisors of n.

A more general solution involves finding the proper divisors and then finding the right numerators.

```python
import math

def find_proper_divisors(n):
    divisors = []
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i!= n // i:
                divisors.append(n // i)
    return divisors

def find_sequence(n):
    divisors = find_proper_divisors(n)
    # Use a subset sum problem to find the correct sequence of fractions
    # This can be done using dynamic programming
    target = 1 - 1 / n
    for divisor in divisors:
        numerator = 1
        while numerator < divisor:
            fraction = numerator / divisor
            remaining = target - fraction
            for other_divisor in divisors:
                if other_divisor == divisor:
                    continue
                other_numerator = int(remaining * other_divisor)
                if other_numerator < other_divisor and other_numerator > 0:
                    if math.isclose(remaining, other_numerator / other_divisor):
                        return [(numerator, divisor), (other_numerator, other_divisor)]
            numerator += 1
    return None

def func():
    n = int(input())
    if n == 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        sequence = find_sequence(n)
        if sequence is not None:
            print('YES')
            print(len(sequence))
            for numerator, divisor in sequence:
                print(numerator, divisor)
        else:
            print("NO")

func()
```

In the previous Python code, `find_proper_divisors` finds all the proper divisors of `n`, and `find_sequence` uses these divisors to find a sequence of fractions that sum to `1 - 1/n`. If such a sequence is found, it is printed; otherwise, "NO" is printed.
