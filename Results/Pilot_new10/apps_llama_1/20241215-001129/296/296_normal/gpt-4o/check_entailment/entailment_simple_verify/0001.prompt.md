You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a positive integer $n$.

Find a sequence of fractions $\frac{a_i}{b_i}$, $i = 1 \ldots k$ (where $a_i$ and $b_i$ are positive integers) for some $k$ such that:

$$ \begin{cases} \text{$b_i$ divides $n$, $1 < b_i < n$ for $i = 1 \ldots k$} \\ \text{$1 \le a_i < b_i$ for $i = 1 \ldots k$} \\ \text{$\sum\limits_{i=1}^k \frac{a_i}{b_i} = 1 - \frac{1}{n}$} \end{cases} $$


-----Input-----

The input consists of a single integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

In the first line print "YES" if there exists such a sequence of fractions or "NO" otherwise.

If there exists such a sequence, next lines should contain a description of the sequence in the following format.

The second line should contain integer $k$ ($1 \le k \le 100\,000$) — the number of elements in the sequence. It is guaranteed that if such a sequence exists, then there exists a sequence of length at most $100\,000$.

Next $k$ lines should contain fractions of the sequence with two integers $a_i$ and $b_i$ on each line.


-----Examples-----
Input
2

Output
NO

Input
6

Output
YES
2
1 2
1 3



-----Note-----

In the second example there is a sequence $\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}$ such that $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = 1 - \frac{1}{6}$.
Program:
```
import math

n = int(input().strip())
result = func_1(n)
print(result)

def func_1(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return 'NO'
    divisors = []
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i != n // i:
                divisors.append(n // i)
    if not divisors:
        return 'NO'
    k = len(divisors)
    fractions = [(1, d) for d in divisors]
    return f'YES\n{k}\n' + '\n'.join((f'{a} {b}' for (a, b) in fractions))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue with the program is that it does not correctly calculate the sequence of fractions that sum up to `1 - 1/n`. It simply generates all the divisors of `n` and pairs them with `1` as the numerator, which is not guaranteed to satisfy the equation.

For example, when the input is `6`, the program correctly outputs `YES` and generates the sequence `1/2` and `1/3`, which sums up to `1 - 1/6`. However, when the input is `4`, the program outputs `YES` and generates the sequence `1/2`, which does not sum up to `1 - 1/4 = 3/4`. The correct output for the input `4` should be `YES` and the sequence `1/2` and `1/4`, but the program does not generate this sequence.

Another issue with the program is that it does not handle the case where `n` is a prime number greater than `2`. In this case, the only divisors of `n` are `1` and `n`, and the program should output `NO` because there is no sequence of fractions that sums up to `1 - 1/n`. However, the program outputs `YES` and generates an empty sequence.

To fix these issues, the program needs to be modified to correctly calculate the sequence of fractions that sum up to `1 - 1/n`. This can be done by using a different approach, such as using the fact that `1 - 1/n = (n-1)/n` and finding a sequence of fractions that sums up to `(n-1)/n`.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
n = int(input().strip())
result = func_1(n)
print(result)

import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9.
def func_1(n):
    if (n <= 2) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: n is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9, and n is larger than 2
    divisors = []
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i != n // i:
                divisors.append(n // i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9, `i` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `n`, `divisors` is a list containing all the divisors of `n` that are less than or equal to the square root of `n`.
    if (not divisors) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9, `i` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `n`, `divisors` is a list containing all the divisors of `n` that are less than or equal to the square root of `n`, and `divisors` is not empty
    k = len(divisors)
    fractions = [(1, d) for d in divisors]
    return f'YES\n{k}\n' + '\n'.join(f'{a} {b}' for a, b in fractions)
    #The program returns a string that starts with 'YES', followed by the number of divisors of `n` that are less than or equal to the square root of `n`, and then lists each of these divisors in the format '1 d', where d is a divisor of `n` and is less than or equal to the square root of `n`.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
