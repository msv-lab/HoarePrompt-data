Correctness: **False**.

The code does not correctly solve the problem. It only checks for divisors of `n` up to the square root of `n`, but the problem statement requires that `b_i` divides `n` and `1 < b_i < n`. This means that the code may miss some valid fractions where `b_i` is greater than the square root of `n` but still less than `n`.

For example, if `n = 6`, the code will correctly output `YES` with fractions `1/2` and `1/3`. However, if `n = 12`, the code will output `YES` with fractions `1/2`, `1/3`, `1/4`, and `1/6`, but it does not check if the sum of these fractions is equal to `1 - 1/n`. In fact, the sum of these fractions is greater than `1 - 1/12`.

Moreover, the code does not check if the sum of the fractions is equal to `1 - 1/n`. It simply outputs all the fractions with `a_i = 1` and `b_i` being a divisor of `n`. This is not sufficient to solve the problem, as the problem requires that the sum of the fractions is equal to `1 - 1/n`.

Therefore, the code does not correctly solve the problem and its correctness is **False**.
