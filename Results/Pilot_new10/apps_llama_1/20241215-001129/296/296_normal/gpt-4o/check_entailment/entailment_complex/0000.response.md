Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Incorrect handling of prime numbers**: The program returns 'NO' if `n` has no divisors other than 1 and itself, which is incorrect. According to the problem description, the program should find a sequence of fractions that sums up to `1 - 1/n`, even if `n` is a prime number.

2. **Insufficient sequence generation**: The program generates a sequence of fractions with `a_i = 1` and `b_i` being the divisors of `n`. However, this does not guarantee that the sum of these fractions equals `1 - 1/n`. The program does not consider the actual values of `a_i` and `b_i` that would satisfy the equation.

3. **Lack of validation**: The program does not validate whether the generated sequence of fractions actually sums up to `1 - 1/n`. It simply returns a string with the sequence of fractions without checking its correctness.

A counterexample can be demonstrated with the input `n = 5`. The program returns 'NO' because 5 is a prime number. However, a correct sequence of fractions can be found: `1/2` and `1/3` are not divisors of 5, but `1/4` and `1/5` are not a solution either, but a correct solution would be `1/4` and `1/20` since `1/4 + 1/20 = 1 - 1/5`.

To fix these issues, the program needs to be modified to correctly generate a sequence of fractions that sums up to `1 - 1/n` for all possible values of `n`. This may involve using a different approach, such as using the prime factorization of `n` or employing a more sophisticated algorithm to find the correct sequence of fractions.
