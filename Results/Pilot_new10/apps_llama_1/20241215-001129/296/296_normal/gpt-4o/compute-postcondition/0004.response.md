According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive). For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 4, since the square root of `n` should be at least 2. 

The state before the loop starts mentions that `n` is larger than 2, which is not sufficient to guarantee the execution of the loop. Therefore, the state of `n` needs to be adjusted to reflect this. Additionally, since `i` is the loop variable, it will be initialized to 2 at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 10^9, `divisors` is an empty list, `i` is 2**
