The code creates a new list `fractions` containing tuples, where each tuple is a pair of 1 and a divisor from the `divisors` list. 

The value of `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9, the value of `i` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `n`, the value of `divisors` is a list containing all the divisors of `n` that are less than or equal to the square root of `n` and is not empty, and `k` is the number of elements in `divisors`. 

Since the code only introduces a new variable `fractions` and does not alter the existing variables `n`, `i`, `divisors`, or `k`, the output state will include the new variable and the unchanged state of the existing variables.

The new variable `fractions` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains 1 and a divisor from the `divisors` list.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9, `i` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `n`, `divisors` is a list containing all the divisors of `n` that are less than or equal to the square root of `n` and is not empty, `k` is the number of elements in `divisors`, and `fractions` is a list of tuples equal to [(1, d) for d in `divisors`].

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9, `i` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `n`, `divisors` is a list containing all the divisors of `n` that are less than or equal to the square root of `n` and is not empty, `k` is the number of elements in `divisors`, and `fractions` is a list of tuples equal to [(1, d) for d in `divisors`]**
