Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 10^9, `i` is 3. If `n` is a multiple of 3 and `n` is greater than 9, then `divisors` is a list containing the integers 3 and `n // 3`, given that `i` is not equal to `n // i`. If `n` equals 9, which is a multiple of 3, or if `n` is not a multiple of 3, no update to `divisors` is specified, but `n` remains an integer between 4 and 10^9, and `i` remains 3.**
