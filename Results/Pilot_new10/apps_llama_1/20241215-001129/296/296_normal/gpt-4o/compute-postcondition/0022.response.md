Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9, `i` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `n`, `divisors` is an empty list, meaning it contains no divisors of `n` that are less than or equal to the square root of `n`, indicating that the current value of `n` has no divisors other than 1 and possibly itself, and the current value of `divisors` remains empty.**
