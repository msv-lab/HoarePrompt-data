To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 10^9.
- `i` is 2.
- The state of `divisors` depends on whether `n` is even or odd and the relationship between `n` and `i`.

The loop statement is:
```
for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`. Since `i` is currently 2, for the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 3.

Considering the constraints and the increment of `i`, the conditions for `n` and the potential changes to `divisors` need to be assessed based on the new value of `i`. However, the exact state of `divisors` after the previous iteration is not explicitly defined for all cases (it depends on the parity of `n` and the relationship between `n` and `i`), but we can infer the adjustment needed for the loop to continue:

- `n` remains an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 10^9, as this condition does not change with iterations.
- `i` will be 3, as it increments by 1 from its previous value of 2.
- The potential update to `divisors` depends on whether `n` is even and if `n // i` (now `n // 3`) is not equal to `i` (which is 3). If `n` is even and `n // 3` is not equal to 3, `divisors` could be updated to include 3 and `n // 3` if they are not already included. If `n` is odd, no change is made to `divisors` based on the previous iteration's rules.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, considering `i` needs to be less than `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`, and given that `i` will be 3, we can state:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `n` must be greater than or equal to 9 to ensure `i` (now 3) is less than `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`, `i` is 3**. 

Note: The condition on `n` to be greater than or equal to 9 ensures that `i` (which is 3) is less than `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`, thus allowing the loop to potentially continue. The state of `divisors` may or may not change based on the evenness of `n` and the relationship between `n` and `i`, but the loop's continuation primarily depends on `i` and `n`.
