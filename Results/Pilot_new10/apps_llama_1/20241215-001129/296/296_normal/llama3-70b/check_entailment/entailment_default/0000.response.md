Correctness: **False**

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by printing 'YES' and providing a sequence of two fractions for every input `n` except when `n` is 2. However, the provided fractions are `1/(n // 2)` and `1/n`, which do not satisfy the condition `sum(a_i/b_i) = 1 - 1/n` for all `n`.

For example, when `n` is 6, the program prints `1/3` and `1/6`, which sum to `1/2`, and indeed `1/2 + 1/3 = 5/6 = 1 - 1/6`. However, this does not hold for all `n`.

A counterexample can be seen when `n` is 4. The program would print `1/2` and `1/4`, which sum to `3/4`, but `1 - 1/4` is `3/4`, so this case actually works. 

However, consider `n = 5`. The program would print `1/2` (because `n // 2 = 2`) and `1/5`. The sum of these fractions is `1/2 + 1/5 = 7/10`, which is not equal to `1 - 1/5 = 4/5`. Therefore, the program does not work for all potential cases.

This example shows that the given program does not satisfy the problem description for every potential case, so the correctness is **False**.
