Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements in the problem description for every potential case. 

According to the problem description, the sequence of fractions $\frac{a_i}{b_i}$ should satisfy the following conditions:

1. $b_i$ divides $n$, $1 < b_i < n$ for $i = 1 \ldots k$
2. $1 \le a_i < b_i$ for $i = 1 \ldots k$
3. $\sum\limits_{i=1}^k \frac{a_i}{b_i} = 1 - \frac{1}{n}$

The given program only handles the case when $n = 2$ and prints 'NO' correctly. For $n > 2$, it prints 'YES', $k = 2$, and two fractions: $\frac{1}{\frac{n}{2}}$ and $\frac{1}{n}$.

However, the program does not ensure that the denominators of the fractions ($\frac{n}{2}$ and $n$) always divide $n$. The condition $1 < b_i < n$ is not always met, especially when $n$ is an odd number, because $\frac{n}{2}$ is not an integer.

For example, if $n = 5$, the program will print $\frac{1}{\frac{5}{2}}$ and $\frac{1}{5}$, but $\frac{5}{2}$ does not divide $5$, and the sum of the fractions does not equal $1 - \frac{1}{5}$.

Therefore, the program does not always follow the problem description, and its correctness is **False**.
