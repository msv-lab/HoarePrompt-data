The initial state of `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, but this value is overwritten by the input. 
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. 
The state of `n` being a positive integer greater than 1 before the code is executed does not affect the state after the code is executed, because `n` is reassigned.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer**
