The code prints the value of `k`, which is 2. The value of `n` is still an input integer and not equal to 2. 'YES' has been printed before, so the output of the program now includes 'YES' and the value of `k`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `n` is not equal to 2, 'YES' and 2 have been printed, `k` is 2**
