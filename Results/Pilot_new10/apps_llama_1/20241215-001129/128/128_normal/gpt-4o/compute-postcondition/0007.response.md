To calculate the output state, we need to understand the impact of the given code on the program. The code is appending a new value to the `potential_sales_increase` list. This value is calculated as `min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l)`, where `k` and `l` are the next pair of values from the `days` list.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `f` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= f <= n`.
- `days` is a list of at least two pairs of non-negative integers.
- `regular_sales` is a list containing the minimum of the first pair of values from `days` and the minimum of `k` and `l`, where `k` and `l` are the next pair of values from the `days` list.
- `potential_sales_increase` is a list containing `min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l)`.

The code `potential_sales_increase.append(min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l))` will add another element to the `potential_sales_increase` list, which is calculated based on the next pair of values (`k` and `l`) from the `days` list.

Since `k` and `l` are the next pair of values from the `days` list after the pair used to calculate the previous `regular_sales` and `potential_sales_increase`, and given that `days` contains at least two pairs of non-negative integers, `k` and `l` are well-defined for the calculation.

Thus, the new element appended to `potential_sales_increase` will be based on these `k` and `l` values, but without explicit values for `k` and `l` or their relationship to `n`, `f`, and previous values in `days`, we can only describe the update in terms of the operation performed.

The states of `n`, `f`, `days`, and `regular_sales` are not affected by this operation, as it only involves appending a new calculation to `potential_sales_increase`.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` is a positive integer, 
`f` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= f <= n`, 
`days` is a list of at least two pairs of non-negative integers, 
`regular_sales` is a list containing the minimum of the first pair of values from `days` and the minimum of `k` and `l`, where `k` and `l` are the next pair of values from the `days` list, 
`potential_sales_increase` is a list containing its previous values plus an additional value `min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l)` calculated from the next pair of `days`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= f <= n`, `days` is a list of at least two pairs of non-negative integers, `regular_sales` is a list containing the minimum of the first pair of values from `days` and the minimum of `k` and `l`, where `k` and `l` are the next pair of values from the `days` list, `potential_sales_increase` is a list containing its previous values plus an additional value `min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l)`**
