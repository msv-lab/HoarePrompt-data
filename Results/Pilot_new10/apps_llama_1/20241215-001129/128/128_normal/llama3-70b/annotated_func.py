#State of the program right berfore the function call: the function is given two lists of integers, where the first list contains two integers n and f (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ f ≤ n), and the subsequent n lists contain two integers k_i and l_i (0 ≤ k_i, l_i ≤ 10^9) for i = 1 to n, where k_i represents the number of products on the shelves of the shop on the i-th day and l_i represents the number of clients that will come to the shop on the i-th day.
def func():
    n, f = map(int, input().split())
    days = []
    for _ in range(n):
        k, l = map(int, input().split())
        
        days.append((k, l))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer in the range [1, 10^5], `f` is an integer in the range [0, `n`], there are `n` lists each containing two integers `k_i` and `l_i`, and `days` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains two input integers.
    days.sort(key=lambda x: x[1] - x[0], reverse=True)
    sold = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if i < f:
            sold += min(days[i][0] * 2, days[i][1])
        else:
            sold += min(days[i][0], days[i][1])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer in the range [1, 10^5], `f` is an integer in the range [0, `n`], there are `n` lists each containing two integers `k_i` and `l_i`, `days` is a sorted list of `n` tuples in descending order by `x[1] - x[0]`, and `sold` is the sum of `min(days[i][0] * 2, days[i][1])` for the first `f` iterations and `min(days[i][0], days[i][1])` for the remaining iterations.
    print(sold)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates the total number of products that can be sold over a given number of days, considering a differentiation in sales strategy between a specified number of forecast days and the remaining days, and prints this total. It assumes that during forecast days, products can be sold to meet twice the available stock, limited by client demand, and for other days, sales are limited by the minimum of available stock and client demand, without validating for negative inputs or considering the real-world implications of selling a product twice.
