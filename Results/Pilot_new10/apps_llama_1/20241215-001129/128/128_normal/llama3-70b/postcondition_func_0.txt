The function calculates the total number of products that can be sold over a given number of days, considering a differentiation in sales strategy between a specified number of forecast days and the remaining days, and prints this total. It assumes that during forecast days, products can be sold to meet twice the available stock, limited by client demand, and for other days, sales are limited by the minimum of available stock and client demand, without validating for negative inputs or considering the real-world implications of selling a product twice.
