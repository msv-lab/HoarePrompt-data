Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer in the range [1, 10^5], `f` is an integer in the range [0, `n`], there are `n` lists each containing two integers `k_i` and `l_i`, `days` is a sorted list of `n` tuples in descending order by `x[1] - x[0]`. If `i` is less than `f`, then `sold` is `min(days[i][0] * 2, days[i][1])` more than its initial value of 0. If `i` is greater than or equal to `f`, then `sold` is its previous value plus `min(days[i][0], days[i][1])`, and `i` is an integer with a current value, where the value of `i` and `sold` are updated based on the condition `i < f`.***
