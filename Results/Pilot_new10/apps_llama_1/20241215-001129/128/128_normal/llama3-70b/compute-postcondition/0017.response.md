Postcondition: **`n` is an integer in the range [1, 10^5], `f` is an integer in the range [0, `n`], there are `n` lists each containing two integers `k_i` and `l_i`, `days` is a sorted list of `n` tuples in descending order by `x[1] - x[0]`, `sold` is 0, `i` is equal to or larger than `f`, and `i` is 0 or more, depending on previous values of `i` before the if condition, but since `i` is compared to `f` in the if condition, the value of `i` that matters for the postcondition is that it is greater than or equal to `f`**
