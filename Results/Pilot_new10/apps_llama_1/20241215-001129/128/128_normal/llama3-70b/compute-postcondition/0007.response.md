The code appends a new tuple `(k, l)` to the `days` list. The previous values of `n`, `f`, and the `n` lists containing `k_i` and `l_i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range [2, 10^5], `f` is an integer in the range [0, `n`], there are `n` lists each containing two integers `k_i` and `l_i`, `days` is a list containing two tuples, the first tuple is `(k, l)` from the initial state and the second tuple is `(k, l)` from the new input, `k` is an input integer from the new input, `l` is an input integer from the new input**
