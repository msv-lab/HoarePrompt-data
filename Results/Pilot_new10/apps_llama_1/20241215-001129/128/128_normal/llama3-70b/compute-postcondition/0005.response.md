According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If the loop has not completed `n` iterations, it can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer in the range [1, 10^5]. The loop variable `_` is not explicitly used, but its value is incremented at the end of each iteration. Since the loop has already executed once, the value of `_` is implicitly 1, and for the loop to execute again, `_` should be less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an integer in the range [2, 10^5], `f` is an integer in the range [0, `n`], there are `n` lists each containing two integers `k_i` and `l_i`, `days` is a list containing one tuple `(k, l)`, `k` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer**
