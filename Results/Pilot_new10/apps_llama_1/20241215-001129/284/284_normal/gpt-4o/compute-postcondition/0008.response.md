To calculate the postcondition, we need to consider the precondition and the negation of the if condition.

Precondition: x is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 1000, and x is greater than 1, and x is greater than 3. This simplifies to x being a positive integer such that 4 ≤ x ≤ 1000.

If condition: `if (x % 2 == 0 or x % 3 == 0)`. The negation of this condition is `(x % 2!= 0 and x % 3!= 0)`, meaning x is neither divisible by 2 nor by 3.

Postcondition: **x is a positive integer such that 4 ≤ x ≤ 1000, x is greater than 1, x is greater than 3, and x is neither divisible by 2 nor by 3.** 

This postcondition retains all conditions from the precondition and adds the condition that x must not be divisible by either 2 or 3, which is the negation of the if condition.
