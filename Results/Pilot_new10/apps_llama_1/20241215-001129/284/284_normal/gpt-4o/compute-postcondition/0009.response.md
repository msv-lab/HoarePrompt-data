The code snippet `i = 5` assigns the value `5` to the variable `i`. This does not affect the value of `x`. 

The initial conditions state that `x` is a positive integer such that `4 ≤ x ≤ 1000`, `x` is greater than `1`, `x` is greater than `3`, and `x` is neither divisible by `2` nor by `3`. Since `x` is neither divisible by `2` nor by `3`, and considering the range `4 ≤ x ≤ 1000`, `x` can only be certain odd numbers not divisible by `3`. The smallest such number is `5`, and the largest is `997`. The conditions that `x` is greater than `1` and `x` is greater than `3` are inherently satisfied by the range condition `4 ≤ x ≤ 1000`.

Therefore, the output state is: `x` is a positive odd integer such that `5 ≤ x ≤ 997`, `x` is not divisible by `2` or `3`, and `i` is `5`.

Output State: **`x` is a positive odd integer such that `5 ≤ x ≤ 997`, `x` is not divisible by `2` or `3`, and `i` is `5`**
