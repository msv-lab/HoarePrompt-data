The value of `i` is incremented by 6. The previous value of `i` is 5, so the new value of `i` is 11. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is a positive odd integer such that `25 ≤ x ≤ 997`, `x` is not divisible by `2` or `3`, `x` is not divisible by `5` or `7`, and `i` is `11`.
Output State: **`x` is a positive odd integer such that `25 ≤ x ≤ 997`, `x` is not divisible by `2` or `3`, `x` is not divisible by `5` or `7`, and `i` is `11`**
