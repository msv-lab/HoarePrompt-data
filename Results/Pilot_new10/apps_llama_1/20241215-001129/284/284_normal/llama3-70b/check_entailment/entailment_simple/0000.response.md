Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct and meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why:

1. The program takes an integer `n` as input from the user.
2. It then iterates over a range of values for `m` from 1 to 1000.
3. For each `m`, it calculates the value of `n * m + 1` and checks if it's a prime number using the `func_1` function.
4. If `n * m + 1` is not a prime number (i.e., `func_1` returns `False`), the program prints the current value of `m` and breaks out of the loop.
5. The `func_1` function checks if a given number `num` is prime by iterating up to its square root and checking for divisibility. If `num` is divisible by any number in this range, it's not a prime number, and the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

The program always does what the problem description says because:

* It iterates over a range of values for `m` as specified in the problem description (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^3).
* It checks if `n * m + 1` is a prime number using the correct definition of prime numbers (a natural number greater than 1 with no positive divisors other than 1 and itself).
* It returns the first value of `m` for which `n * m + 1` is not a prime number, which is a suitable counterexample to PolandBall's hypothesis.

There are no potential cases where the program does not follow the problem description, as it correctly implements the required logic and iteration over the specified range of values.
