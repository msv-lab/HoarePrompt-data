The original assessment seems to be accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The code defines a function `func_1` to check if a number is prime, and then iterates over all possible values of `m` from 1 to 1000 to find a counterexample where `n*m + 1` is not a prime number.

The output hints provided confirm the functionality of the `func_1` function and do not indicate any issues with the code. The function `func_1` checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility up to the square root of the number, which is an efficient and correct approach.

The code handles all possible cases as described in the problem, and it does so efficiently by limiting the search for `m` to the range 1 to 1000, as guaranteed by the problem statement.

One potential concern mentioned in the original assessment is that the function `func_1` is defined after it's called in the main part of the code. However, as explained in the original assessment, Python's execution model allows this, and the code should work correctly.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I agree with the original assessment that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
