According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `num`. If `i` is less than the square root of `num`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `num` is an odd integer between 4 and 1000 that is not divisible by 2 or 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 4. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `num`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `num` must be greater than or equal to 4^2 = 16, since the loop checks up to the square root of `num`.
State: **`num` is an odd integer between 16 and 1000 that is not divisible by 2 or 3, and `i` is 4**
