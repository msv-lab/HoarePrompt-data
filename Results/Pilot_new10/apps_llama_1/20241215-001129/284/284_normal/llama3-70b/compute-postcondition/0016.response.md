The function `func_1` accepts an integer `num` and checks if it's a prime number within the range [1, 1000]. It first checks if `num` is less than 2 and returns False in that case. Then it iterates from 2 to the square root of `num` to check for any divisors. If a divisor is found, it returns False. If no divisors are found, it returns True, indicating that `num` is a prime number. 

The code handles edge cases such as `num` being 1 (returns False), and `num` being a prime number (returns True). However, the annotations don't explicitly mention what happens when `num` is outside the range [1, 1000], but based on the code, it will still work correctly for any integer `num`. 

The function doesn't handle cases where `num` is not an integer, but since the problem statement doesn't mention this, we can assume that `num` will always be an integer.

Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `num` and returns True if `num` is a prime number greater than or equal to 2, False if `num` is less than 2 or has any divisors other than 1 and itself **
