Postcondition: ***`num` is an odd integer between 4 and 1000 that is not divisible by 2 or 3, and `i` is 3. If `num` is divisible by `i` (which is 3), the program returns False. Since `num` is not divisible by 3 according to the precondition, the program will not return False, implying that the condition `num % i == 0` is never true given the initial conditions, thus the state of the variables remains unchanged except for the implicit case where the function doesn't return anything if `num` is not divisible by `i`.***
