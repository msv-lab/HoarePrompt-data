Correctness: **True**

The provided program is a Python solution that checks the PolandBall hypothesis. The hypothesis is proven wrong by finding a counterexample where `n*m + 1` is not a prime number for a given `n`. The program iterates over all possible values of `m` from 1 to 1000 and checks whether `n*m + 1` is a prime number or not using a helper function `func_1`. 

The `func_1` function checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility up to the square root of the number. If the number is divisible by any number in this range, it's not a prime number.

This solution follows the problem description accurately, checking all possible values of `m` for a given `n` and returning the first `m` where `n*m + 1` is not a prime number.

The code handles all possible cases as described in the problem, and it does so efficiently by limiting the search for `m` to the range 1 to 1000, as guaranteed by the problem statement. 

One potential concern is that the function `func_1` is defined after it's called in the main part of the code. However, Python is able to handle this due to its execution model, where it first parses the entire file and then executes it. So, by the time the code reaches the call to `func_1`, the function has already been defined. 

Thus, the program is correct in every case, and it should work as expected according to the problem description.
