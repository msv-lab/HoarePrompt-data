Correctness: **True**.

The given program is designed to find a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis, which states that there exists a positive integer n such that for each positive integer m, n·m + 1 is a prime number. The program takes an integer n as input and checks for each positive integer m (from 1 to 1000) whether n·m + 1 is a prime number or not.

The function `func_1(x)` is used to check if a number x is prime. This function correctly checks for primality by first handling the base cases (x ≤ 1, x ≤ 3, and x being divisible by 2 or 3), and then checks for divisibility by numbers of the form 6k ± 1, which is a common optimization when testing for primality.

As soon as the program finds an m such that n·m + 1 is not a prime number, it prints that value of m and breaks out of the loop. The program is guaranteed to find such an m for any given n, as stated in the problem description.

The program handles all potential cases correctly. For any given n, it checks all possible values of m in the range from 1 to 1000 and prints the first m for which n·m + 1 is not prime. The function `func_1(x)` correctly checks whether a number is prime or not.

Therefore, the program is correct and works as expected for all inputs. It finds a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis for any given n, as required by the problem description.
