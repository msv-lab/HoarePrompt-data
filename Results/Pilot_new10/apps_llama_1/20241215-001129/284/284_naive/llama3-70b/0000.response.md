Correctness: **True**.

The program is designed to find a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis by finding an `m` such that `n * m + 1` is not a prime number. 

The code reads an input `n` and iterates over all possible values of `m` from 1 to 1000. It checks if `n * m + 1` is prime using the helper function `func_1`. If `n * m + 1` is not prime, it prints the current `m` and stops.

The helper function `func_1` checks if a number is prime by iterating from 2 to the square root of the number and checking for divisibility. This is an efficient way to check for primality, as any factor larger than the square root of the number would have a corresponding factor smaller than the square root.

The program handles all potential cases, as it iterates over all possible values of `m` and checks each one for primality. If it finds an `m` for which `n * m + 1` is not prime, it prints the correct result.

The examples provided in the problem description, such as inputs 3 and 4, are handled correctly by the program. For `n = 3`, it outputs `1` because `3 * 1 + 1 = 4` is not prime. For `n = 4`, it outputs `2` because `4 * 2 + 1 = 9` is not prime.

Overall, the program is correct and efficiently solves the problem.
