    return answer
    #The program returns the minimum cost that can be achieved by subtracting powers of 2 from the original value of `L` (which is 0) and adding the corresponding values from the `dp` list, where `dp` is a list where each element is the minimum between its original cost (if it exists) and the propagated minimum from previous elements doubled, and the original costs are from the list `costs` with `n` integers where each integer is a cost such that `1 <= cost <= 10^9`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts parameters n, L, and costs, and returns the minimum cost achievable by subtracting powers of 2 from L and adding the corresponding minimum costs from the provided list of costs, with potential errors or incorrect results for inputs outside the specified ranges or for invalid input types.
