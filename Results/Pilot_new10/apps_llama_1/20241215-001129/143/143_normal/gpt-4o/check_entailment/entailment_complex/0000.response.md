Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. 

The main issue lies in the way the program calculates the minimum cost. It initializes `dp` with the costs from the input list and then propagates the minimum cost by doubling the previous element. However, this approach does not consider the optimal way to buy bottles of different volumes.

In the problem description, a single bottle of type `i` has a volume of `2^i - 1` liters and costs `c_i` roubles. The program does not take into account the volume of each bottle when calculating the minimum cost.

For example, consider the case where `n = 2`, `L = 3`, and `costs = [10, 100]`. The program will calculate the minimum cost as follows:

- `dp[0] = 10` (cost of the first bottle)
- `dp[1] = min(100, 10 * 2) = 20` (propagated minimum cost)

However, the optimal way to buy bottles in this case would be to buy three bottles of type 0 (1 liter each), which would cost `3 * 10 = 30` roubles, or to buy one bottle of type 1 (3 liters), which would cost `100` roubles. The program does not consider this optimal solution.

A correct approach would involve using dynamic programming to calculate the minimum cost for each possible volume from 1 to `L`, taking into account the volumes and costs of the bottles.

The current implementation does not meet the problem description, and therefore, the correctness of the program is False. 

Here's an example of a correct implementation in Python:
```python
def min_cost(n, L, costs):
    dp = [float('inf')] * (L + 1)
    dp[0] = 0

    for i in range(n):
        volume = 2 ** i - 1
        cost = costs[i]

        for j in range(volume, L + 1):
            dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[j - volume] + cost)

    return dp[L]
```
This implementation uses dynamic programming to calculate the minimum cost for each possible volume from 1 to `L`, taking into account the volumes and costs of the bottles. It iterates over each bottle type and updates the minimum cost for each volume that can be achieved using that bottle type. The final result is the minimum cost for the desired volume `L`.
