According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer such that `1 <= n <= 30`, which ensures that the loop will execute at least once. The variable `i` is not initialized before the loop, so it needs to be adjusted to start from 0, which is the first iteration of the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer such that `1 <= n <= 30`, `L` is an integer such that `1 <= L <= 10^9`, `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is a cost such that `1 <= cost <= 10^9`, `max_cost` equals `10^18`, `dp` is a list of 31 integers all equal to `10^18`, `c` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` elements are the costs from `costs` and the remaining elements are `max_cost`, and `i` is 0**
