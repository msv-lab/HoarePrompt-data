To calculate the result, we need to consider the impact of the code on the program and check the previous values of the affected variables. 

The given code is `current_cost += dp[i]`. Here, `current_cost` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i]` to it. The value of `i` is given as 28.

Now, considering the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that `0 <= n <= 30`.
- `L` is an integer which may have been updated to `L - 536870912` if it was greater than or equal to `1 << 29`.
- `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is a cost such that `1 <= cost <= 10^9`.
- `max_cost` equals `10^18`.
- `dp` is a list where each element is the minimum between its original cost (if it exists) and the propagated minimum from previous elements doubled.
- `c` is a list of 31 integers with the first `n` elements as costs from `costs` and the rest as `max_cost`.
- `i` is 28.
- `answer` is the minimum of its original value and `current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[29]`.
- `current_cost` may have been updated before this line of code.

After executing the code `current_cost += dp[i]`, the value of `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + dp[28]`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `0 <= n <= 30`, `L` is an integer which may have been updated to `L - 536870912` if it was greater than or equal to `1 << 29`, `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is a cost such that `1 <= cost <= 10^9`, `max_cost` equals `10^18`, `dp` is a list where each element is the minimum between its original cost (if it exists) and the propagated minimum from previous elements doubled, `c` is a list of 31 integers with the first `n` elements as costs from `costs` and the rest as `max_cost`, `i` is 28, `answer` is the minimum of its original value and `current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[29]`, and `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + dp[28]`.**
