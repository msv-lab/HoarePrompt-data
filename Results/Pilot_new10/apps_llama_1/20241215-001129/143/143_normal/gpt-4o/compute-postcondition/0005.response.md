According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is an integer such that `1 <= n <= 30`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 30`, `L` is an integer such that `1 <= L <= 10^9`, `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is a cost such that `1 <= cost <= 10^9`, `max_cost` equals `10^18`, `dp` is a list of 31 integers where `dp[0]` equals `costs[0]` and the rest equal `10^18`, `c` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` elements are the costs from `costs` and the remaining elements are `max_cost`, and `i` is 1**
