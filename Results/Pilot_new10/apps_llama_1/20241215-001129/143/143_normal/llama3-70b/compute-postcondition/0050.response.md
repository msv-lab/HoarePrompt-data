The given code prints the minimum cost to achieve `L` using volumes up to `n` if this cost is not infinite; otherwise, it prints -1. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a list of `L + 1` elements where `dp[i]` is the minimum cost to achieve `i` using volumes up to `n`, and the minimum cost to achieve `L` is printed, which is `dp[L]` if `dp[L]` is not infinite, otherwise it is -1, `dp[L]` has been returned at the output state.**
