According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 1, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`i` is `L + 1`, `L` is greater than the previous `L`, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1**
