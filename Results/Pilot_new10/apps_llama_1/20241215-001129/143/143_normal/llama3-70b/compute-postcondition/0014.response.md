According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n` and the loop counter `j`. If `j` is less than `n-1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of `n` integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `vol` is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `n` must be at least 2, and `j` must be incremented by 1. 
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of `n` integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `vol` is 1**
