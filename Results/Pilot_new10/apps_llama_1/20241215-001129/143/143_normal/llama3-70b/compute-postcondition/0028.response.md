Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a list of `L + 1` elements where `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[1]` is `costs[1]` if `n` is at least 2, otherwise it is infinity. If `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, then `dp[2]` is the minimum of its previous value and `2 * costs[1]`, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `vol` is 1. If `vol` is greater than `i`, the state of the variables remains unchanged as there is no else part to handle this condition.***
