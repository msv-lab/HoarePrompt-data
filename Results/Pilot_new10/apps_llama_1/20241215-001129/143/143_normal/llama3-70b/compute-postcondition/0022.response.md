Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a list of `L + 1` elements where `dp[0]` is 0 and `dp[1]` is `costs[1]` if `n` is at least 2, otherwise it is infinity, and the rest are initialized with infinity, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, the current value of `vol` is 0, and the current value of `vol` is less than or equal to `i`**
