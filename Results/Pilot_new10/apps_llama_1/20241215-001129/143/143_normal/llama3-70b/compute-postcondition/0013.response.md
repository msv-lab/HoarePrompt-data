Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of `n` integers, if `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, then `dp` is a list of `L + 1` elements where `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[1]` is `costs[1]`, and the rest are initialized with infinity except for `dp[1]`, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `vol` is 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged as there is no else part in the code.**
