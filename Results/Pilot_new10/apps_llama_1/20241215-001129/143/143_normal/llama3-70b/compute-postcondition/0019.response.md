According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `L`. If `i` is less than `L + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a list of `L + 1` elements where `dp[0]` is 0 and `dp[1]` is `costs[1]` if `n` is at least 2, otherwise it is infinity, and the rest are initialized with infinity, `i` is 1, `j` is `n-1`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must be 2.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a list of `L + 1` elements where `dp[0]` is 0 and `dp[1]` is `costs[1]` if `n` is at least 2, otherwise it is infinity, and the rest are initialized with infinity, `i` is 2, `j` is `n-1`**
