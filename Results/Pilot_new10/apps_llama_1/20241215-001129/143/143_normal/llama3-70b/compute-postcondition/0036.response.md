The code `vol = 2 ** j - 1` assigns the value of `2` raised to the power of `j`, minus `1`, to the variable `vol`. Given that `j` is `0`, `2 ** j` equals `2 ** 0` which equals `1`. Therefore, `vol` is assigned the value `1 - 1`, which equals `0`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, `i` remains `L + 1`, `L` is still greater than the previous `L`, `n` is still greater than `0`, and `j` remains `0`.

Output State: **`i` is `L + 1`, `L` is greater than the previous `L`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `vol` is 0**
