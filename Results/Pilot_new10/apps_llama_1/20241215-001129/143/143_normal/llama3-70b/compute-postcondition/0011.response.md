The code `vol = 2 ** j - 1` updates the value of `vol`. Given that `j` is 1, we can calculate the new value of `vol` as `2 ** 1 - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a list of `L + 1` elements where `dp[0]` is 0 and the rest are initialized with infinity, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `vol` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a list of `L + 1` elements where `dp[0]` is 0 and the rest are initialized with infinity, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `vol` is 1**
