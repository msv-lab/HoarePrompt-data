The given code line `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - vol] + costs[j])` updates the value of `dp[i]`. 

Given that `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `vol` is 1, `dp` is a list of `L + 1` elements where `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[1]` is `costs[1]` if `n` is at least 2, otherwise it is infinity. If `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, then `dp[2]` is the minimum of `costs[1]` and `costs[0] + costs[1]` if `n` is at least 2.

`dp[2]` becomes the minimum of its current value and `dp[2 - vol] + costs[j]`. Since `vol` is 1 and `j` is 1, this simplifies to the minimum of `dp[2]` and `dp[1] + costs[1]`. 

Given that `dp[1]` is `costs[1]` if `n` is at least 2, the new value of `dp[2]` is the minimum of its current value and `costs[1] + costs[1]`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a list of `L + 1` elements where `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[1]` is `costs[1]` if `n` is at least 2, otherwise it is infinity, `dp[2]` is the minimum of its previous value and `2 * costs[1]`, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `vol` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a list of `L + 1` elements where `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[1]` is `costs[1]` if `n` is at least 2, otherwise it is infinity, `dp[2]` is the minimum of its previous value and `2 * costs[1]`, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `vol` is 1**
