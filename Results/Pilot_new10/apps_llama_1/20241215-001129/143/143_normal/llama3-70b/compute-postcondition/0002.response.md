`dp` is assigned a list of `L + 1` elements, each initialized with `float('inf')`. The value of `L` is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), and `n` is between 1 and 30 (inclusive). The states of `n` and `L` and `costs` are not affected, so they remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a list of `L + 1` elements, all initialized with infinity**
