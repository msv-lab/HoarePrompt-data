The variable `vol` is assigned the value of `2 ** j - 1`. Given that `j` is 0, `vol` becomes `2 ** 0 - 1`, which equals `1 - 1`, so `vol` equals `0`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a list of `L + 1` elements where `dp[0]` is 0 and the rest are initialized with infinity, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `vol` is 0.
