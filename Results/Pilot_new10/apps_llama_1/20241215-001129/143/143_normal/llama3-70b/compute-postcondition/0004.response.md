To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The given loop statement is:
```python
for i in range(1, L + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```
The initial state is:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive)
- `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive)
- `costs` is a list of `n` integers
- `dp` is a list of `L + 1` elements where `dp[0]` is 0 and the rest are initialized with infinity

For the loop to execute, we need to consider the following:
- The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `L` (inclusive), so `L` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.
- The variable `i` is introduced in the loop, which takes values from 1 to `L` in each iteration.

Given the initial state and the loop statement, we can conclude that:
- `n`, `costs`, and `dp` do not directly affect the execution of the loop since the loop depends only on `L`.
- `L` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute, which is already guaranteed by the initial state.
- `i` starts at 1 in the first iteration of the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the loop to execute is:
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a list of `L + 1` elements where `dp[0]` is 0 and the rest are initialized with infinity, `i` is 1**
