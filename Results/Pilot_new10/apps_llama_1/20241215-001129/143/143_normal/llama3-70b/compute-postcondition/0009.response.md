Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a list of `L + 1` elements where `dp[0]` is 0 and the rest are initialized with infinity, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `vol` is 0, and if `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, then the state of the program variables remains unchanged, specifically `dp[1]` remains as infinity.***
