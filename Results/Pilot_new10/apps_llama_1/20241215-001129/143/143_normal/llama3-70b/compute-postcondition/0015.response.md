The value of `vol` is updated to `2 ** j - 1`. Given that `j` is 2, we can calculate the new value of `vol` as `2 ** 2 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of `n` integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `vol` is 3**
