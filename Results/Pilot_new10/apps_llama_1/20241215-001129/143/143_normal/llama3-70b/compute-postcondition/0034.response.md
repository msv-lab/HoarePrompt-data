According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `L`. If `i` is less than `L + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` must be the last value it took in the previous iteration. Since the loop starts from 1 and goes up to `L`, the last iteration would have `i` as `L`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is `L + 1`. However, since the loop only executes up to `L`, for it to execute again with `i` as `L + 1`, `L` must be increased by 1 so that `L + 1` is still within the loop's range.

State: **`i` is `L + 1`, `L` must be greater than the previous `L`**
