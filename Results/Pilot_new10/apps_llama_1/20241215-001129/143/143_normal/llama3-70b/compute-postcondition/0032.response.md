Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 3 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of `n` integers, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `vol` is 3, if `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, then `dp` is a list where `dp[2]` is the minimum of its previous value and `dp[1] + costs[2]`. Since there is no else part, the state of the variables when `vol` is greater than `i` remains unchanged.***
