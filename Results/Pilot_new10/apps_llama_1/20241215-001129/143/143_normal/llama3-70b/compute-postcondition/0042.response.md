To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `L + 1`
- `L` is greater than the previous `L`
- `n` is greater than 1
- `j` is 1
- `vol` is 1

And the code snippet:
```python
dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - vol] + costs[j])
```

This code updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the minimum between its current value and the sum of `dp[i - vol]` and `costs[j]`.

Given that `vol` is 1, the code snippet simplifies to:
```python
dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] + costs[j])
```

Since `j` is 1, it further simplifies to:
```python
dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] + costs[1])
```

However, without knowing the exact values of `dp[i]`, `dp[i - 1]`, and `costs[1]`, we cannot determine the exact new value of `dp[i]`. We only know that `dp[i]` will be updated to the minimum between its current value and the sum of `dp[i - 1]` and `costs[1]`.

The states of `i`, `L`, `n`, `j`, and `vol` are not changed by this code snippet, as it only updates the value of `dp[i]`.

Therefore, the output state, considering all provided information, is:
- `i` is `L + 1`
- `L` is greater than the previous `L`
- `n` is greater than 1
- `j` is 1
- `vol` is 1
- `dp[i]` is the minimum of its previous value and `dp[i - 1] + costs[1]`

Output State: **`i` is `L + 1`, `L` is greater than the previous `L`, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `vol` is 1, `dp[i]` is the minimum of its previous value and `dp[i - 1] + costs[1]`**
