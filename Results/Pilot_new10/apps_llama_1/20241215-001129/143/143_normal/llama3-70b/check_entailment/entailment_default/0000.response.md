Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code seems to be incorrect and does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The issue is with the way it calculates the volume of the bottles. The code uses `vol = 2 ** j - 1` to calculate the volume of the bottles, where `j` is the index of the bottle type. However, this calculation is incorrect because the problem statement specifies that the volume of a single bottle of type `i` is `2^i - 1` liters. Therefore, the code should use `vol = 2 ** (j + 1) - 1` to calculate the volume of the bottles, since the index `j` starts at 0.

This mistake can lead to incorrect results, especially for larger bottle types. For example, if the required amount of lemonade is 12 liters and there are four bottle types with volumes 1, 3, 7, and 15 liters, the code will calculate the volume of the fourth bottle type as `2^3 - 1 = 7` liters, instead of the correct volume `2^4 - 1 = 15` liters. This will lead to incorrect results, and the code will not always find the minimum cost to make the specified amount of lemonade. 

A correct implementation would be:

```python
def func():
    (n, L) = map(int, input().split())
    costs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    dp = [float('inf')] * (L + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, L + 1):
        for j in range(n):
            vol = 2 ** (j + 1) - 1
            if vol <= i:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - vol] + costs[j])
    print(dp[L] if dp[L]!= float('inf') else -1)
```
