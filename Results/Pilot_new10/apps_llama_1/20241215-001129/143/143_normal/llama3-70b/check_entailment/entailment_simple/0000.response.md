Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why:

1. The program initializes a list `dp` of size `L + 1` with all elements set to infinity, except for `dp[0]`, which is set to 0. This represents the minimum cost to achieve a volume of 0, which is indeed 0.

2. The program then iterates over each possible volume from 1 to `L`. For each volume `i`, it iterates over each bottle type `j` and calculates the volume of the bottle `vol = 2 ** j - 1`.

3. If the bottle volume `vol` is less than or equal to the current volume `i`, the program updates the minimum cost `dp[i]` to be the minimum of its current value and the cost of the current bottle plus the minimum cost to achieve the remaining volume `i - vol`. This is a standard dynamic programming approach to solve the problem.

4. After filling up the `dp` table, the program prints the minimum cost to achieve the required volume `L`, which is stored in `dp[L]`. If `dp[L]` is still infinity, it means that it's not possible to achieve the required volume, and the program prints -1. However, according to the problem description, the number of bottles of each type is infinite, so it's always possible to achieve the required volume, and `dp[L]` will never be infinity.

The program correctly implements the problem description and will always produce the correct output for any valid input. It considers all possible combinations of bottle types to achieve the required volume and chooses the one with the minimum cost. 

For example, in the first example, the program will calculate the minimum cost to achieve 12 liters by considering all possible combinations of bottle types: 
- 1 8-liter bottle and 2 2-liter bottles (cost: 90 + 2 * 30 = 150)
- 3 4-liter bottles (cost: 3 * 70 = 210)
- Other combinations will have higher costs.

The program will correctly choose the combination with the minimum cost, which is 150. 

Similarly, the program will produce the correct output for all other examples provided. 

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
