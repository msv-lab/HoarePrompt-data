You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A New Year party is not a New Year party without lemonade! As usual, you are expecting a lot of guests, and buying lemonade has already become a pleasant necessity.

Your favorite store sells lemonade in bottles of n different volumes at different costs. A single bottle of type i has volume 2^{i} - 1 liters and costs c_{i} roubles. The number of bottles of each type in the store can be considered infinite.

You want to buy at least L liters of lemonade. How many roubles do you have to spend?


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and L (1 ≤ n ≤ 30; 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9) — the number of types of bottles in the store and the required amount of lemonade in liters, respectively.

The second line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n} (1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the costs of bottles of different types.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the smallest number of roubles you have to pay in order to buy at least L liters of lemonade.


-----Examples-----

20 30 70 90

Output
150

Input

10000 1000 100 10

Output

Input

10 100 1000 10000

Output
30

Input
5 787787787
123456789 234567890 345678901 456789012 987654321

Output
44981600785557577



-----Note-----

In the first example you should buy one 8-liter bottle for 90 roubles and two 2-liter bottles for 30 roubles each. In total you'll get 12 liters of lemonade for just 150 roubles.

In the second example, even though you need only 3 liters, it's cheaper to buy a single 8-liter bottle for 10 roubles.

In the third example it's best to buy three 1-liter bottles for 10 roubles each, getting three liters for 30 roubles.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, L) = map(int, input().split())
    costs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    dp = [float('inf')] * (L + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, L + 1):
        for j in range(n):
            vol = 2 ** j - 1
            if vol <= i:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - vol] + costs[j])
    print(dp[L] if dp[L] != float('inf') else -1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description. It uses dynamic programming to find the minimum cost of buying at least L liters of lemonade.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the code is correct:

1. The input is taken correctly: The program reads the number of types of bottles `n` and the required amount of lemonade `L` from the first line, and the costs of bottles of different types from the second line.

2. The dynamic programming approach is implemented correctly: The program initializes a list `dp` of size `L + 1` with all elements set to infinity, except for `dp[0]` which is set to 0. This represents the minimum cost of buying 0 liters of lemonade, which is 0.

3. The program then iterates over each possible amount of lemonade from 1 to `L`, and for each amount, it iterates over each type of bottle. If the volume of the current bottle is less than or equal to the current amount of lemonade, it updates the minimum cost of buying the current amount of lemonade by taking the minimum of the current minimum cost and the cost of buying the current bottle plus the minimum cost of buying the remaining amount of lemonade.

4. Finally, the program prints the minimum cost of buying at least `L` liters of lemonade, or -1 if it is not possible to buy at least `L` liters of lemonade.

The code handles all the examples provided correctly, and it also handles edge cases such as when `L` is 0 or when the costs of the bottles are all infinity. Therefore, based on the provided problem description and examples, the program appears to be correct. 

However, it is worth noting that the program assumes that the input is valid and that the costs of the bottles are non-negative. If the input can be invalid or if the costs of the bottles can be negative, the program may not work correctly. But based on the problem description, it seems that these cases are not considered. 

In conclusion, the program seems to be correct based on the provided problem description and examples.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no parameters, but the input is provided in two lines: the first line contains two integers n and L (1 ≤ n ≤ 30; 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9), and the second line contains n integers c_1, c_2,..., c_{n} (1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ 10^9), where n is the number of types of bottles in the store and the required amount of lemonade in liters, and c_i is the cost of a bottle of type i with volume 2^{i} - 1 liters.
def func():
    n, L = map(int, input().split())
    costs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    dp = [float('inf')] * (L + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, L + 1):
        for j in range(n):
            vol = 2 ** j - 1
            if vol <= i:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - vol] + costs[j])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a list of `L + 1` elements where `dp[i]` is the minimum cost to achieve `i` using volumes up to `n`, calculated as the minimum of its original value and `dp[i - vol] + costs[j]` for all `j` where `vol = 2
    print(dp[L] if dp[L] != float('inf') else -1)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
