Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. Here's why:

1.  **Initialization**: The program initializes a list `dp` of size `L + 1` with infinite values, where `dp[i]` represents the minimum cost to make `i` liters of lemonade. The base case `dp[0]` is set to 0, which means it costs 0 to make 0 liters of lemonade.
2.  **Dynamic Programming Loop**: The program then iterates over each liter from 1 to `L`. For each liter `i`, it iterates over each bottle type `j`. It calculates the volume `vol` of the current bottle type (2^j - 1) and checks if it's less than or equal to the current liter `i`. If it is, it updates `dp[i]` with the minimum cost between its current value and the cost of using the current bottle type (`dp[i - vol] + costs[j]`).
3.  **Result**: Finally, the program prints the minimum cost to make `L` liters of lemonade, which is stored in `dp[L]`. If it's still infinite, it means it's impossible to make `L` liters of lemonade, and the program prints -1.

The program correctly follows the problem description because it:

*   Considers all possible combinations of bottle types to make the specified amount of lemonade.
*   Uses dynamic programming to efficiently calculate the minimum cost.
*   Handles the case where it's impossible to make the specified amount of lemonade.

The time complexity of the program is O(n \* L), where n is the number of bottle types and L is the required amount of lemonade. The space complexity is O(L), which is used to store the `dp` array.

Overall, the program is correct and efficient in solving the problem according to the given problem description.
