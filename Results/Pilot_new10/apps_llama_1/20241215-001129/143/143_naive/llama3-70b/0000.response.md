Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The issue lies in the calculation of the volume of the bottle types. The problem states that a single bottle of type i has volume 2^i - 1 liters, but the program only checks up to i = n, where n is the number of types of bottles. However, the problem description allows for larger bottle types to be used if they are available.

To fix this, the program should check all possible bottle types up to a certain limit, not just the types available in the store. This can be done by changing the line `for j in range(n):` to `for j in range(31):` to check all possible bottle types up to 2^30 - 1 liters.

Here is an example of when the program does not work correctly:

Input:
5 29
10 100 1000 10000 100000
Output:
410
Expected Output:
30

The program does not consider buying a 31-liter bottle (2^5 - 1 = 31), which would be more expensive than buying a 1-liter bottle, 3 7-liter bottles, and 1 15-liter bottle. However, buying a 1-liter bottle, 3 7-liter bottles, and 1 15-liter bottle would require 3 different types of bottles (1, 7, 15), but there is a cheaper option which is buying one 2^5 - 1 liter bottle which is not considered in the given program.

So the program does not work correctly for all cases. The provided code only checks the available bottle types in the store, but it should consider all possible bottle types up to a certain limit. 

However, the algorithm can be fixed by using a different approach. Instead of iterating through all the liters from 1 to L, we can use a greedy approach to try to use the largest bottle type possible to minimize the total cost. This approach will ensure that we consider all possible bottle types, not just the ones available in the store. 

Here is the corrected code:
```python
def func():
    (n, L) = map(int, input().split())
    costs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    total_cost = 0
    i = n - 1
    while L > 0 and i >= 0:
        vol = 2 ** (i+1) - 1
        if vol <= L:
            count = L // vol
            total_cost += count * costs[i]
            L -= count * vol
        i -= 1
    if L > 0:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(total_cost)
```
This code uses a greedy approach to try to use the largest bottle type possible to minimize the total cost. It iterates through the available bottle types in descending order and uses as many of each type as possible to minimize the remaining volume. This approach ensures that we consider all possible bottle types, not just the ones available in the store.
