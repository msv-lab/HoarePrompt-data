Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to be correct and accurately implements the required logic. Here's why:

1. The program takes an input `x` which represents the camera angle in degrees.
2. It then calculates the equivalent angle within the range of 0 to 360 degrees by taking `x % 360`. This is correct because the rotation is periodic with a period of 360 degrees.
3. If the angle is 0, it prints 0, which is correct because no rotation is needed.
4. For non-zero angles, it calculates the minimum number of 90 degrees clockwise turns required by using the formula `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4`. This formula is correct because it effectively rounds up the angle to the nearest multiple of 90 degrees and then takes the remainder when divided by 4, which gives the minimum number of turns required.

The program correctly handles both positive and negative input angles, as well as angles that are already a multiple of 90 degrees.

It's also worth noting that the formula `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4` is a clever way to calculate the minimum number of turns required. By adding 90-1 to x, we are effectively rounding up the angle to the nearest multiple of 90 degrees, and then taking the remainder when divided by 4 gives us the minimum number of turns required.

After analyzing the program and the problem description, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
