The original assessment correctly points out that the program does not handle negative input angles correctly. The program normalizes the angle to be within the range of 0 to 360, but it does not account for the fact that a negative angle represents counter-clockwise rotation. 

However, upon closer inspection of the code, the line `turns = (360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4` seems to be an attempt to adjust the angle in the opposite direction of rotation (i.e., clockwise rotation of the image vs counter-clockwise rotation of the camera). 

But this attempt is still incorrect for negative angles, as `x % 360` will give a negative result for negative `x`, and the absolute value of this result can be between 0 and 360. In this case, `(360 - normalized_angle)` will give a large value which will result in incorrect results when divided by 90 and then taking the modulus with 4.

However, in the annotated version of the code, the state before the function call, it is mentioned that "positive values denote clockwise camera rotation and negative values denote counter-clockwise rotation", but this information is not used to adjust the calculation for negative angles.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided code, I agree with the original assessment that the program does not correctly handle negative input angles.

The reason for this is that the program does not correctly account for the direction of rotation. The calculation `turns = (360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4` assumes that all angles are positive, but in the case of negative angles, the direction of rotation is reversed.

Final: **False**
