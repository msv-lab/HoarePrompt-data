The original assessment points out that the program does not handle negative input angles correctly. However, upon closer inspection, the issue is not with the normalization of the angle, but rather with the calculation of the number of turns required.

The correct implementation, as provided in the original assessment, takes into account the absolute value of the normalized angle and calculates the number of turns based on that. However, the provided output hints suggest that the function does not handle negative input angles correctly.

After reviewing the problem description and the code, I realized that the original assessment is actually accurate. The provided code does not correctly calculate the minimum number of 90-degree turns required to minimize the deviation from the vertical.

The issue lies in the calculation of the number of turns: `turns = (360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4`. This calculation does not take into account the direction of the rotation, which is crucial in determining the minimum number of turns.

The original assessment provides two correct implementations that take into account the direction of the rotation and correctly calculate the minimum number of turns required.

The output hints also suggest that the function does not handle negative input angles correctly, which aligns with the original assessment.

Therefore, I believe that the original assessment is accurate, and the program is indeed incorrect.

Final: **False**
