Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle negative input angles correctly. When the input angle is negative, it is normalized to a value between -360 and 0. However, in the calculation of the number of turns, the code does not account for the fact that the image is initially rotated counter-clockwise when the camera is rotated counter-clockwise.

For example, if the input is -60, the normalized angle is -60, and the code calculates the number of turns as (360 - (-60)) // 90 % 4 = 3, which is correct. However, if the input is -300, the normalized angle is -300, and the code calculates the number of turns as (360 - (-300)) // 90 % 4 = 1, which is incorrect. The correct answer for -300 is 3, because the image is rotated 300 degrees clockwise, and 3 turns of 90 degrees each are needed to rotate it to the correct position.

The code also does not perform any error checking, and does not account for input values outside the range of -10^18 to 10^18.

To fix this, the code needs to handle negative input angles correctly, perform error checking, and account for input values outside the range of -10^18 to 10^18.

Here is a revised version of the code that handles these cases correctly:
```python
def func():
    x = int(input())
    if x < -10**18 or x > 10**18:
        print("Error: Input value is outside the range of -10^18 to 10^18")
        return
    normalized_angle = x % 360
    if normalized_angle < 0:
        normalized_angle = 360 + normalized_angle
    turns = round(normalized_angle / 90) % 4
    if normalized_angle < 180 and normalized_angle > 90:
        turns = 3
    elif normalized_angle < 90 and normalized_angle > 0:
        turns = 1
    elif normalized_angle < 360 and normalized_angle > 270:
        turns = 3
    elif normalized_angle < 270 and normalized_angle > 180:
        turns = 1
    print(turns)
```
However, this code still needs to be optimized and corrected further to handle all possible cases correctly.

A more optimized and correct version of the code can be:
```python
def func():
    x = int(input())
    if x < -10**18 or x > 10**18:
        print("Error: Input value is outside the range of -10^18 to 10^18")
        return
    y = -x
    y = y % 360
    if y < 0:
        y += 360
    if y <= 45 or y > 315:
        turns = 0
    elif y <= 135:
        turns = 1
    elif y <= 225:
        turns = 2
    else:
        turns = 3
    print(turns)
```
