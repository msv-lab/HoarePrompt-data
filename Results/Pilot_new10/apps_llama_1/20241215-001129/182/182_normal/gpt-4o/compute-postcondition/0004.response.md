The function `func` accepts no parameters. However, based on the given constraints, it seems there should be a parameter representing the camera angle in degrees, which is an integer between -10^18 and 10^18 (inclusive). Assuming the parameter exists and is named `camera_angle`, the functionality can be described as follows:

The function `func` accepts a parameter `camera_angle`. `camera_angle` is an integer between -10^18 and 10^18 (inclusive), where positive values denote clockwise camera rotation and negative values denote counter-clockwise rotation. 

However, since the output is not specified, the return value cannot be determined. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is incomplete.


Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter representing the camera angle in degrees and returns an unspecified value based on the input angle.**
