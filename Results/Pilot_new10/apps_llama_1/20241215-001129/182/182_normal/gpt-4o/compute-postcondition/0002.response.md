To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code step by step.

The initial state is: 
- `x` is an integer between -10^18 and 10^18.
- `normalized_angle` is the remainder of `x` divided by 360, which means it is an integer between -359 and 359.

The code is:
```python
turns = (360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4
```

Here's the breakdown of what the code does:

1. `360 - normalized_angle`: This expression subtracts the `normalized_angle` from 360. Since `normalized_angle` is between -359 and 359, the result of this subtraction will be between 1 and 719.

2. `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90`: This performs integer division of the result from step 1 by 90. The possible results of the subtraction in step 1 that are relevant for the division by 90 (considering the range of `normalized_angle`) are as follows:
   - When `normalized_angle` is between -359 and -1, `360 - normalized_angle` will be between 361 and 719, and the integer division by 90 will yield a value between 4 and 7 (since 361 // 90 = 4 and 719 // 90 = 7 with remainder 59).
   - When `normalized_angle` is between 0 and 359, `360 - normalized_angle` will be between 360 and 1, and the integer division by 90 will yield a value between 4 and 0 (since 360 // 90 = 4 and 1 // 90 = 0).

3. `% 4`: This takes the result of the division in step 2 and computes its remainder when divided by 4. The possible results from step 2 are between 0 and 7, so the remainder when divided by 4 can be 0, 1, 2, or 3.

Given these operations, the variable `turns` is assigned a value based on the `normalized_angle`. The specific value of `turns` depends on the value of `normalized_angle`, but it will always be between 0 and 3, inclusive.

The states of `x` and `normalized_angle` are not changed by the code, so they remain as initially described. The code only introduces a new variable `turns` which is a function of `normalized_angle`.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
- `x` is an integer between -10^18 and 10^18.
- `normalized_angle` is the remainder of `x` divided by 360, an integer between -359 and 359.
- `turns` is `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4`, an integer between 0 and 3, depending on `normalized_angle`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer between -10^18 and 10^18, `normalized_angle` is the remainder of `x` divided by 360, an integer between -359 and 359, `turns` is `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4`, an integer between 0 and 3**
