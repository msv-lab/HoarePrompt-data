Correctness: **True**

The code provided seems to correctly implement the problem description. It first normalizes the input angle to an equivalent angle between 0 and 359 degrees using the modulo operator. Then, it outputs 0 if the normalized angle is 0, indicating no rotation or a full rotation.

For non-zero normalized angles, it uses the expression `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4` to determine the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns required to get the image to be minimally deviated from vertical. This expression seems to correctly calculate the required number of turns based on the normalized angle.

The output hints and examples provided also agree with the code's behavior. For example, when the input is 60, the code outputs 1, which is correct because one 90-degree clockwise turn will result in a 30-degree counter-clockwise deviation, which is the smallest possible deviation. Similarly, when the input is -60, the code outputs 3, which is also correct because three 90-degree clockwise turns will result in a 30-degree counter-clockwise deviation, which is the smallest possible deviation.

The code also handles the edge cases correctly. For example, when the input is a multiple of 360, the code outputs 0, which is correct because no rotation is required in this case. When the input is a negative multiple of 360, the code also outputs 0, which is correct because the negative sign is taken care of by the modulo operator.

Overall, the code seems to correctly implement the problem description and handles all the potential cases correctly.
