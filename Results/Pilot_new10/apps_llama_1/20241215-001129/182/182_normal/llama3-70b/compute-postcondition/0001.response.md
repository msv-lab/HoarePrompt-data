To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state. The initial state specifies that `x` is an integer between -10^18 and 10^18 (inclusive), where a positive value denotes clockwise camera rotation and a negative value denotes counter-clockwise rotation. The code `x = x % 360` calculates the remainder of `x` divided by 360 and assigns this value back to `x`.

This operation effectively brings the value of `x` within the range of -359 to 359 because any integer divided by 360 will have a remainder within this range (considering the negative values as well, where -360 < remainder â‰¤ 0). 

However, to match the standard representation of angles (where a full rotation is 360 degrees), negative remainders should be adjusted to their equivalent positive values within the range of 0 to 359. But since the problem involves camera rotation and the sign of `x` (positive or negative) denotes the direction of rotation, we'll consider the impact of the modulo operation on the range and sign of `x`.

Given that `x` is an integer between -10^18 and 10^18 and considering the modulo operation `x = x % 360`, the value of `x` after this operation will still denote the direction of rotation (positive for clockwise, negative for counter-clockwise) but will be limited to the range of -359 to 359. It effectively normalizes the rotation to be within one full rotation (360 degrees) while preserving the direction of rotation.

The output state, considering the modulo operation's effect on `x`, will thus be an integer between -359 and 359, inclusive, preserving the sign's meaning (positive for clockwise rotation, negative for counter-clockwise rotation).

Output State: **`x` is an integer between -359 and 359 (inclusive), where a positive value denotes clockwise camera rotation and a negative value denotes counter-clockwise rotation.**
