To understand the functionality of the given function, let's analyze it step by step.

1. **Input**: The function reads an integer `x` from the input, which represents a camera angle in degrees. The range of `x` is specified as -10^18 ≤ x ≤ 10^18, with positive values denoting clockwise rotation and negative values denoting counter-clockwise rotation.

2. **Normalization**: The input angle `x` is then normalized by taking the modulus of `x` with 360. This operation ensures that the angle is reduced to an equivalent angle within the range of -359 to 359 degrees, considering that a full rotation (360 degrees) brings the camera back to its original position.

3. **Output Determination**:
   - If the normalized angle `x` is 0, the function prints 0. This suggests that when there is no rotation (or a full rotation that brings the camera back to its original position), the output is 0.
   - For any other normalized angle `x`, the function calculates and prints the value of `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4`. This expression seems to categorize the rotation into four distinct categories based on the angle.

Given the information and focusing on what the code actually does, let's consider potential edge cases and the logic provided:

- **Angle Normalization**: The code correctly normalizes the input angle to be within -359 to 359 degrees.
- **Output for Zero Rotation**: The function correctly handles the case where there is no rotation (or a complete rotation), printing 0.
- **Output for Other Rotations**: For non-zero angles, the calculation `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4` is applied. This appears to be a categorization based on the angle, potentially related to the quadrants of a circle (given the division by 90 and the modulo 4 operation). However, the exact meaning or purpose of this categorization isn't explicitly stated in the annotations but is implied by the code's behavior.

Considering all potential cases and focusing on the code's actual behavior:

- The function doesn't technically "return" a value in the traditional sense (as it uses `print` statements), but it outputs a value based on the camera angle.
- The output is determined by the normalized angle, with specific handling for a zero angle and a categorization scheme for non-zero angles.
- Edge cases, such as the maximum and minimum possible input values, are implicitly handled by the normalization step, ensuring the function operates within a defined range.

Therefore, based on the code's actual behavior and including all potential edge cases and logic:

Functionality: ** The function reads a camera angle in degrees from the input, normalizes it to an equivalent angle between -359 and 359 degrees, and then outputs 0 if the normalized angle is 0 (indicating no rotation or a full rotation), or otherwise categorizes the rotation into one of four categories based on the expression `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4` and prints the corresponding category number. **
