The code reads an integer `x` from the input. The value of `x` is the camera angle in degrees, where -10^18 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18. A positive value denotes clockwise camera rotation, while a negative value denotes counter-clockwise rotation.

The code `x = int(input())` assigns the input integer value to `x`. The previous value of `x` is overwritten by this assignment.

The states of other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`x` is an integer between -10^18 and 10^18 (inclusive), where a positive value denotes clockwise camera rotation and a negative value denotes counter-clockwise rotation, `x` is an input integer.**
