Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly solve the problem in all cases. It fails to account for the optimal solution when the cursor is already at one of the boundaries of the segment [l, r] and needs to close the other side.

A counterexample can be found in the following input: 
```
6 2 2 4
```
In this case, the optimal solution involves shifting the cursor to the right to the tab 4 and then closing all the tabs to the right of it. However, the code will calculate the minimum number of operations as the minimum of moving to the left (l) or right (r) and then closing both sides, which results in an incorrect calculation.

The code also does not correctly handle cases where moving the cursor directly to the left or right boundary of the segment [l, r] and then closing the other side results in a smaller number of operations.

A correct implementation of this problem should consider the minimum number of operations to move the cursor to the left or right boundary of the segment [l, r] and then close the other side, as well as the minimum number of operations to move the cursor to one of the boundaries and then close the other side, and choose the optimal solution among these cases. 

To correctly solve this problem, the following approach can be taken:

- Calculate the minimum number of operations to move the cursor to the left boundary of the segment [l, r] and then close the other side.
- Calculate the minimum number of operations to move the cursor to the right boundary of the segment [l, r] and then close the other side.
- Compare these two options and choose the one that requires the minimum number of operations.

Here is the Python code that corresponds to the described approach:

```python
def func():
    (n, pos, l, r) = map(int, input().split())
    if l == 1 and r == n:
        print(0)
    elif pos < l:
        print(abs(l - pos) + (n - r))
    elif pos > r:
        print(abs(r - pos) + (l - 1))
    else:
        left_ops = l - 1 + (n - r)
        right_ops = (n - r) + (l - 1)
        if pos - l < r - pos:
            print(pos - l + (n - r))
        else:
            print(r - pos + (l - 1))

func()
