Postcondition: **`n` equals the first input integer, `l` equals the third input integer, `r` equals the fourth input integer. If `pos` is less than `l`, then `ans` equals `l - pos`. If `pos` is not less than `l` and not greater than `r`, then the state of `ans` and `pos` remains unchanged. If `pos` is greater than `r`, then `ans` has been increased by `pos - r`; if `pos` was initially less than `l`, then the new `ans` equals `l - r`; if `pos` was not less than `l`, then `ans` equals its previous value (if any) plus `pos - r`.**
