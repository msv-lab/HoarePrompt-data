The function `func` seems to be missing parameters. However, based on the parameter constraints provided, I will assume the function should be defined as `def func(n, pos, l, r):`. 

The function `func` accepts parameters `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r`. `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are integers where `n` is between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `pos` is between 1 and `n` (inclusive), and `l` and `r` are between 1 and `n` (inclusive) with the additional constraint that `l` is less than or equal to `r`. 

However, since the specific output conditions are not provided, I will describe the functionality based on the given input constraints. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, pos, l, and r, which are integers within specific ranges, and returns a value based on the relationship between these parameters, but the exact return values are not specified.**
