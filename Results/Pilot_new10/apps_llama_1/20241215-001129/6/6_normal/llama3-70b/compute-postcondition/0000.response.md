The code `n, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())` assigns the values from the input to the variables `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r`. The `map(int, input().split())` function splits the input into four parts, converts each part to an integer, and returns them as a map object, which is then unpacked into the four variables.

Given that `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are integers such that `1 <= n <= 100`, `1 <= pos <= n`, `1 <= l <= r <= n`, the code updates these variables with new values from the input.

Output State: **`n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are integers such that `n` equals the first input integer, `pos` equals the second input integer, `l` equals the third input integer, and `r` equals the fourth input integer,  where these integers are the result of splitting the input and converting the parts to integers.**
