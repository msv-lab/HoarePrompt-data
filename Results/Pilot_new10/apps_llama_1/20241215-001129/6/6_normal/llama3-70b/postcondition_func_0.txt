The function accepts four integer parameters `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` as input from the user, calculates a value `ans` based on their relationship, and prints the calculated value, where `ans` is incremented by the distance from `pos` to `l` if `pos` is less than `l`, by the distance from `pos` to `r` if `pos` is greater than `r`, and by the minimum of `pos - 1` and `n - r` plus the maximum of `0` and `l - 1`.
