Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly follow the problem description for every potential case. 

The problem description asks for the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened. However, the provided program has several issues:

1. The case when `l` is not equal to 1 and `r` is not equal to `n` is handled incorrectly. The program prints `min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2))`, but this does not consider the optimal way to close the tabs. The correct approach would be to consider moving to either `l` or `r` and then closing the tabs on the other side.

2. The case when `l` equals 1 or `r` equals `n` is also handled incorrectly in some scenarios. The program simply prints `abs(pos - r) + 1` or `abs(pos - l) + 1`, but this does not take into account the possibility of closing the tabs in a more efficient way.

To correctly solve this problem, a more thorough analysis of the possible cases is needed, and the program should consider the optimal way to move the cursor and close the tabs in each case.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())
    if l == 1 and r == n:
        print(0)
    else:
        if pos < l:
            print(l - pos + (n - r))
        elif pos > r:
            print(pos - r + (l - 1))
        else:
            print(min(pos - l + (n - r), r - pos + (l - 1)))

# Test cases
func()
```

This program first checks if all tabs are within the required range. If not, it calculates the minimum number of seconds needed to move the cursor to the nearest end of the required range and then close the tabs on the other side. If the cursor is already within the required range, it calculates the minimum number of seconds needed to close the tabs on either side.
