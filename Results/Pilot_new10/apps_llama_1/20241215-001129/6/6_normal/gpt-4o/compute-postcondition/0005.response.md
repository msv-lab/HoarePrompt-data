The given code calculates and prints the absolute difference between `pos` and `r`, then adds 1 to this difference. 

`n` is an input integer 1, `pos` is an input integer 2, `l` is an input integer 3, and `r` is an input integer 4. The current value of `l` is given as 1, and it is not the case that `r` equals `n`.

Given the initial state, the values of `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are maintained as they are. The print statement does not change any variable values but returns the calculated value: 

`abs(pos - r) + 1`. 

This returned value is calculated based on the provided input integers. 

Since the values of `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are based on input integers and `l` equals 1, and `r` does not equal `n`, we maintain these conditions.

The Output State is: `n` is an input integer 1, `pos` is an input integer 2, `l` equals 1, `r` is an input integer 4 and does not equal `n`, and the value `abs(pos - r) + 1` has been returned.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer 1, `pos` is an input integer 2, `l` equals 1, `r` is an input integer 4 and does not equal `n`, and the value `abs(pos - r) + 1` has been returned**
