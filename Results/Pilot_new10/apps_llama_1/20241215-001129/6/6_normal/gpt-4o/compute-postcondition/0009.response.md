Postcondition: **`n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are integers such that `n` = input integer 1, `pos` = input integer 2, `l` = input integer 3, `r` = input integer 4, where the input integers are the four integers from the input, and it is not the case that `l` equals 1 and `r` equals `n`. Additionally, `l` is not equal to 1, and `r` is not equal to `n`.**
