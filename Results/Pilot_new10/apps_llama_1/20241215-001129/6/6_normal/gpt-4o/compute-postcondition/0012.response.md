The code calculates the minimum value between `move_to_l + (r - l + 2)` and `move_to_r + (r - l + 2)` and assigns it to the variable `close_both_sides`.

Given the initial state: 
- `n` is 1
- `pos` is 2
- `l` is 3
- `r` is 4
- `move_to_l` is 1
- `move_to_r` is 2

We can calculate `close_both_sides` as follows:
- `r - l + 2` equals `4 - 3 + 2` equals `3`.
- `move_to_l + (r - l + 2)` equals `1 + 3` equals `4`.
- `move_to_r + (r - l + 2)` equals `2 + 3` equals `5`.

The minimum value between `4` and `5` is `4`, so `close_both_sides` equals `4`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is 1, `pos` is 2, `l` is 3, `r` is 4, `move_to_l` is 1, `move_to_r` is 2, `close_both_sides` is 4, `l` is not equal to 1, `r` is not equal to `n`, and it is not the case that `l` equals 1 and `r` equals `n`.**
