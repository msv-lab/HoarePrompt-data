You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Kolya is developing an economy simulator game. His most favourite part of the development process is in-game testing. Once he was entertained by the testing so much, that he found out his game-coin score become equal to 0.

Kolya remembers that at the beginning of the game his game-coin score was equal to n and that he have bought only some houses (for 1 234 567 game-coins each), cars (for 123 456 game-coins each) and computers (for 1 234 game-coins each).

Kolya is now interested, whether he could have spent all of his initial n game-coins buying only houses, cars and computers or there is a bug in the game. Formally, is there a triple of non-negative integers a, b and c such that a × 1 234 567 + b × 123 456 + c × 1 234 = n?

Please help Kolya answer this question.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — Kolya's initial game-coin score.


-----Output-----

Print "YES" (without quotes) if it's possible that Kolya spent all of his initial n coins buying only houses, cars and computers. Otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
1359257

Output
YES
Input
17851817

Output
NO


-----Note-----

In the first sample, one of the possible solutions is to buy one house, one car and one computer, spending 1 234 567 + 123 456 + 1234 = 1 359 257 game-coins in total.
Program:
```
n = int(input().strip())
result = func_1(n)
print(result)

def func_1(n):
    house_cost = 1234567
    car_cost = 123456
    computer_cost = 1234
    for a in range(n // house_cost + 1):
        remaining_after_houses = n - a * house_cost
        for b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1):
            remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost
            if remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0:
                return 'YES'
    return 'NO'


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The program provided is designed to determine if it's possible for Kolya to spend all his initial game-coins by buying houses, cars, and computers. The function `func_1(n)` iterates through all possible combinations of buying houses and cars, and checks if the remaining coins can be spent on computers. If it finds a combination where the remaining coins can be exactly spent on computers, it returns 'YES', indicating that it's possible to spend all coins. If it checks all combinations and doesn't find a valid one, it returns 'NO'.

The program correctly handles all potential cases by:

1. **Iterating through all possible house purchases**: It checks for all numbers of houses that can be bought with the initial coins, ensuring it doesn't miss any potential combinations.
2. **Iterating through all possible car purchases after buying houses**: For each number of houses bought, it checks all possible numbers of cars that can be bought with the remaining coins, again ensuring that all potential combinations are considered.
3. **Checking if the remaining coins can be spent on computers**: If the remaining coins after buying houses and cars can be exactly divided by the cost of a computer, it means there's a valid combination where all coins can be spent, and it returns 'YES'.

Given the constraints and the problem description, the provided program seems to exhaustively search through all possible combinations of purchases that could lead to spending all of Kolya's initial coins. It correctly returns 'YES' if such combinations exist and 'NO' otherwise, aligning with the problem's requirements. Therefore, without being able to find a case where the program fails to work as expected according to the problem description, the program is considered correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
n = int(input().strip())
result = func_1(n)
print(result)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, representing the initial game-coin score, such that there are non-negative integers a, b, and c satisfying the equation a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234 = n.
def func_1(n):
    house_cost = 1234567
    car_cost = 123456
    computer_cost = 1234
    for a in range(n // house_cost + 1):
        remaining_after_houses = n - a * house_cost
        
        for b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1):
            remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost
            if remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0:
                return 'YES'
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `house_cost` is `1234567`, `car_cost` is `123456`, `computer_cost` is `1234`, and either a valid combination of `a`, `b`, and `c` exists such that `a * house_cost + b * car_cost + c * computer_cost = n` (in which case the function returns `'YES'`), or no such combination exists (in which case the function does not return `'YES'`).
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO'


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
