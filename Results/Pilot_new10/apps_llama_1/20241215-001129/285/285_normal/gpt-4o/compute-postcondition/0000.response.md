The code introduces a new variable `house_cost` and assigns it the value `1234567`. This does not affect the value of `n`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, representing the initial game-coin score, such that there are non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c` satisfying the equation `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234 = n`, and `house_cost` is `1234567`.**
