The code `car_cost = 123456` introduces a new variable `car_cost` and assigns it the value `123456`. The initial state's condition regarding `n` being an integer greater than or equal to 1, and the existence of non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c` satisfying the equation `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234 = n`, remains unchanged as this code snippet does not modify `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or the relationship between them. Similarly, `house_cost` is `1234567`, which is also unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, such that there are non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c` satisfying the equation `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234 = n`, `house_cost` is `1234567`, and `car_cost` is `123456`.**
