To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

The loop statement is `for b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1):`. This implies that the loop will execute based on the value of `remaining_after_houses` and `car_cost`. 

Given that `car_cost` is `123456`, for the loop to execute, `remaining_after_houses // car_cost` must be a non-negative integer, meaning `remaining_after_houses` must be at least 0 and a multiple of `car_cost` for it to execute at least once.

Additionally, since `b` is the loop variable, at the start of the loop, `b` needs to be defined within the context of the loop's range, starting from 0.

The initial state mentions that `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and there are equations involving `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `house_cost`, `car_cost`, and `computer_cost`. However, these are related to the problem's setup and do not directly influence the loop's execution condition, which depends on `remaining_after_houses` and `car_cost`.

Given the equation `remaining_after_houses = b * 123456 + c * 1234`, for the loop to start executing, we should consider the initial value of `b` in the context of the loop (which starts from 0) and the fact that `remaining_after_houses` must allow for at least one iteration. This implies that `remaining_after_houses` should be sufficiently large to accommodate at least one value of `b` in the loop's range.

At the start of the loop, `b` is 0, so `remaining_after_houses` must be at least 0 for the loop to potentially execute. The state adjustments focus on ensuring that the loop can begin its first iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `house_cost` is `1234567`, `car_cost` is `123456`, `computer_cost` is `1234`, `a` is 0, `remaining_after_houses` must be at least 0, `b` is 0**
