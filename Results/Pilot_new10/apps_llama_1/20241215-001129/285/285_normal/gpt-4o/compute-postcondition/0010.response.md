To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the given for loop statement and the current state.

The for loop statement is `for b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1):`. This means the loop will iterate over a range of values from 0 to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost` (inclusive).

At the end of the previous iteration, `b` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `b` needs to be incremented by 1. 

The condition for the loop to execute again depends on the value of `remaining_after_houses` and `car_cost`. The loop will execute as long as `b` is less than `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`. 

So, at the start of the next iteration, `b` should be 1.

The other states (`n`, `house_cost`, `car_cost`, `computer_cost`, `a`, `remaining_after_houses`, `remaining_after_cars`) do not directly depend on the loop variable `b`. However, since `remaining_after_cars` equals `remaining_after_houses` and `b` is incremented, we need to consider how `remaining_after_cars` and `remaining_after_houses` might change in relation to the loop body (which is omitted). 

Given that the loop body is omitted and we're only considering the increment of `b`, we can only conclude the change in `b` directly. 

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `house_cost` is `1234567`, `car_cost` is `123456`, `computer_cost` is `1234`, `a` is 0, `b` is 1, `remaining_after_houses` is at least 0, `remaining_after_cars` equals `remaining_after_houses` and is at least 0, and `remaining_after_cars` modulo `computer_cost` is not equal to 0**
