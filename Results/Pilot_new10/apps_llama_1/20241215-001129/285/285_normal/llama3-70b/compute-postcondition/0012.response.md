Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `a` is 0, `b` is 1, `c` is `(n - 123456) // 1234`. If `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234` equals `n`, then 'YES' has been printed and the program has been terminated. Otherwise, no specific changes have been made to the variables and the program continues execution.***
