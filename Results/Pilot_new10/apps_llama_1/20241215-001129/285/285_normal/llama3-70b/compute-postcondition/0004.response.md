Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is initially 0, `b` is initially 0, `c` is the integer division of `n` by 1234. The current value of `a` is 0, the current value of `b` is 0, and the current value of `c` equals `n // 1234`. The expression `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234` equals `n`.**
