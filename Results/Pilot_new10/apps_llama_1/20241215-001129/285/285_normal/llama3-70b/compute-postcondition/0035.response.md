Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to `1234567 + 2 * 123456`, `a` is 1, `b` is 2, `c` is `(n - 1478479) // 1234`. If `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234` equals `n`, then 'YES' has been printed and the program has been terminated. Otherwise, the program continues execution without any changes to the variables.***
