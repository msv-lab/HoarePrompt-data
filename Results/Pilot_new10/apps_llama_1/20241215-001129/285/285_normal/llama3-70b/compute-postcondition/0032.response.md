To calculate the new value of `c`, we need to substitute the given values of `a`, `b`, and `n` into the equation.

Given:
- `n` is greater than or equal to `1234567 + 2 * 123456`
- `a` is 1
- `b` is 2

The equation to calculate `c` is:
```python
c = (n - a * 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234
```

Substituting the values of `a` and `b`:
```python
c = (n - 1 * 1234567 - 2 * 123456) // 1234
```

Simplifying:
```python
c = (n - 1234567 - 246912) // 1234
```

Further simplifying:
```python
c = (n - 1478479) // 1234
```

Now, let's compare this with the initial state of `c`, which is `(n - 1357123) // 1234`. The difference lies in the constants being subtracted from `n`. Initially, it was `1357123`, and now it's `1478479`.

The initial condition for `n` is `n` is greater than or equal to `1234567 + 2 * 123456`. Let's calculate this value:
```python
n >= 1234567 + 2 * 123456
n >= 1234567 + 246912
n >= 1478479
```

So, `n` is indeed greater than or equal to `1478479`, which means the new calculation for `c` is valid given the constraints on `n`.

The other variables `a` and `b` do not change, so their values remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `1234567 + 2 * 123456`, `a` is 1, `b` is 2, `c` is `(n - 1478479) // 1234`**
