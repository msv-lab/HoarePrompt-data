The `exit()` function terminates the execution of the program. However, the values of the variables before termination are still valid and can be referenced. 


Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1234567, `a` is 1, `b` is 0, `c` is the integer part of the result of subtracting 1234567 from `n` then dividing by 1234, `n` equals `a` * 1234567 + `b` * 123456 + `c` * 1234, 'YES' has been printed, and the program has been terminated**
