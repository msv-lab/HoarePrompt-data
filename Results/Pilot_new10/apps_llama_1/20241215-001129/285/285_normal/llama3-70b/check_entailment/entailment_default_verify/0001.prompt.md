You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Kolya is developing an economy simulator game. His most favourite part of the development process is in-game testing. Once he was entertained by the testing so much, that he found out his game-coin score become equal to 0.

Kolya remembers that at the beginning of the game his game-coin score was equal to n and that he have bought only some houses (for 1 234 567 game-coins each), cars (for 123 456 game-coins each) and computers (for 1 234 game-coins each).

Kolya is now interested, whether he could have spent all of his initial n game-coins buying only houses, cars and computers or there is a bug in the game. Formally, is there a triple of non-negative integers a, b and c such that a × 1 234 567 + b × 123 456 + c × 1 234 = n?

Please help Kolya answer this question.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — Kolya's initial game-coin score.


-----Output-----

Print "YES" (without quotes) if it's possible that Kolya spent all of his initial n coins buying only houses, cars and computers. Otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
1359257

Output
YES
Input
17851817

Output
NO


-----Note-----

In the first sample, one of the possible solutions is to buy one house, one car and one computer, spending 1 234 567 + 123 456 + 1234 = 1 359 257 game-coins in total.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for a in range(n // 1234567 + 1):
        for b in range((n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1):
            c = (n - a * 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234
            if a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234 == n:
                print('YES')
                exit()
    print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly checks whether it's possible to spend all of the initial game-coins buying only houses, cars, and computers. 

Here's a breakdown of why the code works:

- The outer loop iterates over the possible number of houses (`a`) that can be bought, ranging from 0 to the maximum number of houses that can be afforded with the initial game-coins (`n // 1234567 + 1`).
- The inner loop iterates over the possible number of cars (`b`) that can be bought, considering the remaining game-coins after buying `a` houses (`(n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1`).
- For each combination of houses and cars, the code calculates the maximum number of computers (`c`) that can be bought with the remaining game-coins (`(n - a * 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234`).
- The code checks whether the total cost of buying `a` houses, `b` cars, and `c` computers equals the initial game-coins (`n`). If a match is found, it prints "YES" and exits.
- If no match is found after checking all possible combinations, the code prints "NO".

This solution correctly handles all possible cases because it systematically explores the feasible combinations of houses, cars, and computers that can be bought with the initial game-coins. The use of integer division (`//`) ensures that the calculations are done correctly and no potential solutions are missed.

The program's approach ensures that it will find a solution if one exists, and it will correctly report "NO" if no solution is found. The provided example inputs and outputs are correctly handled by the program, and it should work correctly for all valid inputs within the specified range (`1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`). 

Therefore, the code is correct, and the program functions as expected according to the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function takes an integer input from the user, attempts to express it as a sum of multiples of 1234567, 123456, and 1234, and prints 'YES' if successful or 'NO' otherwise, without validating the input. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
