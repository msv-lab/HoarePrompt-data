Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly checks whether it's possible to spend all of the initial game-coins buying only houses, cars, and computers. 

Here's a breakdown of why the code works:

- The outer loop iterates over the possible number of houses (`a`) that can be bought, ranging from 0 to the maximum number of houses that can be afforded with the initial game-coins (`n // 1234567 + 1`).
- The inner loop iterates over the possible number of cars (`b`) that can be bought, considering the remaining game-coins after buying `a` houses (`(n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1`).
- For each combination of houses and cars, the code calculates the maximum number of computers (`c`) that can be bought with the remaining game-coins (`(n - a * 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234`).
- The code checks whether the total cost of buying `a` houses, `b` cars, and `c` computers equals the initial game-coins (`n`). If a match is found, it prints "YES" and exits.
- If no match is found after checking all possible combinations, the code prints "NO".

This solution correctly handles all possible cases because it systematically explores the feasible combinations of houses, cars, and computers that can be bought with the initial game-coins. The use of integer division (`//`) ensures that the calculations are done correctly and no potential solutions are missed.

The program's approach ensures that it will find a solution if one exists, and it will correctly report "NO" if no solution is found. The provided example inputs and outputs are correctly handled by the program, and it should work correctly for all valid inputs within the specified range (`1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`). 

Therefore, the code is correct, and the program functions as expected according to the problem description.
