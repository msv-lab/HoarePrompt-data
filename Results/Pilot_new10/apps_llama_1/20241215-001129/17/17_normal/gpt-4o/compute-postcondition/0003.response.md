The code updates the value of `cnt_4` by assigning it an input integer value. The previous value of `cnt_4` is discarded, and it is replaced with the new input value. The states of the other variables, `cnt1`, `cnt2`, and `cnt_3`, are not affected.

Output State: **`cnt1` is an input integer, `cnt2` is an input integer, `cnt_3` is an input integer, `cnt_4` is an input integer**
