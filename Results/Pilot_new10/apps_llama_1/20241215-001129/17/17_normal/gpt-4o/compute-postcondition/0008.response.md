Postcondition: ***`cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt_3`, `cnt_4` are input integers. If the sum of `cnt1` and `cnt2` equals the sum of `cnt_3` and `cnt_4`, and `cnt2` is greater than or equal to `cnt_3`, then the value 1 has been printed. Otherwise, the value 0 has been printed and returned as output, indicating that either the sums are not equal or `cnt2` is less than `cnt_3`.***
