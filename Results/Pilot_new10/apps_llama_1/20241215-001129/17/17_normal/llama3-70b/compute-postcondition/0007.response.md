The function func accepts four non-negative integer parameters cnt_1, cnt_2, cnt_3, and cnt_4 as input from the user, where cnt_1 represents the number of strings "((", cnt_2 represents the number of strings "()", cnt_3 represents the number of strings ")(", and cnt_4 represents the number of strings "))". It then checks if the count of "((" (cnt_1) is greater than or equal to the count of ")((" (cnt_3). If cnt_3 is greater than cnt_1, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints 1. The functionality of the function is to determine whether the given counts of "((", "()", ")((", and "))" can potentially form a balanced sequence based on the condition that the number of opening brackets is sufficient to match the number of closing brackets, considering only the counts of "((" and ")((" for this check.

Functionality: ** The function accepts four non-negative integers representing counts of "((", "()", ")((", and "))", and returns 1 if the count of "((" is greater than or equal to the count of ")((", indicating potential balance, and 0 otherwise **
