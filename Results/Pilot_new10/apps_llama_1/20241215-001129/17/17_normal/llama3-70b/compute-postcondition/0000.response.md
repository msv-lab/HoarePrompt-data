The code assigns the values of four input integers to the variables `cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt3`, and `cnt4`. Each of these variables now holds a non-negative integer value, as specified by the input.

Output State: **`cnt1` is a non-negative integer input, `cnt2` is a non-negative integer input, `cnt3` is a non-negative integer input, `cnt4` is a non-negative integer input**
