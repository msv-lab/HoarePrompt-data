Correctness: **False**.

The code seems to only compare the counts of "((" and ")((", but it does not consider the counts of "()" and "))". According to the problem description, a regular bracket sequence can be formed if it is possible to obtain a correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters "+" and "1" into the sequence. This means that the total count of "(" should be equal to the total count of ")".

In the given code, it only checks if `cnt3` (count of ")((") is greater than `cnt1` (count of "(("), which is not sufficient to determine if a regular bracket sequence can be formed. 

A counterexample can be `cnt1 = 1`, `cnt2 = 0`, `cnt3 = 0`, `cnt4 = 2`. In this case, the code will print `1`, but a regular bracket sequence cannot be formed because there are more ")" than "(". 

The correct condition to check is if the total count of "(" is equal to the total count of ")". This can be implemented as `cnt1 + cnt2 + cnt3 == cnt2 + cnt4 + cnt3`, which simplifies to `cnt1 == cnt4`. The code should be modified to check this condition instead of just comparing `cnt1` and `cnt3`.
