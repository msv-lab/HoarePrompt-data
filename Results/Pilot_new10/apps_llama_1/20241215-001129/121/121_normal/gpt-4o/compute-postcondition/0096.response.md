The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the given parameter constraints, it seems that the function is designed to process two lines of input: an integer `n` representing the length of the genome and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. 

Given the output cases, all of which return None, the function's return value is consistently None across all cases. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept no explicit parameters but process two lines of input and return None.
Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters, processes two lines of input, and returns None.**
