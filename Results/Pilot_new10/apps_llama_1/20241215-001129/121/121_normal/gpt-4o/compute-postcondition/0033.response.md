Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer and a multiple of 4 between 4 and 255, `data` is a list where the first element is the string representation of `n` and the second element is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?`, `target_count` is `n // 4`, `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where each value is the total count of the respective character in `s`, `char` is 'G'. If the count of 'G' in `s` is greater than `target_count`, the function returns None. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
