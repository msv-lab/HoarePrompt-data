The function func_1 accepts no explicit parameters and processes two lines of input from the standard input. 

1. The first line is expected to contain an integer `n` (4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255) representing the length of the genome.
2. The second line is expected to contain a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.

The function then checks if `n` is a multiple of 4. If `n` is not a multiple of 4, it prints '===' and returns None.

If `n` is a multiple of 4, it calculates the target count of each nucleotide ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') as `n // 4`. It then counts the occurrences of each nucleotide in the string `s`.

The function checks if the count of any nucleotide exceeds the target count. If any count exceeds the target count, it prints '===' and returns None.

If no count exceeds the target count, the function replaces each '?' in the string `s` with the first nucleotide ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') that has a count less than the target count. It increments the count of the nucleotide used to replace '?'.

Finally, the function prints the modified string where all '?' have been replaced with nucleotides.

The functionality of the function does not handle cases where the input is not as expected (e.g., non-integer value for `n`, string `s` with length not equal to `n`, or characters other than 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?' in `s`). 

In such cases, the function may not work as intended or may raise exceptions. Additionally, the function assumes that it is always possible to replace all '?' with nucleotides without exceeding the target count for any nucleotide. If this assumption is not met, the function will still replace '?' with nucleotides but may not ensure that the final counts of nucleotides are exactly equal to the target count.

Functionality: ** The function processes two lines of input, the first containing an integer `n` (4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255) and the second a string `s` of length `n` with characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. It checks if `n` is a multiple of 4, counts nucleotides in `s`, and checks if any count exceeds `n // 4`. If `n` is not a multiple of 4 or any count exceeds `n // 4`, it prints '===' and returns None. Otherwise, it replaces '?' in `s` with nucleotides that have counts less than `n // 4` and prints the modified string. The function does not handle unexpected input formats and assumes replacement of '?' is always possible without exceeding target counts. **
