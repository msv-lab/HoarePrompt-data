Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer and a multiple of 4 between 4 and 255, `data` is a list where the first element is the string representation of `n` and the second element is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?`, `target_count` is `n // 4`, if `result[i]` is '?', then `result` is a list of characters with counts less than `target_count` at the time of their assignment, and `counts` has updated counts for characters assigned to `result`.***
