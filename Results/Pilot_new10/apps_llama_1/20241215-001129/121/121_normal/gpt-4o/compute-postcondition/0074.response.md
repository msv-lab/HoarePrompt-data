Postcondition: **`n` is an integer and a multiple of 4 between 4 and 255, `data` is a list where the first element is the string representation of `n` and the second element is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?`, `target_count` is `n // 4`, if `result[i]` is '?', then `result` is a list of characters where the '?' at the current index `i` has been replaced with a character from 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' that has a count less than `target_count`, and `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where each value is the total count of the respective character in `s` plus the number of times each character was used to update `result`, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
