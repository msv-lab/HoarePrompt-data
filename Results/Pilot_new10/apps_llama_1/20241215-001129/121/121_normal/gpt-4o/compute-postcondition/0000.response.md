The code `input = sys.stdin.read` redirects the built-in `input` function to read from standard input using `sys.stdin.read`. This means that `input` will now return the entire contents of the standard input as a string, rather than prompting the user to enter a line of text.

Given the initial state, the first line of the input contains an integer `n` (4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255) representing the length of the genome, and the second line contains a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.

After executing the code, the `input` variable now holds the entire input as a string. This string includes the integer `n` on the first line, followed by the string `s` on the second line.

Output State: **`input` is a string containing the entire standard input, `n` is the first line of `input` which is an integer and 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, and the second line of `input` is a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.**
