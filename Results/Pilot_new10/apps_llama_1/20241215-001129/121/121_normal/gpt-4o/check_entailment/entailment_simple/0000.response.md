To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's analyze it step by step against the problem description:

1. **Handling Input**: The program correctly reads the input, where the first line contains an integer `n` (the length of the genome) and the second line contains a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.

2. **Initial Checks**:
   - It checks if `n` is a multiple of 4, which is a necessary condition for the genome to be decoded with equal numbers of each nucleotide type. If `n` is not a multiple of 4, it correctly prints '===' as per the problem description and returns.
   
3. **Counting Nucleotides**:
   - The program counts the occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' in the string `s` using a dictionary `counts`. This step is essential to understand how many of each nucleotide type are already present in the string.

4. **Checking for Exceeding Counts**:
   - Before proceeding to replace the '?' characters, the program checks if the count of any nucleotide type exceeds `target_count` (which is `n // 4`). If any count exceeds `target_count`, it prints '===' and returns, as it would be impossible to achieve equal counts for all nucleotides.

5. **Replacing '?' Characters**:
   - The program then iterates over the string `s` (stored in `result` as a list for mutability). When it encounters a '?' character, it replaces it with the first nucleotide type ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') that has a count less than `target_count`. It increments the count of the chosen nucleotide type in `counts`.
   - This greedy approach ensures that '?' characters are replaced in a way that tries to balance the counts of all nucleotide types, which is the goal of decoding the genome.

6. **Output**:
   - After replacing all '?' characters, the program joins the `result` list back into a string and prints it. This final string represents the decoded genome where each nucleotide type appears an equal number of times.

**Correctness: True**

The program is correct because it:

- Handles all possible inputs correctly, including cases where `n` is not a multiple of 4 or when it's impossible to achieve equal counts due to the existing distribution of nucleotides.
- Uses a greedy approach to replace '?' characters, which is sufficient for this problem since the goal is to find any valid decoding, not necessarily the optimal one in terms of some other criteria.
- Prints '===' when it's impossible to decode the genome according to the problem's constraints, as required.

This analysis covers all potential cases, and the program behaves as specified in the problem description for each of them.
