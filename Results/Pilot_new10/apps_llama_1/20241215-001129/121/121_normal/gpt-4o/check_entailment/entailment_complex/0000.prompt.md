You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The process of mammoth's genome decoding in Berland comes to its end!

One of the few remaining tasks is to restore unrecognized nucleotides in a found chain s. Each nucleotide is coded with a capital letter of English alphabet: 'A', 'C', 'G' or 'T'. Unrecognized nucleotides are coded by a question mark '?'. Thus, s is a string consisting of letters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and characters '?'.

It is known that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types in the decoded genome of mammoth in Berland should be equal.

Your task is to decode the genome and replace each unrecognized nucleotide with one of the four types so that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types becomes equal.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the integer n (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) — the length of the genome.

The second line contains the string s of length n — the coded genome. It consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and '?'.


-----Output-----

If it is possible to decode the genome, print it. If there are multiple answer, print any of them. If it is not possible, print three equals signs in a row: "===" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
8
AG?C??CT

Output
AGACGTCT

Input
4
AGCT

Output
AGCT

Input
6
????G?

Output
===

Input
4
AA??

Output
===



-----Note-----

In the first example you can replace the first question mark with the letter 'A', the second question mark with the letter 'G', the third question mark with the letter 'T', then each nucleotide in the genome would be presented twice.

In the second example the genome is already decoded correctly and each nucleotide is exactly once in it.

In the third and the fourth examples it is impossible to decode the genom.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: There is an available input where the first line contains an integer n (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) representing the length of the genome, and the second line contains a string s of length n consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    s = data[1]
    if (n % 4 != 0) :
        print('===')
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer and 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `n` is a multiple of 4, `data` is a list where the first element is the string representation of `n` and the second element is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'
    target_count = n // 4
    counts = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}
    for char in s:
        if char in counts:
            counts[char] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given information and the loop code step by step.
    #
    #1. **Initial State**: 
    #   - `n` is an integer and a multiple of 4 between 4 and 255.
    #   - `data` is a list where the first element is the string representation of `n` and the second element is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.
    #   - `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.
    #   - `target_count` is `n // 4`.
    #   - `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and values 0.
    #
    #2. **Loop Code**:
    #   ```
    #   for char in s:
    #       if char in counts:
    #           counts[char] += 1
    #   ```
    #   This loop iterates over each character in string `s`. If the character is one of the keys in the `counts` dictionary ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T'), it increments the count for that character by 1.
    #
    #3. **Output State after Some Iterations**:
    #   - The output states after 1, 2, and 3 iterations give us hints about how the variables change. 
    #   - `n`, `data`, and `target_count` do not change because the loop does not modify them.
    #   - `s` must have at least as many characters as the number of iterations for the loop to execute that many times.
    #   - `counts` is updated based on the characters in `s` that match the keys in `counts`.
    #
    #4. **Final Output State**:
    #   - Since the loop iterates over all characters in `s` (which has a length of `n`), after all iterations, `counts` will contain the total count of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' characters in `s`.
    #   - The loop does not modify `n`, `data`, or `target_count`, so their values remain as in the initial state.
    #   - `s` is not modified by the loop, so its value remains the same.
    #
    #Given this analysis, if the loop executes (meaning `s` is not empty), the final state of `counts` will reflect the total counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' in `s`. If the loop does not execute (because `s` is empty), then `counts` remains unchanged with all values being 0. However, since `s` is defined as a string of length `n` and `n` is between 4 and 255, `s` cannot be empty, ensuring the loop will always execute.
    #
    #**Output State**: **`n` is an integer and a multiple of 4 between 4 and 255, `data` is a list where the first element is the string representation of `n` and the second element is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', `target_count` is `n // 4`, and `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where each value is the total count of the respective character in `s`.**
    for char in counts:
        if counts[char] > target_count:
            print('===')
            return
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given information and the loop code step by step.
    #
    #1. **Initial State**: 
    #   - `n` is an integer and a multiple of 4 between 4 and 255.
    #   - `data` is a list where the first element is the string representation of `n` and the second element is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.
    #   - `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.
    #   - `target_count` is `n // 4`.
    #   - `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and values 0.
    #
    #2. **Loop Code**:
    #   ```
    #   for char in counts:
    #       if counts[char] > target_count:
    #           print('===')
    #           return
    #   ```
    #   This loop iterates over each character in the `counts` dictionary ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T'). If the count of any character exceeds `target_count` (`n // 4`), it prints '===' and returns from the function.
    #
    #3. **Output State after Some Iterations**:
    #   - The output states after 1, 2, and 3 iterations give us hints about how the variables change. 
    #   - `n`, `data`, and `target_count` do not change because the loop does not modify them.
    #   - `s` must have at least as many characters as the number of iterations for the loop to execute that many times, but since the loop iterates over `counts`, not `s`, this condition is always met since `s`'s length is used to populate `counts` before this loop.
    #   - `counts` is updated based on the characters in `s` that match the keys in `counts`, but this happens in the previous loop (not shown in this snippet).
    #
    #4. **Final Output State**:
    #   - Since the loop checks each character in `counts`, after all iterations, if none of the counts exceed `target_count`, the function will not return and will continue execution beyond this loop.
    #   - If any count exceeds `target_count`, the function will return after printing '===', indicating that at least one of the character counts in `s` exceeds the target count.
    #   - `n`, `data`, `s`, and `target_count` retain their initial values because they are not modified within this loop.
    #   - `counts` retains its value as calculated from `s` before this loop, showing the total count of each character in `s`.
    #
    #Given this analysis, the output state after all iterations of the loop will depend on whether any character count exceeds `target_count`. However, since the loop's primary action is to check and potentially return, the variables' states are mostly determined by the previous loop that populated `counts`.
    #
    #- If the function does not return (meaning no count exceeds `target_count`), `n`, `data`, `s`, `target_count`, and `counts` will have the same values as after the previous loop that populated `counts`.
    #- If the function returns (meaning at least one count exceeds `target_count`), the state of the variables is frozen at the point of return, with `n`, `data`, `s`, and `target_count` unchanged, and `counts` reflecting the distribution of characters in `s`.
    #
    #Thus, the output state after all iterations will reflect whether the function continued beyond this loop or returned due to exceeding `target_count`. Since `counts` is the critical variable here, and its calculation happens before this snippet, we consider its state as determined by the previous loop.
    #
    #**Output State**: **`n` is an integer and a multiple of 4 between 4 and 255, `data` is a list where the first element is the string representation of `n` and the second element is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?`, `target_count` is `n // 4`, and `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where each value is the total count of the respective character in `s`. If any value in `counts` exceeds `target_count`, the function returns after printing '===', otherwise, it continues execution.**
    result = list(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if result[i] == '?':
            for char in counts:
                if counts[char] < target_count:
                    result[i] = char
                    counts[char] += 1
                    break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer and a multiple of 4 between 4 and 255, `data` is a list where the first element is the string representation of `n` and the second element is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?`, `target_count` is `n // 4`, `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where each value is the total count of the respective character in the original `s` plus the number of times each character was used to update `result`, and `result` is a list of characters where all '?' have been replaced with characters from 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' that had counts less than `target_count` at the time of their assignment.
    print(''.join(result))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes two lines of input, the first containing an integer `n` (4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255) and the second a string `s` of length `n` with characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. It checks if `n` is a multiple of 4, counts nucleotides in `s`, and checks if any count exceeds `n // 4`. If `n` is not a multiple of 4 or any count exceeds `n // 4`, it prints '===' and returns None. Otherwise, it replaces '?' in `s` with nucleotides that have counts less than `n // 4` and prints the modified string. The function does not handle unexpected input formats and assumes replacement of '?' is always possible without exceeding target counts.

The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
