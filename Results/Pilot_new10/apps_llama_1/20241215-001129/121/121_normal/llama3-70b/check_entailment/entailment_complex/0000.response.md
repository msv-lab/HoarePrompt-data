Correctness: **True**

This program is correct because it follows the problem description for every potential case. 

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why it works:

1. **Counting existing nucleotides**: The program first counts the number of each nucleotide ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') in the input string `s`. This is done using a dictionary `count` where each key represents a nucleotide and its corresponding value is the count of that nucleotide.

2. **Calculating the target count**: The program then calculates the target count for each nucleotide, which is `n // 4` (where `n` is the length of the string). This is stored in the `avg` variable.

3. **Calculating the remaining count for each nucleotide**: The program then calculates how many more of each nucleotide are needed to reach the target count. This is done by subtracting the existing count from the target count for each nucleotide.

4. **Replacing '?' with the available nucleotides**: The program then replaces each '?' in the string `s` with the available nucleotides from `count`. It does this by iterating over each character in `s` and checking if it's a '?'. If it is, it finds the first nucleotide in `count` that has a value greater than 0, adds it to the result string `res`, and decrements the count for that nucleotide.

5. **Checking if all available nucleotides are used**: Finally, the program checks if all available nucleotides are used by checking if any of the values in `count` are greater than 0. If any of them are, it means that there are remaining nucleotides that couldn't be used, so it prints '==='. Otherwise, it prints the resulting string `res`.

This program works for all cases because it correctly calculates the target count for each nucleotide, replaces '?' with the available nucleotides, and checks if all available nucleotides are used. If the input string `s` can be modified to have an equal number of each nucleotide, this program will do so and print the resulting string. If it's not possible to modify `s` to have an equal number of each nucleotide, it will print '==='.
