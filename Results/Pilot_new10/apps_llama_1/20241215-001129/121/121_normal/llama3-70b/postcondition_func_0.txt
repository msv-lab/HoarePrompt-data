The function reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`, where `n` is between 4 and 255 (inclusive), and `s` consists of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', replaces '?' in `s` with 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' to achieve a balance of `n // 4` for each character, and prints the resulting string if all available characters are used, or '===' if there are remaining characters; if the input does not meet the specified conditions, the function's behavior is undefined
