The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or a control structure. When this statement is executed, it will terminate the loop it is directly inside. The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is the input string that must have at least 1 character, `avg` is `n // 4`, `count` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where `count['A']` is `n // 4 - count_original['A'] - 1` and `count['C']`, `count['G']`, `count['T']` are `n // 4 - count_original['C']`, `n // 4 - count_original['G']`, `n // 4 - count_original['T']` respectively, `c` is '?', `nc` is 'A', `res` is 'A' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
