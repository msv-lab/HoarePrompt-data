The code line `count[nc] -= 1` decreases the value of `count[nc]` by 1. We know that `nc` is 'C'. Therefore, the value of `count['C']` is decreased by 1.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is the input string that must have at least 2 characters, `avg` is `n // 4`, `c` is the second character in the string `s`, `nc` is 'C', `res` is the old state of `res` plus 'C', `count['C']` is the old state of `count['C']` minus 1**
