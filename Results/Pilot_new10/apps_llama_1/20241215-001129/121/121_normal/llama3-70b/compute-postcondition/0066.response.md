To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given:
- `n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive).
- `s` is the input string that must have at least 2 characters.
- `avg` is `n // 4`.
- `c` is the second character in the string `s`.
- The loop iterates over each character `c` in the string `s`.

Since `c` is the second character in the string `s` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `s` must have at least 3 characters. This is because the loop will move on to the next character in the string. Thus, `c` will become the third character in `s` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is the input string that must have at least 3 characters, `avg` is `n // 4`, `c` is the third character in the string `s`**
