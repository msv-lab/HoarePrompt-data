The code `res += nc` modifies the variable `res` by adding the value of `nc` to it. Since `nc` is 'G', `res` is updated by appending 'G' to it.

The initial state provides values for `n`, `s`, `avg`, `c`, and `nc`. The variable `res` is not initialized in the initial state, but it is being modified in the code. We can assume `res` is initially an empty string or some predefined string, but for the sake of calculation, let's consider `res` as it is, without any specific initial value.

Given that:
- `n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive),
- `s` is the input string with at least 3 characters,
- `avg` is `n // 4`,
- `c` is the third character in the string `s`,
- `nc` is 'G',
- `res` is increased by 'G'.

The states of `n`, `s`, `avg`, `c`, and `nc` are not affected by the code. Only `res` is updated.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is the input string that must have at least 3 characters, `avg` is `n // 4`, `c` is the third character in the string `s`, `nc` is 'G', and `res` is increased by 'G'**
