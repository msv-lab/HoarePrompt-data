Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is the input string that must have at least 1 character, `avg` is `n // 4`. If `c` is '?', then `res` is either an empty string or the first character from 'ACGT' where `count[c]` was greater than 0 before the loop, `count` is updated only for the first 'ACGT' character that had a count greater than 0 (if any), and `c` remains '?'. If `c` is not '?', then `res` is a string containing the first character of `s`, and `c` is the first character in the string `s`.**
