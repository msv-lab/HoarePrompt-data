The code `s = input()` assigns the value of `input()` to the variable `s`. Since `n` is an input integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), and the previous value of `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', the new value of `s` is an input string.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is an input string**
