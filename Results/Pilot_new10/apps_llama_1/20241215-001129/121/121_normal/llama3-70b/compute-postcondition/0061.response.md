Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is the input string that must have at least 3 characters, `avg` is `n // 4`, `c` is the third character in the string `s`, `nc` is 'G'. If `count['G']` is greater than 0, then `res` is increased by 'G', `count['G']` is decreased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
