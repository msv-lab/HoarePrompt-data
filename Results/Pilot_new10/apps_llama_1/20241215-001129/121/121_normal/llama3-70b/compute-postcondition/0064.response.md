The code `res += c` has the effect of appending the character `c` to the string `res`. Given that `c` is the second character in the string `s` and is not '?', and the initial state of `res` depends on the value of `c`, we can infer that `res` is updated by adding `c` to its current value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is the input string that must have at least 2 characters, `avg` is `n // 4`, `c` is the second character in the string `s` and `c` is not '?', `res` is the original value of `res` (which depends on `c`) plus the character `c`**
