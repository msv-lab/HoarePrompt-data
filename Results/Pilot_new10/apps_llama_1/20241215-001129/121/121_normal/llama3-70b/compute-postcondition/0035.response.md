Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is the input string that must have at least 1 character, `avg` is `n // 4`, `count['A']` is either decremented by 1 or remains unchanged. If `count['C']` is greater than 0, then `res` is either 'AC' or its previous value plus 'C', `count['C']` is decremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. In this case, `c` is '?'. Otherwise, the state of `res`, `count['C']`, and the loop or if statement remains unchanged.***
