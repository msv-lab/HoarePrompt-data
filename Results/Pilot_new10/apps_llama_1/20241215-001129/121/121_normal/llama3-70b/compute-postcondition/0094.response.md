The function `func` accepts an integer `n` and a string `s` as input, where `n` is between 4 and 255 (inclusive) and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. It calculates the count of each character 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' in `s` and then calculates the average count `avg` of these characters, which is `n // 4`. It then adjusts the count of each character to be `avg` minus the original count of the character. The function then iterates over `s` and replaces each '?' with the first available character from 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' that has a count greater than 0, decrementing the count of the character each time it is used. If there are any remaining counts greater than 0 after replacing all '?' in `s`, the function prints '==='; otherwise, it prints the resulting string `res` after replacement. The function does not handle cases where the input `n` or `s` does not meet the specified conditions, and it does not return a value explicitly, instead printing the result directly to the console.

Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`, where `n` is between 4 and 255 (inclusive), and `s` consists of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', replaces '?' in `s` with 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' to achieve a balance of `n // 4` for each character, and prints the resulting string if all available characters are used, or '===' if there are remaining characters; if the input does not meet the specified conditions, the function's behavior is undefined **
