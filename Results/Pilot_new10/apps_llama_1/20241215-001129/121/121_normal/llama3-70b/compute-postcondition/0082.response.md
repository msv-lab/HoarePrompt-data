Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is the input string that must have at least 3 characters, `avg` is `n // 4`, `c` is the third character in the string `s`, `nc` is 'G'. If `count['G']` is greater than 0, then `res` is the original value of `res` plus 'G', and `count['G']` is the original value of `count['G']` minus 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `res` and `count['G']`.***
