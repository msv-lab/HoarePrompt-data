Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is the input string that must have at least 3 characters, `avg` is `n // 4`, `c` is the third character in the string `s`, `nc` is 'A'. If `count[nc]` is greater than 0, `res` is updated by appending 'A' to its previous value and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
