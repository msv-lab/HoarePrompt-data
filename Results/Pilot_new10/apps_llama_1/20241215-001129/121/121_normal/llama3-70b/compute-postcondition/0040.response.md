Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is the input string that must have at least 1 character, `avg` is `n // 4`, `count['A']` is either decremented by 1 or remains unchanged. If `count[nc]` is greater than 0, then `res` is increased by `nc`, `count[nc]` is decreased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `res` and `count[nc]`.***
