Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is the input string that must have at least 3 characters, `avg` is `n // 4`, `c` is the third character in the string `s`. If `c` is '?', then `res` is the original value of `res` plus the first character from 'ACGT' that has a count greater than 0 (if such a character exists), and `count` has the count of the appended character decremented by 1 (if such a character exists). If `c` is not '?', then `res` is the original value of `res` plus `c`.**
