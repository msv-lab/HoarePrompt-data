To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given state:
- `n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive)
- `s` is the input string that must have at least 1 character
- `avg` is `n // 4`
- `count` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where each value `count[c]` is `n // 4 - count_original[c]`
- `res` is an empty string
- The current value of `c` is '?' since it is the first character in the string `s` which equals to '?'

Loop statement:
```python
for nc in 'ACGT':
    # the loop body is omitted
```

The loop will iterate over each character in the string 'ACGT'. This means `nc` will take the values 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in each iteration. 

The given state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute because the loop will run regardless of the current state of `n`, `s`, `avg`, `count`, `res`, and `c`. The loop is designed to iterate over a fixed string 'ACGT', and its execution is not dependent on the values of `n`, `s`, `avg`, `count`, `res`, or `c`.

However, for clarity and completeness in describing the state at the start of the loop, we acknowledge that `nc` will be initialized to 'A' at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is the input string that must have at least 1 character, `avg` is `n // 4`, `count` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where each value `count[c]` is `n // 4 - count_original[c]`, `res` is an empty string, `c` is '?', and `nc` is 'A'**
