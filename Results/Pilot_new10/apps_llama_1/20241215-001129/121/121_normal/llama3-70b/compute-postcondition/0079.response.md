The value of `res` is incremented by `nc`. The initial value of `res` is not provided, but it is known that `nc` is 'G'. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is the input string that must have at least 3 characters, `avg` is `n // 4`, `c` is the third character in the string `s`, `nc` is 'G', and `res` is incremented by 'G'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is the input string that must have at least 3 characters, `avg` is `n // 4`, `c` is the third character in the string `s`, `nc` is 'G', `res` is the original value of `res` plus 'G'**
