Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue with the program is that it only checks for values of 'a' up to 's-1'. However, 'a' can be equal to 's/2' and 'b' can also be equal to 's/2' when 'x' is 0 (because 'a ^ b' is equal to '0' when 'a' and 'b' are equal), but 's/2' cannot be checked by this program if 's' is even. 

Another issue with the program is that it only checks values of 'a' up to 's-1', but 'b' is calculated as 's - a', so this program will not check the case where 'a' is greater than 's/2' and 'b' is less than 's/2'.

For example, the input "10 0" will not work correctly with this program because the only possible solution is (5, 5), but this program will not check it. The correct output for this input should be 1, but the program will print 0.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    (s, x) = map(int, input().split())
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, s):
        b = s - a
        if a ^ b == x and a > 0 and b > 0:
            count += 1
    print(count)

```
However, this correction will still fail when 's' is even and 'x' is 0, because it will count (s/2, s/2) twice.

To correctly solve this problem, you need to check all possible combinations of 'a' and 'b' such that 'a + b = s' and 'a ^ b = x', which can be achieved by using the following corrected version:

```python
def func():
    (s, x) = map(int, input().split())
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, s):
        b = s - a
        if a ^ b == x and a > 0 and b > 0:
            if a == b:
                count += 1
            else:
                count += 2
    print(count)
```
This program checks all possible combinations of 'a' and 'b', and counts each combination twice if 'a' and 'b' are different, and counts it once if 'a' and 'b' are the same.
