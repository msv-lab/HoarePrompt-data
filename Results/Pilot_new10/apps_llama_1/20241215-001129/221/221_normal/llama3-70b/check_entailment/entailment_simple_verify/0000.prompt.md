You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Two positive integers a and b have a sum of s and a bitwise XOR of x. How many possible values are there for the ordered pair (a, b)?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers s and x (2 ≤ s ≤ 10^12, 0 ≤ x ≤ 10^12), the sum and bitwise xor of the pair of positive integers, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, the number of solutions to the given conditions. If no solutions exist, print 0.


-----Examples-----
Input
9 5

Output
4

Input
3 3

Output
2

Input
5 2

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first sample, we have the following solutions: (2, 7), (3, 6), (6, 3), (7, 2).

In the second sample, the only solutions are (1, 2) and (2, 1).
Program:
```
def func():
    (s, x) = map(int, input().split())
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, s):
        b = s - a
        if a ^ b == x:
            count += 1
    print(count)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The given program is correct and works as expected for every potential case. It correctly counts the number of possible ordered pairs (a, b) where a and b are positive integers, their sum is equal to s, and their bitwise XOR is equal to x.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The program iterates over all possible values of a from 1 to s-1.
2. For each value of a, it calculates the corresponding value of b as s-a.
3. It checks if the bitwise XOR of a and b is equal to x. If it is, it increments the count.
4. Finally, it prints the total count of such ordered pairs.

The program handles all possible cases correctly:

- It checks all possible values of a from 1 to s-1, ensuring that both a and b are positive integers.
- It calculates b as s-a, ensuring that the sum of a and b is equal to s.
- It checks the bitwise XOR of a and b, ensuring that it is equal to x.

The provided examples in the problem description also work correctly with the given program. For instance:

- For input (9, 5), the program correctly outputs 4, corresponding to the pairs (2, 7), (3, 6), (6, 3), and (7, 2).
- For input (3, 3), the program correctly outputs 2, corresponding to the pairs (1, 2) and (2, 1).
- For input (5, 2), the program correctly outputs 0, as there are no pairs of positive integers that satisfy the conditions.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s and x are integers such that 2 <= s <= 10^12 and 0 <= x <= 10^12.
def func():
    s, x = map(int, input().split())
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, s):
        b = s - a
        
        if a ^ b == x:
            count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is the original input integer, `x` is the original input integer, `a` is `s-1`, `b` is `1`, and `count` is the number of pairs `(a, b)` where `a ^ b == x` for `a` ranging from 1 to `s-1` and `b = s - a`.
    print(count)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
