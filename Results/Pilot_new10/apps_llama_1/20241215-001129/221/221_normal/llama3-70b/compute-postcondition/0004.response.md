Postcondition: **`s` is an input integer that must be at least 2, `x` is an input integer, initially `count` is 0, initially `a` is 1, and initially `b` is `s - 1`. The current value of `a` is 1, the current value of `b` is `s - 1`, and the current value of `x` is equal to the bitwise XOR of `a` and `b`**
