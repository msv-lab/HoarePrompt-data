You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Famous Brazil city Rio de Janeiro holds a tennis tournament and Ostap Bender doesn't want to miss this event. There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.

Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.

Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.


-----Examples-----
Input
2

Output
1

Input
3

Output
2

Input
4

Output
2

Input
10

Output
4



-----Note-----

In all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.

In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.

In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. 

In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    print(n.bit_length() - 1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided program calculates the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in, given the number of players and the rule that two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played.

The program uses the `bit_length()` function in Python, which returns the number of bits necessary to represent the number in binary. This is equal to the floor of the base-2 logarithm of the number plus 1.

The reason this works is that in a knockout tournament where players are eliminated after losing one game, the maximum number of games a player can play is equal to the number of times the number of players can be halved until we reach a single player. This is equivalent to finding the base-2 logarithm of the number of players, rounding down, and adding 1.

By subtracting 1 from the result of `n.bit_length()`, the program effectively calculates the floor of the base-2 logarithm of the number of players, which represents the maximum number of games the winner can play.

For example, if we have 10 players, the binary representation of 10 is 1010, which requires 4 bits. However, the maximum number of games the winner can play is 4, not 4 - 1 = 3. But if we think about the process: 

- In the first round, 5 players are eliminated, and 5 players are left.
- In the second round, 2-3 players are eliminated (depending on whether there was a bye in the first round), and 2-3 players are left.
- In the third round, 1-2 players are eliminated, and 1-2 players are left.
- In the fourth round, the final game is played.

So, the winner plays 4 games in total.

This logic applies to all positive integers, so the program correctly calculates the maximum number of games the winner can play for any number of players. Therefore, I couldn't find any case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided seem to work correctly.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function reads an integer from the input, calculates the number of bits required to represent the integer in binary, subtracts 1 from this value, and prints the result. If the input is not a valid integer, it may raise a ValueError. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
