You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Famous Brazil city Rio de Janeiro holds a tennis tournament and Ostap Bender doesn't want to miss this event. There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.

Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.

Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.


-----Examples-----
Input
2

Output
1

Input
3

Output
2

Input
4

Output
2

Input
10

Output
4



-----Note-----

In all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.

In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.

In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. 

In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    print(n.bit_length() - 1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program calculates the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can participate in, given the number of players `n`. 

The program uses the `bit_length()` function, which returns the number of bits necessary to represent `n` in binary. The reason this works is due to the nature of the tournament. 

In a knockout tournament where a player is eliminated after losing one game, and two players can only play against each other if they have played a similar number of games (differing by at most one), the structure of the tournament will resemble a binary tree.

The maximum number of games a winner can play in such a tournament is equivalent to the height of the binary tree that can be constructed with `n` players. This height is `log2(n)` when `n` is a power of 2, because a binary tree with `n` leaves (where `n` is a power of 2) has a height of `log2(n)`. However, when `n` is not a power of 2, the height is still equivalent to the number of bits required to represent the next highest power of 2, which is `bit_length() - 1`.

The `-1` in the expression `n.bit_length() - 1` accounts for the fact that the `bit_length()` function returns the number of bits necessary to represent `n+1`, and subtracting 1 gives the number of bits necessary to represent `n`, which corresponds to the height of the binary tree and thus the maximum number of games.

This solution accounts for all possible inputs `n`, where `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, and it correctly calculates the maximum number of games the winner can participate in, given the constraints of the tournament. 

The examples provided in the problem description are correctly solved by the program, and there are no obvious cases where the program would fail to produce the correct result. Therefore, the program appears to be correct for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is an integer n, such that n is greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 10^18, representing the number of players participating in the tournament.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    print(n.bit_length() - 1)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
