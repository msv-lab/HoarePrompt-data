Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The program is designed to find the minimum amount of kvass that can be left in the least keg after pouring a glass of `s` liters from `n` kegs, each containing `v_i` liters of kvass. This aligns perfectly with the problem statement.

2. **Binary Search Approach**: The program uses a binary search approach to find the minimum amount of kvass that can be left in the least keg. It initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to the minimum value in `v`, ensuring that the search space includes all possible amounts of kvass that could be left in the least keg. The binary search continues until `low` and `high` converge, which guarantees that `low` will be the minimum value where the sum of the minimum between `low` and each element in `v` is greater than or equal to `s`.

3. **Sum Calculation**: Inside the binary search loop, the program calculates the total amount of kvass that would be poured if `mid` liters were left in each keg. This is done using the expression `sum(min(mid, x) for x in v)`, which correctly calculates the sum of the minimum between `mid` and each element `x` in `v`.

4. **Condition Checking**: The program checks if the calculated total is less than `s`. If it is, `low` is updated to `mid`, effectively increasing the amount of kvass left in each keg in the next iteration. If the total is greater than or equal to `s`, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`, which decreases the amount of kvass left in each keg in the next iteration.

5. **Final Result**: After the binary search loop converges, the program checks if the sum of the minimum between `low` and each element in `v` is equal to `s`. If it is, `low` is printed as the minimum amount of kvass that can be left in the least keg. If not, -1 is printed, indicating that it's not possible to pour `s` liters of kvass from the given kegs.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* When it's possible to pour `s` liters of kvass, it finds the minimum amount of kvass that can be left in the least keg.
* When it's not possible to pour `s` liters of kvass, it returns -1.

Overall, the program accurately implements the problem description and provides the correct output for all possible input cases.
