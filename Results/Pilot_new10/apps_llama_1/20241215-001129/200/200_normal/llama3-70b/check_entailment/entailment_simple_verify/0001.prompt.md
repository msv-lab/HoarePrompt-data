You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The Fair Nut likes kvass very much. On his birthday parents presented him $n$ kegs of kvass. There are $v_i$ liters of kvass in the $i$-th keg. Each keg has a lever. You can pour your glass by exactly $1$ liter pulling this lever. The Fair Nut likes this drink very much, so he wants to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass. But he wants to do it, so kvass level in the least keg is as much as possible.

Help him find out how much kvass can be in the least keg or define it's not possible to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $s$ ($1 \le n \le 10^3$, $1 \le s \le 10^{12}$) — the number of kegs and glass volume.

The second line contains $n$ integers $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$ ($1 \le v_i \le 10^9$) — the volume of $i$-th keg.


-----Output-----

If the Fair Nut cannot pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass, print $-1$. Otherwise, print a single integer — how much kvass in the least keg can be.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
4 3 5

Output
3

Input
3 4
5 3 4

Output
2

Input
3 7
1 2 3

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example, the answer is $3$, the Fair Nut can take $1$ liter from the first keg and $2$ liters from the third keg. There are $3$ liters of kvass in each keg.

In the second example, the answer is $2$, the Fair Nut can take $3$ liters from the first keg and $1$ liter from the second keg.

In the third example, the Fair Nut can't pour his cup by $7$ liters, so the answer is $-1$.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, s) = map(int, input().split())
    v = list(map(int, input().split()))
    v.sort()
    (low, high) = (0, min(v))
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high + 1) // 2
        total = sum((min(mid, x) for x in v))
        if total < s:
            low = mid
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    if sum((min(low, x) for x in v)) != s:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(low)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and it meets the requirements in the problem description. Here's why:

1. The program correctly sorts the volumes of the kegs in ascending order, which is necessary for finding the minimum volume of kvass that can be left in the kegs after pouring the desired amount.
2. The program uses a binary search approach to find the minimum volume of kvass that can be left in the kegs. This approach is efficient and correct, as it iteratively narrows down the search range until it finds the correct answer.
3. The program correctly calculates the total volume of kvass that can be poured from the kegs without leaving less than the current minimum volume in any keg. If this total volume is less than the desired amount, it increases the minimum volume. If the total volume is greater than or equal to the desired amount, it decreases the minimum volume.
4. The program checks if the total volume of kvass that can be poured from the kegs with the calculated minimum volume is equal to the desired amount. If it is not, it prints -1, indicating that it is not possible to pour the desired amount of kvass.

After analyzing the program and considering various potential cases, I was unable to find any example where the program does not work correctly according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct. 

The code is well-structured and follows a logical approach to solve the problem, which makes it easy to understand and verify its correctness. The use of binary search reduces the time complexity of the program, making it efficient for large inputs. Overall, the program is well-designed and correctly implements the required logic to solve the problem.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, s is a positive integer, and there is a list of n integers v where each v_i is a positive integer and 1 <= n <= 10^3, 1 <= s <= 10^12, and 1 <= v_i <= 10^9.
def func():
    n, s = map(int, input().split())
    v = list(map(int, input().split()))
    v.sort()
    low, high = 0, min(v)
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high + 1) // 2
        
        total = sum(min(mid, x) for x in v)
        
        if total < s:
            low = mid
        else:
            high = mid - 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is unchanged, `s` is unchanged, `v` is unchanged, `low` and `high` have converged such that `low` is the minimum value where the sum of the minimum between `low` and each element in `v` is greater than or equal to `s`, or the closest value to this condition without exceeding `s` if such an exact value does not exist, with `low` being equal to or one more than `high` at termination.
    if (sum(min(low, x) for x in v) != s) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        print(low)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is unchanged, `s` is unchanged, `v` is unchanged, `low` and `high` have converged such that `low` is the minimum value where the sum of the minimum between `low` and each element in `v` is greater than or equal to `s`, or the closest value to this condition without exceeding `s` if such an exact value does not exist, with `low` being equal to or one more than `high` at termination. If the sum of the minimum between `low` and each element in `v` is equal to `s`, then `low` has been returned and printed at the output. Otherwise, -1 has been printed because the sum of the minimum between `low` and each element in `v` is not equal to `s`.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
