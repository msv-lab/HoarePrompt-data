Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `v` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order. If `total` is less than `s`, then `low` is equal to `(low + high + 1) // 2` and `high` is greater than or equal to `low`. Otherwise, `low` is less than `high`, `high` is `mid - 1`, and `mid` is `(low + high + 1) // 2` with `total` being the sum of `min(mid, x)` for all `x` in `v`.**
