Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `v` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order. If the total sum of `min(mid, x)` for all `x` in `v` is less than `s`, then `low` is updated to `(high + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid - 1` and `mid` is updated to `mid // 2`, and the total sum is greater than or equal to `s`.***
