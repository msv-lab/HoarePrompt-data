Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is an input integer, `v_i` is a list of n non-negative integers, `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `total_volume` is equal to the sum of all elements in `volumes`, `total_volume` is greater than or equal to `s`, `min_keg_volume` is equal to `volumes[0]`, `i` is 0, if `volumes[i]` is less than or equal to `min_keg_volume`, then the current state remains unchanged and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. If `volumes[i]` is greater than `min_keg_volume`, then `remaining_kvass` is updated to `s - possible_to_take`, where `possible_to_take` is the minimum of `volumes[i] - min_keg_volume` and `s`. The current value of `remaining_kvass` is 0**
