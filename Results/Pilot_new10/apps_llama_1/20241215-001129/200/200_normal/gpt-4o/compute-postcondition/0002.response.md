The code sorts the list `volumes` in ascending order. The values of `n`, `s`, and `v_i` are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `v_i` is a list of n non-negative integers such that 1 <= v_i <= 10^9 for each i, and `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order**
