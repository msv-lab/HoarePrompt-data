The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It does not change the values of any variables, but it continues with the next iteration of the loop. 

The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 2, `s` is an input integer, `v_i` is a list of n non-negative integers, `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `total_volume` is equal to the sum of all elements in `volumes`, `total_volume` is greater than or equal to `s`, `min_keg_volume` is equal to `volumes[0]`, `i` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop.**
