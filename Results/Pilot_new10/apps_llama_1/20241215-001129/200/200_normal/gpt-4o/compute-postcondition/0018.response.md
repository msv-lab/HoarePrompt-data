Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is an input integer, `v_i` is a list of n non-negative integers, `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `total_volume` is equal to the sum of all elements in `volumes`, `total_volume` is greater than or equal to `s`, `min_keg_volume` is equal to `volumes[0]`, `i` is 0, if `remaining_kvass` is 0, then we break out of the most internal loop; otherwise, the execution continues***
