Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 2, `s` is an input integer, `v_i` is a list of n non-negative integers, `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `total_volume` is equal to the sum of all elements in `volumes`, `total_volume` is greater than or equal to `s`, `min_keg_volume` is equal to `volumes[0]`, `i` is 2. If `volumes[i]` is less than or equal to `min_keg_volume`, we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop. Otherwise, `possible_to_take` is `min(volumes[2] - volumes[0], remaining_kvass)` and `remaining_kvass` is updated to `remaining_kvass - min(volumes[2] - volumes[0], remaining_kvass)`***
