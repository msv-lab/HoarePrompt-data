The code `print(-1)` simply prints the value -1 to the console. This operation does not modify any of the existing variables. 

The values of `n`, `s`, `v_i`, `volumes`, and `total_volume` remain unchanged. 

Since `print(-1)` does not assign a value to any variable, the only effect is that -1 has been printed and no variable has been returned at the output state, but we return -1 as per print statement.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `v_i` is a list of n non-negative integers such that 1 <= v_i <= 10^9 for each i, `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `total_volume` is equal to the sum of all elements in `volumes` and is less than `s`, and -1 has been printed**
