Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is an input integer, `v_i` is a list of n non-negative integers, `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `total_volume` is equal to the sum of all elements in `volumes`, `total_volume` is greater than or equal to `s`, `min_keg_volume` is equal to `volumes[0]`, the current value of `remaining_kvass` is equal to `s`, and the current value of `i` is 0. The current value of `volumes[i]` is less than or equal to `min_keg_volume`.**
