The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. `n` is still an input integer greater than 1, `s` is still an input integer, `v_i` is still a list of n non-negative integers, `volumes` is still a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `total_volume` is still equal to the sum of all elements in `volumes`, `total_volume` is still greater than or equal to `s`, `min_keg_volume` is still equal to `volumes[0]`, `i` is still 1. 
The condition to move to the next iteration of the loop is still the same: If `volumes[i]` is less than or equal to `min_keg_volume`.  
Also the condition to stop the loop is met, as the break condition is called so `remaining_kvass - possible_to_take` equals 0.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input integer, `v_i` is a list of n non-negative integers, `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `total_volume` is equal to the sum of all elements in `volumes`, `total_volume` is greater than or equal to `s`, `min_keg_volume` is equal to `volumes[0]`, `i` is 1, we break out of the most internal loop, `remaining_kvass - possible_to_take` equals 0**
