The code uses the `map` function to convert the input values into integers and assigns them to the variables `n` and `s`. The input is expected to be two space-separated integers.

The value of `n` is updated to be the first integer input by the user, and the value of `s` is updated to be the second integer input by the user.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, and `v_i` is still a list of n non-negative integers such that 1 <= v_i <= 10^9 for each i, but the initial constraints on `n` and `s` (1 <= n <= 10^3 and 1 <= s <= 10^12) may not hold anymore since `n` and `s` now hold user-input values.**
