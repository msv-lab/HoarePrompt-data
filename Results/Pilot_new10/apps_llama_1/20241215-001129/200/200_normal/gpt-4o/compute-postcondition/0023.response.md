Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input integer, `v_i` is a list of n non-negative integers, `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `total_volume` is equal to the sum of all elements in `volumes`, `total_volume` is greater than or equal to `s`, `min_keg_volume` is equal to `volumes[0]`, `i` is 1. If `volumes[i]` is less than or equal to `min_keg_volume`, we move to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `possible_to_take` is the minimum of `volumes[1] - volumes[0]` and `remaining_kvass`, `remaining_kvass` is updated to `remaining_kvass - possible_to_take`, and if `remaining_kvass - possible_to_take` equals 0, we break out of the most internal loop.***
