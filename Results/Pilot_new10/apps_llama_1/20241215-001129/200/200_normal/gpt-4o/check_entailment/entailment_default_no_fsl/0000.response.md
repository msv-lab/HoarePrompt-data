Correctness: **True**

The code provided implements the logic to determine the minimum amount of kvass that can be left in the least keg after pouring `s` liters from `n` kegs, where each keg has a certain volume of kvass. 

The function first checks if the total volume of all kegs is enough to fill `s` liters. If not, it prints `-1` as it's not possible to pour `s` liters.

If the total volume is enough, it sorts the volumes of the kegs and starts from the smallest volume. It iterates through the kegs, calculating how much kvass can be taken from each keg without going below the minimum keg volume. If there's still remaining kvass after this process, it reduces the minimum keg volume proportionally among all kegs.

The code handles the edge case where the total volume of all kegs is less than `s`, and also handles cases where the minimum keg volume needs to be reduced proportionally among all kegs.

The provided examples in the problem description are also correctly handled by the code:

- In the first example, the answer is `3` as the Fair Nut can take `1` liter from the first keg and `2` liters from the third keg, leaving `3` liters in each keg.
- In the second example, the answer is `2` as the Fair Nut can take `3` liters from the first keg and `1` liter from the second keg, leaving `2` liters in the second keg.
- In the third example, the answer is `-1` as the total volume of all kegs (`1 + 2 + 3 = 6`) is less than `s` (`7`).

Overall, the code appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem and handles all potential cases.
