You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The Fair Nut likes kvass very much. On his birthday parents presented him $n$ kegs of kvass. There are $v_i$ liters of kvass in the $i$-th keg. Each keg has a lever. You can pour your glass by exactly $1$ liter pulling this lever. The Fair Nut likes this drink very much, so he wants to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass. But he wants to do it, so kvass level in the least keg is as much as possible.

Help him find out how much kvass can be in the least keg or define it's not possible to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $s$ ($1 \le n \le 10^3$, $1 \le s \le 10^{12}$) — the number of kegs and glass volume.

The second line contains $n$ integers $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$ ($1 \le v_i \le 10^9$) — the volume of $i$-th keg.


-----Output-----

If the Fair Nut cannot pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass, print $-1$. Otherwise, print a single integer — how much kvass in the least keg can be.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
4 3 5

Output
3

Input
3 4
5 3 4

Output
2

Input
3 7
1 2 3

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example, the answer is $3$, the Fair Nut can take $1$ liter from the first keg and $2$ liters from the third keg. There are $3$ liters of kvass in each keg.

In the second example, the answer is $2$, the Fair Nut can take $3$ liters from the first keg and $1$ liter from the second keg.

In the third example, the Fair Nut can't pour his cup by $7$ liters, so the answer is $-1$.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, s) = map(int, input().split())
    volumes = list(map(int, input().split()))
    volumes.sort()
    total_volume = sum(volumes)
    if total_volume < s:
        print(-1)
    else:
        min_keg_volume = volumes[0]
        remaining_kvass = s
        for i in range(n):
            if volumes[i] <= min_keg_volume:
                continue
            else:
                possible_to_take = min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)
                remaining_kvass -= possible_to_take
            if remaining_kvass == 0:
                break
        if remaining_kvass > 0:
            min_keg_volume -= (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n
        print(min_keg_volume)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The code is correct because it follows the problem description for every potential case. It first checks if the total volume of all kegs is less than the target volume `s`, in which case it prints `-1`. If the total volume is sufficient, it tries to pour the target volume `s` by taking liters from the kegs while keeping the minimum keg volume as high as possible.

The code sorts the volumes of the kegs in ascending order, so it can easily find the minimum keg volume. It then iterates over the kegs, taking liters from each keg if possible without decreasing the minimum keg volume. If it cannot take liters from a keg without decreasing the minimum keg volume, it breaks the loop and adjusts the minimum keg volume to account for the remaining liters that need to be taken.

The code correctly handles all edge cases, including when the total volume of all kegs is less than the target volume `s`, when the target volume `s` is greater than or equal to the total volume of all kegs, and when the target volume `s` can be poured by taking liters from the kegs without decreasing the minimum keg volume.

The program also correctly handles the case when the remaining liters that need to be taken after the loop is greater than 0, by subtracting `(remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n` from the minimum keg volume. This ensures that the minimum keg volume is decreased by the smallest possible amount to accommodate the remaining liters.

Overall, the code is well-structured, efficient, and correctly handles all potential cases, making it a correct solution to the problem.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^3, s is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= s <= 10^12, and v_i is a list of n non-negative integers such that 1 <= v_i <= 10^9 for each i.
def func():
    n, s = map(int, input().split())
    volumes = list(map(int, input().split()))
    volumes.sort()
    total_volume = sum(volumes)
    if (total_volume < s) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        min_keg_volume = volumes[0]
        remaining_kvass = s
        for i in range(n):
            if volumes[i] <= min_keg_volume:
                continue
            else:
                possible_to_take = min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)
                remaining_kvass -= possible_to_take
            
            if remaining_kvass == 0:
                break
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `v_i` is a list of n non-negative integers, `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `total_volume` is equal to the sum of all elements in `volumes`, `total_volume` is greater than or equal to the original value of `s`, `min_keg_volume` is equal to `volumes[0]`, `i` is `n-1` if `n` is greater than 0, `remaining_kvass` is between 0 and the original value of `s` (inclusive), depending on how much kvass was distributed.
        if (remaining_kvass > 0) :
            min_keg_volume -= (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n
        #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `v_i` is a list of n non-negative integers, `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `total_volume` equals the sum of all elements in `volumes` and is greater than or equal to `s`, `min_keg_volume` equals `volumes[0]` if `remaining_kvass` is 0, otherwise `min_keg_volume` equals `volumes[0] - (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n`, `i` is `n-1` if `n` is greater than 0, and `remaining_kvass` is between 0 and the original value of `s` (inclusive).
        print(min_keg_volume)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `v_i` is a list of n non-negative integers such that 1 <= v_i <= 10^9 for each i, `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, and `total_volume` is equal to the sum of all elements in `volumes`. If `total_volume` is less than `s`, then -1 has been printed. Otherwise, `min_keg_volume` equals `volumes[0]` if `remaining_kvass` is 0, otherwise `min_keg_volume` equals `volumes[0] - (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n`, `i` is `n-1` if `n` is greater than 0, `remaining_kvass` is between 0 and the original value of `s` (inclusive), and `min_keg_volume` has been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts parameters n and s, and a list v_i, calculates the total volume of all kegs, and if the total volume is less than s, prints -1; otherwise, it calculates the minimum keg volume that can be used to fill n kegs with a total volume of at least s, considering the case where there is remaining kvass after filling all kegs, and prints this minimum keg volume.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
