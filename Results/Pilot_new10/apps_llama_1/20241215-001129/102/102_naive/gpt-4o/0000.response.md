Correctness: **True**

The given program is designed to determine if it's possible to buy a certain amount of bottles of Ber-Cola and Bars bars with a given amount of burles, such that the total cost equals the amount of burles. It checks every possible combination of buying bottles of Ber-Cola, ranging from 0 to the maximum number of bottles that can be bought with the given amount of burles, and then checks if the remaining amount of burles can be spent on buying Bars bars. 

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the case where it's impossible to spend the exact amount of burles on buying bottles of Ber-Cola and Bars bars. 

The provided code iterates over every possible number of bottles of Ber-Cola that can be bought, and then checks if the remaining amount can be divided evenly by the cost of a Bars bar. If such a combination is found, the program prints "YES" along with the number of bottles of Ber-Cola and Bars bars that should be bought. If no such combination is found after checking all possibilities, the program prints "NO". 

The program's logic is sound and it correctly handles all edge cases, including cases where one or both of the items cannot be bought, or where the amount of burles is not enough to buy any items. 

For example, if n = 7, a = 2, and b = 3, the program will correctly output "YES" and print the number of bottles of Ber-Cola and Bars bars that should be bought to spend exactly 7 burles (2 bottles of Ber-Cola and 1 Bars bar). 

Similarly, if n = 15, a = 4, and b = 8, the program will correctly output "NO" because there is no combination of buying bottles of Ber-Cola and Bars bars that will result in spending exactly 15 burles. 

The program's solution approach is efficient and it does not have any logical errors or edge cases that it does not handle. Therefore, the program is correct.
