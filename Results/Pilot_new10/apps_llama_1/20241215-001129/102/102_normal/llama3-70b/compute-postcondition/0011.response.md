To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10,000,000, `a` is a non-zero integer, `b` is an integer, `x` is 1, `y` is the integer part of `n` divided by `b`.

The code is: `y = (n - x * a) // b`.

Now, let's break it down:

- `x` is 1, so `x * a` equals `a`.
- The expression `n - x * a` then becomes `n - a`.
- The expression `(n - x * a) // b` becomes `(n - a) // b`, which is the integer part of `(n - a)` divided by `b`.
- `y` is updated to be this new value.

The states of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `x` are not changed by the code. Only `y` is updated.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10,000,000, `a` is a non-zero integer, `b` is an integer, `x` is 1, `y` is the integer part of `(n - a)` divided by `b`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10,000,000, `a` is a non-zero integer, `b` is an integer, `x` is 1, `y` is `(n - a) // b`**
