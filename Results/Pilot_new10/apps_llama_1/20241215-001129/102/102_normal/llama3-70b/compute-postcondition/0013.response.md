The code `print(x, y)` prints the values of `x` and `y`. The values of `x` and `y` are not changed by this statement, but the values of `x` and `y` are printed. The value of `x` is 1 and the value of `y` is `(n - a) // b`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 'YES' has been printed before this statement. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10,000,000, `a` is a non-zero integer, `b` is an integer, `x` is 1, `y` is `(n - a) // b`, 'YES' has been printed, and the values of `x` and `y` have been printed**
