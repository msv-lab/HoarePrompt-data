Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10,000,000, `a` is a non-zero integer, `b` is an integer, if `x * a + y * b` equals `n`, then `x` is 1, `y` is `(n - a) // b`, 'YES' has been printed along with the values of `x` and `y`, and the program has been terminated; otherwise, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition, with `x` being 1 and `y` being `(n - a) // b`***
