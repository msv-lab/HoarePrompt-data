The `exit()` function terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change, but the program stops executing. 'YES' has been printed, and `x` and `y` have been printed. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10,000,000, `a` is a non-zero integer, `b` is an integer, `x` is 2, `y` is `(n - 2 * a) // b`, 'YES' has been printed, `x` and `y` have been printed, and the program has terminated**
