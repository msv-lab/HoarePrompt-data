The code `a = int(input())` assigns an input integer value to `a`. The initial state specified that `n` is an input integer, and `a` and `b` are positive integers waiting to be read from the input. 

Given this, the value of `a` is now an input integer, and since `a` was specified to be a positive integer in the range 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 10,000,000, the new value of `a` will be within this range. 

The states of `n` and `b` are not directly affected by this code. Therefore, `n` remains an input integer, and `b` remains a positive integer in the range 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 10,000,000 waiting to be read from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a positive input integer in the range 1 to 10,000,000, `b` is a positive integer in the range 1 to 10,000,000 waiting to be read from the input**
