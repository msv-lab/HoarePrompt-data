Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a positive input integer in the range 1 to 10,000,000, `b` is an input integer in the range 1 to 10,000,000, `x` is initially 0. The current value of `x` is still 0, and the expression `n - x * a` is a multiple of `b`, meaning `n` is a multiple of `b` since `x` is 0, or `n` equals `b` times an integer.**
