Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the required functionality as per the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input, which is in line with the problem description.

2. **Loop Iteration**: The program iterates over all possible non-negative integer values of `x` (the number of bottles of Ber-Cola) up to `n // a`. This is a safe upper bound because buying more than `n // a` bottles of Ber-Cola would exceed the total budget `n`.

3. **Condition Check**: Inside the loop, the program checks if the remaining amount `(n - x * a)` can be exactly divided by `b` (the cost of one Bars bar). If this condition is met, it means that Vasya can spend exactly `n` burles by buying `x` bottles of Ber-Cola and `y` Bars bars.

4. **Printing Result**: If a valid combination of `x` and `y` is found, the program prints "YES" followed by the values of `x` and `y` and then returns. This meets the problem description's requirements for output.

5. **Handling No Solution**: If the loop completes without finding a valid combination of `x` and `y`, the program prints "NO", indicating that it's impossible to spend exactly `n` burles. This also aligns with the problem description.

The program's logic ensures that it covers all possible non-negative integer combinations of `x` and `y` that could sum up to `n` given the costs `a` and `b`. Therefore, it correctly implements the required functionality as per the problem description. 

This program does what the problem description asks for all potential cases because of the loop that checks every possible number of bottles of Ber-Cola (`x`) up to `n // a`, and for each `x`, it checks whether there exists a number of Bars bars (`y`) such that `x*a + y*b = n`. This exhaustive check ensures that if there exists any combination of `x` and `y` that satisfies the equation, the program will find and print it. If no such combination is found after checking all possibilities, the program correctly concludes that it's impossible to spend exactly `n` burles and prints "NO".
