You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has n burles. One bottle of Ber-Cola costs a burles and one Bars bar costs b burles. He can buy any non-negative integer number of bottles of Ber-Cola and any non-negative integer number of Bars bars.

Find out if it's possible to buy some amount of bottles of Ber-Cola and Bars bars and spend exactly n burles.

In other words, you should find two non-negative integers x and y such that Vasya can buy x bottles of Ber-Cola and y Bars bars and x·a + y·b = n or tell that it's impossible.


-----Input-----

First line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10 000 000) — amount of money, that Vasya has.

Second line contains single integer a (1 ≤ a ≤ 10 000 000) — cost of one bottle of Ber-Cola.

Third line contains single integer b (1 ≤ b ≤ 10 000 000) — cost of one Bars bar.


-----Output-----

If Vasya can't buy Bars and Ber-Cola in such a way to spend exactly n burles print «NO» (without quotes).

Otherwise in first line print «YES» (without quotes). In second line print two non-negative integers x and y — number of bottles of Ber-Cola and number of Bars bars Vasya should buy in order to spend exactly n burles, i.e. x·a + y·b = n. If there are multiple answers print any of them.

Any of numbers x and y can be equal 0.

-----Note-----

In first example Vasya can buy two bottles of Ber-Cola and one Bars bar. He will spend exactly 2·2 + 1·3 = 7 burles.

In second example Vasya can spend exactly n burles multiple ways:   buy two bottles of Ber-Cola and five Bars bars;  buy four bottles of Ber-Cola and don't buy Bars bars;  don't buy Ber-Cola and buy 10 Bars bars. 

In third example it's impossible to but Ber-Cola and Bars bars in order to spend exactly n burles.
Program:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    for x in range(n // a + 1):
        if (n - x * a) % b == 0:
            y = (n - x * a) // b
            print('YES')
            print(x, y)
            return
    print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given program is designed to determine if it's possible to buy a certain amount of bottles of Ber-Cola and Bars bars with a given amount of burles, such that the total cost equals the amount of burles. It checks every possible combination of buying bottles of Ber-Cola, ranging from 0 to the maximum number of bottles that can be bought with the given amount of burles, and then checks if the remaining amount of burles can be spent on buying Bars bars. 

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the case where it's impossible to spend the exact amount of burles on buying bottles of Ber-Cola and Bars bars. 

The provided code iterates over every possible number of bottles of Ber-Cola that can be bought, and then checks if the remaining amount can be divided evenly by the cost of a Bars bar. If such a combination is found, the program prints "YES" along with the number of bottles of Ber-Cola and Bars bars that should be bought. If no such combination is found after checking all possibilities, the program prints "NO". 

The program's logic is sound and it correctly handles all edge cases, including cases where one or both of the items cannot be bought, or where the amount of burles is not enough to buy any items. 

For example, if n = 7, a = 2, and b = 3, the program will correctly output "YES" and print the number of bottles of Ber-Cola and Bars bars that should be bought to spend exactly 7 burles (2 bottles of Ber-Cola and 1 Bars bar). 

Similarly, if n = 15, a = 4, and b = 8, the program will correctly output "NO" because there is no combination of buying bottles of Ber-Cola and Bars bars that will result in spending exactly 15 burles. 

The program's solution approach is efficient and it does not have any logical errors or edge cases that it does not handle. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function reads three integers n, a, and b from the input, attempts to find integer values x and y such that n = a*x + b*y, and prints "YES" along with the values of x and y if such a combination exists; otherwise, it prints "NO". The function handles all positive integers n, a, and b but may behave unexpectedly with zero or negative inputs and does not enforce the specified upper limit of 10,000,000 for n, a, and b. After executing, the function returns None. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
