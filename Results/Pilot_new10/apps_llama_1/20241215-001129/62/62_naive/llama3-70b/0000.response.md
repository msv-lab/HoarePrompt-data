Correctness: **True**

The program correctly compares two numbers represented in different bases. It first reads the input, which includes the number of digits and the base for each number. Then it reads the digits of each number. The `func_1` function converts each number from its respective base to decimal. This is done by iterating over the digits from left to right, multiplying the current result by the base and adding the current digit. Finally, it compares the two decimal numbers and prints the result.

The program handles all possible cases correctly. It can handle numbers with different numbers of digits and different bases. It also correctly handles the cases where the numbers are equal, less than, or greater than each other. The provided examples in the problem description also support the correctness of the program.

The conversion function `func_1` is also correct, as it uses the standard method for converting a number from any base to decimal. The use of the `map` function to read the input and the `list` function to store the digits is also correct and efficient.

In general, the program is well-structured and easy to understand, making it easier to verify its correctness. After analyzing the program and the problem description, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
