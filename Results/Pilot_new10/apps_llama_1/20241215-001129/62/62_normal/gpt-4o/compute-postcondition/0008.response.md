The `decimal_value` is the decimal equivalent of the number represented by the original list `digits` in base `base`. Given that `digits` is a list of non-negative integers, each less than `base`, and `base` is an integer between 2 and 40 (inclusive), the program returns the decimal equivalent of the base `base` number represented by `digits`.

Output State: **The program returns the decimal equivalent of the number represented by the list `digits` in base `base`, where `base` is an integer between 2 and 40 (inclusive) and `digits` is a list of non-negative integers each less than `base`.**
