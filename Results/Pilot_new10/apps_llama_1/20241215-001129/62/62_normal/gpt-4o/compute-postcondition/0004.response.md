The given code line updates the `decimal_value` by multiplying its current value by `base` and adding the value of `digit`. 

Since `decimal_value` is initially equal to the second digit in `digits` and `digit` is also the second digit in `digits`, we can say that `decimal_value` is initially equal to `digit`.

After the execution of the given code, `decimal_value` becomes `decimal_value * base + digit`. Since `decimal_value` is initially equal to `digit`, we can rewrite this as `digit * base + digit`. 

This can be further simplified to `digit * (base + 1)`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `digits` is a list with at least two non-negative integers, each less than `base`, `base` is an integer between 2 and 40 (inclusive), `decimal_value` is equal to `digit * (base + 1)`, and `digit` is the second digit in `digits`.

Output State: **`digits` is a list with at least two non-negative integers, each less than `base`, `base` is an integer between 2 and 40 (inclusive), `decimal_value` is equal to `digit * (base + 1)`, and `digit` is the second digit in `digits`.**
