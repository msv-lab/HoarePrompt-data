The original assessment is correct. The provided code accurately implements the conversion of numbers from different bases to decimal and compares them as per the problem description. 

The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly calculates the decimal equivalent of a number represented in a given base, and the main part of the program correctly reads the input, converts the numbers to decimal, and compares them.

The annotations also highlight that the function `func_1` does not perform any error checking or handling, but since we assume that the input will be valid, this does not affect the correctness of the program.

The key to the program's correctness is the accurate conversion of numbers from their respective bases to decimal, which allows for a straightforward comparison. Since the conversion and comparison are correctly implemented, the program should work as expected for all valid inputs within the specified constraints.

Final: **True**
