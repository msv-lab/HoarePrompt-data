Correctness: **True**

The code provided appears to correctly implement the problem description. It reads in the number of digits and base for two numbers X and Y, then converts each number from its respective base to decimal using the function `func_1`. The function `func_1` works by iterating over each digit in the input list, multiplying the current result by the base, and adding the current digit. This effectively converts the base `base` number represented by `digits` to decimal.

The code then compares the decimal equivalents of X and Y, printing '<' if X is less than Y, '>' if X is greater than Y, and '=' if X is equal to Y.

The provided examples in the problem description all match the expected output of the code. Additionally, the output hints suggest that the function `func_1` correctly handles cases where `digits` is empty (returning 0) and where `base` is outside the range 2-40 or `digits` contains negative integers (although these cases may not produce accurate results).

The only potential edge cases that could cause issues are:

* If `digits` contains negative integers or integers greater than or equal to `base`, the conversion to decimal will be incorrect.
* If `base` is less than 2, the conversion to decimal will be incorrect.

However, according to the problem description, the input digits are guaranteed to be non-negative and less than the base, and the base is guaranteed to be between 2 and 40. Therefore, the code should work correctly for all valid inputs. 

It's worth noting that the code does not include any error checking to handle invalid inputs. If invalid inputs are possible, additional checks should be added to handle these cases. But based on the problem description, the code is correct.
