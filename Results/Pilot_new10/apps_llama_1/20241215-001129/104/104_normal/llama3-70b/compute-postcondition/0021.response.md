To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

Initial State: 
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0
- `a` is a list of input integers
- `i` is less than `n`
- `j` is `i + 2`

Given Code:
```python
max_erase = max(max_erase, j - i - 1)
```

From the initial state, we know `j = i + 2`. Thus, `j - i - 1` simplifies to `(i + 2) - i - 1 = 1`.

The code updates `max_erase` to be the maximum of its current value and `j - i - 1`, which we've determined is `1`. 

However, without knowing the initial value of `max_erase`, we can't determine its exact value after the update. If `max_erase` was less than `1`, it will be updated to `1`. If `max_erase` was already `1` or greater, its value won't change.

The states of `n`, `a`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by the code. `n` remains an input integer greater than 0, `a` remains a list of input integers, `i` remains less than `n`, and `j` remains equal to `i + 2`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of input integers, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i + 2`, and `max_erase` is the maximum of its previous value and `1`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of input integers, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i + 2`, and `max_erase` is the maximum of its previous value and `1`.**
