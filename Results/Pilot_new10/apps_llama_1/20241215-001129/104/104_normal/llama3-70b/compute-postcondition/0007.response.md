Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of input integers, `i` is 0, `j` will range from 1 to `n`. If all elements in the sublist `a[i:j]` form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1, then `max_erase` is updated to `j - i - 1` if `j - i - 1` is greater than 0, otherwise `max_erase` remains 0.***
