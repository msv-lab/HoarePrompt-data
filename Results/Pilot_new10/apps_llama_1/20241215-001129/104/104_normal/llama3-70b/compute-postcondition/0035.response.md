According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i + 2`, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is `i + 3` and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than `i + 3` (or `j` must be less than `n + 1`).
State: **`n` is an input integer greater than `i + 3`, `a` is a list of input integers, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `j` is `i + 3`**
