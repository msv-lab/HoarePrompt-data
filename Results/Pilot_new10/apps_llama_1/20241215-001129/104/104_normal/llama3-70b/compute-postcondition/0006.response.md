The value of `max_erase` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `j - i - 1`. Since `i` is 0 and `j` ranges from 1 to `n`, `j - i - 1` ranges from 0 to `n - 1`. The initial value of `max_erase` is 0. 

Given that `j` ranges from 1 to `n` and the list `a` from index `i` to `j` forms an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1, the maximum possible value of `j - i - 1` would be `n - 1` when `j` equals `n` and `i` equals 0.

Therefore, `max_erase` is updated to be the maximum of 0 and `j - i - 1`, which means `max_erase` becomes `j - i - 1` when `j - i - 1` is greater than 0.

The other variables `n`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of input integers, `max_erase` is `j - i - 1` when `j - i - 1` > 0, otherwise it remains 0, `i` is 0, `j` will range from 1 to `n`.**
