Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of input integers, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i + 2`, and if all elements in the list `a` from index `i` to `j` are in arithmetic progression (i.e., `a[k] - a[i] == k - i` for all `k` in range `i` to `j`), then `max_erase` is the maximum of its previous value and `1`; otherwise, the state of `max_erase` remains unchanged.**
