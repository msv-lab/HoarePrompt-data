To solve this problem, we need to consider the initial state and the given code. The initial state is: `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of input integers, `i` is 0, `j` is `n + 1`. The code is: `max_erase = max(max_erase, j - i - 1)`. 

Given that `j` is `n + 1` and `i` is 0, we calculate `j - i - 1` as `(n + 1) - 0 - 1`, which simplifies to `n`. 

However, the initial state does not specify the value of `max_erase`. Since we do not know the initial value of `max_erase`, we cannot determine its exact value after the code is executed. We only know that `max_erase` will be the maximum of its current value (unknown) and `n`.

The states of `n`, `a`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of input integers, `i` is 0, `j` is `n + 1`, `max_erase` is the maximum of its previous value and `n`.**
