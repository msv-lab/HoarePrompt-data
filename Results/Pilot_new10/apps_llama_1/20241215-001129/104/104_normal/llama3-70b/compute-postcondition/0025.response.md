Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 0 and greater than `i + 2`, `a` is a list of input integers, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `j` is `i + 3`. If all elements in the list `a` from index `i` to `j` are in an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1, then `max_erase` is at least `2`.***
