Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than `i + 3`, `a` is a list of input integers, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `j` is `i + 3`. If all elements in the list `a` from index `i` to `j` are in an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1, then `max_erase` is the maximum of its previous value and 2.***
