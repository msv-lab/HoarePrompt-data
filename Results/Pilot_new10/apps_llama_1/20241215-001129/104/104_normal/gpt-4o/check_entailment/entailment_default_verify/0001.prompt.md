You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: JATC and his friend Giraffe are currently in their room, solving some problems. Giraffe has written on the board an array $a_1$, $a_2$, ..., $a_n$ of integers, such that $1 \le a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n \le 10^3$, and then went to the bathroom.

JATC decided to prank his friend by erasing some consecutive elements in the array. Since he doesn't want for the prank to go too far, he will only erase in a way, such that Giraffe can still restore the array using the information from the remaining elements. Because Giraffe has created the array, he's also aware that it's an increasing array and all the elements are integers in the range $[1, 10^3]$.

JATC wonders what is the greatest number of elements he can erase?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 100$) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_i$ ($1 \le a_1<a_2<\dots<a_n \le 10^3$) — the array written by Giraffe.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the maximum number of consecutive elements in the array that JATC can erase.

If it is impossible to erase even a single element, print $0$.


-----Examples-----
Input
6
1 3 4 5 6 9

Output
2
Input
3
998 999 1000

Output
2
Input
5
1 2 3 4 5

Output
4


-----Note-----

In the first example, JATC can erase the third and fourth elements, leaving the array $[1, 3, \_, \_, 6, 9]$. As you can see, there is only one way to fill in the blanks.

In the second example, JATC can erase the second and the third elements. The array will become $[998, \_, \_]$. Because all the elements are less than or equal to $1000$, the array is still can be restored. Note, that he can't erase the first $2$ elements.

In the third example, JATC can erase the first $4$ elements. Since all the elements are greater than or equal to $1$, Giraffe can still restore the array. Note, that he can't erase the last $4$ elements.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_erase = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_erase = max(max_erase, a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1)
    print(max_erase)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given program does not work correctly for all potential cases. It tries to find the maximum number of consecutive elements that can be erased from the array, but it only considers the differences between adjacent elements. This approach is not correct because it does not take into account the boundary conditions, such as when the erased elements are at the beginning or the end of the array.

For example, consider the input array [1, 1000]. According to the problem description, JATC can erase the first element (1), leaving the array [_, 1000]. Since all elements are less than or equal to 1000, Giraffe can still restore the array. However, the program will output 0 because the difference between the adjacent elements is 999, which is not considered as a valid erase operation.

A correct approach would be to consider all possible erase operations and check if the remaining elements can still restore the original array. This would involve checking for each possible erase operation if the remaining elements can still be restored to their original values, taking into account the boundary conditions. The given program does not do this and therefore does not work correctly for all potential cases. 

One potential fix for this could be iterating through all possible subarrays and checking if erasing that subarray would allow for a unique restoration of the original array. 

Here's an example of how this could be implemented:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_erase = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            subarray = a[:i] + a[j:]
            if subarray and can_restore(subarray, a[i:j]):
                max_erase = max(max_erase, j - i)
            if not subarray and can_restore_empty(a[i:j]):
                max_erase = max(max_erase, j - i)
    print(max_erase)

def can_restore(subarray, erased):
    if not subarray:
        return can_restore_empty(erased)
    if len(subarray) == 1:
        start = 1
        end = 1000
        if subarray[0]!= 1:
            start = subarray[0] - (len(erased) - 1)
        if subarray[0]!= 1000:
            end = subarray[0] + (len(erased) - 1)
        return start <= end and len(set(range(start, end + 1))) == len(set(erased))
    else:
        start = 1
        end = 1000
        if subarray[0]!= 1:
            start = subarray[0] - (erased[0] - subarray[0])
        if subarray[-1]!= 1000:
            end = subarray[-1] + (subarray[-1] - erased[-1])
        return start <= end and len(set(range(start, end + 1))) == len(set(erased))

def can_restore_empty(erased):
    start = 1
    end = 1000
    if erased[0]!= 1:
        start = erased[0] - (len(erased) - 1)
    if erased[-1]!= 1000:
        end = erased[-1] + (len(erased) - 1)
    return start <= end and len(set(range(start, end + 1))) == len(set(erased))
```

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a sequence of integers representing an array size n and its elements a, calculates the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in a minus 1, and prints this value as the result, handling potential edge cases such as arrays with one or zero elements, and arrays with duplicate or negative elements. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
