According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Since `i` is now 2, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is an input integer that must be at least 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a1 < a2 <... < an ≤ 10^3, `max_erase` is `a[1] - a[0] - 1`, `i` is 2**
