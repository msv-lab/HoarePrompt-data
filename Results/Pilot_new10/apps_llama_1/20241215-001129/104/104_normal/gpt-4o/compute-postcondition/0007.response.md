According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 3, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`n` is an input integer that must be at least 4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a1 < a2 <... < an ≤ 10^3, `max_erase` is the maximum of `a[1] - a[0] - 1` and `a[2] - a[1] - 1`, `i` is 3**
