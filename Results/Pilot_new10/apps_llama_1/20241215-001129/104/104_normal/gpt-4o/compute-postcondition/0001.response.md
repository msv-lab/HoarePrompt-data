The given code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a sequence of integers from the input, converts them to integers, and stores them in a list `a`. 

The initial state mentions that the input to the function is a sequence of integers, where `n` is an input integer representing the number of elements in the array (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and the next `n` integers are the elements of the array `a` (1 ≤ a1 < a2 <... < an ≤ 10^3).

However, the code does not explicitly read the value of `n`. Instead, it directly reads the elements of the array `a` from the input.

So, after the code is executed, `a` is a list of `n` integers, where `n` is known from the problem description, and the elements of `a` are a sequence of integers as per the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of elements in the array, `a` is a list of `n` integers, where 1 ≤ a1 < a2 <... < an ≤ 10^3.**
