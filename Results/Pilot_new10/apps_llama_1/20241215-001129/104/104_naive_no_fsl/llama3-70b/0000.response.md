Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem requires that JATC erases consecutive elements in a way that Giraffe can still restore the array using the information from the remaining elements. However, the code does not correctly implement this condition.

The issue with the code lies in the fact that it checks for a sequence of equal intervals between consecutive elements, which is not the correct condition for determining if the erased elements can be restored. The correct condition should consider whether the remaining elements can uniquely determine the original array.

For example, consider the input:

```
5
1 3 4 100 1000
```

In this case, the code will output `1` because it checks for sequences of consecutive elements with equal intervals. However, the correct answer should be `2` because JATC can erase the second and third elements (or the first and second elements), and Giraffe can still restore the array.

This case shows that the code does not work as expected, and therefore its correctness is **False**.
