Correctness: **True**.

The program given correctly follows the problem description and calculates the maximum value among the 12 given expressions, then prints the corresponding expression.

The code defines the 12 expressions as `a1` through `a12`, stores them in a list `a`, and their corresponding string representations in a list `b`. It then uses the `max()` function to find the maximum value in the list `a`, finds the index of this maximum value using `a.index(max(a))`, and prints the string representation of this expression from list `b`.

Since the problem description requires finding the maximum value among these expressions and printing the corresponding string representation, and the code correctly implements this, I could not find a case where the program does not work as expected. The code handles all potential cases by calculating and comparing all 12 expressions, and it handles cases of multiple maximums by printing the one that comes first in the list.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct and will work as expected for all inputs.
