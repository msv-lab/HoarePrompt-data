The function `func_1` accepts no parameters and processes an input string of three space-separated real numbers `x`, `y`, and `z` from the standard input. The numbers are expected to be in the format of having exactly one digit after the decimal point and within the range of 0.1 to 200.0. However, there is no validation or handling for cases where the input format or range does not match these expectations.

The function calculates twelve different expressions involving exponentiation of `x`, `y`, and `z` in various orders and identifies the expression that results in the maximum value. It then prints out the string representation of the expression that yielded this maximum value.

Given the code, potential edge cases include:

- Handling of invalid input formats (e.g., less or more than one decimal place, non-numeric input, or not exactly three space-separated numbers).
- Handling of values outside the specified range (0.1 to 200.0), which could lead to unexpected results or potential errors in the exponentiation operations.
- The possibility of two or more expressions resulting in the same maximum value is not addressed; the function will print one of the corresponding expressions, but which one is not specified.

The functionality of the function, therefore, encompasses not only the calculation and identification of the maximum exponentiation expression value but also the implicit assumption of well-formed input and the potential for unhandled edge cases.

Functionality: ** The function accepts an input string of three space-separated real numbers from the standard input, calculates twelve different exponentiation expressions, and prints the string representation of the expression that results in the maximum value, assuming the input is well-formed and within a specified range, without explicit handling for potential edge cases such as invalid input formats or out-of-range values. **
