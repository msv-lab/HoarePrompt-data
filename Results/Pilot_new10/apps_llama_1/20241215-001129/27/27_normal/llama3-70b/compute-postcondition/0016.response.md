The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the given constraints, it is clear that the function is expected to operate on a list of three space-separated real numbers x, y, and z. 
x, y, and z are real numbers where 0.1 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 200.0, and each of x, y, and z has exactly one digit after the decimal point.

Since the problem description does not specify the output, we cannot determine the return value of the function.


Functionality: **The function operates on a list of three real numbers x, y, and z with the given constraints, but the return value is unspecified.**
