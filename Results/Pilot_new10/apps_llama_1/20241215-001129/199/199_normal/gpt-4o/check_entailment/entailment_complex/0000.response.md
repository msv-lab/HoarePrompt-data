Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly follow the problem description. 

The problem asks for the number of ways to split a stick of length `n` into four parts such that it is possible to form a rectangle but not a square. A rectangle can be formed by two pairs of equal lengths, while a square requires four equal lengths.

However, the program only checks for one possible way to form a rectangle, where two pairs of equal lengths `a` and `b` (which are always equal in the program) exist, and the remaining length `rem` is also paired. It does not consider all possible ways to split the stick into four parts.

For example, consider the case where `n = 10`. The program would only check the cases where `a = b` and `rem` is even, but it would not consider the case where `a = 1`, `b = 3`, `c = 1`, and `d = 5`, which also forms a rectangle but not a square.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should iterate over all possible ways to split the stick into four parts and check if each way forms a rectangle but not a square. The current program does not achieve this and therefore does not correctly follow the problem description. 

Additionally, the loop variable `b` is always equal to `a`, which means that the program is only considering the cases where two pairs of equal lengths exist, and the remaining length is also paired. The program should consider all possible values of `b` and not just `a`. 

To fix the program, we would need to modify it to consider all possible ways to split the stick into four parts and check if each way forms a rectangle but not a square. 

Here is a modified version of the program in python:
```python
def func_1(n):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 4 + 1):
        for b in range(a, (n - 2 * a) // 2 + 1):
            if n - 2 * a - 2 * b > 0:
                count += 1
    return count

n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))
```
This version of the program considers all possible ways to split the stick into four parts and checks if each way forms a rectangle but not a square.
