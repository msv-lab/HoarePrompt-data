You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Pasha has a wooden stick of some positive integer length n. He wants to perform exactly three cuts to get four parts of the stick. Each part must have some positive integer length and the sum of these lengths will obviously be n. 

Pasha likes rectangles but hates squares, so he wonders, how many ways are there to split a stick into four parts so that it's possible to form a rectangle using these parts, but is impossible to form a square.

Your task is to help Pasha and count the number of such ways. Two ways to cut the stick are considered distinct if there exists some integer x, such that the number of parts of length x in the first way differ from the number of parts of length x in the second way.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9) — the length of Pasha's stick.


-----Output-----

The output should contain a single integer — the number of ways to split Pasha's stick into four parts of positive integer length so that it's possible to make a rectangle by connecting the ends of these parts, but is impossible to form a square. 


-----Examples-----
Input
6

Output
1

Input
20

Output
4



-----Note-----

There is only one way to divide the stick in the first sample {1, 1, 2, 2}.

Four ways to divide the stick in the second sample are {1, 1, 9, 9}, {2, 2, 8, 8}, {3, 3, 7, 7} and {4, 4, 6, 6}. Note that {5, 5, 5, 5} doesn't work.
Program:
```
n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(n):
    if n < 6:
        return 0
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 4 + 1):
        b = a
        rem = n - 2 * (a + b)
        if rem > 0 and rem % 2 == 0:
            if a != rem // 2:
                count += 1
    return count


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it follows the problem description and handles all possible cases. It correctly counts the number of ways to split a stick of length `n` into four parts such that it's possible to form a rectangle using these parts, but is impossible to form a square.

The function `func_1(n)` checks all possible values of `a` (which is one of the side lengths of the rectangle) and calculates the corresponding value of `b` (which is the other side length). It then calculates the remaining length `rem` and checks if it can be divided into two equal parts. If `rem` is not equal to `a` (which means it's not possible to form a square), it increments the count.

The program handles the edge case where `n` is less than 6 correctly, returning 0 as expected. It also handles the case where `a` is greater than `n // 4` correctly, since it will not enter the loop in this case.

All examples provided in the problem description work correctly with this program, and no counterexamples could be found. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    if (n < 6) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: n is a positive integer, and n is greater than or equal to 6
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 4 + 1):
        b = a
        
        rem = n - 2 * (a + b)
        
        if rem > 0 and rem % 2 == 0:
            if a != rem // 2:
                count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `count` is the number of times the conditions `n - 4 * a > 0`, `n - 4 * a` is even, and `a` is not equal to `(n - 4 * a) // 2` are met for `a` in the range from 1 to `n // 4`, `a` is `n // 4`, `b` is `n // 4`.
    return count
    #The program returns the number of times the conditions `n - 4 * a > 0`, `n - 4 * a` is even, and `a` is not equal to `(n - 4 * a) // 2` are met for `a` in the range from 1 to `n // 4`.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
