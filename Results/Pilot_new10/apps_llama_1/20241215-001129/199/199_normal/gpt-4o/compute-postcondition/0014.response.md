To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

Initial State: 
- `n` is greater than or equal to 8
- `rem` is `n - 4`
- `a` is 2
- `b` is 2

Given code:
```python
rem = n - 2 * (a + b)
```

Now, substitute the values of `a` and `b` into the equation:
```python
rem = n - 2 * (2 + 2)
rem = n - 2 * 4
rem = n - 8
```

So, the value of `rem` is updated to `n - 8`. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 8, `rem` is `n - 8`, `a` is 2, `b` is 2**
