To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop statement:

```python
for a in range(1, n // 4 + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop iterates over a range from 1 to `n // 4 + 1`. For this loop to execute at least once, `n // 4 + 1` must be greater than 1, which implies that `n // 4` must be at least 1. Therefore, `n` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute.

Given that `n` is a positive integer and `n` is greater than or equal to 6, we know that `n` meets the condition for the loop to execute. 

At the start of the loop, `a` will be 1 because the range starts from 1.

So, for the loop to be executed, `n` must be at least 4 (which is already guaranteed since `n` is greater than or equal to 6), `a` is 1, and `count` remains 0 as it is not affected by the loop condition.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 6, `count` is 0, `a` is 1**
