According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `a`, `b`, and `n`. The loop iterates over the range from `a` to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer greater than 8, `a` is 2, `b` is 3. For the loop to execute again, `b` must be incremented by 1. So, `b` becomes 4. The loop will execute again if `b` is less than or equal to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`. Since `a` is 2 and `n` is greater than 8, `(n - a) // 2 + 1` will be greater than 3, so the loop can execute again with `b` equal to 4.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 8, `a` is 2, `b` is 4, `ways` remains unchanged unless `a` is not equal to `b` and 2 times the sum of `a` and `b` equals `n`**
