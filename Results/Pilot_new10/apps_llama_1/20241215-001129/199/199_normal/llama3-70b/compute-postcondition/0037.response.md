To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given loop code and the provided output states for the first few iterations.

The loop code is:
```python
for a in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
    for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
        if a!= b and 2 * (a + b) == n:
            ways += 1
```
The loop iterates over possible values of `a` and `b` such that `a` is in the range from 1 to `n // 2` (inclusive), and `b` is in the range from `a` to `(n - a) // 2` (inclusive). It checks if `a` is not equal to `b` and if the sum of `a` and `b` multiplied by 2 equals `n`. If both conditions are met, it increments `ways` by 1.

The initial state is: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, and `ways` is 0.

After analyzing the loop code and the provided output states for the first few iterations, we can see that `ways` will be incremented for each pair of `(a, b)` that satisfies the condition `2 * (a + b) == n`, where `a` and `b` are in their respective ranges and `a` is not equal to `b`.

When the loop finishes, `a` will be the last value it took in the outer loop, which is `n // 2`, and `b` will be the last value it took in the inner loop, which depends on `a` and `n`. However, these values are not of primary interest for determining the final state regarding `ways`.

The key observation is that `ways` will accumulate the count of all valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the given conditions for the entire range of `a` and `b` as defined by the loop.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop have finished:
- `n` remains a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, as its value does not change within the loop.
- `ways` will hold the total count of pairs `(a, b)` where `a` and `b` are in their respective ranges, `a` is not equal to `b`, and `2 * (a + b)` equals `n`. This essentially counts the number of ways to express `n` as the sum of two different positive integers `a` and `b`, such that their sum multiplied by 2 equals `n`, within the given constraints.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, `ways` is the number of pairs of distinct positive integers `(a, b)` where `a` is in the range from 1 to `n // 2`, `b` is in the range from `a` to `(n - a) // 2`, and `2 * (a + b) == n`.**
