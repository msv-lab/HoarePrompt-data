The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` greater than or equal to 4. It calculates the number of pairs of distinct positive integers `(a, b)` where `a` is in the range from 1 to `n // 2`, `b` is in the range from `a` to `(n - a) // 2`, and `2 * (a + b) == n`. The code iterates over all possible values of `a` and `b` within the given ranges and checks if the condition `2 * (a + b) == n` is satisfied. If it is, the code increments the `ways` counter. The function then returns the total number of such pairs.

Upon closer inspection, it can be observed that the code does not account for cases where `n` is less than 4, as the loop conditions and the condition `2 * (a + b) == n` may not be well-defined in such cases. Additionally, the code does not handle non-integer or non-positive inputs for `n`. However, based on the given annotations and the code, it seems that the function is designed to work with positive integers `n` greater than or equal to 4.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` greater than or equal to 4 and returns the number of distinct positive integer pairs `(a, b)` where `a` is from 1 to `n//2`, `b` is from `a` to `(n-a)//2`, and `2*(a+b)` equals `n`, or returns 0 if no such pairs exist, and may not be well-defined for `n` less than 4 or for non-integer or non-positive inputs **
