Correctness: **True**.

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description. It correctly counts the number of ways to split a stick into four parts so that it's possible to form a rectangle using these parts, but is impossible to form a square.

The program works by iterating over all possible pairs of lengths `(a, b)` for the sides of the rectangle, with the condition that `a!= b` (to prevent forming a square) and `2 * (a + b) == n` (to ensure the total length of the stick is used). The program then counts the number of such pairs, which represents the number of ways to split the stick into four parts that can form a rectangle but not a square.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including cases where `n` is odd or even, and cases where there are no possible ways to split the stick into four parts that meet the conditions.

The given examples in the problem description are also handled correctly by the program. For example, when `n = 6`, the program outputs `1`, which is correct because there is only one way to divide the stick: `{1, 1, 2, 2}`. Similarly, when `n = 20`, the program outputs `4`, which is correct because there are four ways to divide the stick: `{1, 1, 9, 9}`, `{2, 2, 8, 8}`, `{3, 3, 7, 7}`, and `{4, 4, 6, 6}`.

Overall, the program is correct and handles all potential cases as described in the problem description.
