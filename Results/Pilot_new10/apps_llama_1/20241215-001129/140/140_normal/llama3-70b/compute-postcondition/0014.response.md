Postcondition: **the program returns True if `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` is True, where the current state of the graph has a node with at least 2 neighbors, the node has been visited as indicated by `visited[node]` being `True`, and the node is in the recursion stack as indicated by `rec_stack[node]` being `True`; otherwise, the program state remains unchanged with `node` being an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` being a dictionary or list representing the adjacency list of the directed graph, `visited` being a list or dictionary of boolean values, and `rec_stack` being a list or dictionary of boolean values.**
