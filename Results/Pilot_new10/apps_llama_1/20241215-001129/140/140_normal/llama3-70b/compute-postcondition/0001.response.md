The code `rec_stack[node] = True` sets the value of `rec_stack` for the given `node` to `True`. This indicates that the vertex represented by `node` is now in the recursion stack.

Output State: **`node` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary or list representing the adjacency list of the directed graph, `visited` is a list or dictionary of boolean values where `visited[node]` is `True`, and `rec_stack` is a list or dictionary of boolean values where `rec_stack[node]` is `True` and all other values remain unchanged**
