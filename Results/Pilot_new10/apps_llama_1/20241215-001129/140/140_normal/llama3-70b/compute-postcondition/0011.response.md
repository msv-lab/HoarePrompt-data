Postcondition: ***`node` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary or list representing the adjacency list of the directed graph where `node` is a key and has at least 1 neighbor, `visited` is a list or dictionary of boolean values where `visited[node]` is `True`, `rec_stack` is a list or dictionary of boolean values where `rec_stack[node]` is `True`, and `neighbor` is the first neighbor of `node` in the graph. If `visited[neighbor]` is `False`, then `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` returns `False`. If `visited[neighbor]` is `True`, then `rec_stack[neighbor]` is `False`.***
