Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully address the problem description. It checks if the graph contains a cycle and prints 'NO' if it does, and 'YES' otherwise. However, the problem asks to determine if the graph can be made acyclic by removing at most one edge. The code does not attempt to remove edges and check if the resulting graph is acyclic.

The code will incorrectly print 'NO' for graphs that contain a cycle but can be made acyclic by removing one edge. For example, in the first example given in the problem description, the code will print 'NO' because the graph contains a cycle, but it can be made acyclic by removing the edge 2 -> 3. 

To solve this problem correctly, we need to modify the code to check all possible edge removals and see if the resulting graph is acyclic. This would involve iterating over all edges, removing each one, and then performing a cycle detection algorithm. If the graph is acyclic after removing an edge, we can print 'YES'. If no such edge is found, we print 'NO'. 

Alternatively, we can use a more efficient algorithm that finds the minimum number of edge removals required to make the graph acyclic. This can be done using a strongly connected components algorithm and then finding the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to make the graph acyclic. 

Here is an example of how to modify the code to check all possible edge removals:

```python
def has_cycle(graph, visited, rec_stack, node):
    visited[node] = True
    rec_stack[node] = True
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        if not visited[neighbor]:
            if has_cycle(graph, visited, rec_stack, neighbor):
                return True
        elif rec_stack[neighbor]:
            return True
    rec_stack[node] = False
    return False

def is_acyclic(graph):
    visited = [False] * len(graph)
    rec_stack = [False] * len(graph)
    for node in range(len(graph)):
        if not visited[node]:
            if has_cycle(graph, visited, rec_stack, node):
                return False
    return True

def remove_edge_and_check(graph, u, v):
    graph[u] = [x for x in graph[u] if x!= v]
    if is_acyclic(graph):
        return True
    graph[u] = [x for x in graph[u] if x!= v] + [v]
    return False

def solve(n, m, edges):
    graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for u, v in edges:
        graph[u].append(v)

    if is_acyclic(graph):
        print('YES')
        return

    for u, v in edges:
        if remove_edge_and_check(graph, u, v):
            print('YES')
            return
    print('NO')

(n, m) = map(int, input().split())
edges = []
for _ in range(m):
    (u, v) = map(int, input().split())
    edges.append((u, v))

solve(n, m, edges)
