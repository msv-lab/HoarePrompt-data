You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a directed graph consisting of n vertices and m edges (each edge is directed, so it can be traversed in only one direction). You are allowed to remove at most one edge from it.

Can you make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge from it? A directed graph is called acyclic iff it doesn't contain any cycle (a non-empty path that starts and ends in the same vertex).


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 500, 1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)) — the number of vertices and the number of edges, respectively.

Then m lines follow. Each line contains two integers u and v denoting a directed edge going from vertex u to vertex v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v). Each ordered pair (u, v) is listed at most once (there is at most one directed edge from u to v).


-----Output-----

If it is possible to make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge, print YES. Otherwise, print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1

Output
YES

Input
5 6
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1
2 1
4 5

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example you can remove edge $2 \rightarrow 3$, and the graph becomes acyclic.

In the second example you have to remove at least two edges (for example, $2 \rightarrow 1$ and $2 \rightarrow 3$) in order to make the graph acyclic.
Program:
```
(n, m) = map(int, input().split())
graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
for _ in range(m):
    (u, v) = map(int, input().split())
    graph[u].append(v)
visited = [False] * (n + 1)
rec_stack = [False] * (n + 1)
has_cycle = False
for node in range(1, n + 1):
    if not visited[node]:
        if func_1(node, graph, visited, rec_stack):
            has_cycle = True
            break
if has_cycle:
    print('NO')
else:
    print('YES')

def func_1(node, graph, visited, rec_stack):
    visited[node] = True
    rec_stack[node] = True
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        if not visited[neighbor]:
            if func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack):
                return True
        elif rec_stack[neighbor]:
            return True
    rec_stack[node] = False
    return False


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given code checks if a directed graph contains a cycle and prints 'NO' if it does, and 'YES' otherwise. However, the question asks to check if it is possible to make the graph acyclic by removing at most one edge. The given code does not handle this correctly. It only checks if the original graph is acyclic.

For example, consider the case where there are two cycles in the graph, but both cycles share an edge. In this case, removing that shared edge would make the graph acyclic, but the given code would print 'NO' because it doesn't check the possibility of removing an edge.

Here is an example where the program does not work correctly:

Input:
```
4 4
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 1
```
In this case, the graph has a cycle (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1), but removing the edge 4 -> 1 makes it acyclic. However, the program will print 'NO' because it doesn't check the possibility of removing an edge to make the graph acyclic. 

To fix this, the program should check for all edges in the graph if removing them makes the graph acyclic, which is not implemented in the given code. 

Here is a simple example of what could be done instead:

```python
def has_cycle(graph, edge_to_remove):
    visited = [False] * len(graph)
    rec_stack = [False] * len(graph)

    def dfs(node):
        visited[node] = True
        rec_stack[node] = True
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if (node, neighbor) == edge_to_remove or (neighbor, node) == edge_to_remove:
                continue
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                if dfs(neighbor):
                    return True
            elif rec_stack[neighbor]:
                return True
        rec_stack[node] = False
        return False

    for node in range(len(graph)):
        if not visited[node]:
            if dfs(node):
                return True
    return False

def solve():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    edges = []
    for _ in range(m):
        (u, v) = map(int, input().split())
        u -= 1
        v -= 1
        graph[u].append(v)
        edges.append((u, v))

    for edge in edges:
        if not has_cycle(graph, edge):
            print("YES")
            return
    print("NO")

solve()
```

This code checks for all edges in the graph if removing them makes the graph acyclic, and prints 'YES' if it finds such an edge, and 'NO' otherwise.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a node and a directed graph, performs a depth-first search to detect cycles, and returns True if a cycle is found, False otherwise, assuming the input graph is valid and the node exists in the graph. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
