You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a directed graph consisting of n vertices and m edges (each edge is directed, so it can be traversed in only one direction). You are allowed to remove at most one edge from it.

Can you make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge from it? A directed graph is called acyclic iff it doesn't contain any cycle (a non-empty path that starts and ends in the same vertex).


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 500, 1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)) — the number of vertices and the number of edges, respectively.

Then m lines follow. Each line contains two integers u and v denoting a directed edge going from vertex u to vertex v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v). Each ordered pair (u, v) is listed at most once (there is at most one directed edge from u to v).


-----Output-----

If it is possible to make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge, print YES. Otherwise, print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1

Output
YES

Input
5 6
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1
2 1
4 5

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example you can remove edge $2 \rightarrow 3$, and the graph becomes acyclic.

In the second example you have to remove at least two edges (for example, $2 \rightarrow 1$ and $2 \rightarrow 3$) in order to make the graph acyclic.
Annotated Functions:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
m = int(data[1])
edges = [(int(data[i]), int(data[i + 1])) for i in range(2, len(data), 2)]
result = func_1(n, m, edges)
print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of vertices, m is an integer representing the number of edges, and edges is a list of tuples, where each tuple (u, v) represents a directed edge from vertex u to vertex v, and 1 <= u, v <= n, u!= v.
def func_1(n, m, edges):
    graph = defaultdict(list)

        graph[u].append(v)

The graph contains at least one cycle.
    for (u, v) in edges:
        graph[u].remove(v)
        
        if not has_cycle(graph):
            return 'YES'
        
        graph[u].append(v)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop step by step.
    #
    #1. **Loop Iteration**: For each edge `(u, v)` in the `edges` list, the loop removes `v` from the list of destination vertices of `u` in the graph, checks if the graph still has a cycle, and then appends `v` back to the list of destination vertices of `u` in the graph.
    #
    #2. **Effect of Iterations**:
    #   - `n` and `m`: These represent the number of vertices and edges, respectively. They do not change within the loop.
    #   - `edges`: This list of edges is iterated over but not modified in terms of its length or content. Each edge is processed once.
    #   - `u` and `v`: These variables take on the values of the source and destination vertices of each edge as the loop iterates over the `edges` list.
    #   - `graph`: The graph structure is temporarily modified (by removing and then adding back an edge) during each iteration, but at the end of each iteration, it returns to its original state (before the loop started) because `v` is appended back to `graph[u]`.
    #   - `has_cycle(graph)`: This function checks if the graph contains a cycle. The loop's behavior depends on this check, but since it's not the focus of determining the output state's variable values, we acknowledge its role in controlling the loop's flow but focus on variable states.
    #
    #3. **After All Iterations**:
    #   - `n` remains an integer representing the number of vertices.
    #   - `m` remains an integer representing the number of edges.
    #   - `edges` remains a list of tuples representing all edges.
    #   - `u` and `v` will hold the values of the source and destination vertices of the last edge processed.
    #   - `graph` returns to its original state after all iterations because each edge removed is added back.
    #
    #Considering the loop's behavior:
    #- If the graph does not contain a cycle after removing any edge, the function returns 'YES' and the loop does not continue.
    #- However, the question asks for the state after all iterations, implying we consider the scenario where the loop completes normally (without returning early) or when the conditions are such that it does not early return.
    #
    #**Output State**: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices, `m` is an integer representing the number of edges, `edges` is a list of tuples, `u` is the source vertex of the last edge, `v` is the destination vertex of the last edge, and `graph` is a defaultdict of lists representing the original graph structure with all edges intact, assuming no early return due to the absence of a cycle. If the graph originally contained at least one cycle, this characteristic is maintained unless an early return occurred.**
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns the string 'NO', indicating the presence of a cycle in the graph after all iterations have completed, with `n` being an integer representing the number of vertices, `m` being an integer representing the number of edges, `edges` being a list of tuples representing all edges, `u` being the source vertex of the last edge, `v` being the destination vertex of the last edge, and `graph` being a defaultdict of lists representing the original graph structure with all edges intact.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts parameters `n` (number of vertices), `m` (number of edges), and `edges` (list of directed edges), and returns 'YES' if the graph is cycle-free or if removing any single edge makes it cycle-free; otherwise, it returns 'NO', indicating the presence of a cycle that cannot be removed by deleting a single edge.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: graph is a dictionary representing a directed graph where each key is a node (integer), the value for each key is a list of its neighboring nodes (integers), and n is a positive integer representing the number of nodes in the graph such that 1 <= n <= 500.
def has_cycle(graph):
    in_degree = {i: (0) for i in range(1, n + 1)}
    for u in graph:
        for v in graph[u]:
            in_degree[v] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph, `n` is a positive integer, `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key is a node from 1 to `n` and the value represents the total in-degree of the node in the graph.
    queue = deque([node for node in in_degree if in_degree[node] == 0])
    count = 0
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        
        count += 1
        
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            in_degree[neighbor] -= 1
            if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:
                queue.append(neighbor)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `graph` remains the same, `n` is a positive integer, `queue` is empty, `in_degree` values are updated based on the graph structure, and `count` is the number of nodes processed, which is the number of nodes in the graph that are reachable from nodes with an in-degree of 0
    return count != n
    #The program returns True if there are nodes in the graph not reachable from nodes with an in-degree of 0, and False otherwise.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a dictionary representing a directed graph and the number of nodes, and returns True if there are nodes in the graph not reachable from nodes with an in-degree of 0, indicating a potential cycle, and False otherwise, suggesting the graph is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
