n is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 500, m is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to min(n(n - 1), 100000), edges is a list of m pairs of integers, where each pair (u, v) represents a directed edge from vertex u to vertex v, 1 <= u, v <= n, u!= v, and each ordered pair (u, v) is listed at most once.
