The code `queue.append(neighbor)` adds the `neighbor` node to the end of the `queue`. 

The values of `graph`, `n`, `in_degree[neighbor]`, `count`, and `node` are not affected by this operation. The `neighbor` is still the next neighbor of `node` in the `graph`. 

The state of `queue` is updated by adding the `neighbor` node to it.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph, `n` is a positive integer, `in_degree[neighbor]` is `in_degree[neighbor] - 1`, `count` is 1, `node` is the same as before, `graph[node]` has at least one more neighbor, `neighbor` is the next neighbor of `node` in the `graph`, and `queue` contains the `neighbor` node**
