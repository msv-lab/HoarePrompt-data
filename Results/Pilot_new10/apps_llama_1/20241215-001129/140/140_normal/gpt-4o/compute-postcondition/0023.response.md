The code `in_degree[v] += 1` increments the in-degree of node `v` by 1. 

Given the initial state: 
- `graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph with at least one more unprocessed node, 
- `n` is a positive integer, 
- `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key is a node from 1 to `n` and the value represents the total in-degree of the node in the graph with `in_degree[v]` equals its previous value plus 2, 
- `u` is the next unprocessed node in `graph` and has at least one more unprocessed neighbor or `u` is a new next unprocessed node, 
- `v` is the next unprocessed neighbor of `u` in `graph[u]`

The in-degree of node `v` was previously `in_degree[v]`, which was its previous value plus 2. After incrementing by 1, `in_degree[v]` will be its previous value plus 3.

The Output State is: 
- `graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph with at least one more unprocessed node, 
- `n` is a positive integer, 
- `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key is a node from 1 to `n` and the value represents the total in-degree of the node in the graph with `in_degree[v]` equals its previous value plus 3, 
- `u` is the next unprocessed node in `graph` and has at least one more unprocessed neighbor or `u` is a new next unprocessed node, 
- `v` is the next unprocessed neighbor of `u` in `graph[u]`.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph with at least one more unprocessed node, `n` is a positive integer, `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key is a node from 1 to `n` and the value represents the total in-degree of the node in the graph with `in_degree[v]` equals its previous value plus 3, `u` is the next unprocessed node in `graph` and has at least one more unprocessed neighbor or `u` is a new next unprocessed node, `v` is the next unprocessed neighbor of `u` in `graph[u]`.**
