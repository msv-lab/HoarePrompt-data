The code appends `neighbor` to `queue`, so the length of `queue` is increased by 1. The previous values of the other variables are not changed, but `queue` now contains `neighbor` in addition to its previous nodes.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph, `n` is a positive integer, `in_degree` has at least one key with a value that could be 0 after the decrement operation, `count` is 1, `node` is the same as before, `neighbor` is the next neighbor of `node` in the `graph`, `in_degree[neighbor]` is `in_degree[neighbor] - 1`, and `queue` contains all its previous nodes, excluding the leftmost node that was removed if `in_degree[neighbor]` was 0 before the decrement, and `neighbor` is now the last node in `queue`.**
