The code increments the `count` variable by 1. The previous value of `count` was 2. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph, `n` is a positive integer, `node` is the new last removed element of the `queue`, `count` is 3, `in_degree` values are updated based on the graph structure, and `queue` has one less element than before, and it may or may not be empty.
