The value of `queue` is updated by appending `neighbor` to it. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph that must contain `node` as a key with at least one neighbor, `n` is a positive integer, `node` is the next neighbor in the `graph` of the previous `node`, `count` is 3, `in_degree` values are updated, specifically `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1, and `queue` contains the updated list of nodes with `neighbor` added to it.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph that must contain `node` as a key with at least one neighbor, `n` is a positive integer, `node` is the next neighbor in the `graph` of the previous `node`, `count` is 3, `in_degree` values are updated, specifically `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1, and `queue` is updated to `queue + [neighbor]`**
