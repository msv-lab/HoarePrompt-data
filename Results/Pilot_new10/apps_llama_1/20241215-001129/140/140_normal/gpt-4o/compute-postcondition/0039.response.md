Postcondition: ***`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph, `n` is a positive integer, `in_degree` has at least one key with a value that could be 0 after the decrement operation, `count` is 1, `node` is the same as before, `neighbor` is the next neighbor of `node` in the `graph`, `in_degree[neighbor]` is `in_degree[neighbor] - 1`. If `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0 after the decrement, then `queue` contains all its previous nodes, excluding the leftmost node that was removed, and `neighbor` is now the last node in `queue`. If `in_degree[neighbor]` is not 0 after the decrement, then `queue` is the same length as before the decrement operation but with a node removed before the operation.***
