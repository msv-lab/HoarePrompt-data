To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and the initial state step by step.

1. The code `queue.append(neighbor)` adds the `neighbor` element to the end of the `queue`.
2. The initial state mentions that `queue` has one less element than before and may or may not be empty. After appending `neighbor`, the `queue` will have at least one element if it was empty before, or it will have the same number of elements as before the last removal if it was not empty.
3. The value of `neighbor` is such that its `in_degree[neighbor]` has been decremented to 0, making it a candidate to be added to the `queue`.
4. Other variables like `graph`, `n`, `in_degree[neighbor]`, `node`, and `count` are not directly affected by the `queue.append(neighbor)` operation.

Given these considerations, the output state can be described as follows:

- `graph` remains a dictionary representing a directed graph.
- `n` remains a positive integer.
- `in_degree[neighbor]` remains 0, as it was decremented before the append operation and not changed by it.
- `queue` now contains the `neighbor` element, potentially making it non-empty if it was empty before the operation.
- `node` remains the removed leftmost element of the `queue` before the append operation, but it's important to note that the `queue`'s state has changed with the addition of `neighbor`.
- `count` remains 2, as it was not modified by the append operation.
- `graph[node]` is not empty, as per the initial condition, and this condition does not change with the append operation.

Therefore, considering all the changes and the initial conditions:

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph, `n` is a positive integer, `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0, `queue` is not empty and contains `neighbor`, `node` is the previously removed leftmost element of the `queue`, `count` is 2, and `graph[node]` is not empty.**
