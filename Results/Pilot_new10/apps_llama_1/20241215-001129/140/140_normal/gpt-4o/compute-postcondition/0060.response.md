Postcondition: ***`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph, `n` is a positive integer, `node` is the previously removed leftmost element of the `queue`, `count` is 2, `graph[node]` has at least one more neighbor, and `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1. If `in_degree[neighbor]` equals 0, then `queue` contains the previously added elements plus the newly added `neighbor`.***
