The code assigns `count` the value 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph, `n` is a positive integer, `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key is a node from 1 to `n` and the value represents the total in-degree of the node in the graph, `queue` is a deque containing all nodes with an in-degree of 0, `count` is 0**
