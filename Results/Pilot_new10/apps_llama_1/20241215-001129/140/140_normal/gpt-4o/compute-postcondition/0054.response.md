The value of `in_degree[neighbor]` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `in_degree[neighbor]` is at least 1, since `graph[node]` has at least one more neighbor and `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0 for the next `neighbor` in `graph[node]` if `queue` is not empty and contains the next `neighbor`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph, `n` is a positive integer, `node` is the previously removed leftmost element of the `queue`, `count` is 2, `in_degree[neighbor]` is `in_degree[neighbor] - 1`, `graph[node]` has at least one more neighbor, and if `in_degree[neighbor] - 1` is 0 for the next `neighbor` in `graph[node]`, then `queue` is not empty and contains the next `neighbor`**
