The value of `in_degree[v]` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `in_degree[v]` was the previous in-degree of `v` plus 1. So, the new value of `in_degree[v]` is the previous in-degree of `v` plus 2. 
The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph with at least one unprocessed node, `n` is a positive integer, `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key is a node from 1 to `n` and the value represents the total in-degree of the node in the graph, `u` is a key in `graph` with at least three neighbors, `v` is the third neighbor of `u` in `graph`, `in_degree[v]` is the previous in-degree of `v` plus 2.
Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph with at least one unprocessed node, `n` is a positive integer, `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key is a node from 1 to `n` and the value represents the total in-degree of the node in the graph, `u` is a key in `graph` with at least three neighbors, `v` is the third neighbor of `u` in `graph`, `in_degree[v]` is the previous in-degree of `v` plus 2**
