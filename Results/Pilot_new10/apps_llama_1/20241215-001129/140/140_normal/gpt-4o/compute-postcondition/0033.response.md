Postcondition: **`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph, `n` is a positive integer, `in_degree` has at least one key with a value that could be 0 after the decrement operation, `queue` is one node shorter, `count` is 1, `node` is the leftmost node that was in `queue` and is a key in `graph` with at least one neighbor, `neighbor` is the first neighbor of `node` in the `graph`, the current value of `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0, which resulted from the decrement operation `in_degree[neighbor] = in_degree[neighbor] - 1`, indicating that `neighbor` has no more incoming edges from other nodes that have not been processed yet.**
