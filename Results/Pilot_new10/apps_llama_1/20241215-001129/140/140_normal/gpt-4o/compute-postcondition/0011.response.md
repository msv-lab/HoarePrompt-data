The code increments the in-degree of node `v` by 1. The previous value of `in_degree[v]` was the total in-degree of node `v` in the graph, and now it is increased by 1.

The states of the other variables are not affected. `graph` is still a dictionary representing a directed graph with at least one unprocessed node, `n` is still a positive integer, `u` is still a key in `graph` with at least one neighbor, and `v` is still the first neighbor of `u` in `graph`.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph with at least one unprocessed node, `n` is a positive integer, `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key is a node from 1 to `n` and the value represents the total in-degree of the node in the graph, except for node `v` which now has an in-degree of `in_degree[v] + 1`, `u` is a key in `graph` with at least one neighbor, `v` is the first neighbor of `u` in `graph`**
