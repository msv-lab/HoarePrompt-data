Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly follow the problem description. The main issue is with the way it prints the subarray indices. The problem description asks to print the number of new arrays, followed by the start and end indices of each new array. However, the code prints the number of new arrays along with the start and end indices in the same line.

For example, given the input:
```
3
1 2 -3
```
The code will print:
```
YES
1 1 2
2 3 3
```
Instead of the correct output:
```
YES
2
1 2
3 3
```
This is because the code prints the number of new arrays (`k`) along with the start and end indices (`l` and `r`) in the same line. The correct code should print the number of new arrays (`k`) in one line, followed by the start and end indices of each new array in separate lines.

Additionally, the code does not correctly handle the case when there are multiple answers, as it always prints the first possible solution. 

Another issue with the code is that it doesn't correctly handle the prefix sums. It prints the indices of non-zero prefix sums that are not equal to the total sum, but it doesn't consider the case where a prefix sum is equal to the total sum at some point before the end of the array. 

The code should be modified to correctly print the number of new arrays and their start and end indices, and to handle multiple answers and prefix sums correctly.
