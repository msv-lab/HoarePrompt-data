Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description for several reasons:

1.  The program does not correctly print the number of new arrays (`k`). It prints the value of `k` along with the subarray indices, but it should print the value of `k` separately before printing the subarray indices.
2.  The program does not correctly handle the case where the sum of elements in each new array is not zero. It checks if the prefix sum is not zero and not equal to the total sum, but it does not ensure that the sum of elements in each new array is not zero.
3.  The program does not correctly handle the case where the input array has only one element with a sum of zero. In this case, the program should print "NO", but it may print "YES" with an empty subarray.

To fix these issues, the program should be modified to correctly print the number of new arrays, ensure that the sum of elements in each new array is not zero, and handle the case where the input array has only one element with a sum of zero.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + a[i]

    if prefix_sum[n] == 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        k = 0
        l = 0
        subarrays = []
        for r in range(n):
            if prefix_sum[r + 1]!= 0 and (r == n - 1 or prefix_sum[r + 1]!= prefix_sum[n]):
                subarrays.append((l + 1, r + 1))
                k += 1
                l = r
        if not subarrays:
            subarrays.append((1, n))
            k = 1
        print(k)
        for subarray in subarrays:
            print(subarray[0], subarray[1])
```

This corrected version of the program ensures that the sum of elements in each new array is not zero and handles the case where the input array has only one element with a sum of zero. It also correctly prints the number of new arrays and their indices.
