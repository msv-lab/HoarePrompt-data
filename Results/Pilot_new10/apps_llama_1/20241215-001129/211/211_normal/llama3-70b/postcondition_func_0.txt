The function reads a list of integers from the console, calculates the prefix sum, and prints 'NO' if the total sum is zero. If the total sum is non-zero, it prints 'YES' and the indices of non-zero prefix sums that are not equal to the total sum, as well as the final indices, but does not handle invalid inputs and may produce unexpected results for edge cases.
