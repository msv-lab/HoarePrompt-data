The given code simply prints 'YES' and does not modify any variables. Therefore, the values of `A`, `a`, `prefix_sum`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` has a length of `n` where 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` has the same length as the number of input integers, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` is the sum of all elements up to index `i-1` in `a`, `i` is `n-1` if `n` > 0, `prefix_sum` contains all zeros if `n` is 0, the sum of all elements in `a` is not equal to 0, i.e., `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to 0, and 'YES' has been printed.**
