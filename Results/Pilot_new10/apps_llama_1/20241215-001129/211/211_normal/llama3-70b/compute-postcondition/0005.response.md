According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`A` has a length of `n` where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` has the same length as the number of input integers, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_sum[0]` is 0 and `prefix_sum[1]` is `a[0]` and the rest of the elements are 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**
