Postcondition: ***`A` has a length of `n` where 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` has the same length as the number of input integers, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` is the sum of all elements up to index `i-1` in `a`, `i` is `n-1` if `n` > 0, and `prefix_sum` contains all zeros if `n` is 0. If the current value of `prefix_sum` at index `n` is 0, 'NO' has been printed to the console. Otherwise, `k` is 1 plus the number of times a non-zero and non-total sum prefix was found, `l` is the last index `r` where such a prefix sum was found, values have been printed for each such occurrence, and the values of `k`, `l`, and `n` have been printed. If `n` is 0 in this case, `k` is 1, `l` is 1.***
