The given code line affects the `prefix_sum` list by updating its element at index `i + 1`. The value of `prefix_sum[i + 1]` becomes the sum of the current value of `prefix_sum[i]` and `a[i]`. 

Since `i` is 0, `prefix_sum[1]` will be updated to `prefix_sum[0] + a[0]`. Given that `prefix_sum[0]` is initially 0, `prefix_sum[1]` will be equal to `a[0]`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, `A` still has a length of `n`, `a` still has the same length as the number of input integers, `n` is still greater than 0, and `i` is still 0.

Output State: **`A` has a length of `n` where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` has the same length as the number of input integers, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_sum[0]` is 0 and `prefix_sum[1]` is `a[0]` and the rest of the elements are 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
