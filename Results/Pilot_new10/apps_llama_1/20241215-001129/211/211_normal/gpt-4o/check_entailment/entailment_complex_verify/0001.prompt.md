You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One spring day on his way to university Lesha found an array A. Lesha likes to split arrays into several parts. This time Lesha decided to split the array A into several, possibly one, new arrays so that the sum of elements in each of the new arrays is not zero. One more condition is that if we place the new arrays one after another they will form the old array A.

Lesha is tired now so he asked you to split the array. Help Lesha!


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in the array A.

The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 10^3 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^3) — the elements of the array A.


-----Output-----

If it is not possible to split the array A and satisfy all the constraints, print single line containing "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise in the first line print "YES" (without quotes). In the next line print single integer k — the number of new arrays. In each of the next k lines print two integers l_{i} and r_{i} which denote the subarray A[l_{i}... r_{i}] of the initial array A being the i-th new array. Integers l_{i}, r_{i} should satisfy the following conditions:  l_1 = 1  r_{k} = n  r_{i} + 1 = l_{i} + 1 for each 1 ≤ i < k. 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Program:

def func():
    n = int(input())
    A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    total_sum = sum(A)
    if total_sum != 0:
        print('YES')
        print('1')
        print('1', n)
    else:
        for i in range(n):
            if A[i] != 0:
                print('YES')
                print('2')
                print('1', i + 1)
                print(i + 2, n)
                break
        else:
            print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. One potential case it does not handle is when the total sum of the array is not zero, but all prefix sums are zero until the last element. For example, if the input is:

5
-1 1 -1 1 -1

The program will incorrectly output:

YES
1
1 5

When the correct output should be:

YES
5
1 1
2 2
3 3
4 4
5 5

This is because the program only checks if the total sum is not zero, and if so, it outputs that the array can be split into one subarray. However, it does not check if the prefix sums are non-zero, which is a requirement for splitting the array.

The program also handles the case where the total sum is zero incorrectly. It tries to split the array into two subarrays, but this approach is incorrect. The correct approach is to output "NO" when the total sum is zero and all elements in the array are zero, or to split the array into single-element subarrays when the total sum is not zero.

To fix this, the program should be modified to check all prefix sums and split the array accordingly. If the total sum is zero and all elements are zero, the program should output "NO". If the total sum is not zero, the program should output "YES" and split the array into single-element subarrays if the prefix sums are zero until the last element.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2,..., a_{n} ( - 10^3 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^3), representing the elements of array A.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    total_sum = sum(A)
    if (total_sum != 0) :
        print('YES')
        print('1')
        print('1', n)
    else :
        for i in range(n):
            if A[i] != 0:
                print('YES')
                print('2')
                print('1', i + 1)
                print(i + 2, n)
                break
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `A` is a list of `n` integers each in the range -10^3 to 10^3, `total_sum` equals 0, `i` is either `n` if all elements in `A` are 0 or the index of the first non-zero element in `A`, and either 'YES', '2', and specific indices have been printed if a non-zero element was found, or 'NO' has been printed if all elements are 0.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `A` is a list of `n` integers each in the range -10^3 to 10^3, `total_sum` equals the sum of all elements in `A`, ranging from `-10^5` to `10^5`. If `total_sum` is not equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed, '1' has been printed twice, and `n` has been printed. If `total_sum` equals 0, then either 'NO' has been printed if all elements in `A` are 0, or 'YES', '2', and specific indices have been printed if a non-zero element was found in `A`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer n and a list of n integers, calculates the sum of the integers, and prints 'YES' along with specific information based on whether the sum is non-zero or if a non-zero element is found in the list; if all elements are 0, it does not print anything.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
