Correctness: **False**

The given program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why:

1. The program only checks if the total sum of the array is not equal to zero. If it's not zero, it simply splits the array into one part. However, the problem description requires that each part of the array should have a non-zero sum.

2. If the total sum is zero, the program checks for the first non-zero element and splits the array into two parts at that index. However, this approach does not guarantee that each part will have a non-zero sum.

3. The program does not handle cases where all elements in the array are zero correctly. According to the problem description, if it's not possible to split the array into parts with non-zero sums, the program should print "NO". However, the given program only checks if the total sum is zero and if all elements are zero, but it does not check if the array can be split into parts with non-zero sums.

4. The program does not consider cases where the array can be split into more than two parts. The problem description allows for the array to be split into several parts, but the program only considers splitting it into one or two parts.

For example, consider the input array `[1, -1, 1, -1]`. The total sum of this array is zero, but it can be split into parts with non-zero sums: `[1, -1, 1]` and `[-1]` is not a valid split because the second part has a sum of -1 which is not non-zero and also we cannot split the array into `[1]`, `[-1, 1]` and `[-1]` because in this case the second part `[-1, 1]` has a sum of 0. However, the array can be split into `[1]`, `[-1]`, `[1]` and `[-1]`. However, another valid split is `[1, -1]` and `[1, -1]` in which the two parts have non-zero sums which is not detected by the given program.

To correctly solve this problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as using dynamic programming to find all possible splits of the array into parts with non-zero sums.
