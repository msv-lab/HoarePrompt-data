The `break` statement terminates the loop or conditional statement it is directly inside of. Since there's no specific loop or conditional statement provided in the code snippet, we'll assume it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside. Given the initial state, we have:

- `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive),
- `A` is a list of `n` integers each in the range -10^3 to 10^3,
- `total_sum` equals 0,
- `i` is 0,
- The current value of `A` at index `i` is not 0,
- 'YES' has been printed,
- '2' has been printed,
- '1' and '1' have been printed,
- The values 2 and `n` have been printed.

The `break` statement does not change the values of `n`, `A`, `total_sum`, or `i`, nor does it undo any print statements that have been executed. Therefore, the output state remains the same except that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `A` is a list of `n` integers each in the range -10^3 to 10^3, `total_sum` equals 0, `i` is 0, the current value of `A` at index `i` is not 0, 'YES' has been printed, '2' has been printed, '1' and '1' have been printed, the values 2 and `n` have been printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
