The code `print('1', i + 1)` will print '1' and the value of `i + 1` to the console. The value of `i` is 1, so `i + 1` equals 2. The states of the variables `n`, `A`, and `total_sum` are not affected. 'YES', '2', '1', and 2 have been printed to the console.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `A` is a list of `n` integers each in the range -10^3 to 10^3, `total_sum` equals 0, `i` is 1, 'YES', '2', '1', and 2 have been printed to the console**
