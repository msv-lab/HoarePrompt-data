Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 100 (inclusive), `A` is a list of `n` integers each in the range -10^3 to 10^3, `total_sum` equals 0, `i` is 2. If `A[i]` is not equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed, '2' has been printed, '1' has been printed, '3' has been printed, and the numbers 4 and `n` have been printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `A[i]` equals 0, no additional changes have been made.**
