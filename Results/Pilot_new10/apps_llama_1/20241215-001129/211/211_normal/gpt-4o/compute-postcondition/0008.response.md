To determine the adjusted state for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
- `A` is a list of `n` integers, each in the range -10^3 to 10^3.
- `total_sum` equals the sum of all elements in `A`, and `total_sum` equals 0.

The loop statement is `for i in range(n):`, which means the loop will iterate `n` times, starting from 0 and ending at `n-1`.

For the loop to execute, we need to consider the following:
1. **Variable `i`**: Since `i` is the loop counter, at the start of the loop, `i` should be the first index to be processed, which is 0.
2. **Variable `n`**: The loop depends on `n` to determine the number of iterations. Since `n` is given to be between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and the loop will execute at least once (since `n` is at least 1), no additional conditions are needed for `n` beyond what is already given.
3. **List `A`**: The list `A` must have `n` elements, as stated. For the loop to execute, the condition on `A` (being a list of `n` integers) is already met by the given state.
4. **`total_sum`**: The condition that `total_sum` equals 0 is additional information but does not affect the execution of the loop directly. The loop's execution is independent of the sum of the elements in `A`.

Therefore, considering the loop statement and the initial state, the adjusted state for the loop to execute is:
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `A` is a list of `n` integers each in the range -10^3 to 10^3, `total_sum` equals 0, and `i` is 0**
