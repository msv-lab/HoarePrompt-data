The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters, but it is stated that the input consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2,..., a_n`. However, since the function definition does not include any parameters, we will proceed with the understanding that these inputs are handled within the function body, possibly through global variables or other means not specified in the provided function definition.

Given the constraints:
- `n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 100`.
- The list consists of `n` integers `a_1, a_2,..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer and `-10^3 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^3`.

However, without specific details on the output, we cannot directly describe the functionality in terms of return values based on the input parameters. The problem statement seems incomplete as it doesn't specify what the function should return or any specific conditions that affect the return value.

If we were to follow the instruction to the letter without making assumptions beyond what is provided, we would have to say:

Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but is associated with an integer n and a list of n integers, and its return value is not specified.**
