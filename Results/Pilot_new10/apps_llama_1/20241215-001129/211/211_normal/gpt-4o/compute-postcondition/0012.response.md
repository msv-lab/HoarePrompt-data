The given Python code prints the string '1' and the value of `i + 1`. 

The value of `i` is 0, so `i + 1` equals 1. After executing the code, '1' and '1' have been printed. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `A` is a list of `n` integers each in the range -10^3 to 10^3, `total_sum` equals 0, `i` is 0, the current value of `A` at index `i` is not 0, 'YES' has been printed, '2' has been printed, and '1' and '1' have been printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `A` is a list of `n` integers each in the range -10^3 to 10^3, `total_sum` equals 0, `i` is 0, the current value of `A` at index `i` is not 0, 'YES' has been printed, '2' has been printed, and '1' and '1' have been printed**
