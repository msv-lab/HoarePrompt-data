Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `A` is a list of `n` integers each in the range -10^3 to 10^3, `total_sum` equals the sum of all elements in `A`, ranging from `-10^5` to `10^5`. If `total_sum` is not equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed, '1' has been printed twice, and `n` has been printed. If `total_sum` equals 0, then either 'NO' has been printed if all elements in `A` are 0, or 'YES', '2', and specific indices have been printed if a non-zero element was found in `A`.**
