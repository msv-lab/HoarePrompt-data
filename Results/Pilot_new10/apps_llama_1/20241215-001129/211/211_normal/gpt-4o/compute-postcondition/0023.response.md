According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is now 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2. If `A[i]` is not equal to 0, some variables have been printed to the console, but this does not affect the loop execution, so we do not need to adjust `total_sum`. However, we need to consider the case where `A[i]` is equal to 0 or not equal to 0. Since `i` is now 2, `A[i]` refers to the third element in the list. Since `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again, `A` will have at least 3 elements. The state of `total_sum` remains unchanged as 0. 

State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 100 (inclusive), `A` is a list of `n` integers each in the range -10^3 to 10^3, `total_sum` equals 0, `i` is 2**
