The print statement is executed with the arguments `i + 2` and `n`. `i` is 1, so `i + 2` equals 3. The values of `n`, `A`, `total_sum`, and `i` remain unchanged. 'YES', '2', '1', and 2 have been printed to the console, and now 3 and `n` have also been printed. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `A` is a list of `n` integers each in the range -10^3 to 10^3, `total_sum` equals 0, `i` is 1, 'YES', '2', '1', 2, 3, and `n` have been printed to the console**
