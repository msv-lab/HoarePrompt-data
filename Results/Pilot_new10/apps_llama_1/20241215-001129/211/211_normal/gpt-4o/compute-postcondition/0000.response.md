The given code takes an integer input and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The initial state mentions an input consisting of this integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers, but these subsequent integers are not directly affected by the given code snippet.

The code `n = int(input())` reads an input and converts it into an integer. Given that the input is supposed to be an integer `n` where `1 ≤ n ≤ 100`, this `n` is the number of integers that are supposed to follow in the list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), representing the number of elements in the list that follows, which consists of `n` integers `a_1, a_2,..., a_{n}` ( - 10^3 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^3)**
