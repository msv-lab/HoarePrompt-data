Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `A` is a list of `n` integers each in the range -10^3 to 10^3, `total_sum` equals 0, `i` is 0, if the current value of `A` at index `i` is not 0, then 'YES' has been printed, '2' has been printed, '1' and '1' have been printed, the values 2 and `n` have been printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; if the current value of `A` at index `i` is 0, then no additional actions have been taken.**
