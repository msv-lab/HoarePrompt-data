The function accepts an integer n and a string s of length n, calculates the maximum consecutive 'G' characters before an 'S' and the maximum beauty score achievable by swapping one 'G' with an 'S' if a 'G' is followed by an 'S', then prints the maximum of these two scores, assuming the input string only contains 'G' and 'S' characters.
