The code increments `curr_beauty` by 1. The previous value of `curr_beauty` was 0, so the new value of `curr_beauty` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` with 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is 1, and the current value of `left` is less than the current value of `right`, where `left` was either equal to `right` or it was the index of the next 'G' character in `s` before entering the if condition.
