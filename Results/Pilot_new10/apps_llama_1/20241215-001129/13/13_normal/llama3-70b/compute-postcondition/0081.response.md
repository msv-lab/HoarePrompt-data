To determine the output state after the provided Python code is executed, we'll consider the initial conditions and the operation performed by the code.

The initial state conditions are:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive) and greater than `i + 1`.
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters.
- `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`.
- `max_beauty` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty`.
- `curr_beauty` is either 0 or the count of 'G' characters at the end of `s`.
- `left` is at or past the last 'G' or 'S' character.
- `right` equals `n`.
- `max_beauty_one_swap` is `0`.
- `i` is greater than 0.
- `s[i]` is 'G'.
- `s[i + 1]` is 'S'.
- `j` is `i + 3`.

Given the operation `beauty += 1`, we are increasing the value of `beauty` by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive) and greater than `i + 1`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is either 0 or the count of 'G' characters at the end of `s`, `left` is at or past the last 'G' or 'S' character, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is `0`, `i` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is 'G', `s[i + 1]` is 'S', `j` is `i + 3`, and `beauty` is increased by 1 from its previous value**.
