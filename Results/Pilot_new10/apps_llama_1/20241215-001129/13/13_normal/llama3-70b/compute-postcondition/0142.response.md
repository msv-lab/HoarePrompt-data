According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n` and `i`. If `i + 2` is less than `n`, the loop can execute. Given that `i` is greater than 2 and less than `n - 1`, and `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), for the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `n - 2` (since `j` starts from `i + 2`) and `n` must be at least `i + 2`. 

Also, at the start of the loop, `j` is -1, so it needs to be adjusted to `i + 2` for the loop to start executing.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is either 0 or the count of 'G' characters at the end of `s`, `left` is at or past the last 'G' or 'S' character, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is as previously updated, `i` is greater than 2 and less than `n - 2`, `j` is `i + 2`, and `beauty` is the total count of consecutive 'G' characters starting from index `i - 1` and moving backwards, or 1 if the loop does not execute**
