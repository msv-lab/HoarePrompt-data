To determine the output state of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the loop's behavior.

The loop condition is `left < right and s[left]!= 'G'`, which means the loop will continue as long as `left` is less than `right` and the character at index `left` in string `s` is not 'G'. Inside the loop, `left` is incremented by 1.

Given the output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times, we can observe a pattern:

- After 1 time, `left` is 1, and `s[1]` must be 'S'.
- After 2 times, `left` is 2, and `s[1]` and `s[2]` must be 'S'.
- After 3 times, `left` is 3, and `s[1]`, `s[2]`, and `s[3]` must be 'S'.

This pattern indicates that the loop will continue until it finds a 'G' character in the string `s` starting from the left index, or until `left` is no longer less than `right`.

Since the initial state specifies that the character at index `right` in string `s` is 'S', and `right` is not modified within the loop, the loop will eventually terminate when `left` reaches the index of the first 'G' character in `s` from the left, or when `left` equals `right` if there are no 'G' characters before the `right` index.

At the end of the loop, `left` will be pointing to the first 'G' character it encounters (if such a character exists before `right`), or `left` will equal `right` if no 'G' character is found before `right`.

The values of `n`, `s`, `golden`, `max_beauty`, and `curr_beauty` do not change within the loop based on the provided code. The value of `right` is also not modified within the loop.

Therefore, considering the given conditions and the behavior of the loop, the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed is:

Output State: **`n` remains the original value, `s` remains the original string, `golden` remains the list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is 0, `right` remains its original value, and `left` is either the index of the first 'G' character in `s` from the left (if such a character exists and is before `right`), or `left` equals `right` (if no 'G' character is found before `right`).**
