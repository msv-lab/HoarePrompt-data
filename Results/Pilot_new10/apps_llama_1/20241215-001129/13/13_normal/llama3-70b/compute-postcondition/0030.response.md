The value of `left` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `left` was such that `s[left]` is not 'G' after the increment, but now `left` has been incremented. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` with at least one 'S' character and 'G' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `right` is greater than the new `left` index, `curr_beauty` is 0, and `left` is `left + 1`.**
