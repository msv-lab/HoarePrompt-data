To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the patterns observed from the output states after a few iterations.

The loop code is:
```python
for j in range(i + 2, n):
    if s[j] == 'G':
        beauty += 1
    else:
        break
```
The loop starts from `i + 2` and goes up to `n`. It increments `beauty` by 1 for each 'G' character encountered and breaks the loop when it encounters an 'S' character.

From the output states after a few iterations, we can observe the following patterns:

* `j` takes on the value of `i + 2`, `i + 3`, `i + 4`, and so on, until the loop breaks or reaches the end of the string `s`.
* `beauty` is incremented by 1 for each 'G' character encountered.
* The loop breaks when an 'S' character is encountered.

Now, let's analyze what happens after all iterations of the loop have finished:

* The loop will have checked all characters in the string `s` from index `i + 2` to the end.
* If all characters in this range are 'G', `beauty` will be incremented by the number of 'G' characters in this range.
* If an 'S' character is encountered, the loop will break, and `beauty` will be the total count of consecutive 'G' characters starting from index `i - 1` and moving backwards, or 1 if the loop did not execute.
* If the loop does not execute (i.e., `i + 2` is greater than or equal to `n`), `beauty` will remain 1, which is the initial value.

Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the output state will be:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is either 0 or the count of 'G' characters at the end of `s`, `left` is at or past the last 'G' or 'S' character, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is as previously updated, `i` is greater than 2 and less than `n`, `j` is `n`, and `beauty` is the total count of consecutive 'G' characters starting from index `i - 1` and moving backwards, or 1 if the loop did not execute.**
