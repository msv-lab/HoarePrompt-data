To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop condition.

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop is defined as `for i in range(n - 1)`. This means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is greater than 1 and less than `n - 1`. This implies that `i` has been incremented at least once and is not at its initial value (which would be 0 for the first iteration).

3. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Given that `i` is currently greater than 1 and less than `n - 1`, after incrementing, `i` will still be less than `n - 1` but will be exactly one more than its current value.

4. **Other States**: The states of `n`, `s`, `golden`, `max_beauty`, `curr_beauty`, `left`, `right`, and `max_beauty_one_swap` are not directly affected by the loop condition itself but by the operations performed within the loop body, which are not provided. Therefore, we cannot determine how these states change based solely on the loop condition and the information given.

5. **Conclusion**: The only state that we can definitively say needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, based on the loop condition, is `i`, which needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is either 0 or the count of 'G' characters at the end of `s`, `left` is at or past the last 'G' or 'S' character, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is as previously updated, and `i` is greater than 2 and less than `n - 1`**
