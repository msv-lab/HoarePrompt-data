The value of `left` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `left` was 1, so the new value of `left` is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` with 'G' and 'S' characters and `s[left-1]` was 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s` excluding the index `left - 2`, `curr_beauty` is `0`, `max_beauty` is `0`, `right` is the last index plus one, and `left` is 2.
