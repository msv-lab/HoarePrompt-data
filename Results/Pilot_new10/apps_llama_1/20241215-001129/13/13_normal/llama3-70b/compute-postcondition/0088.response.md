To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the given output states for the first few iterations.

The loop iterates from `i + 2` to `n`, and for each iteration, it checks if the character at index `j` in string `s` is 'G'. If it is, it increments `beauty` by 1. If it encounters an 'S', it breaks out of the loop.

From the given output states, we can observe that:

- `n` must be greater than `i + 1` for the loop to execute at least once.
- `j` starts at `i + 2` and increments by 1 for each iteration.
- `beauty` is incremented by 1 for each 'G' character encountered after `i + 1` until an 'S' is encountered or the end of the string is reached.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, the state of the variables can be summarized as follows:

- `n` remains the same, an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive).
- `s` remains the same, a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters.
- `golden` remains the same, a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`.
- `max_beauty` remains the same, the maximum of the previous `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty`.
- `curr_beauty` remains the same, either 0 or the count of 'G' characters at the end of `s`.
- `left` remains the same, at or past the last 'G' or 'S' character.
- `right` remains the same, equals `n`.
- `max_beauty_one_swap` remains the same, `0`.
- `i` remains the same, greater than 0, `s[i]` is 'G', `s[i + 1]` is 'S'.
- `j` will be equal to the index of the first 'S' encountered after `i + 1` or `n` if no 'S' is encountered after `i + 1`.
- `beauty` will be the initial value of `beauty` (1 plus the number of 'G' characters to the left of `s[i]`) plus the number of 'G' characters between `i + 2` and the first 'S' encountered after `i + 1` (inclusive if 'S' is at `i + 2`, exclusive if 'S' is after `i + 2`), or all 'G' characters after `i + 1` if no 'S' is encountered.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is either 0 or the count of 'G' characters at the end of `s`, `left` is at or past the last 'G' or 'S' character, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is `0`, `i` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is 'G', `s[i + 1]` is 'S', `j` equals `n` or the index of the first 'S' encountered after `i + 1`, and `beauty` is the initial value of `beauty` plus the number of 'G' characters between `i + 2` and the first 'S' encountered after `i + 1` (inclusive if 'S' is at `i + 2`, exclusive if 'S' is after `i + 2`), or all 'G' characters after `i + 1` if no 'S' is encountered.**
