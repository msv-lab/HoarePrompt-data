The `break` statement breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement it is directly inside, but it does not change any variable values. The values of the variables `n`, `s`, `golden`, `max_beauty`, `curr_beauty`, `left`, `right`, `max_beauty_one_swap`, `i`, `j`, and `beauty` remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is either 0 or the count of 'G' characters at the end of `s`, `left` is at or past the last 'G' or 'S' character, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is `0`, `i` must be greater than 0, `s[i]` is 'G', `s[i + 1]` is 'S', `j` is `i - 1`, `beauty` is 1, `s[j]` is not 'G', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
