The given code snippet updates the `max_beauty` variable by taking the maximum value between its current value and `curr_beauty`. 

`max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of its current value, which is 0, and `curr_beauty`, which is also 0. Therefore, `max_beauty` remains 0.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` with 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, and the character at index `right` in string `s` is 'S'**
