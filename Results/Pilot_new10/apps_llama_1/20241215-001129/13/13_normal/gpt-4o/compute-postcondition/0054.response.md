The code updates the value of `max_length` by comparing its current value with the sum of the lengths of the first and second sequences of 'G's in `trophies` plus 1. 

`max_length` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the expression `curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1`. 

Since we know that `curr_start` is 2 more than `prev_end`, we can substitute `curr_start` with `prev_end + 2` in the expression.

The expression becomes `curr_end - (prev_end + 2) + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1`, which simplifies to `curr_end - prev_end - 1 + prev_end - prev_start + 3`, and further simplifies to `curr_end - prev_start + 2`.

The value of `max_length` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_end - prev_start + 2`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `segments` contains tuples representing all sequences of 'G's in the original `trophies` string and has more than 1 element, `trophies` remains unchanged, `max_length` is equal to the maximum of its previous value and `curr_end - prev_start + 2`, `prev_start` is the start of the first sequence of 'G's in `trophies`, `prev_end` is the end of the first sequence of 'G's in `trophies`, `curr_start` is the start of the second sequence of 'G's in `trophies`, `curr_end` is the end of the second sequence of 'G's in `trophies`, and `curr_start` is 2 more than `prev_end`.**
