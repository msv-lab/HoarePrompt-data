Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. For example, when `n = 4`, `m = 4`, and `k = 4`, the program should print "YES" with three points that form a triangle with an area of 4. However, the program prints "NO" because `2 * area` is greater than both `n` and `m`, and the program does not check for other possible combinations of points that could form a triangle with the desired area.

In this case, the program fails to find a valid solution because it only checks two specific cases: when `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n` and when `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`. However, there may be other combinations of points that could form a triangle with the desired area, and the program does not check for these cases.

Therefore, the program is not correct for all potential cases, and its correctness is **False**.
