    return a
    #The program returns a, which is the absolute value of the original value of `a`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns the GCD of the absolute values of `a` and `b`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers, where a and b represent the coefficients of the linear Diophantine equation, with a and b being non-zero to ensure meaningful results for the function.

        return 1, 0
        #The program returns two values: 1 and 0, where 1 can be considered as the coefficient representing a solution or a part of the solution to the linear Diophantine equation and 0 as another component of the solution.
    else :
        x, y = func_2(b, a % b)
        return y, x - a // b * y
        #The program returns `y`, which is assigned based on `func_2(b, a % b)`, and the value of `x - a // b * y`, where `x` is also assigned based on `func_2(b, a % b)`, `a` is an integer, and `b` is a non-zero integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers `a` and `b` and returns a tuple of two integers representing the coefficients `x` and `y` in the linear Diophantine equation `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`, using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, with `x` and `y` calculated based on recursive calls and the specific case handling when `b` is 0, assuming `a` and `b` are non-zero to ensure meaningful results, but does not explicitly handle cases where `a` or `b` is negative, or where both are zero, and does not account for potential overflow issues.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers, where the values of a and b are related to the coordinates of points that will be used to calculate the area of a triangle in the context of the problem.
def func_3(a, b):
    x, y = func_2(a, b)
    return x, y, x * a + y * b
    #The program returns x, y (which are return values of func_2(a, b) where a and b are integers), and the value of x * a + y * b
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, calls `func_2(a, b)` to obtain `x` and `y`, and returns these values along with the calculated value of `x * a + y * b`, assuming `func_2(a, b)` executes successfully and returns two values; otherwise, its behavior is dependent on the implementation and potential error handling of `func_2(a, b)`.
