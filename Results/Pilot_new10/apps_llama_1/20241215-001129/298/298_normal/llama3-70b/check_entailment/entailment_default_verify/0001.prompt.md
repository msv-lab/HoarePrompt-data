You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has got three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$. He'd like to find three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, such that $0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n$, $0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m$ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

Help Vasya! Find such points (if it's possible). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The single line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\le n, m \le 10^9$, $2 \le k \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

If there are no such points, print "NO".

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. The next three lines should contain integers $x_i, y_i$ â€” coordinates of the points, one point per line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 3

Output
YES
1 0
2 3
4 1

Input
4 4 7

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example area of the triangle should be equal to $\frac{nm}{k} = 4$. The triangle mentioned in the output is pictured below:  [Image] 

In the second example there is no triangle with area $\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{16}{7}$.
Program:
```
import math

(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
if n * m % k:
    print('NO')
    exit()
(n1, m1, g) = func_3(n, m)
if abs(n1 * m) >= g:
    print('YES')
    print(0, 0)
    print(0, n1 * m // g)
    print(m1 * m // g, 0)
else:
    print('NO')

def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

def func_2(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return (1, 0)
    else:
        (x, y) = func_2(b, a % b)
        return (y, x - a // b * y)

def func_3(a, b):
    (x, y) = func_2(a, b)
    return (x, y, x * a + y * b)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. A counterexample is when the input is `4 3 6`. The program will check if `n * m % k` equals zero, which it does in this case, but then it does not correctly calculate the points for the triangle.

In this case, the area of the triangle should be equal to `nm/k = 2`. However, the program does not correctly calculate the points for the triangle.

Another issue with the program is that it only checks if `abs(n1 * m) >= g`, but it does not consider the case where `g` does not divide `n1 * m`. In such cases, the program will not be able to find the correct points for the triangle.

The function `func_3(n, m)` is also not correctly defined in the given code, the definition of this function seems to calculate the gcd of `n` and `m` but it is not clear how this is used to find the points of the triangle. 

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider all possible cases and correctly calculate the points for the triangle based on the given conditions. 

In general, the program seems to be incomplete and does not handle all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns the GCD of the absolute values of `a` and `b`. 

Output hint for function_2: The function accepts two integers `a` and `b` and returns a tuple of two integers representing the coefficients `x` and `y` in the linear Diophantine equation `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`, using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, with `x` and `y` calculated based on recursive calls and the specific case handling when `b` is 0, assuming `a` and `b` are non-zero to ensure meaningful results, but does not explicitly handle cases where `a` or `b` is negative, or where both are zero, and does not account for potential overflow issues. 

Output hint for function_3: The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, calls `func_2(a, b)` to obtain `x` and `y`, and returns these values along with the calculated value of `x * a + y * b`, assuming `func_2(a, b)` executes successfully and returns two values; otherwise, its behavior is dependent on the implementation and potential error handling of `func_2(a, b)`. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
