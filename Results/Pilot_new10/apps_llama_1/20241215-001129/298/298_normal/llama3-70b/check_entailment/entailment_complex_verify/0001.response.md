The original assessment of the program's correctness is **False**. However, after analyzing the annotated version of the code, I believe that the original assessment is accurate.

The reason why I think the original assessment is accurate is that the program does not correctly handle all possible cases. For example, when the input is `4 3 6`, the program will check if `n * m % k` equals zero, which it does in this case, but then it does not correctly calculate the points for the triangle. 

Another issue with the program is that it only checks if `abs(n1 * m) >= g`, but it does not consider the case where `g` does not divide `n1 * m`. In such cases, the program will not be able to find the correct points for the triangle.

Additionally, the program uses the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` to calculate the GCD of `n` and `m` and the coefficients `x` and `y` in the linear Diophantine equation `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`. However, these functions do not handle all possible cases, such as when `a` or `b` is negative, or when both are zero.

The annotated version of the code does provide more information about the state of the program at different points, but it does not address the issues mentioned above. Therefore, I believe that the original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate.

Final: **False**
