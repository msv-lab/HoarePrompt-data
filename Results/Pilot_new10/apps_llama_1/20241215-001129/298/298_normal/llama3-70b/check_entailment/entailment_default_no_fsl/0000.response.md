Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. 

One potential issue with the code is that it does not correctly handle cases when the GCD of `n` and `m` does not divide `k`. The code checks if `n * m` is divisible by `k`, but it does not consider the case when the GCD of `n` and `m` is not equal to the GCD of `n * m` and `k`. 

For example, consider the case when `n = 6`, `m = 9`, and `k = 6`. The GCD of `n` and `m` is 3, but `n * m` is not divisible by `k * 3`. However, the code only checks if `n * m` is divisible by `k`, and since it is, the code will attempt to print the coordinates of the triangle, which will not be correct.

Another issue with the code is that it does not correctly calculate the coordinates of the triangle. The code uses the function `func_3` to calculate the coordinates, but this function only returns the coefficients `x` and `y` in the linear Diophantine equation `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`, which does not necessarily correspond to the coordinates of the triangle.

The code also does not handle the case when `n1 * m` is less than `g`, which can result in the code printing incorrect coordinates or failing to print the coordinates of the triangle.

In addition, the code does not consider all possible cases when the triangle can be formed. The code only considers the case when the triangle has vertices at `(0, 0)`, `(0, n1 * m // g)`, and `(m1 * m // g, 0)`, but there may be other possible cases when the triangle can be formed with different vertices.

Overall, the code has several issues that make it incorrect for every potential case.
