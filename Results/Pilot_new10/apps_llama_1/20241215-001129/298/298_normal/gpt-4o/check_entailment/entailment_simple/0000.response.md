Correctness: **False**

The program does not always follow the problem description. 

The problem description requires finding three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$ such that $0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n$, $0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m$ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

However, the program has a bug in the case where `2 * area` is larger than both `n` and `m`. In this case, the program prints `f'{n} {m // 2}'` and `f'0 {m // 2}'` twice, but this does not guarantee that the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

For example, consider the case where `n = 4`, `m = 4`, and `k = 7`. The area of the triangle should be $\frac{16}{7}$, but the program will print `4 2`, `0 2`, and `0 2`, which does not form a triangle with the required area.

Therefore, the program does not always follow the problem description, and its correctness is **False**. 

To make the program correct, it needs to be modified to handle the case where `2 * area` is larger than both `n` and `m` correctly, ensuring that the area of the triangle formed by the printed points is always equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$. 

One possible modification is to use the Shoelace formula to calculate the area of the triangle formed by the points, and then adjust the points accordingly to ensure that the area is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$. 

Here is a possible correction:

```Python
def func():
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    area = n * m / k
    if (area!= int(area)) or area == 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        area = int(area)
        print('YES')
        print('0 0')
        if 2 * area <= n:
            print(f'{2 * area} 1')
            print('0 1')
        elif 2 * area <= m:
            print(f'1 {2 * area}')
            print('1 0')
        else:
            # Handle the case where 2 * area is larger than both n and m
            for x in range(1, n):
                for y in range(1, m):
                    # Calculate the area of the triangle using the Shoelace formula
                    triangle_area = abs((0 * (y - 0) + x * (0 - y) + 0 * (y - 0)) / 2.0)
                    if triangle_area == area:
                        print(f'{x} {y}')
                        print(f'0 0')
                        return
            print('NO')  # If no solution is found
```
This modification uses the Shoelace formula to calculate the area of the triangle formed by the points, and then adjusts the points accordingly to ensure that the area is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$. If no solution is found, it prints 'NO'. 

Note that this is just one possible correction, and there may be other ways to modify the program to make it correct.
