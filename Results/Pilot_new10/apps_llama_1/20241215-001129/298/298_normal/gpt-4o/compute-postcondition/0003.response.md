The code snippet provided only contains a print statement, which does not modify any variables. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `area` remain unchanged. The print statement simply outputs the string 'NO' to the console.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `area` is the result of `n * m / k`, the current value of `area` is not a whole number, and 'NO' has been printed to the console.**
