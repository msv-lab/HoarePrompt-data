Since `area` is already an integer (i.e., `n * m` is divisible by `k`), the impact of the code `area = int(area)` is that it doesn't change the value of `area` because `area` is already an integer. The states of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`) are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `area` is an integer equal to `n * m / k`**
