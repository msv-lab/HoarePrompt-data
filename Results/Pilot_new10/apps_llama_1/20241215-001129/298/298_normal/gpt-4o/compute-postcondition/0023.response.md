Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `area` is an integer equal to `n * m / k`. If `area` is 0, 'NO' has been printed. If `area` is not equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed, '0 0' has been printed. Additionally, if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, then the string `f'{2 * area} 1'` has been printed and the string '0 1' has been printed. If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m` but larger than `n`, then '1 ' followed by the value of `2 * area` has been printed and '1 0' has been printed. If `2 * area` is larger than both `n` and `m`, then '0 0' has been printed twice, `f'{n} {m // 2}'` has been printed, and `f'0 {m // 2}'` has been printed twice.***
