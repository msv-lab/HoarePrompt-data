Postcondition: **`n` is an integer where 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', `c` is the second character in `s`, the index of `c` in `s` is 1, if `count[nc]` is greater than 0, then `nc` is greater than 0, `res` is `res + nc`, `count[nc]` is `count[nc] - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
