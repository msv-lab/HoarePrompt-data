The `break` statement terminates the loop it is inside. The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', `count` is a dictionary where `count['A']` equals `n // 4 - 1`, `count['C']` equals `n // 4 - 1`, `count['G']` equals `n // 4`, `count['T']` equals `n // 4`, `avg` is `n // 4`, `res` is 'AC', `nc` is 'C', the index of `c` in `s` is 0, `c` is '?' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
