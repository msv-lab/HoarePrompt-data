Postcondition: **`n` is an integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 255, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?' where n is between 4 and 255 (inclusive), if the first character `c` in `s` is not '?', then `count` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and values updated such that the count of `c` is increased by 1, otherwise `count` remains unchanged with all values set to 0.**
