The value of `count[c]` is updated to `avg - count[c]`. Since `c` is 'C' and `avg` is `n // 4`, the value of `count['C']` becomes `n // 4 - count['C']`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', `count` is a dictionary where the value for 'A' has been updated and the value for 'C' is `n // 4 - count['C']`, and `avg` is `n // 4`, and `c` is 'C'**
