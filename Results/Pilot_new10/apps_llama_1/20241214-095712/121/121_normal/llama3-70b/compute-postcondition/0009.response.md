Postcondition: **`n` is an integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 255, `s` is a string of length `n-1` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', if `c` is not '?', then `count[c]` is incremented by 1 for some character `c` in `s`, and the count values for other characters remain unchanged; if `c` is '?', then the count values remain unchanged.**
