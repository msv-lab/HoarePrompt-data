Postcondition: **`n` is an integer where 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. If `c` is '?', then `count` is a dictionary where the values are the updated counts after the loop, `avg` is `n // 4`, `res` contains the first character in 'ACGT' that has a count greater than 0, and `c` is '?'. If `c` is not '?', then `count` is a dictionary where `count['A'] = n // 4 - original count['A']`, `count['C'] = n // 4 - original count['C']`, `count['G'] = n // 4 - original count['G']`, `count['T'] = n // 4 - original count['T']`, `avg` is `n // 4`, `res` is the first character in `s`, and the index of `c` in `s` is 0.**
