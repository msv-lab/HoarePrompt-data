The code updates the value of `count['G']` using the formula `avg - count['G']`. Given that `c` is 'G', `avg` is `n // 4`, and `count['G']` is initially 0, we can substitute these values into the formula.

So, `count['G']` becomes `n // 4 - 0`, which simplifies to `n // 4`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer where 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', `count` is a dictionary where the value for 'A' has been updated, the value for 'C' is `n // 4 - count['C']`, the value for 'G' is `n // 4`, and `avg` is `n // 4`, and `c` is 'G'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', `count` is a dictionary where the value for 'A' has been updated, the value for 'C' is `n // 4 - count['C']`, the value for 'G' is `n // 4`, and `avg` is `n // 4`, and `c` is 'G'**
