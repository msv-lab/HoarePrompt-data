Postcondition: **`n` is an integer where 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. If `count['C']` is greater than 0 and `count[nc]` is greater than 0, then `count` is a dictionary where `count['A']` equals `n // 4 - 1`, `count['C']` equals `n // 4 - 1`, `count['G']` equals `n // 4 - 1`, `count['T']` equals `n // 4`, `avg` is `n // 4`, `res` is 'ACG', `nc` is 'G', the index of `c` in `s` is 0, `c` is '?' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count['C']` is greater than 0 and `count[nc]` is not greater than 0, then `count` is a dictionary where `count['A']` equals `n // 4 - 1`, `count['C']` equals `n // 4 - 1`, `count['G']` equals `n // 4`, `count['T']` equals `n // 4`, `avg` is `n // 4`, `res` is 'AC', `nc` is 'G', the index of `c` in `s` is 0, `c` is '?' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count['C']` is not greater than 0, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
