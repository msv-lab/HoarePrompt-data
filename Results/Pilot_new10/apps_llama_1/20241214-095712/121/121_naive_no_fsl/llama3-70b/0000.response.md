Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and accurately implements the problem description. 

Here's why:

1. The program first counts the occurrences of each nucleotide ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') in the input string `s`. It then calculates the average count of each nucleotide, which should be equal in the decoded genome.

2. It then calculates the number of each nucleotide that needs to be added to `s` to make their counts equal. This is done by subtracting the current count of each nucleotide from the average count.

3. The program then iterates over `s` and replaces each '?' with the first nucleotide that still needs to be added. This is done by looping over the nucleotides in 'ACGT' (not necessarily the order in which they appear in the input string) and checking if any of them still need to be added (i.e., their count is greater than 0).

4. Finally, if there are any nucleotides left to be added after iterating over the entire string, it means that it is impossible to decode the genome, so the program prints '==='.

The program handles all cases correctly:

- If the input string is already decoded and each nucleotide appears an equal number of times, the program will simply return the original string.

- If there are unrecognized nucleotides ('?') in the string, the program will replace them with the necessary nucleotides to make their counts equal, if possible.

- If it is impossible to decode the genome (e.g., if the length of the string is not a multiple of 4, or if there are not enough '?'s to make the counts equal), the program will print '==='.

The program works correctly for all examples provided in the problem description, and it should work correctly for any valid input.
