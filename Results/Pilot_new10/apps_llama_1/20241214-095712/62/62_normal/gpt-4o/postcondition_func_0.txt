The function accepts a list of non-negative integers `digits` and an integer `base`, and returns the decimal representation of the number formed by `digits` in base `base`, assuming `digits` and `base` are valid inputs, and handling cases where `digits` might be empty or `base` might be outside the range of 2 to 40, in which case it still computes a decimal value based on the given inputs without validation.
