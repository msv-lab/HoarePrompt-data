It appears that the function definition provided is incomplete and doesn't match the problem description. The problem description mentions two numbers, X and Y, with different bases, but the function definition only takes two parameters.

Based on the problem description, a more suitable function definition would be:

```python
def compare_numbers(nx, bx, x_digits, ny, by, y_digits):
```

However, if we consider the given function definition `def func_1(digits, base):`, we can assume it's used to convert a number from a given base to decimal, and then compare two decimal numbers. In this case:

Precondition: **digits is a list of non-negative integers, and base is an integer such that 2 ≤ base ≤ 40, and for all i in digits, 0 ≤ digits[i] < base.**
