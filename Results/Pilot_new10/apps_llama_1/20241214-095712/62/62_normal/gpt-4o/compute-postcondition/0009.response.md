The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `digits` and `base`. `digits` is a list of non-negative integers, and `base` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `base` ≤ 40. Additionally, for all elements in `digits`, each element is a non-negative integer less than `base`. After executing the function body, the function returns the decimal representation of the number formed by `digits` in base `base`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of non-negative integers `digits` and an integer `base` between 2 and 40, and returns the decimal representation of the number formed by `digits` in base `base`.**
