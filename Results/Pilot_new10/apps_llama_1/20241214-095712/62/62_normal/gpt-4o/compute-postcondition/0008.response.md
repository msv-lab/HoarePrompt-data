The program is given the decimal representation of the number formed by `digits` in base `base`. Here, `base` is between 2 and 40 (inclusive), and `digits` is a list of non-negative integers less than `base`. 
The code simply returns `decimal_value`. 
Given this information, the return value is `decimal_value`, which represents the decimal equivalent of the number formed by the list of digits `digits` when interpreted in base `base`.

Output State: **The program returns decimal_value, the decimal representation of the number formed by `digits` in base `base`, where `base` is an integer between 2 and 40 (inclusive) and `digits` is a list of non-negative integers less than `base`.**
