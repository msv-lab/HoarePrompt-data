According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If the list has at least 1 digit, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `digits` is a list of non-negative integers, `base` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `base` ≤ 40, and for all i in `digits`, 0 ≤ `digits[i]` < `base`, and `decimal_value` is 0. So for the loop to be executed, the list must have at least 1 digit and the digit is the first digit in the list.
State: **`digits` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 digit, `base` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `base` ≤ 40, for all i in `digits`, 0 ≤ `digits[i]` < `base`, `decimal_value` is 0, digit is the first digit in the list**
