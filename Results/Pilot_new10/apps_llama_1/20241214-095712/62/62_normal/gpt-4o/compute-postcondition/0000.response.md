The code initializes a new variable `decimal_value` to 0. The values of `digits` and `base` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `digits` is a list of non-negative integers, `base` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `base` ≤ 40, and for all i in `digits`, 0 ≤ `digits[i]` < `base`, and `decimal_value` is 0.

Output State: **`digits` is a list of non-negative integers, `base` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `base` ≤ 40, and for all i in `digits`, 0 ≤ `digits[i]` < `base`, and `decimal_value` is 0**
