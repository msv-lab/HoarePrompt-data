To calculate the new value of `decimal_value`, we need to understand its initial value and how it changes with the given operation.

Initially, `decimal_value` is equal to `digits[0] * base + digits[1] * base^2 + digits[2] * base^3`.

The operation `decimal_value = decimal_value * base + digit` implies that we are shifting the current value of `decimal_value` one position to the left in terms of the base (multiplying by `base`) and then adding the third digit (`digit`) of the list.

Given that `digit` is the third digit in the list, it is equivalent to `digits[2]`.

So, the new `decimal_value` becomes:
- The old `decimal_value` multiplied by `base` (which shifts its value one position to the left in base terms) plus `digit` (which is `digits[2]`).

This can be expressed as:
`decimal_value = (digits[0] * base + digits[1] * base^2 + digits[2] * base^3) * base + digits[2]`.

Expanding this, we get:
`decimal_value = digits[0] * base^2 + digits[1] * base^3 + digits[2] * base^4 + digits[2]`.

Since `digits` is a list of non-negative integers, `base` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `base` ≤ 40, and for all `i` in `digits`, 0 ≤ `digits[i]` < `base`, these conditions remain unchanged after the operation.

The value of `decimal_value` has been updated based on the operation, and the other variables (`digits`, `base`, and `digit`) retain their initial properties except for the change in `decimal_value`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `digits` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 3 digits, `base` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `base` ≤ 40, for all `i` in `digits`, 0 ≤ `digits[i]` < `base`, `decimal_value` is equal to `digits[0] * base^2 + digits[1] * base^3 + digits[2] * base^4 + digits[2]`, and `digit` is the third digit in the list.

Output State: **`digits` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 3 digits, `base` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `base` ≤ 40, for all `i` in `digits`, 0 ≤ `digits[i]` < `base`, `decimal_value` is equal to `digits[0] * base^2 + digits[1] * base^3 + digits[2] * base^4 + digits[2]`, and `digit` is the third digit in the list**.
