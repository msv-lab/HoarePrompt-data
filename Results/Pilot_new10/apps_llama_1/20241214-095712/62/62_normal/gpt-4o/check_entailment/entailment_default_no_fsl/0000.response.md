Correctness: **True**

The code accurately implements the problem description, which asks to compare two numbers, X and Y, represented in different bases. It correctly converts both numbers to decimal using the provided base and digits, and then compares the decimal values to determine the output.

The `func_1` function takes a list of digits and a base as input and returns the decimal representation of the number formed by those digits in that base. This function works correctly for all valid inputs, including empty lists of digits (although the problem description guarantees that the lists will not be empty) and bases within the range of 2 to 40.

The main part of the code reads the input, converts the numbers to decimal, and prints the result of the comparison. This logic is sound and should produce the correct output for all valid inputs.

The output hints suggest that the function `func_1` will still compute a decimal value even if the inputs are outside the expected range, but this does not affect the correctness of the code with respect to the problem description. The problem description guarantees that the bases will be between 2 and 40, and the digits will be valid for the given base, so the code does not need to handle invalid inputs.

The examples provided in the problem description also demonstrate that the code works correctly for different cases. For instance, in the first example, X = 101111_2 = 47_10 = Y, and the code correctly outputs '='. Similarly, in the second and third examples, the code produces the expected outputs based on the decimal representations of the input numbers.

Therefore, based on the problem description, output hints, and examples, it appears that the code is correct and will produce the expected output for all valid inputs.
