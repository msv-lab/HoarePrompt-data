Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and meets the problem description. Here's why:

1. The program first reads the input as specified: the number of digits `n` and the base `b_x` for number `X`, followed by the digits of `X` in the order from most significant to least significant. It does the same for number `Y`.
2. The program then converts each number from its respective base to decimal using the function `func_1`.
3. The conversion function `func_1` correctly calculates the decimal value of a number represented in a given base. It iterates through the digits, multiplying the current decimal value by the base and adding the current digit. This is the standard method for converting a number from any base to decimal.
4. After converting both numbers to decimal, the program compares them and prints the result as specified: `<` if `X` is less than `Y`, `>` if `X` is greater than `Y`, and `=` if `X` is equal to `Y`.
5. The program handles cases where `digits` might be empty or `base` might be outside the range of 2 to 40 without explicit validation. However, according to the problem description, the inputs are guaranteed to be valid (i.e., `2 ≤ b_x, b_y ≤ 40`, and `0 ≤ x_i, y_i < b_x, b_y`), so the lack of validation does not affect the program's correctness.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and correctly compares two numbers represented in different bases. It handles all potential cases as specified and produces the expected output.
