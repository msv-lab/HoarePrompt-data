Correctness: **True**

The code provided accurately compares two numbers represented in different bases. It first converts each number to its decimal representation using the `func_1` function, which calculates the decimal value of a number given its digits and base. It then compares the decimal values of the two numbers and outputs '<', '>', or '=' based on whether the first number is less than, greater than, or equal to the second number, respectively.

The `func_1` function correctly calculates the decimal representation of a number by iterating over its digits from most significant to least significant, multiplying the current decimal value by the base, and adding the current digit. This is a standard method for converting a number from any base to decimal.

The output hints agree with the code and suggest that the function handles cases where the input digits might be empty or the base might be outside the range of 2 to 40. However, according to the problem description, the input will always be valid (i.e., 1 ≤ n ≤ 10, 2 ≤ b_x ≤ 40, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10, 2 ≤ b_y ≤ 40, b_x ≠ b_y), so the function does not need to handle invalid inputs.

The provided examples demonstrate the correctness of the code. For instance, in the first example, X = 101111_2 = 47_10 and Y = 47_10, so the output is '=' as expected. Similarly, in the second example, X = 102_3 = 11_10 and Y = 24_5 = 14_10, but the base 5 representation of Y is given as 24_5 which equals 14 in decimal and in base 3 X equals 21 in decimal and Y equals 14 in decimal hence the output is '<' as expected, but based on sample X in decimal is 11 and Y is 14 so expected answer should be '<' and in third sample X is much larger than Y so the answer is indeed '>'.

The code handles all possible cases according to the problem description and does not contain any errors or omissions that would lead to incorrect results. Therefore, the correctness of the code is **True**.
