Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it follows the problem description accurately. 

1. The program reads the input correctly: It reads the number of digits `n` and the base `b_x` of the number `X`, followed by the digits of `X`. It then reads the number of digits `m` and the base `b_y` of the number `Y`, followed by the digits of `Y`.

2. The program converts the given numbers to decimal: The function `func_1` takes a list of digits and a base as input and returns the decimal representation of the number formed by those digits in that base. This is done correctly using the formula for converting a number from any base to decimal: `decimal_value = decimal_value * base + digit`.

3. The program compares the decimal representations: After converting both numbers to decimal, the program compares them using the `<`, `>`, and `=` operators. This is correct because it will print the expected output based on the comparison.

4. The program handles all potential cases: The problem description states that the bases `b_x` and `b_y` will be between 2 and 40 (inclusive), and that the digits will be non-negative integers less than their respective bases. The program correctly handles these cases by using the `map` function to convert the input to integers and by using a loop to convert each digit to decimal.

5. The program does not have any leading zeroes issues: The problem description states that there will be no leading zeroes in the input. The program does not need to handle leading zeroes explicitly because the input is guaranteed to not have them.

6. The program assumes that both `X` and `Y` are positive: The problem description states that both `X` and `Y` will be positive. The program does not need to handle the case where either `X` or `Y` is zero or negative because the input is guaranteed to be positive.

Therefore, the program is correct and follows the problem description accurately.
