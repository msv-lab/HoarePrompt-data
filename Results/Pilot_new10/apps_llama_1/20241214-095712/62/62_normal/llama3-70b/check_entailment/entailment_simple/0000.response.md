Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately follows the problem description. Here's why:

1. The problem description requires comparing two numbers `X` and `Y` represented in different bases `bx` and `by`.
2. The program reads the input correctly, storing the number of digits `n` and base `bx` for `X`, and the number of digits `m` and base `by` for `Y`.
3. The program uses a function `func_1` to convert the digits of `X` and `Y` from their respective bases to decimal.
4. The `func_1` function works by iterating through the digits from most significant to least significant, multiplying the current result by the base, and adding the current digit. This is a standard method for converting a number from a given base to decimal.
5. The program compares the decimal equivalents of `X` and `Y` using the `if-elif-else` statement and prints the correct comparison result (`<`, `>`, or `=`).

The program handles all cases correctly, including:

* When `X` and `Y` have different numbers of digits
* When `X` and `Y` have different bases
* When `X` and `Y` are equal
* When `X` is less than `Y`
* When `X` is greater than `Y`

The program does not have any logical errors or incorrect assumptions. It correctly follows the problem description and produces the expected output for all possible inputs.
