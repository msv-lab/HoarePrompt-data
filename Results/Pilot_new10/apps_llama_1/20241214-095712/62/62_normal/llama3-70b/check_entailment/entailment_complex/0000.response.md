Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input as specified in the problem description, with two lines describing the number X and two lines describing the number Y.
2. **Base Conversion**: The program defines a function `func_1` that converts a list of digits in a given base to its decimal equivalent. This function works by iterating over the digits from most significant to least significant, multiplying the current result by the base, and adding the current digit. This is the standard method for converting a number from any base to decimal.
3. **Comparison**: After converting both numbers X and Y to their decimal equivalents using `func_1`, the program compares them and prints the correct comparison operator ('<', '>', or '=') as specified in the problem description.
4. **Edge Cases**: The problem description mentions that the input numbers will be positive and will not have leading zeroes. The program handles these cases correctly because it does not assume any specific format for the input numbers beyond what is specified.

The program does not perform explicit error checking on the input base, but this is not necessary because the problem description guarantees that the base will be between 2 and 40.

In summary, the program correctly implements the problem description by converting the input numbers from their respective bases to decimal, comparing them, and printing the correct comparison operator. It handles all potential cases as specified in the problem description.
