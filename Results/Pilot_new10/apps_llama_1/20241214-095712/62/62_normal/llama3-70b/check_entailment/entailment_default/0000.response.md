Correctness: **True**

The code provided accurately follows the problem description and should handle all potential cases correctly. 

The function `func_1` correctly converts the given digits in a specific base to their decimal equivalent. This is done by iterating over the digits from left to right (most significant to least significant), multiplying the current result by the base, and adding the current digit. This process is a standard method for converting numbers from any base to decimal.

The main part of the code then uses `func_1` to convert both numbers X and Y to decimal, and compares them to determine the output. The comparison and output logic are straightforward and align with the problem description.

The output hints provided are consistent with the code's behavior and do not indicate any potential issues. The function `func_1` handles the conversion correctly, assuming the base is between 2 and 40, as specified in the problem.

Additionally, the code handles the edge case where `digits` is empty by returning 0, which is the expected behavior for an empty list of digits (representing the number 0 in any base).

Given the provided examples and the code's logic, it seems that the program should work correctly for all potential cases within the specified constraints.
