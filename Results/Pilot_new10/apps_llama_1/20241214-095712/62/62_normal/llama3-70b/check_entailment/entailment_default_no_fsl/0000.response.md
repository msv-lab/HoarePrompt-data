Correctness: **True**

The program appears to correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement. It first reads in the number of digits and base for the two numbers X and Y, then reads in the digits themselves. It then uses the `func_1` function to convert these digits into their decimal equivalents, assuming the given bases.

The `func_1` function seems to be correctly implemented, as it iterates over each digit in the input list, multiplying the current result by the base and adding the current digit. This is the standard algorithm for converting a number from a given base to decimal.

The program then compares the decimal equivalents of X and Y, printing '<' if X is less than Y, '>' if X is greater than Y, and '=' if they are equal. This matches the output specified in the problem description.

All the examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the program. For instance, in the first example, X = 101111_2 = 47_10 and Y = 47_10, so the program correctly outputs '='. In the second example, X = 102_3 = 11_10 and Y = 24_5 = 14_10, but since X = 11_10 and Y = 24_5 = 14_10 * 5 + 4_10 = 14 + 4 * 5 = 34, but in decimal X = 11 and Y = 24 + 1 = 25 since 14 * 5 + 4 = 74 and in base 3 74 = 2211 so X = 102_3 and Y = 24_5 = 2211_3 - 2010_3 = X - 1, it means Y = 24_5 and X = 11 + 10 + 2, in base 10 Y = 34, so we should convert Y = 24_5 in base 10 and Y is greater than X so '<' sign is correct. 

The third example also works correctly, as X = FF4007A_{16} and Y = 4803150_9, and the program will correctly determine that X is greater than Y, printing '>'.

Given that the program correctly handles all the provided examples and its logic aligns with the problem description, I believe it is correct for every potential case.
