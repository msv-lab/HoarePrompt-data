The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `digits` and `base`. `digits` is a list of integers, and `base` is an integer between 2 and 40 (inclusive), with the constraint that all elements in `digits` are between 0 and `base-1`. The function returns the decimal equivalent of the number represented by `digits` in base `base`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `digits` and an integer `base`, and returns the decimal equivalent of the number represented by `digits` in base `base`.**
