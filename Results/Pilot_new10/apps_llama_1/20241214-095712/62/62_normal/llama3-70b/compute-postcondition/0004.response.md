The value of `result` is updated to be the product of the previous `result` and `base`, plus `digit`. The previous value of `result` is the first element in the list `digits`. The value of `digit` is the second element in the list `digits`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `digits` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `base` is an integer such that 2 <= `base` <= 40, all elements in `digits` are between 0 and `base`-1, `result` is equal to the first element in the list `digits` multiplied by `base` plus the second element in the list `digits`, `digit` is the second element in the list.

Output State: **`digits` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `base` is an integer such that 2 <= `base` <= 40, all elements in `digits` are between 0 and `base`-1, `result` is equal to `digits[0]` * `base` + `digits[1]`, `digit` is `digits[1]`.**
