The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a list of integers `digits` and an integer `base`. According to the annotations and the code, the function should convert the number represented by `digits` in base `base` to its decimal equivalent.

Looking at the code line by line, it seems that the function correctly performs this conversion. The loop iterates over each digit in `digits`, multiplies the current result by `base`, and adds the current digit. This process effectively converts the number from base `base` to decimal.

However, the annotations do not explicitly mention what happens if `digits` is empty. In this case, the code will return `0`, as `result` is initialized to `0` and the loop will not be executed.

Additionally, the annotations do not mention any error checking on the input `base`. The code assumes that `base` will always be between 2 and 40, but if this is not the case, the function may not work correctly.

There are no other potential edge cases or missing logic in the code. The function seems to correctly perform the conversion for all valid inputs.

Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `digits` and an integer `base`, and returns the decimal equivalent of the number represented by `digits` in base `base`, where `base` is assumed to be between 2 and 40. If `digits` is empty, the function returns 0. The function does not perform any error checking on the input `base`. **
