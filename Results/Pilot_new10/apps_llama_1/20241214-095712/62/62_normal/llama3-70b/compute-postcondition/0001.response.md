According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `digits`. If `digits` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `digits` is a list of integers, `base` is an integer such that 2 <= `base` <= 40, and all elements in `digits` are between 0 and `base`-1, and `result` is 0. For the loop to execute, `digits` must have at least 1 element and `digit` is the first element in the list.

State: **`digits` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `base` is an integer such that 2 <= `base` <= 40, all elements in `digits` are between 0 and `base`-1, `result` is 0, `digit` is the first element in the list**
