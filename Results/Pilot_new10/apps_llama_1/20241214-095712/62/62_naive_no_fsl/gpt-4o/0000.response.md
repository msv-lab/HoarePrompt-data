Correctness: **True**

The program correctly converts the given numbers from their respective bases to decimal and then compares them. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program works:

1. The program takes the number of digits and the base of the first number as input and converts it into a decimal number using the `func_1` function.

2. It then does the same for the second number.

3. The `func_1` function uses the formula for converting a number from a base to decimal, which is `decimal_value = decimal_value * base + digit`. This formula is applied to each digit of the number from most significant to least significant.

4. After converting both numbers to decimal, the program compares them and prints the result according to the problem description.

The program also handles edge cases correctly, such as when the two numbers are equal, or when one is larger than the other.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct. 

The given examples also demonstrate that the program works correctly for different inputs. 

In general, the program seems to be well-structured and easy to understand. The use of a separate function `func_1` for converting the numbers to decimal makes the code more readable and maintainable. 

Overall, the program correctly solves the problem and handles all potential cases, so I conclude that it is correct.
