Correctness: **True**

The program provided appears to correctly implement the logic required to compare two numbers represented in different bases. 

Here's why:

1. The program reads the input as specified: the number of digits and base for both numbers X and Y, followed by the digits themselves.

2. It then uses the `func_1` function to convert these numbers from their respective bases to base 10 (decimal), which allows for easy comparison. This conversion function works by iterating through the digits of the number in order from most significant to least significant, multiplying the current total by the base and adding the current digit at each step.

3. Once both numbers have been converted to base 10, the program compares them and prints out the correct comparison operator (=, <, or >) based on the result.

No potential cases were found where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The examples given in the problem description were considered and the code handles them correctly. Additionally, the conversion function `func_1` correctly handles numbers of different lengths and bases.

Therefore, the code should work correctly for any valid input according to the problem description.
