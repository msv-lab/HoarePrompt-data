Correctness: **True**

The given program appears to correctly implement the logic to compare two numbers represented in different bases. The `func_1` function correctly calculates the decimal equivalent of a number given its digits and base. The main part of the program then compares the decimal equivalents of the two numbers and prints the appropriate comparison result.

To verify the correctness of the program, let's analyze the key components:

1. The `func_1` function calculates the decimal equivalent of a number given its digits and base. This is done using the formula for converting a number from a different base to decimal, which is `decimal_value = decimal_value * base + digit`. The function iterates over each digit in the input list, applying this formula to calculate the decimal equivalent.

2. The main part of the program reads the input for the two numbers, including their digits and bases. It then calls `func_1` to calculate the decimal equivalents of both numbers.

3. The program compares the decimal equivalents of the two numbers and prints the appropriate comparison result.

The program handles the conversion from different bases to decimal correctly, and the comparison logic is straightforward. The code does not have any obvious errors or edge cases that it does not handle correctly. Therefore, it appears to be a correct implementation of the problem description.

It's worth noting that the program does not perform any error checking on the input. For example, it assumes that the input digits are valid for the given base, and it does not handle cases where the input is invalid (e.g., a digit is greater than or equal to the base). However, the problem description does not specify any error handling requirements, so this is not necessarily a flaw in the program.
