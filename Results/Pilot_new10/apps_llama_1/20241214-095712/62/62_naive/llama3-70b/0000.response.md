Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly compares two numbers represented in different bases. The `func_1` function accurately converts the digits of a number from a given base to decimal by iterating over each digit and calculating its contribution to the decimal value.

The comparison logic at the end of the program then correctly determines whether the two numbers are equal, less than, or greater than each other based on their decimal representations.

The program handles all the potential cases described in the problem statement, including numbers with different bases and numbers with the same base. The use of the `func_1` function ensures that each number is correctly converted to decimal before comparison.

The provided examples also demonstrate the correctness of the program, as the outputs match the expected results based on the decimal representations of the input numbers.

In summary, the program correctly implements the logic for comparing two numbers represented in different bases, and there is no apparent case where the program fails to work as expected.
