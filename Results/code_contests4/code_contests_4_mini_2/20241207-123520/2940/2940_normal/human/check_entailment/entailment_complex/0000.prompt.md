You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: In this problem we assume the Earth to be a completely round ball and its surface a perfect sphere. The length of the equator and any meridian is considered to be exactly 40 000 kilometers. Thus, travelling from North Pole to South Pole or vice versa takes exactly 20 000 kilometers.

Limak, a polar bear, lives on the North Pole. Close to the New Year, he helps somebody with delivering packages all around the world. Instead of coordinates of places to visit, Limak got a description how he should move, assuming that he starts from the North Pole. The description consists of n parts. In the i-th part of his journey, Limak should move ti kilometers in the direction represented by a string diri that is one of: "North", "South", "West", "East".

Limak isn’t sure whether the description is valid. You must help him to check the following conditions:

  * If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the North Pole, he can move only to the South. 
  * If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the South Pole, he can move only to the North. 
  * The journey must end on the North Pole. 



Check if the above conditions are satisfied and print "YES" or "NO" on a single line.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).

The i-th of next n lines contains an integer ti and a string diri (1 ≤ ti ≤ 106, <image>) — the length and the direction of the i-th part of the journey, according to the description Limak got.

Output

Print "YES" if the description satisfies the three conditions, otherwise print "NO", both without the quotes.

Examples

Input

5
7500 South
10000 East
3500 North
4444 West
4000 North


Output

YES


Input

2
15000 South
4000 East


Output

NO


Input

5
20000 South
1000 North
1000000 West
9000 North
10000 North


Output

YES


Input

3
20000 South
10 East
20000 North


Output

NO


Input

2
1000 North
1000 South


Output

NO


Input

4
50 South
50 North
15000 South
15000 North


Output

YES

Note

Drawings below show how Limak's journey would look like in first two samples. In the second sample the answer is "NO" because he doesn't end on the North Pole.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and for each of the next n lines, ti is a positive integer (1 ≤ ti ≤ 10^6) and diri is a string that is one of: "North", "South", "West", "East".
def func():
    HEIGHT = 20000
    f = sys.stdin
    height = HEIGHT
    n = int(f.readline())
    sat = True
    for i in range(n):
        dst, directon = f.readline().strip().split(' ')
        
        if directon not in {'South', 'North'}:
            continue
        
        if directon == 'South':
            height -= int(dst)
        elif directon == 'North':
            height += int(dst)
        else:
            raise ValueError('Invalid directon')
        
        if height < 0 or height > HEIGHT:
            sat = False
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is within the range of 1 to 50, `HEIGHT` is 20000, `height` is the final calculated height based on the inputs, `sat` is True if height is between 0 and 20000 after all iterations, otherwise `sat` is False.
    sat &= height == HEIGHT
    print('YES' if sat else 'NO')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and processes `n` lines of input, each containing a positive integer `ti` (1 ≤ ti ≤ 10^6) and a direction string (`"North"` or `"South"`). It adjusts a height variable starting from 20,000 based on the specified directions and distances. If the height goes out of bounds (less than 0 or greater than 20,000) during the iterations, it sets a flag `sat` to False. After processing all inputs, it checks if the final height is equal to 20,000 and prints 'YES' if `sat` is True and the height is 20,000; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not handle invalid direction inputs ("West" and "East") explicitly and ignores them without any alert or error.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
