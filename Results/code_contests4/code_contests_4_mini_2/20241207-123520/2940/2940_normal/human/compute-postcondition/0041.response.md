The code snippet raises a `ValueError` if the `directon` variable is not 'South' or 'North'. The previous values of the variables are not changed by this action, but the program will terminate the current operation due to the raised exception. Therefore, the output state reflects that an exception has occurred.

Output State: **`n` is within the range of 1 to 50, `HEIGHT` is 20000, `i` is 2; `ValueError` raised due to 'Invalid directon'**
