According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is within the range of 1 to 50. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. 

Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 1. In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 2.

State: **`n` is within the range of 1 to 50, `HEIGHT` is 20000, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
