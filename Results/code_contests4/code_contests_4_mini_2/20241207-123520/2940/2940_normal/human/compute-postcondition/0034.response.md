Postcondition: ***`n` is within the range of 1 to 50, `HEIGHT` is 20000, `i` is 1, and if `height` is less than 0 or greater than `HEIGHT`, then `sat` is set to False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change to `sat` or any other variable.***
