The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is within the range of 1 to 50, `HEIGHT` is 20000, `direction` is either 'South' or 'North', resulting in `height` being either less than 0 or greater than 20000, `sat` is False, and `i` is equal to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
