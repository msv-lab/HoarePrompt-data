Postcondition: ***`n` is within the range of 1 to 50, `HEIGHT` is 20000, `i` is 2; if `height` is less than 0 or greater than `HEIGHT`, `sat` is set to False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `height` is within the valid range (0 to 20000), no changes occur to the values of `sat` or the program flow.***
