The code raises a `ValueError` with the message 'Invalid direction' due to the condition that the `direction` is not 'North'. Since the other variables are unaffected by this line of code, the output state should reflect the unchanged values of the other variables alongside the raised exception.

Output State: **`n` is within the range of 1 to 50, `HEIGHT` is 20000, `height` is 20000, `sat` is True, `i` is 0; `dst` and `direction` are assigned values from the split result of the line read from `f`, and a ValueError 'Invalid direction' has been raised.**
