The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, but it processes input that consists of a positive integer `n`, followed by `n` lines where each line contains a positive integer `ti` and a string `diri` that indicates a direction ("North", "South", "West", "East"). After executing the function, it generates an output based on these inputs. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept a positive integer `n` and `n` pairs of positive integers and direction strings, and produce an output based on the processing of these inputs. 

Functionality: **The function processes a positive integer n and n pairs of positive integers and direction strings, returning an output based on the specified inputs.**
