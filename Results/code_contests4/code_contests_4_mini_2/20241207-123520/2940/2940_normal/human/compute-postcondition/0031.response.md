Postcondition: ***`n` is within the range of 1 to 50, `HEIGHT` is 20000, `i` is 1; if `direction` is 'South', `height` is decreased by `int(dst)`. If `direction` is 'North', `height` remains unchanged. For any other value of `direction`, a ValueError is raised with the message 'Invalid direction'.***
