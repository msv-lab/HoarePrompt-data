Postcondition: ***`n` is within the range of 1 to 50, `HEIGHT` is 20000, if `direction` is 'South', then `height` is decreased by `int(dst)`, with `sat` being True and `i` equal to 0. If `direction` is 'North', then `height` is increased by the value of `dst`, with `sat` being True and `i` equal to 0. If `direction` is neither 'South' nor 'North', a ValueError 'Invalid direction' is raised, `height` remains 20000, `sat` is True, and `i` is 0.***
