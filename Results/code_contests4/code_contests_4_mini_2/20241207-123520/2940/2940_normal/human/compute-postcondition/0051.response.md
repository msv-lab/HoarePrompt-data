Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and processes `n` lines of input, each containing a positive integer `ti` (1 ≤ ti ≤ 10^6) and a direction string (`"North"` or `"South"`). It adjusts a height variable starting from 20,000 based on the specified directions and distances. If the height goes out of bounds (less than 0 or greater than 20,000) during the iterations, it sets a flag `sat` to False. After processing all inputs, it checks if the final height is equal to 20,000 and prints 'YES' if `sat` is True and the height is 20,000; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not handle invalid direction inputs ("West" and "East") explicitly and ignores them without any alert or error.**
