Postcondition: ***`n` is within the range of 1 to 50, and `HEIGHT` is 20000. If `height` is less than 0 or greater than 20000, `sat` is set to False and `i` is equal to 0, indicating an exit from the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `height`, `sat`, and `i` retain their values from before the if statement execution.***
