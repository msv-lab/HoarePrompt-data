The `continue` statement does not change any variable values but causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is within the range of 1 to 50, `HEIGHT` is 20000, `i` is 1; `dst` and `direction` are assigned values from the file, and we skip the remaining code in the loop iteration.
