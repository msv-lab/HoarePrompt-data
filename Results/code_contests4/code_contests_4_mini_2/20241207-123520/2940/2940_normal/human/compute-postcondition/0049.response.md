The code checks the value of `sat`, which is updated based on the comparison of `height` with `HEIGHT`. Since `HEIGHT` is 20000, `sat` will be True if `height` equals 20000 and False otherwise. The output of the print statement will be 'YES' if `sat` is True and 'NO' if `sat` is False. Other variables remain unaffected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is within the range of 1 to 50, `HEIGHT` is 20000, `height` is the final calculated height based on the inputs, `sat` is True if `height` equals 20000, otherwise `sat` is False; print output is 'YES' if `sat` is True, otherwise 'NO'.

Output State: **`n` is within the range of 1 to 50, `HEIGHT` is 20000, `height` is the final calculated height based on the inputs, `sat` is True if `height` equals 20000, otherwise `sat` is False; print output is 'YES' if `sat` is True, otherwise 'NO'.**
