The code raises a `ValueError` with the message 'Invalid direction'. This indicates that the execution will halt due to this exception. The values of `n`, `HEIGHT`, and `i` remain unchanged, and since the exception is raised, we do not proceed with any further iterations or operations in the loop. Therefore, the output state reflects that the error occurred and the current values of the unaffected variables.

Output State: **`n` is within the range of 1 to 50, `HEIGHT` is 20000, `i` is 1; a ValueError is raised with the message 'Invalid direction'.**
