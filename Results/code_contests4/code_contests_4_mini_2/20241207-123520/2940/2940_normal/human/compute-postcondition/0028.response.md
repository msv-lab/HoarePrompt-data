The variable `height` is assigned the value of `height + int(dst)`. However, since the condition states that if `direction` is not in the set `{'South', 'North'}`, the remaining code in the loop iteration is skipped, we cannot determine if `height` is updated or remains unchanged without knowing the value of `direction`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is within the range of 1 to 50, `HEIGHT` is 20000, `i` is 1, and since the code was skipped, `height` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is within the range of 1 to 50, `HEIGHT` is 20000, `i` is 1, and `height` remains unchanged.**
