Postcondition: ***`n` is within the range of 1 to 50, `HEIGHT` is 20000, `i` is 2; if `directon` is 'South', `height` is decremented by the integer value of `dst`, resulting in `height` being `HEIGHT - int(dst)`. If `directon` is 'North', `height` is increased by the integer value of `dst`. If `directon` is neither 'South' nor 'North', a `ValueError` is raised due to 'Invalid directon'.***
