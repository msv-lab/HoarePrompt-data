Postcondition: ***`n` is within the range of 1 to 50, `HEIGHT` is 20000, if `direction` is 'North', then `height` is increased by the value of `dst`, `sat` is True, and `i` is 0. If `direction` is not 'North', a ValueError 'Invalid direction' is raised, and `height` remains 20000, with `sat` being True and `i` equal to 0.***
