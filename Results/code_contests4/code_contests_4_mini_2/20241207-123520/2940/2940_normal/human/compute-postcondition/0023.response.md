According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is within the range of 1 to 50, and `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1, making it 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1 to allow for another iteration.

State: **`n` is within the range of 1 to 50, `HEIGHT` is 20000, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1, and `i` is 1**
