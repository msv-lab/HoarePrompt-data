The code reads a line from a file, splits it into two parts based on whitespace, and assigns these parts to the variables `dst` and `directon`. The initial state indicates that `n` is within the range of 1 to 50 and does not provide specific values for `dst` or `directon`. Since we are reading from a file, the specific output values will depend on the content of the file being read.

Therefore, the output state reflects that we have read values into `dst` and `directon`, but their specific values remain unknown.

Output State: **`n` is within the range of 1 to 50, `HEIGHT` is 20000, `i` is 1; `dst` and `directon` are assigned values from the file**.
