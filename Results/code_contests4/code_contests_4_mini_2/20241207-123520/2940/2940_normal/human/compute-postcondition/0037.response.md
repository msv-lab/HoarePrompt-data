The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the closest loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is within the range of 1 to 50, `HEIGHT` is 20000, `i` is 2; `dst` and `directon` are assigned values from the line read from the file, split by space, and we continue to the next iteration of the closest loop.
