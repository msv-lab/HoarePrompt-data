Functionality: ** The function accepts three positive integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, which represent the number of cores, cycles, and cache memory cells, respectively. It processes a series of instructions for each core based on input values and determines for each core the cycle at which it last made a successful operation using the cache. The results are then printed, with each core's output representing the cycle number or zero if no successful operation occurred. The function does not handle invalid input cases or provide error messages for inputs outside the specified ranges. **
