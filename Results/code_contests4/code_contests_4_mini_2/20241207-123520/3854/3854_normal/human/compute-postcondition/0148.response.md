To determine the output state after executing the code, let's analyze the code snippet and the initial state step by step.

1. The initial state specifies that `d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`. Since `j` is 2 and `i` is 2, `d` will take the value of `ins[2][2]`. The exact value of `ins[2][2]` is not provided, but we will denote it as `d_value`.

2. The next line of code, `cell[d] = True`, indicates that the `cell` at the index `d` is set to `True`. This means the `cell` dictionary or list (depending on the context) now has `cell[d_value]` set to `True`.

3. The line `nn[d] = j` assigns the value of `j` (which is 2) to the index `d` of the `nn` array or dictionary. Thus, after this execution, `nn[d_value]` becomes 2.

4. None of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `k`, `j`, `d`, `cell`, `core`) are changed by this line of code directly, but we have updated `nn` based on the value of `d`.

The final output state summarizes the key changes that were made:

- `d` holds the value `d_value` (which is `ins[2][2]`).
- `cell[d_value]` is True.
- `nn[d_value]` is assigned the value of `j`, which is 2.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `k` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `d` is `ins[2][2]`, `cell[d]` is True, `core[j]` is 3, `nn[d]` is 2**.
