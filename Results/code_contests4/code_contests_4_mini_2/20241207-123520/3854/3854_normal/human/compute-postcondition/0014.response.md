The value of `nn[j]` is assigned 0. The variable `j` is 1, so `nn[1]` is set to 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `ins` is a list of lists with dimensions (n + 1) x m, `cell` is a list of length k + 1 with all values being False, `nn` is a list of length k + 1 with `nn[1]` being 0, `core` is a list of length (n + 1) with all values being 0, `i` is 0, and `j` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `ins` is a list of lists with dimensions (n + 1) x m, `cell` is a list of length k + 1 with all values being False, `nn` is a list of length k + 1 with `nn[1]` being 0, `core` is a list of length (n + 1) with all values being 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**.
