The code `nn[j] = 0` assigns the value 0 to the index `j` of the list `nn`. Given that `j` is 4, the code sets `nn[4]` to 0. The previous values of `nn[2]` and `nn[3]` are already set to 0, but `nn[4]` is now also set to 0. The other variables `n`, `i`, and `k` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `k` is at least 4; `nn[2]` is 0, `nn[3]` is 0, `nn[4]` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `k` is at least 4; `nn[2]` is 0, `nn[3]` is 0, `nn[4]` is 0**
