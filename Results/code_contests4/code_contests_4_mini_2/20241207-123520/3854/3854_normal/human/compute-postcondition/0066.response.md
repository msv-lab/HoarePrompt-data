The code assigns the value `0` to the index `j` of the array or list `nn`. The previous values of the affected variables are `j` is 2, and since `nn` is an array or list, we assume it is of sufficient length to accommodate index `j`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `k` are not affected by this statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is at least 1; `nn[2]` is set to 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is at least 1; `nn[2]` is set to 0**
