The variable `d` is assigned the value of `ins[3][2]`, and `cell[d]` is set to True. The value of `j` is 3. The code `nn[d] = j` assigns the value of `j` (which is 3) to the index `d` of the list or array `nn`. The states of other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State reflects the assignment made to `nn[d]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `k` is at least 1, `j` is 3, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[3][2]`, `cell[d]` is set to True, `core[3]` is 3, and `nn[d]` is assigned the value 3**.
