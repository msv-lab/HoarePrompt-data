Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is at least 1, `nn[1]` is now 1, `core[j]` is now 2, `cell[d]` is True, and `nn[d]` is not equal to 0 if `nn[d]` was initially not equal to 0. Otherwise, `nn[1]` to `nn[k]` are all still set to 0, `core[j]` is equal to 0, and if `nn[d]` was initially 0, then `nn[d]` is updated to 1.***
