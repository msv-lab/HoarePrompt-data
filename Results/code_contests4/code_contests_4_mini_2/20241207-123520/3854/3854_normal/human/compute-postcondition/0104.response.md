The variable `d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`. The index `j` is 3 and `i` is 1, which means that `ins` must be a two-dimensional structure (like a list of lists) that has at least 4 rows (since indexing starts at 0). The current values of `n`, `i`, and `j` do not affect the assignment of `d` directly, but they indicate that the loop has executed at least twice (since `i` starts at 1 and must increment for the loop to execute a third time). 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, and `d` is assigned the value of `ins[3][1]`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, and `d` is assigned the value of `ins[3][1]**
