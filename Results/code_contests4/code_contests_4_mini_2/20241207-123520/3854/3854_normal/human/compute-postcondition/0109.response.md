The value of `d` is assigned the value of `ins[3][1]`, which is not specified and depends on the context of the program. The code `nn[d] = j` assigns the value of `j` (which is 3) to the index `d` of the list or dictionary `nn`. However, the value of `d` is not known from the initial state, so we cannot specify the exact index of `nn` that is being updated.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, and `d` is assigned the value `ins[3][1]`, and we assign `j` (which is 3) to `nn[d]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[3][1]`, and `nn[d]` is assigned the value 3.**
