The variable `core[j]` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is 2, the calculation results in `core[j]` being assigned the value of `2 + 1`, which is 3. The values of `n`, `k`, `j`, and `d` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `k` is at least 1, `j` is 3, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[3][2]`, and `core[3]` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `k` is at least 1, `j` is 3, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[3][2]`, `core[3]` is 3**
