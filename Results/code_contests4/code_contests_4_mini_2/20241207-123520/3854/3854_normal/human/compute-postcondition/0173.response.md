According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented. Therefore, `i` will be 3 for the next iteration. 

Since `i` is 3, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be greater than or equal to 3**
