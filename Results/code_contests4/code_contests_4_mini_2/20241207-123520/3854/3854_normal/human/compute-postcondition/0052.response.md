The value of `d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`. The current values are `j` is 3 and `i` is 0. Therefore, `d` will be assigned the value from the list `ins` at the index `[3][0]`. The other variables `n` and `i` remain unaffected. Since we do not know the content of `ins`, we cannot specify the exact value of `d`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `d` is `ins[3][0]`**
