The code initializes a list called `ins`, which consists of `n + 1` inner lists. Each inner list contains `m` elements, all initialized to `0`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers within the specified ranges but are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the structure of the newly created list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer; `ins` is a list of lists with dimensions (n + 1) x m, initialized with zeros.**
