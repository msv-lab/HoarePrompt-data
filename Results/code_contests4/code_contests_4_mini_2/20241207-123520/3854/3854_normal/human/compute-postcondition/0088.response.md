Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is at least 1, `core[j]` is 2, and `d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`, with `d` not equal to 0. If `cell[d]` is true, then `core[j]` remains 2. If `cell[d]` is false, then `nn[1]` is updated to 1, `core[j]` is still 2, and `nn[d]` is updated to 1 if it was initially not equal to 0; otherwise, `nn[1]` to `nn[k]` remain 0, `core[j]` is set to 0, and if `nn[d]` was initially 0, then `nn[d]` is updated to 1.***
