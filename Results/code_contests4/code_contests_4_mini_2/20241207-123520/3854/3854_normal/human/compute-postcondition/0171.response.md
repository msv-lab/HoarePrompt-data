According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the condition set by `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**.
