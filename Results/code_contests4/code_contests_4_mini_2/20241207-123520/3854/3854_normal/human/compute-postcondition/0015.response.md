According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `k`. The loop iterates as long as `j` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. Since `k` is a positive integer, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will be 2 at the start of the next iteration. 

So, for the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be less than or equal to `k`, and at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `ins` is a list of lists with dimensions (n + 1) x m, `cell` is a list of length k + 1 with all values being False, `nn` is a list of length k + 1 with `nn[1]` being 0, `core` is a list of length (n + 1) with all values being 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be greater than or equal to 2**
