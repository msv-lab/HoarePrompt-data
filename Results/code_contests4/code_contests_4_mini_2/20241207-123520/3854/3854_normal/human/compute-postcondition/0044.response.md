`nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`, which is currently 2. The other variables remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `cell[d]` is set to True, `core[j]` is assigned the value 1, and `nn[d]` is assigned the value 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `cell[d]` is set to True, `core[j]` is assigned the value 1, `nn[d]` is assigned the value 2**
