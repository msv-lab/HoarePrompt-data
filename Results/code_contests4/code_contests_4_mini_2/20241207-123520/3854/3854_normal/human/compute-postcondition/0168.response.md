Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer; `core` contains values reflecting the processing of the list `ins` for indices from 1 to `n`, `cell` is a list of length `k + 1` with some True values based on the assignments made during the loop, `nn` is a list of length `k + 1` with updated values reflecting the last index where each corresponding `d` was found, and `d` is the last value assigned from `ins[j][m-1]` for `j` in the range from 1 to `n`.**
