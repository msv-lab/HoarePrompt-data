The variable `core[j]` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Here, `i` is 0, so `i + 1` equals 1. The value of `j` is 3, which means `core[3]` will be set to 1. The variable `n` and `d` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `d` is `ins[3][0]`, and `core[3]` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `d` is `ins[3][0]`, `core[3]` is 1**
