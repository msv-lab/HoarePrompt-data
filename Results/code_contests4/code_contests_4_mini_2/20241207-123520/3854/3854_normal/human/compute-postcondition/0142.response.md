Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `k` is at least 1, `j` is 1, and `nn[1]` to `nn[k]` are all set to 0. If `core[j]` is 0, then `core[j]` is updated to 3. If `d` is not equal to 0 and `cell[d]` is true, then `core[j]` remains 3. If `nn[d]` is not equal to 0, then `core[1]` and `core[nn[d]]` are set to 3, `cell[d]` is true, and `nn[d]` is updated to 1. If `nn[d]` is equal to 0, then `nn[d]` is updated to 1 and `cell[d]` remains 0. If `core[j]` is not 0, the state remains unchanged as described in the precondition.***
