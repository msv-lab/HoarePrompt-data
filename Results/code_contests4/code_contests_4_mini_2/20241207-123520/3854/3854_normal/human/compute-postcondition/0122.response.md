The code assigns the value `0` to `nn[j]`, where `j` is `3`. This means `nn[3]` is set to `0`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `k` must be at least 3, `m` must be greater than 2; `nn[2]` is set to 0, `nn[3]` is set to 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `k` must be at least 3, `m` must be greater than 2; `nn[2]` is set to 0, `nn[3]` is set to 0**
