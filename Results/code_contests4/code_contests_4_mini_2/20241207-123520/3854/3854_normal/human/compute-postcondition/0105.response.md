The variable `core[j]` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is 1, the calculation results in `core[j]` being assigned the value of `2`. The values of `n`, `j`, and `d` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[3][1]`, and `core[j]` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[3][1]`, and `core[j]` is 2**.
