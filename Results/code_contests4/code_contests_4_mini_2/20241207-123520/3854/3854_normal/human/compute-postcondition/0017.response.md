According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 3. Additionally, for the loop to run again, `k` must be at least 3 since `j` must be less than or equal to `k`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `ins` is a list of lists with dimensions (n + 1) x m, `cell` is a list of length k + 1 with all values being False, `nn` is a list of length k + 1 with `nn[1]` being 0 and `nn[2]` being 0, `core` is a list of length (n + 1) with all values being 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `k` must be greater than or equal to 3.**
