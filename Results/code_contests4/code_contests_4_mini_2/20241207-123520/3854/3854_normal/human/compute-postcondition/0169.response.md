To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the provided state and the for loop.

1. **Loop Range**: The loop is defined as `for i in xrange(1, n + 1):`. This indicates that `i` will take values starting from 1 up to `n`, inclusive.
2. **Initial Variables**: The state indicates that `n`, `m`, and `k` are all positive integers. Therefore, `n` is at least 1, which means the loop will execute at least once.
3. **Index Value**: At the start of the loop, `i` should be initialized to 1, which is the first value it will take.

Now, considering the above points:

- Since `n` is a positive integer, the condition for the loop to execute is already satisfied.
- The value of `i` will begin from 1, which is also appropriate for the first iteration.

Thus, the necessary adjustments in the state can be summarized as follows:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time**
