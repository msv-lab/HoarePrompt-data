According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. The loop will be able to execute again as long as `i` remains less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since `n` is a positive integer, we assume `n` is at least 2 for the loop to execute again. Therefore, after incrementing `i`, it will become 2. 

For the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be less than `n`. Thus, the updated state will reflect this increment.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer; `ins` is a list of lists with dimensions (n + 1) x m; `cell` is a list of length k + 1 with all values being False; `nn` is a list of length k + 1 with all values being 0; `core` is a list of length (n + 1) with all values being 0; `i` is 2; for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
