According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. This means `j` will become 3. 

For the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 3, since `j` will be compared against `n` in the next iteration. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be at least 3.**
