The variable `core[j]` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is 2, the value assigned to `core[j]` will be `2 + 1` which equals 3. The previous value of `core[j]` was 0, but it is updated to 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `k` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `nn[1]` to `nn[k]` are all set to 0, `core[1]` is 3, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[1][2]`, `d` is not equal to 0, and `cell[d]` is true.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `k` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `nn[1]` to `nn[k]` are all set to 0, `core[j]` is 3, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[1][2]`, `d` is not equal to 0, and `cell[d]` is true.**
