`nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`, where `j` is 3. The value of `d` is determined by `ins[3][0]`, but its specific value is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, `nn[d]` is set to 3, but the exact nature of `d` remains unknown. The states of the other variables `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `nn[d]` is 3 (where `d` is `ins[3][0]`)**
