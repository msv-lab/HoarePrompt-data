The value of `nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`. Given that `j` is 1, this means `nn[d]` will be set to 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `core[1]` is 1, `d` is assigned the value `ins[1][0]`, `d` is not equal to 0, `cell[d]` is True, `nn[d]` is now 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `core[1]` is 1, `d` is assigned the value `ins[1][0]`, `d` is not equal to 0, `cell[d]` is True, `nn[d]` is now 1.**
