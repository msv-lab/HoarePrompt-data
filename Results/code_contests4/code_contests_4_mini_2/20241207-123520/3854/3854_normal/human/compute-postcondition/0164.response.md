Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `k` is at least 1, `j` is 3, and `d` is assigned the value of `ins[3][2]`. If `cell[d]` is True, then `core[3]` is set to 3. Otherwise, if `nn[d]` is not 0, `cell[d]` is set to True, `core[3]` remains 3, and `nn[d]` is assigned the value 3. If `nn[d]` is 0, then `nn[d]` is updated to 3.***
