The value of `nn[j]` is assigned the value 0. Given that `j` is 3, this means that `nn[3]` is set to 0. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `k`, and `nn[2]`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `k` is at least 3; `nn[2]` is set to 0; `nn[3]` is set to 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `k` is at least 3; `nn[2]` is set to 0; `nn[3]` is set to 0**
