The value of `core[j]` is assigned the value of `core[nn[d]]`, which is determined by the condition that `d` is not equal to 0 and `nn[d]` is not equal to 0. Since `core[j]` is initially 0, it will now be updated. 

`core[nn[d]]` will be evaluated using the value of `nn[d]`, which is not 0. As a result, `core[nn[d]]` is assigned the value of `i + 1`, where `i` is 1. Therefore, `core[nn[d]]` will be equal to 2.

Thus, the final assignment will be:
- `core[j]` now holds the value of `core[nn[d]]`, which is 2.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is at least 1, `nn[1]` to `nn[k]` are all set to 0, `core[j]` is now 2, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`, `cell[d]` is True, and `nn[d]` is not equal to 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is at least 1, `nn[1]` to `nn[k]` are all set to 0, `core[j]` is now 2, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`, `cell[d]` is True, and `nn[d]` is not equal to 0.**
