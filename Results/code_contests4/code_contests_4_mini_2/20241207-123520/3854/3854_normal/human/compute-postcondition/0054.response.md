In this case, the statement `cell[d] = True` assigns the value `True` to the index `d` of the array or list `cell`. The variable `d` is defined as `ins[3][0]`, but the specific value of `d` is not given in the initial state, and we don't have information about the contents of `ins`. Other variables (`n`, `i`, and `j`) remain unaffected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, and `cell[d]` is set to True.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, and `cell[d]` is set to True.**
