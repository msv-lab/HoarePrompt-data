According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be increased by 1, making it 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer; `ins` is a list of lists with dimensions (n + 1) x m; `cell` is a list of length k + 1 with all values being False; `nn` is a list of length k + 1 with all values being 0; `core` is a list of length (n + 1) with all values being 0; `i` is 1; for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1.**
