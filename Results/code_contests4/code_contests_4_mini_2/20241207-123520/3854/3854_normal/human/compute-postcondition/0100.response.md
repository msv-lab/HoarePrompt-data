Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is at least 1, `core[j]` is 2, and `d` is assigned the value of `ins[2][1]`. If `cell[d]` is true, the state of the program remains unchanged. If `cell[d]` is false and `nn[d]` is not 0, then `core[nn[d]]` is assigned the value 2, and `nn[d]` is updated to 2. If `nn[d]` was originally 0, then `nn[d]` is now 2.***
