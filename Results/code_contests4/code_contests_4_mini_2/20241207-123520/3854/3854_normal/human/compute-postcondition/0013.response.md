According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to k + 1. For the loop to execute at least once, `j` should take on the value of 1 during the first iteration. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `ins`, `cell`, `nn`, and `core` do not directly influence the execution of the loop since the loop's execution solely depends on `k`. As `k` is a positive integer, it ensures that the range includes at least one value (1). 

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `j` is 1, the first value in the range from 1 to k + 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `ins` is a list of lists with dimensions (n + 1) x m, `cell` is a list of length k + 1 with all values being False, `nn` is a list of length k + 1 with all values being 0, `core` is a list of length (n + 1) with all values being 0, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 1**
