According to the code, the for loop is designed to iterate over the range from 1 to `n + 1`, which means it will execute `n` times. The variable `j` is initialized with the value 1 at the end of the previous iteration. Since `j` must be less than or equal to `n` to continue executing the loop, we need to check the relationship between `j` and `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute a second time, `j` will be incremented by 1, which would make `j` equal to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is at least 1, `core[j]` is 2, and for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.**
