According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer, the starting value for `j` in the loop is 1, and the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`. 

At the start of the loop, `j` needs to be set to 1 (which is its initial value in the loop), and the loop will execute for the first time because `n` is positive, ensuring that `j` can go up to `n`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
