Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, and `d` is `ins[2][0]`. If `core[3]` is equal to 0 and `d` is not equal to 0, then if `cell[d]` is True, `core[3]` is set to 1. If `nn[d]` is not 0, `cell[d]` is True, `core[3]` is set to 1, and `nn[d]` is updated to 3. If `nn[d]` is 0, it remains 3. If `core[3]` is not equal to 0, no changes are made to `core[3]`, `cell[d]`, or `nn[d]`.***
