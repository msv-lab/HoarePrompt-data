The code assigns the value of `j` to `nn[d]`. Initially, `nn[d]` is equal to 0, and now it will be changed to the value of `j`, which is 1. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is at least 1, `nn[1]` to `nn[k]` are all set to 0, `core[j]` is equal to 0; `d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`, `d` is not equal to 0, `cell[d]` is equal to 0, and `nn[d]` is equal to 1.**
