Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `d` is assigned the value `ins[1][0]`, and `d` is not equal to 0. If `nn[d]` is not 0, then `core[j]` is updated to 1 and `cell[d]` becomes True with `nn[d]` now equal to 1. Otherwise, if `nn[d]` is 0, `cell[d]` remains false and `nn[d]` is updated to 1.***
