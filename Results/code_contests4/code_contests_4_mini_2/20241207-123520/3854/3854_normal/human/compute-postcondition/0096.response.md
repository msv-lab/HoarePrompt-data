The variable `nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`, and `j` is 2. Therefore, after execution, `nn[d]` will hold the value 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Hence, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is at least 1, `core[j]` is 2, `core[nn[d]]` is assigned the value 2, and `nn[d]` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is at least 1, `core[j]` is 2, `core[nn[d]]` is assigned the value 2, and `nn[d]` is 2.**
