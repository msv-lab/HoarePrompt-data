According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and since `n` is a positive integer, the loop can execute again as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 2. After the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will become 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**
