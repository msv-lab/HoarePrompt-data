According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the integer `n`. The loop will iterate from 1 to `n`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. 

Thus, for the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. Since `n` is a positive integer, `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `k` is at least 1, `j` is 2, and for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.**
