`nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`, and `j` is 3, so after execution, `nn[d]` is 3. The values of `n`, `i`, `cell[d]`, and `core[j]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `cell[d]` is set to True, `core[3]` is 2, and `nn[d]` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `cell[d]` is set to True, `core[3]` is 2, and `nn[d]` is 3**.
