The loop initializes each element of the list `nn` from index 1 to `k` to 0. After `k` iterations, all indices of `nn` from 1 to `k` will be set to 0. The variable `j` will take values from 1 to `k`, and after the loop completes, `j` will be `k + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `j` is `k + 1`, `k` is at least 1; `nn[1]` to `nn[k]` are all set to 0.**
