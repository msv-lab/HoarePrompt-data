`nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`, where `j` is 1. The previous value of `nn[d]` is 0, and the condition `nn[d] == 0` holds true, so the assignment is valid. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `k` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `nn[1]` to `nn[k]` are all set to 0, the value of `core[j]` is 0, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[1][2]`, and `d` is not equal to 0, the value of `cell[d]` is 0, `nn[d]` is now 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `k` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `nn[1]` to `nn[k]` are all set to 0, the value of `core[j]` is 0, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[1][2]`, and `d` is not equal to 0, the value of `cell[d]` is 0, `nn[d]` is now 1.**
