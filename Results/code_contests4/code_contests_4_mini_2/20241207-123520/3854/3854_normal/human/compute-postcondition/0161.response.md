The variable `d` is assigned the value `ins[3][2]`, which is not specified in the initial state but implies that `ins` is a data structure that can be indexed. The variable `j` is 3, so `nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`, resulting in `nn[d]` being 3. The values of `n`, `i`, `k`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `k` is at least 1, `j` is 3, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[3][2]`, and `nn[d]` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `k` is at least 1, `j` is 3, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[3][2]`, and `nn[d]` is 3.**
