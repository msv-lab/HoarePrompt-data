`core[j]` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The current value of `i` is 1, so `i + 1` equals 2. Therefore, `core[j]`, which corresponds to `core[2]`, is updated to 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is at least 1, `core[j]` is 2 (updated to 2), `d` is assigned the value of `ins[2][1]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is at least 1, `core[j]` is 2, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[2][1]**
