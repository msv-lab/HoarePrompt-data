After analyzing the loop code and the initial state, here is the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished executing. The loop iterates from 1 to `k`, setting each corresponding index of the list `nn` to 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `ins` is a list of lists with dimensions (n + 1) x m, `cell` is a list of length k + 1 with all values being False, `nn` is a list of length k + 1 with all values being 0, `core` is a list of length (n + 1) with all values being 0, `i` is 0, `j` is k.**
