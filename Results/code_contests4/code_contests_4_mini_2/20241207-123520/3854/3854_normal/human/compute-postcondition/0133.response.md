The statement `core[j] = core[nn[d]] = i + 1` involves multiple assignments. First, we need to evaluate `i + 1`. Given that `i` is 2, we calculate:

1. `i + 1` equals `2 + 1`, which results in `3`.

Next, we need to evaluate `nn[d]`. We know:
- `d` is assigned the value of `ins[1][2]`, which is some positive integer (not specifically defined but known to be valid for `nn`).
- `nn[d]` is not equal to 0, meaning it holds a positive value.

Assuming `nn[d]` returns a valid index (let's denote this as `m`), we can assign:

2. `core[j]` will be assigned the value of `core[m]` which is also set to `3`.

Finally, the variables are updated as follows:
- `core[j]` is set to `3`.
- The value of `core[nn[d]]` is also set to `3`, but since `core` is indexed by `m`, we don't know its prior value.

The values of `n`, `k`, `j`, `nn`, and `cell` are unaffected by this assignment, and `core` at index `j` and `nn[d]` is now `3`. 

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `k` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `nn[1]` to `nn[k]` are all set to 0, `core[1]` is 3, `core[nn[d]]` is also 3, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[1][2]`, `cell[d]` is True, and `nn[d]` is not equal to 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `k` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `nn[1]` to `nn[k]` are all set to 0, `core[1]` is 3, `core[nn[d]]` is 3, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[1][2]`, `cell[d]` is True, and `nn[d]` is not equal to 0.**
