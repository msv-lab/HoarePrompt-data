According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute `n` times, where `i` will take values from `0` to `n-1`. 

Since `n` is provided as a positive integer, it means that `n` is at least 1, which ensures that the loop can execute at least once. At the start of the loop, `i` should be initialized to `0` for the first iteration.

Thus, the states before the loop starts do not require any adjustments for the loop to execute:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer; `ins` is a list of lists with dimensions (n + 1) x m; `cell` is a list of length k + 1 with all values being False; `nn` is a list of length k + 1 with all values being 0; `core` is a list of length (n + 1) with all values being 0; `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time.**
