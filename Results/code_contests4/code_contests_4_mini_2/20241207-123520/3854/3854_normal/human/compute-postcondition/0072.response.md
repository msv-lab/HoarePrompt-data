According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is given as a positive integer, the loop will execute at least once because the range is from 1 to `n + 1`, which ensures that there will be iterations for each value from 1 to `n`. 

The variable `j` will take values starting from 1 up to `n`. Before the loop starts, `i` is 1, `k` is at least 1, and `nn[1]` to `nn[k]` are all set to 0, which does not affect the execution of the loop directly.

Thus, for the loop to execute for the first time, `j` will be 1. The other variables do not directly impact the loop's execution state but provide context for the overall program state.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is at least 1, `nn[1]` to `nn[k]` are all set to 0, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 1**
