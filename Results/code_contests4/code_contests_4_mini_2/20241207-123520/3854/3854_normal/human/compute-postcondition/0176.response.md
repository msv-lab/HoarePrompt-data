The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `k`. Here, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of cores (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is a positive integer representing the number of cycles (1 ≤ m ≤ 100), and `k` is a positive integer representing the number of cache memory cells (1 ≤ k ≤ 100). Additionally, the function processes `n` lines of `m` integers, where each integer `xij` satisfies the condition 0 ≤ xij ≤ k. The function returns a result based on the provided instructions for each core over the specified cycles. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (number of cores), m (number of cycles), and k (number of cache memory cells), and processes the instructions for each core, returning a result based on these inputs.**
