Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `k` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `nn[1]` to `nn[k]` are all set to 0, `core[j]` is updated to 3, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[1][2]`, and `d` is not equal to 0. If `cell[d]` is true, then `core[j]` is set to 3. Otherwise, if `nn[d]` is not equal to 0, then `core[1]` is set to 3, `core[nn[d]]` is set to 3, `cell[d]` is true, and `nn[d]` is updated to 1. If `nn[d]` is equal to 0, `nn[d]` is updated to 1, and the value of `cell[d]` remains 0.***
