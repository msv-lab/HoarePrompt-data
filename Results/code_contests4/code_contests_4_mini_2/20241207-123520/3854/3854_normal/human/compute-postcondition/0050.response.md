Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `d` is `ins[2][0]`. If `core[j]` is 0 and `d` is not 0, if `cell[d]` is True, then `core[j]` is set to 1. If `nn[d]` is not 0, `cell[d]` is set to True, `core[j]` is assigned the value 1, and `nn[d]` is assigned the value 2. If `nn[d]` is 0, then `nn[d]` is set to 2 while `cell[d]` remains unchanged. If `d` equals 0, no changes are made to `cell[d]`, `core[j]`, or `nn[d]`.***
