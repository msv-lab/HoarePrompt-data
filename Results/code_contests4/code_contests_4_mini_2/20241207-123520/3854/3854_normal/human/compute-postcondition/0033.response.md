The variable `nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`. Since `j` is 1, the value of `nn[d]` will be updated to 1. The previous conditions state that `nn[d]` is equal to 0 prior to this assignment, but now it will change to 1. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `j`, `core`, `d`, `cell`, and `nn`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `core[j]` is 0, `d` is assigned the value `ins[1][0]`, `d` is not equal to 0, `cell[d]` is false, `nn[d]` is equal to 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `core[j]` is 0, `d` is assigned the value `ins[1][0]`, `d` is not equal to 0, `cell[d]` is false, `nn[d]` is equal to 1.**
