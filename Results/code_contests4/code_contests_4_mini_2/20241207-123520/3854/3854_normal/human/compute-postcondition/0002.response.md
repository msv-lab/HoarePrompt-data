The variable `cell` is assigned a list of boolean values, all initialized to `False`, with a length of `k + 1`. This means the `cell` list will contain `k + 1` elements, all of which are `False`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `ins` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer; `ins` is a list of lists with dimensions (n + 1) x m; `cell` is a list of length k + 1 with all values being False.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer; `ins` is a list of lists with dimensions (n + 1) x m; `cell` is a list of length k + 1 with all values being False.**
