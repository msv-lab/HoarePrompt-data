According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `j`, which starts at 1 and runs while `j` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3, and it is stated that `k` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Thus, `j` will become 4.

For the loop to execute again, `k` must be greater than or equal to 4, since the loop continues as long as `j` is less than or equal to `k`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `k` is at least 4.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `k` is at least 4; `nn[2]` is set to 0; `nn[3]` is set to 0**
