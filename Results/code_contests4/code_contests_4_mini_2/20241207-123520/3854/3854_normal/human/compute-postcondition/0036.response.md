Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `d` is assigned the value `ins[1][0]`, which is not equal to 0. If `cell[d]` is true, then the element at index `j` of `core` is 1. Otherwise, if `nn[d]` is not 0, `core[j]` is updated to 1, `cell[d]` becomes true, and `nn[d]` is equal to 1. If `nn[d]` is 0, `cell[d]` remains false and `nn[d]` is updated to 1.***
