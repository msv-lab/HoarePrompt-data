Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `k` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `nn[1]` to `nn[k]` are all set to 0, the value of `core[j]` is 0, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[1][2]`, and `d` is not equal to 0, the value of `cell[d]` is 0. If `nn[d]` was previously 0, then `nn[d]` is updated to 1.***
