Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `k` is at least 1, `j` is 2, and `d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`. If `core[j]` is 3, then `cell[d]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `nn[d]` is not 0, then `cell[d]` is True and `nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`, which is 2. If `nn[d]` is 0, then `nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j` (2), while the other variables remain unchanged.***
