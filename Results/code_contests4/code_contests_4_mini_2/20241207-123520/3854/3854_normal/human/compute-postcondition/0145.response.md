The variable `core[j]` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The value of `i` is 2, so after execution, `core[j]` will be assigned the value of `2 + 1`, which is 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `k` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`, and `core[j]` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `k` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`, and `core[j]` is 3**.
