According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `k`. The loop iterates while `j` is in the range from 1 to `k + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. Since `k` is at least 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will be 3 for the next iteration. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be at least 3 (since the loop ends when `j` exceeds `k`). 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `k` is at least 3; `nn[2]` is set to 0**
