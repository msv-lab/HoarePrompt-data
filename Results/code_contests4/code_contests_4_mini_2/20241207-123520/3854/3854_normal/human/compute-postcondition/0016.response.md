The value of `nn[j]` is assigned `0`, where `j` is `2`. Since `nn` is a list of length `k + 1`, and `nn[1]` is `0`, `nn[2]` (the value at index `j`) is also set to `0`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `ins` is a list of lists with dimensions (n + 1) x m, `cell` is a list of length k + 1 with all values being False, `nn` is a list of length k + 1 with `nn[1]` being 0 and `nn[2]` being 0, `core` is a list of length (n + 1) with all values being 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `ins` is a list of lists with dimensions (n + 1) x m, `cell` is a list of length k + 1 with all values being False, `nn` is a list of length k + 1 with `nn[1]` being 0 and `nn[2]` being 0, `core` is a list of length (n + 1) with all values being 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2.**
