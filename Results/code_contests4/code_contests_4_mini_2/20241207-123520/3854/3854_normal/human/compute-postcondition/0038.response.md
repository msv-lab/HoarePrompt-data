Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and if `core[j]` is 0, then `d` is assigned the value `ins[1][0]`. If `d` is not equal to 0, and if `cell[d]` is true, the element at index `j` of `core` is set to 1. If `cell[d]` is false but `nn[d]` is not 0, then `core[j]` is updated to 1, `cell[d]` becomes true, and `nn[d]` is set to 1. If `nn[d]` is 0, `cell[d]` remains false, and `nn[d]` is updated to 1. If `core[j]` is not 0, the program remains unchanged.***
