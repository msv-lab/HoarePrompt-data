The assignment `core[j] = i + 1` sets the value of `core[j]` to `i + 1`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so `i + 1` equals 2. The variable `core[j]` is updated accordingly. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is at least 1, `nn[1]` to `nn[k]` are all set to 0, `core[j]` is 2, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`, `d` is not equal to 0, and `cell[d]` is true.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is at least 1, `nn[1]` to `nn[k]` are all set to 0, `core[j]` is 2, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`, `d` is not equal to 0, and `cell[d]` is true.**
