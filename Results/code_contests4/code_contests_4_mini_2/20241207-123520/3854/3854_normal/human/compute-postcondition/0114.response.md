Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, and if `core[j]` is 0, then `d` is assigned the value of `ins[3][1]`. If `d` is not equal to 0 and `cell[d]` is True, then `core[j]` is set to 2. If `nn[d]` is not equal to 0, then `cell[d]` is set to True, `core[3]` is set to 2, and `nn[d]` is assigned the value 3. If `nn[d]` equals 0, then `nn[d]` is assigned the value 3. If `d` equals 0, there are no changes to the variables.***
