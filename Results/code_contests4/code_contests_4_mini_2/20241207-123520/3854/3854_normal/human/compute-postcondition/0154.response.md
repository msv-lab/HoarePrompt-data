Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `k` is at least 1, `j` is 2, and if `core[j]` is 0, then `d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`. If `d` is not equal to 0 and `core[j]` is 3, then `cell[d]` remains unchanged. If `nn[d]` is not 0, then `cell[d]` is set to True and `nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`, which is 2. If `nn[d]` is 0, then `nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j` (2), while the other variables remain unchanged. If `d` equals 0, the state of all variables remains unchanged.***
