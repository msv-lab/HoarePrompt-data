In the given code snippet, `nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`. The variable `j` is currently 2, and the variable `d` has been assigned the value of `ins[2][1]`. The value of `d` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is known to be an integer. The variable `nn` is assumed to be defined and mutable, allowing us to assign the value of `j` to the index `d`.

Since the assignment does not change the values of `n`, `i`, `k`, `core[j]`, or `d`, we need to report the new state of the variables, highlighting that `nn[d]` is now equal to `j`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is at least 1, `core[j]` is 2, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[2][1]`, and `nn[d]` is now 2.**
