The code assigns the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())` to `ins[i + 1]`. The value of `i` is currently 2, so `i + 1` equals 3. The `raw_input()` function would take input from the user, split it into separate string components, and then convert each string to an integer, creating a list of integers.

However, since we don't know the input value provided by the user, we cannot determine the exact contents of `ins[i + 1]`. Therefore, the previous values of the affected variables are unchanged, and the only change is that `ins[3]` will hold a list of integers based on user input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer; `ins` is a list of lists with dimensions (n + 1) x m; `cell` is a list of length k + 1 with all values being False; `nn` is a list of length k + 1 with all values being 0; `core` is a list of length (n + 1) with all values being 0; `i` is 2; `ins[3]` is a list of integers based on user input.**
