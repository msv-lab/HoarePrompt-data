Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `j` is `n`, `k` is at least 1, `core[j]` is 2 if `core[j]` was updated during the iterations, `nn[1]` to `nn[k]` may contain the last updated indices or remain 0 if not modified, and the values of `core` and `cell` depend on the values in `ins` and the conditions met during the loop iterations.**
