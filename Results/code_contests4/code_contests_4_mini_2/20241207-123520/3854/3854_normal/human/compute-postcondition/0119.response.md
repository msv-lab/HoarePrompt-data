According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `k`. The loop executes for values of `j` starting from 1 up to `k`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `k` is at least 1, which means the loop could execute again. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 2. Since `k` is at least 1, the loop will still be able to run because the new value of `j` (2) will be within the range defined by `k`. However, we also know that `m` must be greater than 2, but that does not affect the loop execution directly.

Thus, for the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be 2, and `k` remains unchanged. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is at least 1, `m` must be greater than 2; `nn[j]` is set to 0.**
