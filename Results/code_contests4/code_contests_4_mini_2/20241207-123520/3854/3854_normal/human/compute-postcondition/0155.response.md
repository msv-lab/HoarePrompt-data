According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3. Thus, for the loop to be executed one more time, `n` must be at least 3.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `k` is at least 1, `j` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be at least 3.**
