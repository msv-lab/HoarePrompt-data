The variable `nn` is assigned a list containing `k + 1` zeros, initialized to `[0, 0, ..., 0]` (total `k + 1` elements). The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `ins`, and `cell` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer; `ins` is a list of lists with dimensions (n + 1) x m; `cell` is a list of length k + 1 with all values being False; `nn` is a list of length k + 1 with all values being 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer; `ins` is a list of lists with dimensions (n + 1) x m; `cell` is a list of length k + 1 with all values being False; `nn` is a list of length k + 1 with all values being 0.**
