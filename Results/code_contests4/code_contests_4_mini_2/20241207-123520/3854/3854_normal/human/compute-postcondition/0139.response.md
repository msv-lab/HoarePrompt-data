Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `k` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `nn[1]` to `nn[k]` are all set to 0, if `nn[d]` is not equal to 0, then `core[1]` is 3, `core[nn[d]]` is 3, `cell[d]` is True, and `nn[d]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `nn[d]` is updated to 1, and the value of `cell[d]` remains 0.***
