The value of `nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`, where `j` is currently 1. The previous values of the affected variables are: `nn[1]` to `nn[k]` are all set to 0 and `core[j]` is 2. Since `cell[d]` is True and `nn[d]` is not equal to 0, we are updating `nn[d]` to 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is at least 1, `nn[1]` is now 1 (since `d` must be 1), `core[j]` is now 2, `cell[d]` is True, and `nn[d]` is not equal to 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is at least 1, `nn[1]` is now 1, `core[j]` is now 2, `cell[d]` is True, and `nn[d]` is not equal to 0.**
