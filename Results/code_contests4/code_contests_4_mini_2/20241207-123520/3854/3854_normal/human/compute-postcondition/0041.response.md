The variable `core[j]` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The current value of `i` is 0, so `i + 1` equals 1. Thus, `core[j]` will be updated to 1. The values of `n`, `j`, and `d` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `d` is ins[2][0], `core[j]` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `d` is ins[2][0], `core[j]` is 1**
