The value of `d` is assigned the value of `ins[3][1]`, which is not specified in the initial state, but it is a variable that is determined by the input structure `ins`. The code snippet `cell[d] = True` sets the value at index `d` of the `cell` array or dictionary to `True`. The values of the other variables `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, and `cell[d]` is set to True.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, and `cell[d]` is set to True**
