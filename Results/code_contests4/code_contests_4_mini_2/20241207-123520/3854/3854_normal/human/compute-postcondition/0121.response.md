According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit defined by `k`. The loop is currently at `j` equal to 2, and it will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `k`. Since the last iteration had `j` at 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented to 3. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know `k` is at least 1, meaning the loop can execute again if `j` (now 3) is less than or equal to `k`. Therefore, for the loop to execute a third time, `k` must be at least 3.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `k` must be at least 3, `m` must be greater than 2; `nn[2]` is set to 0**
