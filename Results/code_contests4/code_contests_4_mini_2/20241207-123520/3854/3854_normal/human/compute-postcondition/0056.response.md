The assignment `nn[d] = j` assigns the value of `j`, which is 3, to the index `d` of the list `nn`. The value of `d` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact index affected. However, the state of the other variables remains unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `cell[d]` is True; `core[3]` is 1; `nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`, which is 3.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `cell[d]` is True; `core[3]` is 1; `nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`, which is 3.**
