According to the code, the loop will execute for `j` starting from 1 up to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to increase by 1. Therefore, `j` will become 3. 

Since the loop condition is `for j in xrange(1, n + 1)`, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 3 (since `j` is now 3). 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, and `d` is `ins[2][0]`, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be at least 3.**
