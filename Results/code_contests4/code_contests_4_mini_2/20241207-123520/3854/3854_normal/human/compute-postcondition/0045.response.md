To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is a positive integer
   - `i` is 0
   - `j` is 2
   - `d` is `ins[2][0]` (the value of `d` is derived from the list `ins`)

2. **Code Execution**: 
   - The code snippet `nn[d] = j` assigns the value of `j` (which is 2) to the index `d` of the list or dictionary `nn`.

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - The values of `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.
   - The variable `d` is determined by the value of `ins[2][0]`, which is not specified but is necessary for the assignment to `nn[d]`.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged values of `n`, `i`, and `j`, while indicating that `nn[d]` has been set to 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `nn[d]` is set to 2**
