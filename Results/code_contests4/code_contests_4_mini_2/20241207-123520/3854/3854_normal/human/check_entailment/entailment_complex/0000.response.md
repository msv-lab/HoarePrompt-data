To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the program's logic and how it aligns with the requirements.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. We have `n` cores and `k` memory cells.
2. Each core can execute `m` instructions per cycle.
3. Instructions can either be "do nothing" (0) or write to a memory cell (1 to k).
4. If multiple cores try to write to the same cell in the same cycle, a deadlock occurs, causing those cores and the cell to be locked.
5. The output should indicate the cycle when each core gets locked (or 0 if it never locks).

### Program Logic:
1. The program reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
2. It initializes lists for instructions (`ins`), cell states (`cell`), last successful write indices (`nn`), and core lock states (`core`).
3. It fills the instructions for each core.
4. It simulates each cycle, checking for conflicts:
   - If a core tries to write to a locked cell, it locks that core.
   - If a core tries to write to a cell that has already been locked by another core, it also locks the current core.
   - If a cell is available (not locked), the core can write to it and mark it as locked for future cycles.

### Verification:
- The program handles locking correctly:
  - It checks if a core's instruction tries to write to an already locked cell.
  - It updates the lock state of cores and memory cells correctly based on conflicts.
- The output provides the correct cycle number for each core based on whether it got locked and when.

### Conclusion:
The program accurately implements the logic required by the problem description and correctly simulates the behavior of the multi-core processor under the specified conditions. Given that it properly tracks the locking mechanism as described and outputs the correct cycle for each core, we conclude:

Correctness: **True**
