n is a positive integer representing the number of cores (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), m is a positive integer representing the number of cycles (1 ≤ m ≤ 100), k is a positive integer representing the number of cache memory cells (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), and the instructions for each core are provided as n lines of m integers where each integer xij satisfies 0 ≤ xij ≤ k.
