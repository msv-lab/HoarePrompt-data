To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to evaluate the logic of the BMI calculation and whether the program handles the input and output requirements correctly.

The problem requires us to calculate BMI using the formula:
\[ \text{BMI} = \frac{\text{weight}}{\text{height}^2} \]

The program reads input in the form of `s, w, h` where:
- `s` is the student ID (an integer)
- `w` is the weight (a real number)
- `h` is the height (a real number)

It then checks if the calculated BMI is 25 or above, and if so, it prints the student ID.

### Key Observations:
1. **BMI Calculation**: The program calculates BMI correctly with the expression `float(weight) / float(height) ** 2`.
2. **Input Handling**: The program splits the input correctly on commas, handling the student ID, weight, and height appropriately.
3. **Output**: It prints the student ID directly if the BMI condition is met.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
- **Minimum Input Values**: If a student has the minimum weight (1.0) and height (1.0), the BMI would be calculated as 1.0, which is below 25. The program should not print this ID.
- **Exact BMI of 25**: If a student has a weight of 61.25 kg and height of 1.75 m, the BMI would be exactly 25. The program should print this ID.
- **Boundary Cases**: The program should accurately handle students with heights and weights that yield BMI values close to 25 (like 24.9999).

### Possible Case for Failure:
If we consider a case where:
- Student ID: 1006
- Weight: 62.5 kg
- Height: 1.75 m
Calculating the BMI:
\[ \text{BMI} = \frac{62.5}{(1.75)^2} = \frac{62.5}{3.0625} = 20.416 \]
This BMI is below 25, so it should not print the ID. The program correctly handles this case.

However, if we take:
- Student ID: 1007
- Weight: 70 kg
- Height: 1.60 m
Calculating the BMI:
\[ \text{BMI} = \frac{70}{(1.60)^2} = \frac{70}{2.56} = 27.34375 \]
This BMI is above 25, and the ID should be printed, which the program does.

### Conclusion:
After careful consideration, the program correctly implements the BMI calculation and checks if the BMI is 25 or above. It handles the input format properly and should function correctly for the defined input constraints.

Correctness: **True**.
