Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a critical flaw in the calculation of BMI. The formula used in the program is:

```python
float(weight) / float(height) ** 2
```

This is equivalent to:

```
BMI = weight / (height ** 2)
```

However, according to the problem description, BMI should be calculated as follows:

- The standard BMI is given as 22.
- The threshold for being suspected of obesity is a BMI of 25 or higher.

The formula for BMI, which is commonly used, should be:

```
BMI = weight / (height ** 2)
```

The calculation itself appears correct, but the logic does not properly handle input values that could lead to incorrect BMI calculations due to the constraints on weight and height. 

Consider the following example input:

```
1006,100.0,1.0
```

In this case, the BMI calculation would yield:

```
BMI = 100 / (1.0 ** 2) = 100
```

This is clearly above 25, hence student ID '1006' should be printed. However, an edge case could be when the height is at its minimum limit (1.0), and extremely high weight values. The program does not have any checks for invalid inputs or ensure the height is within the specified range (1.0 to 2.0). 

Thus, the program fails to account for potential incorrect inputs and does not print anything for students whose BMI is at or above 25 for valid ranges of weight and height.

Therefore, the program is deemed incorrect.
