The function `func` does not accept any input parameters directly, as indicated by the absence of parameters in the function definition. Instead, it processes input consisting of up to 50 lines, each containing a student ID, weight, and height in a specific format. The student ID is an integer between 1 and 2000, the weight is a real number between 1 and 200, and the height is a real number between 1.0 and 2.0.

Upon processing this input, the function likely returns a collection of results based on the provided data, although the exact nature of the output is not specified in the provided details. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process a predefined input format containing student IDs, weights, and heights, and return results based on this data.

Functionality: **The function processes input consisting of up to 50 lines with each line containing a student ID (integer between 1 and 2000), weight (real number between 1 and 200), and height (real number between 1.0 and 2.0), and returns results based on this data.**
