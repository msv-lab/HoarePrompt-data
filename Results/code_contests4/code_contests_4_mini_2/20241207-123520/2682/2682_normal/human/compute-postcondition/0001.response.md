The code snippet takes the variable `line`, which contains a string formatted as "si, wi, hi", and splits it by the comma delimiter into three new variables: `number`, `weight`, and `height`. Each of these variables is assigned the corresponding part of the input string. 

Since the initial state indicates that there is at least one line of input, we can assume that `line` is a valid string containing the data. The values of `number`, `weight`, and `height` will depend on the specific input provided.

The output state reflects that the variables `number`, `weight`, and `height` are now assigned values based on the input.

Output State: **`number`, `weight`, `height` are assigned values from the input "si, wi, hi"**
