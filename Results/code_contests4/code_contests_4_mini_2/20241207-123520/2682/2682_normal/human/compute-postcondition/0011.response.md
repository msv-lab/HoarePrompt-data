The code `print(number)` outputs the value of `number`. The values of `weight` and `height` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `number` is the value obtained from the input, `weight` is the value obtained from the input, `height` is the value obtained from the input, and `number` is printed.

Output State: **`number` is the value obtained from the input, `weight` is the value obtained from the input, `height` is the value obtained from the input, and `number` is printed.**
