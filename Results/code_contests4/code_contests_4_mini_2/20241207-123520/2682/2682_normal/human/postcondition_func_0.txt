The function processes input consisting of up to 50 lines, each containing a student ID (an integer between 1 and 2000), weight (a real number between 1 and 200), and height (a real number between 1.0 and 2.0). It calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) for each entry and prints the student ID for those entries where the BMI is 25.0 or greater. If the input is empty or no entries meet the BMI condition, nothing is printed. The function does not return any value.
