Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly calculate the BMI according to the specified formula. The BMI calculation should be based on the formula:

\[ \text{BMI} = \frac{\text{weight}}{\text{height}^2} \]

However, in the annotated program, the BMI is calculated as:

```python
float(weight) / float(height) ** 2
```

This part is correct. The calculation itself is fine, but there are other issues with the program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `stdin` to read input, which is not defined in the provided context. It should explicitly handle input reading, especially since there could be multiple lines of input.

2. **Output Formatting**: The problem description specifies that the output should be the student ID numbers of students with a BMI of 25 or higher in the order they were entered. The current implementation prints each qualifying student ID directly, which may not comply with the expected output format (all IDs in one line).

3. **Lack of Input Termination**: The annotated code does not specify how it would terminate input reading. It assumes that the input will be provided in a specific format without any indication of how the input ends.

4. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program doesn't handle cases where the input might not meet the expected format or where there are no students with a BMI of 25 or higher.

Due to these issues, the program does not fully align with the problem description, particularly in the input and output handling aspects.
