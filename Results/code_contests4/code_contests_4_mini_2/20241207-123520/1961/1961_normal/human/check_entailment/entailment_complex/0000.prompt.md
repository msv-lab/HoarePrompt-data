You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You and your n - 1 friends have found an array of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. You have decided to share it in the following way: All n of you stand in a line in a particular order. Each minute, the person at the front of the line chooses either the first or the last element of the array, removes it, and keeps it for himself. He then gets out of line, and the next person in line continues the process.

You are standing in the m-th position in the line. Before the process starts, you may choose up to k different people in the line, and persuade them to always take either the first or the last element in the array on their turn (for each person his own choice, not necessarily equal for all people), no matter what the elements themselves are. Once the process starts, you cannot persuade any more people, and you cannot change the choices for the people you already persuaded.

Suppose that you're doing your choices optimally. What is the greatest integer x such that, no matter what are the choices of the friends you didn't choose to control, the element you will take from the array will be greater than or equal to x?

Please note that the friends you don't control may do their choice arbitrarily, and they will not necessarily take the biggest element available.

Input

The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers n, m and k (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 3500, 0 ≤ k ≤ n - 1) — the number of elements in the array, your position in line and the number of people whose choices you can fix.

The second line of each test case contains n positive integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3500.

Output

For each test case, print the largest integer x such that you can guarantee to obtain at least x.

Note

In the first test case, an optimal strategy is to force the first person to take the last element and the second person to take the first element.

  * the first person will take the last element (5) because he or she was forced by you to take the last element. After this turn the remaining array will be [2, 9, 2, 3, 8]; 
  * the second person will take the first element (2) because he or she was forced by you to take the first element. After this turn the remaining array will be [9, 2, 3, 8]; 
  * if the third person will choose to take the first element (9), at your turn the remaining array will be [2, 3, 8] and you will take 8 (the last element); 
  * if the third person will choose to take the last element (8), at your turn the remaining array will be [9, 2, 3] and you will take 9 (the first element). 



Thus, this strategy guarantees to end up with at least 8. We can prove that there is no strategy that guarantees to end up with at least 9. Hence, the answer is 8.

In the second test case, an optimal strategy is to force the first person to take the first element. Then, in the worst case, both the second and the third person will take the first element: you will end up with 4.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a list `s` of test cases, where each test case is a tuple consisting of three integers followed by a list of positive integers. The function writes the string representation of the entire list to standard output, but does not perform any computations or return any results based on the input data.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts input from the user, specifically reading a single integer that represents one of the test cases based on previously defined parameters (n, m, k, and a list of positive integers). The function does not process the integers or the list, it only returns the integer read from the input. There is no validation or handling of multiple test cases; it simply reads and returns one integer.

The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 3500.
def func_4():
    return map(int, readln().split())
    #The program returns a list of integers parsed from the input line, consisting of the integers n, m, k, and the n positive integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a line of input, splits it into individual string representations of integers, converts them to a list of integers, and returns this list. The list includes three integers (n, m, k) followed by n positive integers.

    #The program returns the input read from standard input as a string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespace.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a line of input from standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and returns the resulting string. It does not handle multiple test cases or process integers as indicated in the annotations. The function only processes a single line of input.

#Function 6:

    #The program returns a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line read from standard input, which corresponds to the values for n, m, and k for each test case, along with the elements of the list a.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and reads a line of input from standard input, returning a list of strings that includes the values for n, m, k, and the elements of the list a for each test case. It does not perform any validation on the input values or handle potential input errors.

#Function 7:

def func_7():
    if debug :
        print(' '.join(map(str, args)))
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`args` is a tuple where the first element is an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, there are three integers `n`, `m`, `k`, followed by a list of `n` positive integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. If `debug` is true, the output is a string representation of `args` joined by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `args` that contains the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, three integers `n`, `m`, `k`, followed by a list of `n` positive integers. The function appears to be designed to process these inputs, but the actual implementation details or results produced for each test case are not provided in the code snippet. Therefore, the functionality is limited to accepting and potentially printing the input if debugging is enabled, without any further processing or output.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are integers representing the left and right bounds of the current segment of the array, k is a non-negative integer representing the number of people whose choices can be fixed, A is a list of integers representing the elements of the array, prilist is a list of integers representing the indices of the chosen people, pri_idx is an integer representing the current index in prilist, and seglen is an integer representing the length of the segment being considered.

    for pi in xrange(pri_idx, len(prilist) - 1):
        v, pl, pr = prilist[pi]
        
        lcut = max(0, pl - l + 1)
        
        rcut = max(0, r - pr + 1)
        
        if lcut == 0 or rcut == 0:

        if rcut <= k and pr - l >= seglen:
            ans = max(ans, func_8(l, pr - 1, k - rcut, A, prilist, pi + 1, seglen))
        
        if ans:
            return ans
        else:
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `l`, `r`, `k`, `A`, `prilist`, `pri_idx`, and `seglen` remain unchanged; `ans` is either 0 or the maximum result from the calls to `func_8` based on the conditions evaluated during the loop iterations. If the loop does not execute, all variables retain their initial values.
    ans = 10000000000.0
    for i in xrange(l, r + 1):

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `ans` is the minimum of 10000000000.0 and the maximum of `A[i]` and `A[i + seglen - 1]` for all valid `i` in the range `[l, r]` such that `i + seglen - 1` does not exceed `r`; `i` is at least `l` and at most `r`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the minimum value 'ans', which is computed as the minimum of 10000000000.0 and the maximum of `A[i]` and `A[i + seglen - 1]` for all valid `i` in the specified range [l, r].
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts integer parameters `l`, `r`, and `k`, a list of integers `A`, a list of indices `prilist`, an integer `pri_idx`, and an integer `seglen`. It calculates a minimum value based on the maximum elements of segments of the array `A` within the specified bounds, while also considering fixed choices from `prilist`. The function returns the minimum of 10000000000.0 and the maximum of `A[i]` and `A[i + seglen - 1]` for valid indices `i` within the range `[l, r]`. Additionally, it evaluates conditions based on `lcut`, `rcut`, and `k`, and calls itself recursively to adjust bounds and choices, returning the result of those evaluations if valid. The function may return a value of `ans` that could be 0, or any valid maximum determined through the recursive calls, depending on conditions met during execution.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
