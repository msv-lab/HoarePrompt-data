s is a list of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer n (the number of elements), an integer m (your position in line), an integer k (the number of people whose choices you can fix), followed by a list of n positive integers representing the elements of the array. It is guaranteed that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 3500, 0 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all elements in the array.
