The input consists of multiple test cases where each test case contains three integers n, m, k (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 3500, 0 ≤ k ≤ n - 1) representing the number of elements in the array, your position in line, and the number of people whose choices you can fix, followed by n positive integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array. The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 3500.
