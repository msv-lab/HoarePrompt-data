According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `pi` and the length of `prilist`. For the loop to execute again, `pi` must be less than `len(prilist) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `pi` is currently at `pri_idx`. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `pi` should be incremented by 1, making it `pri_idx + 1`. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, `len(prilist)` must be greater than `pri_idx + 1`.

State: **`ans` is either 0 or the result of `func_8(l, pr - 1, k - rcut, A, prilist, pi + 1, seglen)`, for the loop to execute a second time `prilist` must have at least `pri_idx + 2` elements, and `pi` is `pri_idx + 1`.**
