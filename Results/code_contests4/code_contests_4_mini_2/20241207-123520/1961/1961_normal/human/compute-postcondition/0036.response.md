The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration without altering the values of any variables. The values of `ans`, `v`, `pl`, `pr`, `lcut`, and `rcut` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is either 0 or the result of `func_8(l, pr - 1, k - rcut, A, prilist, pi + 1, seglen)`; `v`, `pl`, `pr` are assigned from `prilist[pi]`; `lcut` is calculated as max(0, pl - l + 1); `rcut` is either max(0, r - pr + 1) and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
