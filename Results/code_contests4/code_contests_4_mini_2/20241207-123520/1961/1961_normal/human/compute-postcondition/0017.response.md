The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or conditional statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `l`, `pl`, `lcut`, `rcut`, and `ans` are integers; the value of `ans` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
