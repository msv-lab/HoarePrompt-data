Postcondition: ***`ans` is either 0 or the result of `func_8(l, pr - 1, k - rcut, A, prilist, pi + 1, seglen)`; `v`, `pl`, `pr` are assigned from `prilist[pi]`; `lcut` is calculated as max(0, pl - l + 1); `rcut` is either max(0, r - pr + 1). If `lcut` is 0 or `rcut` is 0, we continue to the next iteration of the loop.***
