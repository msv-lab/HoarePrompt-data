Postcondition: ***`l` and `pl` are integers. If `rcut <= k` and `pr - l >= seglen`, then `ans` remains unchanged at 0 if `lcut <= k` and `r - pl >= seglen` is not satisfied; otherwise, `ans` is either 0 or the value returned by `func_8(l, pr - 1, k - rcut, A, prilist, pi + 1, seglen)`. If the condition is not satisfied, `ans` remains unchanged at 0.***
