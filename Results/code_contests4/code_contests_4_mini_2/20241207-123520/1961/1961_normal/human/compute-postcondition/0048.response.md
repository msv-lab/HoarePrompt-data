According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the values of `l` and `r`. The range for the loop is from `l` to `r`, inclusive. To ensure that the loop executes at least once, `l` must be less than or equal to `r`. If `l` is greater than `r`, the loop will not execute. Additionally, the variable `i` will start at `l` and increment up to `r`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute for the first time, `l` must be less than or equal to `r`. At the beginning of the first iteration, `i` will be equal to `l`.

State: **`ans` is 10000000000.0, for the loop to execute the first time `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `i` is `l`**
