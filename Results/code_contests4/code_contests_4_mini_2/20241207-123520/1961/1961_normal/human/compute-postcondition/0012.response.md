Output State: **`l`, `pl`, `lcut`, `rcut`, and `ans` are integers. `lcut` is less than or equal to `k`, `r - pl` is greater than or equal to `seglen`, `rcut` is less than or equal to `k`, `pr - l` is greater than or equal to `seglen`, and `ans` is updated to the maximum of `ans` and the result of `func_8(l, pr - 1, k - rcut, A, prilist, pi + 1, seglen)`**
