The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change as a result of this statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is an integer, `pl` is the value from `prilist[pi]`, `lcut` is max(0, pl - l + 1), `rcut` is assigned as max(0, r - pr + 1). Either `lcut` is 0 or `rcut` is 0 (or both), and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
