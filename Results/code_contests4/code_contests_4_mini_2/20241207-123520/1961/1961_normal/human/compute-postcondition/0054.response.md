The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is the minimum of 10000000000.0 and max(A[l], A[l + seglen - 1]), where `l` is the current value of `l`, `i` is `l + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time `l + 1` must be less than or equal to `r`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
