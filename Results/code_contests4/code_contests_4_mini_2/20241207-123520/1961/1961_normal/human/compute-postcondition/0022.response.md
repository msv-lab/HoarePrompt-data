The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the program to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state is: `l` is integer, `pl` is integer, `lcut` is max(0, pl - l + 1), `rcut` is max(0, r - pr + 1) where `r` is unknown, `ans` is unchanged; `pi` is `pri_idx + 1`; `v`, `pl`, `pr` are assigned values from `prilist[pi]`, and we skip the rest of the current loop iteration.
