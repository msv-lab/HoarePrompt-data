The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop that we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is the minimum of 10000000000.0 and max(A[i], A[i + seglen - 1]), `i` is `l + 1` which must be less than or equal to `r`, and we break out of the most internal loop.
