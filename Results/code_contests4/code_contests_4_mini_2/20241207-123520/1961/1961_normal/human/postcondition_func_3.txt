The function reads a line of input, splits it into individual string representations of integers, converts them to a list of integers, and returns this list. The list includes three integers (n, m, k) followed by n positive integers. It does not handle any edge cases related to input validation or error handling, assuming the input format is always correct as per the constraints provided.
