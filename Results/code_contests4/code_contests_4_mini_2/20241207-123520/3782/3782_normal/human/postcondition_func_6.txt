The function does not accept parameters and reads two integers, `n` and `k`, followed by a list of `n` integers. It computes a result based on precomputed factorial values and various calculations involving the sorted list of integers, ultimately printing the accumulated result. The exact nature of the computation is dependent on several helper functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_6`), which are not defined in the provided code, leaving the specific output behavior unspecified.
