According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n - 1`. The loop executes while `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1`, which means the loop has reached its exit condition. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, which would make `i` equal to `n`. However, since the loop condition checks if `i` is less than `n - 1`, it will not execute again because `i` is no longer less than `n - 1`.

Thus, we cannot adjust `i` to allow the loop to execute again, as the condition for the loop to run is already no longer satisfied.

State: **`ways` is updated by `func_2(ways, func_6(n - i - 1, k, fac))`; `i` is `n`; `n` is greater than `n - 1`; `diff` remains unchanged; `ans` is updated by `func_1(ans, func_3(diff, ways))`**
