To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we need to analyze the impacts of the code on the variables based on the initial state.

1. The variable `ways` is initially assigned the result of `func_6(n, k, fac)`.
2. The code snippet assigns `ways` the value of `func_2(ways, func_6(i + 1, k, fac))`. 
3. The function `func_6(i + 1, k, fac)` is called with `i + 1` (which is `1` since `i` is `0`), `k`, and `fac` as arguments. This will return a value based on the implementation of `func_6`.
4. The result from `func_6(i + 1, k, fac)` is used in the `func_2` function along with the current value of `ways`.
5. The output of `func_2` will then be assigned back to `ways`.

Since we do not have specific values for the variables or the exact behavior of `func_2` and `func_6`, we cannot provide precise numerical outputs. However, we can state the transformation that occurs to `ways`.

The previous value of `ways` is modified by the result of `func_2`, which takes `ways` and another value derived from `func_6`.

Thus, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5; `K` is a positive integer between 1 and `N`; `A` is a sorted list of `N` integers; `fac[0]` is 1; `fac[i]` is the result of `func_3(fac[i - 1], i)` for `1 <= i <= N + 4; `ans` is initialized to 0; `i` is 0; `diff` is assigned the value of `func_2(A[1], A[0]); `ways` is updated by `func_2(ways, func_6(1, k, fac))`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5; `K` is a positive integer between 1 and `N`; `A` is a sorted list of `N` integers; `fac[0]` is 1; `fac[i]` is the result of `func_3(fac[i - 1], i)` for `1 <= i <= N + 4; `ans` is initialized to 0; `i` is 0; `diff` is assigned the value of `func_2(A[1], A[0]); `ways` is updated by `func_2(ways, func_6(1, k, fac))`.**
