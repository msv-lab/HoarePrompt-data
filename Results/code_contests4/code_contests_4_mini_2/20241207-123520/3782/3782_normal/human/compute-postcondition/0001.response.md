The variable `a` is assigned a list created by converting each space-separated input value from `raw_input()` into an integer. The values of `N` and `K` are not directly affected by this line of code, but the list `A` will be populated with the integers provided in the input. The values of `A` can be represented as `A = [A_1, A_2, ..., A_N]`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 10^5; `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`; `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `A_i` satisfies |`A_i`| <= 10^9; `a` is assigned the list of integers from input.**
