To analyze the provided code snippet, we will focus on the variable `ways` and the functions `func_2` and `func_6`. 

- The variable `ways` is updated with the result of `func_2(ways, func_6(n - i - 1, k, fac))`. 
- The value of `n` is `N`, and `i` is initialized to `0`, so `n - i - 1` becomes `N - 1`.
- The value of `k` is a positive integer between `1` and `N`.
- The value of `fac` is a list with `fac[0]` equal to `1` and other values filled based on the function `func_3`.
  
The new value of `ways` is determined by applying `func_2` to its previous value and the result of `func_6(N - 1, k, fac)`. The exact outcomes depend on the specific implementations of `func_2` and `func_6`, which are not provided.

Since `ways` is updated but we do not have the specific previous value of `ways`, we cannot determine its exact new value. Therefore, we can only state that it has been updated based on the provided logic.

Output State: **`ways` is updated by func_2(ways, func_6(N - 1, k, fac)**
