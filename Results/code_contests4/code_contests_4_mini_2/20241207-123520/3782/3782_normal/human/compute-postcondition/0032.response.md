Output State: **`ans` is the result of the accumulated calculations based on the differences and ways computed in each iteration; `ways` is the final value after all updates based on the calculations involving `func_2` and `func_6`; `i` is `n - 1`; `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5; `K` is a positive integer between 1 and `N`; `A` is a sorted list of `N` integers; `fac` contains precomputed factorial values up to `N + 4`; `diff` represents the difference calculated in the last iteration of the loop; the value of `ans` is printed.**
