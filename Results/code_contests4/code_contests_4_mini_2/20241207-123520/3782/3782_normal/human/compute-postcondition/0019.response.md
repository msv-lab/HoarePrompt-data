According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at the maximum value it can take for the loop to run again. Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 on each iteration, if the loop has executed `n - 1` times, `i` will be `n - 2` at the end of the last iteration.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, after the last iteration, `i` becomes `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than `n - 1`, which is always true as long as `n` is at least 1.

State: **`ways` is updated by func_2(ways, func_6(N - 1, k, fac); `ans` is updated by func_1(ans, func_3(diff, ways)); for the loop to execute a second time `i` is n - 1, and `n` must be greater than n - 1.**
