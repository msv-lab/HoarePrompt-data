The loop iterates from 1 to `N + 4`, and during each iteration, it assigns `fac[i]` the result of `func_3(fac[i - 1], i)`. Given that `fac[0]` is initialized to 1, `fac[i]` will accumulate results based on previous values of `fac`.

After the loop completes all iterations, `fac` will contain the values for indices from 0 to `N + 4`, where:
- `fac[0]` is 1,
- `fac[1]` is `func_3(1, 1)`,
- `fac[2]` is `func_3(fac[1], 2)`,
- ...
- `fac[N]` is `func_3(fac[N-1], N)`,
- ...
- `fac[N + 4]` is `func_3(fac[N + 3], N + 4)`.

Thus, `fac` will have been filled from index 1 to `N + 4` based on the recursive relationship defined by `func_3`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `K` is a positive integer between 1 and `N`, `A` is a list of `N` integers, `fac[0]` is 1, `fac[i]` is the result of `func_3(fac[i - 1], i)` for `1 <= i <= N + 4.**
