Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `K` is a positive integer between 1 and `N`, `A` is a list of `N` integers, `fac[0]` is 1, `i` is 3, and `fac[3]` is assigned the value of `func_3(fac[2], 3)` where `fac[2]` depends on the previous state of `fac` and `i` is still less than or equal to `N + 4.**
