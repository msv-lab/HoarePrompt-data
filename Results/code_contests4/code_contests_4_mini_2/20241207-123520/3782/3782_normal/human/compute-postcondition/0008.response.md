According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`. The loop is set to iterate from `1` to `n + 4`, which means it will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n + 4`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, so for the loop to execute a third time, `i` will be incremented by 1. Thus, `i` will be 3 in the next iteration. 

For the loop to continue executing, `i` must still be less than or equal to `n + 4`. Since `i` is 3, this means `n` must be at least 0 (which it is, as it's between 1 and 100,000). 

Therefore, the next state should reflect that `i` is now 3. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `K` is a positive integer between 1 and `N`, `A` is a list of `N` integers, `fac[0]` is 1, `i` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `N` must be at least 1 and `i` must be less than or equal to `N + 4**.
