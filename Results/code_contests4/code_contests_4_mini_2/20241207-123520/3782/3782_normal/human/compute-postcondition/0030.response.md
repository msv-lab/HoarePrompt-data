The value of `ans` is updated by calling `func_1` with the arguments `ans` and `func_3(diff, ways)`. The previous state of `ans` is unknown, and `diff` remains unchanged. The value of `ways` is also unchanged from the previous state where it was updated by `func_2(ways, func_6(n - i - 1, k, fac))`. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact new value of `ans` without knowing the implementation details of `func_1` and `func_3`.

Output State: **`ways` is updated by `func_2(ways, func_6(n - i - 1, k, fac))`, `i` is `n`, `diff` remains unchanged, and `ans` is updated to `func_1(ans, func_3(diff, ways))`.**
