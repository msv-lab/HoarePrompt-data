The value of `ways` is updated by the result of `func_6(n, k, fac)`. The initial state indicates that `ways` was previously updated by `func_2(ways, func_6(n - i - 1, k, fac))`, but now it is assigned a new value based on the function `func_6` with the parameters `n`, `k`, and `fac`. The variables `i`, `n`, `diff`, and `ans` remain unchanged based on the provided initial state context. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `ways` is updated by `func_6(n, k, fac)`; `i` is `n`; `n` is greater than `n - 1`; `diff` remains unchanged; `ans` is updated by `func_1(ans, func_3(diff, ways))`; `diff` is assigned the value of `func_2(a[i + 1], a[i])`.

Output State: **`ways` is updated by `func_6(n, k, fac)`; `i` is `n`; `n` is greater than `n - 1`; `diff` remains unchanged; `ans` is updated by `func_1(ans, func_3(diff, ways))`; `diff` is assigned the value of `func_2(a[i + 1], a[i])`.**
