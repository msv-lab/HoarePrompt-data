Given the initial state:

- `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5
- `K` is a positive integer between 1 and `N`
- `A` is a sorted list of `N` integers
- `fac[0]` is 1
- `fac[i]` is the result of `func_3(fac[i - 1], i)` for `1 <= i <= N + 4
- `ans` is initialized to 0
- `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time

The code snippet provided is:
```
diff = func_2(a[i + 1], a[i])
```

Now, let's analyze the impact of this code.

1. `i` is 0, so `a[i + 1]` refers to `a[1]` and `a[i]` refers to `a[0]`.
2. The function `func_2` is called with the arguments `a[1]` and `a[0]`.
3. The values of `a[1]` and `a[0]` are taken from the sorted list `A`.
4. The result of `func_2(a[1], a[0])` is assigned to `diff`.

Since the specific values of `A` are not provided, we can say that `diff` is assigned a value based on the two elements of the sorted list at indices 0 and 1.

Therefore, the output state reflects the values of `A` and the assignment of `diff`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `K` is a positive integer between 1 and `N`, `A` is a sorted list of `N` integers, `fac[0]` is 1, `fac[i]` is the result of `func_3(fac[i - 1], i)` for `1 <= i <= N + 4, `ans` is initialized to 0, `i` is 0, `diff` is assigned the value of `func_2(A[1], A[0])`.**
