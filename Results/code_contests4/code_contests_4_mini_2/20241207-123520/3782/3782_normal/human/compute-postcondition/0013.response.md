According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute if `n - 1` is at least 0, which implies that `n` must be at least 1. Since `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, it is guaranteed to meet this condition. 

At the start of the loop, `i` will be initialized to 0 for the first iteration. Thus, `i` will be 0 when the loop executes for the first time. 

The state does not need adjustments regarding `N`, `K`, `A`, or `fac` for the loop to execute, as they do not directly influence the loop execution condition aside from ensuring that `N` is valid.

State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `K` is a positive integer between 1 and `N`, `A` is a sorted list of `N` integers, `fac[0]` is 1, `fac[i]` is the result of `func_3(fac[i - 1], i)` for `1 <= i <= N + 4, `ans` is initialized to 0, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
