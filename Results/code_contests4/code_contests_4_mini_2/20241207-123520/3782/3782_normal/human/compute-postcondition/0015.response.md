The variable `ways` is assigned the value of `func_6(n, k, fac)`, where `n`, `k`, and `fac` are inputs to the function. The values of `n` and `k` are defined by the initial state, while `fac` is an array that has been populated based on the previously defined function `func_3`. Since `fac` is established, the output state will reflect that `ways` is calculated but we do not know its exact value without further details on `func_6`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5; `K` is a positive integer between 1 and `N`; `A` is a sorted list of `N` integers; `fac[0]` is 1; `fac[i]` is the result of `func_3(fac[i - 1], i)` for `1 <= i <= N + 4; `ans` is initialized to 0; `i` is 0; `diff` is assigned the value of `func_2(A[1], A[0]); `ways` is calculated as `func_6(n, k, fac)`**.
