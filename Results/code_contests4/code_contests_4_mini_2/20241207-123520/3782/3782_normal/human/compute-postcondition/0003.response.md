Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 10^5; `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`; `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `A_i` satisfies |`A_i`| <= 10^9; `a` is assigned the list of integers from input; `fac` is a list of length `N + 5` initialized with zeros; `fac[0]` is 1.**
