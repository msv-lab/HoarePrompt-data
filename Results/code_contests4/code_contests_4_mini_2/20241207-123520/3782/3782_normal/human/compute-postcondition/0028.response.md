The value of `ways` is assigned the result of `func_2(ways, func_6(i + 1, k, fac))`. The previous value of `ways` is updated by `func_6(n, k, fac)`, and `i` is `n`, meaning `i + 1` is greater than `n`. The value of `diff` remains unchanged, and `ans` is updated by `func_1(ans, func_3(diff, ways))`. The variable `diff` is assigned the value of `func_2(a[i + 1], a[i])`, but this does not affect the current assignment of `ways`. 

Therefore, the output state is: `ways` is updated by `func_2(ways, func_6(n + 1, k, fac))`, `i` is `n`, `diff` remains unchanged, and `ans` is updated by `func_1(ans, func_3(diff, ways))`.

Output State: **`ways` is updated by `func_2(ways, func_6(n + 1, k, fac))`, `i` is `n`, `diff` remains unchanged, and `ans` is updated by `func_1(ans, func_3(diff, ways))`**.
