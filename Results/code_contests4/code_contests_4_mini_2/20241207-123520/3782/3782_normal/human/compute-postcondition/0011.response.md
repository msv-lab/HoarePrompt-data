The statement `a.sort()` sorts the list `A` in ascending order. Since `A` is a list of `N` integers, the values in `A` will now be ordered from the smallest to the largest. The values of `N`, `K`, and `fac` are not affected by this operation, only the order of elements in `A`. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `K` is a positive integer between 1 and `N`, `A` is a sorted list of `N` integers, `fac[0]` is 1, and `fac[i]` is the result of `func_3(fac[i - 1], i)` for `1 <= i <= N + 4.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `K` is a positive integer between 1 and `N`, `A` is a sorted list of `N` integers, `fac[0]` is 1, `fac[i]` is the result of `func_3(fac[i - 1], i)` for `1 <= i <= N + 4.**
