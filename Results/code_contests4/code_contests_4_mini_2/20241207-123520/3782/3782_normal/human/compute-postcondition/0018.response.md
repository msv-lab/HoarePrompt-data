To determine the impact of the code on the program, we first analyze the initial state and the operation being performed.

- The variable `ans` is assigned the value returned from the function call `func_1(ans, func_3(diff, ways))`.
- The value of `ways` has been updated by the function call `func_2(ways, func_6(N - 1, k, fac)`, but we do not have the specific updated value of `ways`.
- The function `func_3` takes `diff` and `ways` as parameters to produce a value that is then passed to `func_1` along with `ans`.

Since `ways` has been updated but we do not know its exact new value, we cannot determine the specific values for `ans` after this operation without knowing the return values of the functions involved.

Thus, we conclude that `ans` is now updated based on the values produced by the functions, but we cannot specify exact numbers or states.

Output State: **`ways` is updated by func_2(ways, func_6(N - 1, k, fac); `ans` is updated by func_1(ans, func_3(diff, ways)).**
