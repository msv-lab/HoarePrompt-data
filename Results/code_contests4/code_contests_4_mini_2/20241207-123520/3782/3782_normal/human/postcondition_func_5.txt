The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k` (where 1 <= k <= n), along with a list `fac` of integers (each satisfying |A_i| <= 10^9). It returns 0 if `k` is greater than `n`. Otherwise, it returns the result of applying `func_3` to `fac[n]` and the result of applying `func_5` to `func_3(fac[n - k], fac[k])`.
