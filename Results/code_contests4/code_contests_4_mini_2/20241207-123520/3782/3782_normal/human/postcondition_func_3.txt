The function accepts a list of integers `a` and an integer `b`. It returns 1 if `b` is 0. If `b` is odd, it returns the result of applying `func_3` to the list `a` and the result of `func_4` with `b` decremented by 1. If `b` is even, it recursively calls itself with `b` divided by 2 and returns the square of that result. The function does not handle cases where `b` is less than 1, which could lead to unexpected behavior or infinite recursion.
