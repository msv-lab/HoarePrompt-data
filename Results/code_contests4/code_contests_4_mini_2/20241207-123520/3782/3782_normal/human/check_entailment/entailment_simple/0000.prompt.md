You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: For a finite set of integers X, let f(X)=\max X - \min X.

Given are N integers A_1,...,A_N.

We will choose K of them and let S be the set of the integers chosen. If we distinguish elements with different indices even when their values are the same, there are {}_N C_K ways to make this choice. Find the sum of f(S) over all those ways.

Since the answer can be enormous, print it \bmod (10^9+7).

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 10^5
* 1 \leq K \leq N
* |A_i| \leq 10^9

Input

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers with length N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5) where each integer |A_i| (1 ≤ |A_i| ≤ 10^9), and b is a positive integer K (1 ≤ K ≤ N).
def func_1(a, b):
    c = a + b
    if (c >= mod) :
        c -= mod
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` is a list of integers of length N, `b` is a positive integer K, and `c` is an integer. If `c` is greater than or equal to `mod`, then `c` is decreased by `mod`. Otherwise, a TypeError occurs due to incompatible types.
    return c
    #The program returns the integer c, which has been adjusted based on the condition with mod, as c is either decreased by mod or remains the same if it is less than mod.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers with length N (1 <= N <= 100000), and b is an integer K such that 1 <= K <= N. The absolute values of the integers in a are at most 10^9.
def func_2(a, b):
    return (a - b) % mod
    #The program returns the result of (a - b) % mod, where 'a' is a list of integers and 'b' is an integer K such that 1 <= K <= N

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers with length N (1 <= N <= 10^5), b is an integer K (1 <= K <= N), and the absolute value of each integer in a is less than or equal to 10^9.
def func_3(a, b):
    return a * b % mod
    #The program returns the product of the list of integers 'a' multiplied by the integer 'b', then taken modulo 'mod'

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers of length N where 1 <= N <= 10^5 and |A_i| <= 10^9, and b is an integer K such that 1 <= K <= N.
def func_4(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns the integer 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` is a list of integers of length N where 1 <= N <= 10^5 and |A_i| <= 10^9, and `b` is an integer K such that 1 <= K <= N, and `b` is not equal to 0.
    if (b % 2 == 1) :
        return func_3(a, func_4(a, b - 1))
        #The program returns the result of func_3 applied to list 'a' and the result of func_4 applied to list 'a' with index (b - 1), where 'b' is an odd integer between 1 and N.
    else :
        temp = func_4(a, b / 2)
        return temp * temp
        #The program returns the square of the value stored in 'temp', which is the result of func_4(a, b / 2), where 'b' is an even integer and 'temp' is assigned that value.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers where the first element is N (the number of integers) and the second element is K (the number of integers to choose), followed by N integers A_1, A_2, ..., A_N, where 1 <= N <= 100000, 1 <= K <= N, and |A_i| <= 10^9.
def func_5(a):
    return func_4(a, mod - 2)
    #The program returns the result of the function `func_4` applied to the list `a` and the value `mod - 2`

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of integers in the set, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, and fac is a list of integers where each integer A_i satisfies |A_i| <= 10^9.
def func_6(n, k, fac):
    if (k > n) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0, as specified in the return statement
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer representing the number of integers in the set, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` <= `n`, and `fac` is a list of integers where each integer `A_i` satisfies |`A_i`| <= 10^9. Additionally, `k` is less than or equal to `n`.

    #The program returns the result of func_3 applied to fac[n] and the result of func_5 applied to func_3 of fac[n - k] and fac[k]

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^5, K is a positive integer such that 1 <= K <= N, and A is a list of N integers where each integer A_i satisfies |A_i| <= 10^9.

The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
