Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here are the reasons why:

1. **Core Functionality Missing**: The program is expected to compute the sum of `f(S)` for all combinations of size `K` from the list of integers `A`. The function `f(S)` is defined as `max(S) - min(S)`. However, the program does not include any logic that calculates the maximum and minimum values of the chosen combinations, nor does it iterate through all combinations of size `K`.

2. **Incorrect Function Definitions**: The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_6`, and `func_7` do not appear to be related to calculating the differences of maximum and minimum values of any set `S`. Instead, they perform operations such as addition, subtraction, and factorial computations, which are not relevant to the task of calculating `f(S)`.

3. **Combinatorial Logic Missing**: The program lacks a combinatorial approach to choose `K` elements from `N`. It does not implement any combinatorial enumeration logic to generate subsets or compute the sum of `f(S)` across these subsets.

4. **Handling of Output**: While the program does include a modulo operation, it is applied in contexts unrelated to the actual problem requirements. The output of the sum of `f(S)` across all valid combinations is not calculated, which is a critical requirement.

5. **Sorting Logic**: The program sorts the array `A`, but it does not use this sorted array in a meaningful way to calculate the required values for `f(S)`.

Overall, the main issue is that the core logic to compute the differences for every combination of `K` integers from the list is missing. The program does not fulfill the requirements stated in the problem description, and therefore the correctness of the program is **False**.
