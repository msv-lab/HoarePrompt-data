You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: For a finite set of integers X, let f(X)=\max X - \min X.

Given are N integers A_1,...,A_N.

We will choose K of them and let S be the set of the integers chosen. If we distinguish elements with different indices even when their values are the same, there are {}_N C_K ways to make this choice. Find the sum of f(S) over all those ways.

Since the answer can be enormous, print it \bmod (10^9+7).

Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers with length N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5) where each integer |A_i| (1 ≤ |A_i| ≤ 10^9), and b is a positive integer K (1 ≤ K ≤ N).
def func_1(a, b):
    c = a + b
    if (c >= mod) :
        c -= mod
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` is a list of integers of length N, `b` is a positive integer K, and `c` is an integer. If `c` is greater than or equal to `mod`, then `c` is decreased by `mod`. Otherwise, a TypeError occurs due to incompatible types.
    return c
    #The program returns the integer c, which has been adjusted based on the condition with mod, as c is either decreased by mod or remains the same if it is less than mod.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function attempts to accept a list of integers `a` and a positive integer `b`, but it will raise a TypeError due to the attempt to add a list and an integer, preventing it from returning an adjusted integer based on a modulus condition.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers with length N (1 <= N <= 100000), and b is an integer K such that 1 <= K <= N. The absolute values of the integers in a are at most 10^9.
def func_2(a, b):
    return (a - b) % mod
    #The program returns the result of (a - b) % mod, where 'a' is a list of integers and 'b' is an integer K such that 1 <= K <= N
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `a` and an integer `b`. It attempts to return the result of the expression `(a - b) % mod`, but the code as written is incorrect because it tries to subtract an integer `b` directly from a list `a`, which will result in a TypeError. The intended functionality seems to be to perform some operation on the elements of the list `a` and the integer `b`, but as it stands, it does not function correctly. Therefore, it does not return a valid result as expected from the annotations.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers with length N (1 <= N <= 10^5), b is an integer K (1 <= K <= N), and the absolute value of each integer in a is less than or equal to 10^9.
def func_3(a, b):
    return a * b % mod
    #The program returns the product of the list of integers 'a' multiplied by the integer 'b', then taken modulo 'mod'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `a` and an integer `b`, returning the product of the list of integers in `a` multiplied by `b`, and then taking the result modulo `mod`. However, the code does not actually compute the product of the elements in `a` because it attempts to multiply the list `a` directly by `b`, which will not yield the intended result. Instead, it will raise a TypeError unless `a` is a single integer or the context allows list multiplication. The code needs to use a proper method to compute the product of the list elements before applying the multiplication with `b` and the modulo operation.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers of length N where 1 <= N <= 10^5 and |A_i| <= 10^9, and b is an integer K such that 1 <= K <= N.
def func_4(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns the integer 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` is a list of integers of length N where 1 <= N <= 10^5 and |A_i| <= 10^9, and `b` is an integer K such that 1 <= K <= N, and `b` is not equal to 0.
    if (b % 2 == 1) :
        return func_3(a, func_4(a, b - 1))
        #The program returns the result of func_3 applied to list 'a' and the result of func_4 applied to list 'a' with index (b - 1), where 'b' is an odd integer between 1 and N.
    else :
        temp = func_4(a, b / 2)
        return temp * temp
        #The program returns the square of the value stored in 'temp', which is the result of func_4(a, b / 2), where 'b' is an even integer and 'temp' is assigned that value.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `a` and an integer `b`. It returns 1 if `b` is 0. If `b` is odd, it returns the result of applying `func_3` to the list `a` and the result of `func_4` with `b` decremented by 1. If `b` is even, it recursively calls itself with `b` divided by 2 and returns the square of that result. The function does not handle cases where `b` is less than 1, which could lead to unexpected behavior or infinite recursion.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers where the first element is N (the number of integers) and the second element is K (the number of integers to choose), followed by N integers A_1, A_2, ..., A_N, where 1 <= N <= 100000, 1 <= K <= N, and |A_i| <= 10^9.
def func_5(a):
    return func_4(a, mod - 2)
    #The program returns the result of the function `func_4` applied to the list `a` and the value `mod - 2`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `a` where the first element indicates the number of integers, the second element indicates how many integers to choose, and it returns the result of the function `func_4` applied to the list `a` and the value `mod - 2`. The actual functionality of `func_4` is not defined here, so the behavior of the function `func_5` cannot be fully determined without further context on `func_4`. Therefore, it is important to note that the specific output of `func_5` depends on the implementation of `func_4`.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of integers in the set, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, and fac is a list of integers where each integer A_i satisfies |A_i| <= 10^9.
def func_6(n, k, fac):
    if (k > n) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0, as specified in the return statement
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer representing the number of integers in the set, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` <= `n`, and `fac` is a list of integers where each integer `A_i` satisfies |`A_i`| <= 10^9. Additionally, `k` is less than or equal to `n`.
    return func_3(fac[n], func_5(func_3(fac[n - k], fac[k])))
    #The program returns the result of func_3 applied to fac[n] and the result of func_5 applied to func_3 of fac[n - k] and fac[k]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k` (where 1 <= k <= n), along with a list `fac` of integers (each satisfying |A_i| <= 10^9). It returns 0 if `k` is greater than `n`. Otherwise, it returns the result of applying `func_3` to `fac[n]` and the result of applying `func_5` to `func_3(fac[n - k], fac[k])`.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^5, K is a positive integer such that 1 <= K <= N, and A is a list of N integers where each integer A_i satisfies |A_i| <= 10^9.
def func_7():
    n, k = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    a = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    fac = [0] * (n + 5)
    fac[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 5):
        fac[i] = func_3(fac[i - 1], i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `K` is a positive integer between 1 and `N`, `A` is a list of `N` integers, `fac[0]` is 1, `fac[i]` is the result of `func_3(fac[i - 1], i)` for `1 <= i <= N + 4.
    a.sort()
    ans = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        diff = func_2(a[i + 1], a[i])
        
        ways = func_6(n, k, fac)
        
        ways = func_2(ways, func_6(i + 1, k, fac))
        
        ways = func_2(ways, func_6(n - i - 1, k, fac))
        
        ans = func_1(ans, func_3(diff, ways))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `ans` is the result of the accumulated calculations based on the differences and ways computed in each iteration, `ways` is the final value after all updates based on the calculations involving `func_2` and `func_6`, `i` is `n - 1`, `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `K` is a positive integer between 1 and `N`, `A` is a sorted list of `N` integers, `fac` contains precomputed factorial values up to `N + 4`, `diff` represents the difference calculated in the last iteration of the loop.
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept parameters and reads two integers, `n` and `k`, followed by a list of `n` integers. It computes a result based on precomputed factorial values and various calculations involving the sorted list of integers, ultimately printing the accumulated result. The exact nature of the computation is dependent on several helper functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_6`), which are not defined in the provided code, leaving the specific output behavior unspecified.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
