To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's carefully analyze the code and the output hints.

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to compute the sum of the difference between the maximum and minimum values of all possible combinations of K integers chosen from N integers. The result must be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Functions Analysis
1. **Function func_1**: 
    - Seems to be a simple addition function with a modulus check.
    - However, it incorrectly attempts to add a list and an integer, which would raise a TypeError.

2. **Function func_2**: 
    - This function attempts to perform subtraction and modulus on a list and an integer, which also leads to a TypeError.

3. **Function func_3**: 
    - Intended to calculate the product of elements in a list with an integer, but it incorrectly tries to multiply a list directly with an integer, leading to another TypeError.

4. **Function func_4**: 
    - This looks like a recursive function for exponentiation. However, it does not handle cases where \(b < 1\), which could lead to unexpected behavior or infinite recursion. 

5. **Function func_5**: 
    - It attempts to call `func_4` with a modulus operation, but the behavior heavily depends on the implementation of `func_4`.

6. **Function func_6**: 
    - It checks if \(k > n\) and calls other functions, but the validity of the operations relies on the previously defined functions, which are flawed.

7. **Function func_7**: 
    - Responsible for reading input, sorting, and computing the result. However, it relies on all the previous functions, which are not functioning correctly due to the issues identified.

### Output Hints Analysis
- The output hints indicate that each function has critical issues that lead to TypeErrors, and therefore, the intended functionality cannot be achieved.
- The hints state that the expected operations involve lists and integers; however, the code attempts operations that are not valid (like adding a list to an integer or subtracting an integer from a list).

### Edge Cases
- Any input with more than one integer or with negative integers will cause the code to produce errors due to the TypeErrors present throughout the functions.
- The function will not return valid results for cases where the input should work according to the description.

### Conclusion
Since the provided code will raise TypeErrors before it can perform any meaningful calculations, and it does not handle edge cases or the problem requirements as specified, I conclude that the program does not meet the problem description. 

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to execute correctly due to TypeErrors in multiple functions, meaning it cannot compute the required sum as specified in the problem description.
