To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze its logic and see if it adheres to the problem description thoroughly.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. We need to choose `K` integers from a list of `N` integers.
2. For each combination of `K` integers, we need to compute `f(S) = max(S) - min(S)`.
3. The goal is to sum up all `f(S)` values across all combinations of chosen integers.
4. The result should be printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Code Analysis:
1. **Factorial Calculation**: The program computes factorial values up to `N + 5` to assist with combination calculations.
2. **Combinatorial Functions**: The functions `func_6` are used to compute combinations (n choose k).
3. **Sorting**: The array `a` is sorted, which allows the calculation of differences between consecutive elements to find `max(S) - min(S)`.
4. **Loop Through Elements**: The loop iterates through sorted elements to calculate the difference between consecutive elements and the number of ways to choose elements.

### Potential Issues:
1. The program computes ways to choose elements based on factorials but does not seem to correctly sum the contributions of `f(S)` for all combinations. The logic in the loop does not seem to properly aggregate the contributions of all valid sets formed by choosing `K` integers.
2. The handling of cases where all elements are the same (`f(S) = 0`) could be an issue, but is not necessarily incorrect; it just needs to ensure those cases are properly included in the summation.
3. The calculation of ways does not seem to take into account the correct combinations for both ends of the selection process, particularly in situations where there are repeated elements.

### Test Cases:
Let's consider a potential edge case:

- **Case**: `N = 4`, `K = 2`, `A = [1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - The only possible selection is any two of the ones which gives `f(S) = 0`. 
  - Expected output is `0`, and it seems like the program would handle this case correctly.

However, in a case where `N = 5`, `K = 2`, `A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, we should see combinations of differences between min and max for various selections. The program must ensure it correctly counts all combinations and their respective contributions to the sum.

### Conclusion:
Upon reviewing the program's logic, it appears that it does not correctly accumulate the contributions for all combinations due to the way it calculates `ways` and `diff` values. The program seems to miss aggregating all contributions properly, which could lead to incorrect outputs for certain cases.

Thus, based on the analysis of the code and the potential for failure in accurately summing contributions, I conclude:

Correctness: **False** 

#### Example Case of Incorrectness:
For `N = 5, K = 2, A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the combinations and their contributions should yield a different sum than what the program computes, showcasing a flaw in the logic.
