According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `N`. The loop will execute if `i + 1` is less than `N`, allowing `j` to take values starting from `i + 1` up to `N - 1`. Given that `N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 1`, it guarantees that the loop can execute at least once. 

Before the loop starts, we know:
- `N` is greater than `i + 1`, which means there is a valid range for `j`.
- `i` is greater than 0, which indicates that `j` will start from at least 1 (since `j` is equal to `i - 1` at the start).
- The initial state of `right` being 0 does not affect the execution of the loop.

Thus, for the loop to execute the first time, the variable `j` needs to be initialized to `i + 1`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 1`, `left` is the sum of absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for all `j` in range(0, i), `i` is greater than 0, `j` is `i + 1`, and `right` is now 0**.
