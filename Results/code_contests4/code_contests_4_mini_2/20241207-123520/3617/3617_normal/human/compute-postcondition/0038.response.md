According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `N`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 1, so `j` is `i + 2`, which means `j` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `N`. Therefore, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 200000\); `i` is at least 1; `j` is at least 3; for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `N` and `j` will be 4 in the next iteration.**
