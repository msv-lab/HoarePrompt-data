The variable `left` is assigned the value 0. The previous values of `N` and `i` are not affected by this operation, so they remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 200000; `i` is 2; `left` is 0.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 200000; `i` is 2; `left` is 0**
