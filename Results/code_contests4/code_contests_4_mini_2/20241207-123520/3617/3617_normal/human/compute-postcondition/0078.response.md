According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `N` and `i`. The loop starts at `j = i + 1` and continues until `j < N`. For the loop to execute at least once, `i + 1` must be less than `N`, which implies that `i` must be less than `N - 1`. 

Since `i` is already stated to be greater than 0, we only need to ensure that `N` is greater than `i + 1`. 

Before the loop starts, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `N` must be at least `i + 2` to ensure that `j` can start at `i + 1` and still be less than `N`.
- `j` should be initialized to `i + 1` for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 1`, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is `i + 1`**
