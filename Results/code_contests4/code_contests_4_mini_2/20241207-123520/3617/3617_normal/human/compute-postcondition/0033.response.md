The value of `right` is assigned to 0, indicating that it is reset or initialized to zero. The other variables (`N`, `i`, `j`, `left`, and `m`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 200000, `i` is at least 1, `j` is less than `i`, `left` is the updated sum of absolute differences for all values of `j` from 0 to `i-1` with respect to `diff[i]`, `m` is updated to include the total sum of `left + right`, and now `right` is 0.
