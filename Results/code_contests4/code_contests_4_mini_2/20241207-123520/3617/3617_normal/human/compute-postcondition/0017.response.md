The expression `right += abs(diff[j] - diff[i])` calculates the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, then adds that value to `right`. The variables `N` and `i` remain unchanged, while `j` is defined as `i + 1`. Therefore, this line updates the value of `right` by the calculated difference.

Since `N` is a positive integer within the specified range, `i` is less than `N - 1`, and `j` is `i + 1`, we will assume `diff[i]` and `diff[j]` have defined values.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 200000; `i` is less than `N - 1; `j` is `i + 1`; `right` is updated by adding `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`.**
