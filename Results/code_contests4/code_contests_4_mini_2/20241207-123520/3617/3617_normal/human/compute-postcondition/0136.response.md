According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`. The loop will iterate as long as `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than 0, meaning that `j` has been less than `i` in the previous iteration. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 from its last value, and it must still be less than `i`. Therefore, if the last value of `j` was `i - 1`, then for the loop to execute again, `j` should be `i` and `i` must remain the same because `j` needs to be less than `i` to continue the loop.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `m` is an empty list, `line` is non-empty, `A` is a list of integers obtained from raw_input() split by spaces, `diff` is a sorted list of differences calculated from A, `i` is greater than 0, `left` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be equal to `i - 1` and `i` must be greater than `j`.**
