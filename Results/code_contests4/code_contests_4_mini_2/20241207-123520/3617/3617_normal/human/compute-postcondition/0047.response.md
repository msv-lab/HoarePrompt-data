The value of `left` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. The previous value of `left` is `left + abs(diff[0] - diff[2])`. Since `j` is 1 and `i` is 2, we need to calculate the new value of `left` as follows:

1. The previous value of `left` is `left + abs(diff[0] - diff[2])`.
2. The new contribution to `left` will be `abs(diff[1] - diff[2])` because `j` is 1 and `i` is 2.

Thus, the updated value of `left` will be:
```
left = (left + abs(diff[0] - diff[2])) + abs(diff[1] - diff[2])
```

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 200000, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `left` is updated based on the absolute differences.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 200000, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `left` is updated based on abs(diff[1] - diff[2])**
