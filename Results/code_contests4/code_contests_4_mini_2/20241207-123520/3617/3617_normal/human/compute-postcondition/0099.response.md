The value of `right` is incremented by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. Given that `j` is adjusted to `i + 2`, both `j` and `i` are valid indices, and `N` is greater than `i + 2`, so `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` are accessible. The previous values of `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` are unknown, but the operation will be executed.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 2`, `i` is at least `1`, `j` is adjusted to `i + 2`, and `right` is increased by `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 2`, `i` is at least `1`, `j` is adjusted to `i + 2`, and `right` is increased by `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])**
