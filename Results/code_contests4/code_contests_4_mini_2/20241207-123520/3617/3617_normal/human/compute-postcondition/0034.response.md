According to the code, the loop is defined to iterate over `j` from `i + 1` to `N - 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `j` must start at `i + 1`, which means that `i + 1` must be less than `N`. Given that `N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 200000` and that `i` is at least 1, we need to ensure that `i + 1` is less than `N`, which implies `N` must be at least `i + 1`.

To summarize, we need the following conditions for the loop to execute:
1. `N` must be greater than `i + 1`.
2. `j` is initialized to `i + 1`.

Thus, the state can be modified to reflect these requirements.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 200000, `i` is at least 1, `j` is `i + 1`, for the loop to execute `N` must be greater than `i + 1`**
