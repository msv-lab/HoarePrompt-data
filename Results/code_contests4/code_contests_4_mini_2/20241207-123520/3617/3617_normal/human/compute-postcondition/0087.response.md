Output State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 2`, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is greater than `i + 1`, `right` is the sum of absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i + 1]` for all `j` from `i + 2` to `N - 1`; `m` is updated by appending the value of `left + right`, and `left` is 0.**
