The variable `left` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. The values of `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` are determined by the current state of the list `diff`, and since `i` is greater than 0 and `N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 2`, we can assume that both `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` are well-defined. The value of `left` increases by this absolute difference, but the specific values of `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` are not provided, so we cannot calculate a specific numeric value for `left`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 2`, `left` is updated to `left + abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 2`, `left` is updated to `left + abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time.**
