Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 200000; `i` is less than `N - 1; `j` is `N`; `right` is the sum of absolute differences calculated from the `diff` list for all values of `j` from `i + 1` to `N - 1` with respect to `diff[i]`; `m` is updated to include `left + right`.**
