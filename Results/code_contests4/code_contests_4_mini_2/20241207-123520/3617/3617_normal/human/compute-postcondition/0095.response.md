The variable `right` is being assigned the value `0`. This does not affect the other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains consistent with the initial definitions of the variables, and we note that `right` is now explicitly set to `0`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 2`, `i` is at least `1`, `j` is equal to `i`, `left` is the sum of absolute differences from `diff[0]` to `diff[i - 1]` with respect to `diff[i]`, `right` is 0, and `m` contains `left + right`.**
