The value of `left` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. The previous value of `left` is determined from the initial state, and we add `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])` to it. Other variables `N`, `i`, `j`, and `right` remain unchanged. The output state reflects the updated value of `left`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 2`, `i` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `left` is updated with the absolute difference of `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, and `right` is defined by the sum of absolute differences.**
