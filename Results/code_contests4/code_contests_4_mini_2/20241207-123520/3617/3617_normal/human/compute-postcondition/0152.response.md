According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. The loop iterates as long as `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1, making `j` equal to 1. Since `N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 1`, `i` can remain the same as long as it is greater than 1, allowing the loop to execute as long as `j` is less than `i`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 1`, `left` is incremented by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, `right` is incremented by the sum of absolute differences, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 1**
