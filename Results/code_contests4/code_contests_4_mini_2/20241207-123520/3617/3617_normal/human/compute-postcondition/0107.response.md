The value of `left` is incremented by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. Given that `j` is 0 and `i` is 2, `left` will be updated to `abs(diff[0] - diff[2])`. The initial state indicates that `left` is currently 0, so after this operation, `left` will be equal to `abs(diff[0] - diff[2])`. The values of `i`, `j`, `right`, `N`, and `m` remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than `3`, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `left` is `abs(diff[0] - diff[2])`, `right` is the sum of absolute differences from `diff[3]` to `diff[N - 1]` with respect to `diff[2]`, `m` includes the value of `left + right`**.
