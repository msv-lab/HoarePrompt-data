According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `N`. The loop is set to iterate from `j` starting at `i + 1` (which is 3) up to `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `j` is 3, while `N` is greater than 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. 

After the next iteration, `j` will be 4. For the loop to execute again, `N` must be greater than 4. 

State: **`N` is greater than 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `left` is abs(diff[0] - diff[2]) + abs(diff[1] - diff[2]), `right` is abs(diff[3] - diff[2]), `m` includes the value of `left + right`, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than 4**
