According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `i`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `i` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will become 1, and the loop can execute again as long as `j` is still less than `i`. 

Since `i` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be 1. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 2`, `left` is updated to `left + abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 1 for the loop to execute a second time.**
