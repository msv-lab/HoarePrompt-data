The value of `left` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. Since `j` is 1 and `i` is greater than 0, we are calculating `left + abs(diff[1] - diff[i])`. The previous values of `left` and the specific values of `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` are not provided, but we know that `left` is being incremented based on the absolute difference of the two elements in the `diff` array. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 2`, `left` is updated to `left + abs(diff[1] - diff[i])`, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 1 for the loop to execute a second time.**
