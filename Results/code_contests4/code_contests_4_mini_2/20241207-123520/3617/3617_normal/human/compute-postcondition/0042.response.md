According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `N`. The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `N - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 1, which means the loop has executed at least once. 

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `N`. Since `i` is currently at least 1, for the loop to run a second time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it at least 2. Therefore, `N` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 200000; `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than 2**
