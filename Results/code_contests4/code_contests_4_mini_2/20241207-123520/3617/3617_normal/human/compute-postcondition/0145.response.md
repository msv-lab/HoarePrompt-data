The value of `right` is incremented by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. The variable `j` is defined as `i + 3`, which means the absolute difference is calculated between `diff[i + 3]` and `diff[i]`. The previous values of `N`, `i`, and `j` are not changed, and the impact is only on `right`. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 3; `j` is `i + 3; `right` is incremented by abs(diff[i + 3] - diff[i])`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 3; `j` is `i + 3; `right` is incremented by abs(diff[j] - diff[i]).**
