The variable `left` is incremented by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. Given that `j` is 1 and `i` is greater than 0, we can determine that `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` are defined and can be used to calculate the absolute difference. The previous value of `left` is increased by this calculated absolute difference. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 1`, `left` is updated by adding the absolute difference, `right` remains unchanged, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 1.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 1`, `left` is updated by adding the absolute difference, `right` remains unchanged, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 1**
