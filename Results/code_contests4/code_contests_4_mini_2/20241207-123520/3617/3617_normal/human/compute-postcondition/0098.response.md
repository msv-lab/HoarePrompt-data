According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `N`. The loop starts at `j = i + 1` and continues as long as `j` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` has been adjusted to `i + 1`. Given that `N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 2`, we know that `j` has the potential to increase. 

Since `j` is currently `i + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `N`. After the last iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration, making it `j = i + 2`. Thus, for the loop to execute again, we require that `N` is greater than `i + 2`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 2`, `i` is at least `1`, `j` is adjusted to `i + 2` for the loop to execute a second time**
