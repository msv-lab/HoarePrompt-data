According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `N` and the current value of `i`. The loop is designed to iterate with `j` starting from `i + 1` and going up to `N - 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `i + 1` must be less than `N`. 

Since `i` is greater than 0, this implies that `i + 1` is at least 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `N` must be greater than `i + 1`. 

As such, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- The condition that `N` must be greater than `i + 1`.
- The initial value of `j` should be set to `i + 1`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 1`, `j` is `i + 1`**
