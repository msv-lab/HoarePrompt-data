The value of `left` is increased by `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`. Given that `j` is 1 and `i` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time, the specific values of `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` will determine the change in `left`. However, since `N`, `m`, `A`, `diff`, and the specific value of `left` are not provided, we cannot calculate an exact numeric output but can describe the change. 

Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer, `m` is an empty list, `A` is created from input values, `diff` is sorted list of differences, `i` is greater than 0, `left` is increased by `abs(diff[1] - diff[i])` where `i` is at least 2.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `m` is an empty list, `A` is created from input values, `diff` is sorted list of differences, `i` is greater than 0, `left` is increased by `abs(diff[1] - diff[i])` where `i` is at least 2.**
