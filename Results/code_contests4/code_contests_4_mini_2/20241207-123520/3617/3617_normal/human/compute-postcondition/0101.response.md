The variable `right` is incremented by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. Given that `j` is adjusted to `i + 3`, we can express the change as `right += abs(diff[i + 3] - diff[i])`. Other variables (`N`, `i`, and `diff`) are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 3, `i` is at least `1`, `j` is adjusted to `i + 3`, and `right` is increased by `abs(diff[i + 3] - diff[i])`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 3`, `i` is at least `1`, `j` is adjusted to `i + 3`, and `right` is increased by `abs(diff[i + 3] - diff[i])**
