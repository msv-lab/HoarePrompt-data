The value of `right` is incremented by `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`. Given that `j` is 3 and `i` is 2, `right` will be updated to `right + abs(diff[3] - diff[2])`. The previous value of `right` is 0, so after execution, `right` will be equal to `abs(diff[3] - diff[2])`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `left` is abs(diff[0] - diff[2]) + abs(diff[1] - diff[2]), `right` is abs(diff[3] - diff[2]), `m` includes the value of `left + right`.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `left` is abs(diff[0] - diff[2]) + abs(diff[1] - diff[2]), `right` is abs(diff[3] - diff[2]), `m` includes the value of `left + right`**.
