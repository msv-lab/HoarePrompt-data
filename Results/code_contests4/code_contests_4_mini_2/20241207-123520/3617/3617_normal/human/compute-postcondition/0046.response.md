According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` in relation to `i`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` will be 1. The loop will execute again if `j` (which will be 1) is still less than `i` (which is 2).

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 200000, `i` is 2, `left` is `left + abs(diff[0] - diff[2])`, where `j` is 1**
