According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `N`. The loop will execute again as long as `j` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i + 2`, and since `N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 2`, the current value of `j` is valid for the next iteration. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the next value of `j` will be `i + 3`. Since `N` is greater than `i + 2`, it must also be greater than `i + 3` for the loop to execute again.

State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 3`, `j` is `i + 3`, `right` is incremented by abs(diff[j] - diff[i]).**
