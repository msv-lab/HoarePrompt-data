According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `N`. The loop starts with `j` initialized to `i + 1` and continues until `j` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, and we know that `N` is greater than `i + 1`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i + 1`, so for the loop to execute again, `N` must be greater than `i + 2`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 2`, `j` is `i + 2; right is incremented by abs(diff[j] - diff[i])**
