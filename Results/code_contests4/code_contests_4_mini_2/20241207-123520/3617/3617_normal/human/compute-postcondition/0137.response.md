The value of `left` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. Given that `j` is equal to `i - 1` and `i` is greater than `j`, this means that the indices are valid. The specific values of `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` are unknown, but the calculation involves the absolute difference. The states of other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `m` is an empty list, `line` is non-empty, `A` is a list of integers, `diff` is a sorted list of differences, `i` is greater than 0, and `left` has been updated.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `m` is an empty list, `line` is non-empty, `A` is a list of integers, `diff` is a sorted list of differences, `i` is greater than 0, and `left` has been updated.**
