According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `N`. The loop starts with `j` initialized to `i + 1` and continues as long as `j` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is now `i + 2`. Since `N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 2`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. 

Thus, after the next iteration, `j` will be `i + 3`. For the loop to execute again, `N` must still be greater than `j`, which means `N` must be greater than `i + 3`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 3`, `left` is updated, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is now `i + 3`, `right` has increased by `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`.**
