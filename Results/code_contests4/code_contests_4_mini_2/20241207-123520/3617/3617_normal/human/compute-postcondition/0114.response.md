According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `N` and the current value of `j`. The loop starts with `j` being set to `i + 1`, which in this case is `2 + 1 = 3`. Since `N` is a positive integer greater than `3`, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `N`.

Given that `j` starts at `3`, the loop will execute the first time if `N` is at least `4`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `N` is greater than `3`. 

State: **`N` is greater than 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `left` is abs(diff[0] - diff[2]) + abs(diff[1] - diff[2]), `right` is 0, `m` includes the value of `left + right`**
