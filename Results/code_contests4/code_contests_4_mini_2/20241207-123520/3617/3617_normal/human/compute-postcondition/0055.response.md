The value of `right` is incremented by `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`. Given that `j` is 4 and `i` is 2, the new value of `right` will depend on the current value of `right` and the absolute difference between `diff[4]` and `diff[2]`. However, the specific values of `diff[4]` and `diff[2]` are not provided, so we can only conclude that `right` is increased by that specific absolute difference.

No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is at least 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `left` is `abs(diff[0] - diff[2]) + abs(diff[1] - diff[2])`, and `right` is increased by `abs(diff[4] - diff[2])`.

Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `left` is `abs(diff[0] - diff[2]) + abs(diff[1] - diff[2])`, and `right` is increased by `abs(diff[4] - diff[2])**
