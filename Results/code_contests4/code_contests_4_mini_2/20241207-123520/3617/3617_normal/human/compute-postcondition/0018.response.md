According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `N`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `N - 1`, which means `j` is currently `i + 1` (and therefore `j` is less than `N`). For the loop to execute again, `j` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration. 

So after the current iteration, `j` will become `j + 1`, which means it will be equal to `i + 2`. Therefore, `j` needs to be updated to `i + 2`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must still be less than `N`. 

In summary, since `i` is less than `N - 1`, it ensures that `i + 2` is less than `N`, allowing the loop to continue executing.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 200000; `i` is less than `N - 1; j` is `i + 2; right` is updated by adding `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`**
