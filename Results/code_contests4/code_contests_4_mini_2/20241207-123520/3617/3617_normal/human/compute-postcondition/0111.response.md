Output State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than `3`; `i` is 2; `j` is 2; `left` is updated to `abs(diff[0] - diff[2]) + abs(diff[1] - diff[2]); `right` is the sum of absolute differences from `diff[3]` to `diff[N - 1]` with respect to `diff[2]; `m` includes the value of `left + right; `left` is updated to `left + abs(diff[2] - diff[2])`.**
