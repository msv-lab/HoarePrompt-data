According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and its relationship with `i`. The loop is set to execute while `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and since `i` is at least 1, the loop can execute again because `j` is less than `i`. 

After this iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be 1, and it will compare the absolute differences as defined in the loop body.

State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 2`, `i` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `left` is updated with the absolute difference of `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, and `right` is defined by the sum of absolute differences as stated.**
