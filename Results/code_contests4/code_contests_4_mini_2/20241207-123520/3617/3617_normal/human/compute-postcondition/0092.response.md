According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the range defined by `i`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `i` is at least 1, meaning that `i` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again. 

In the next iteration, `j` will be increased by 1, so `j` will become 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 2`, `i` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `left` is updated with the absolute difference of `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, `right` is defined by the sum of absolute differences; `left` is increased by `abs(diff[1] - diff[i])`, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be greater than 2.**
