According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `N`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i + 2`, and since `N` is greater than `i + 2`, it allows for another iteration. 

After the last iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes `i + 3`. For the loop to execute one more time, `N` must be greater than `i + 3`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 3`, `left` is the sum of absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for all `j` in range(0, i), `i` is greater than 0, `j` is `i + 3`, `right` is now the previous value of `right` plus abs(diff[j] - diff[i])**
