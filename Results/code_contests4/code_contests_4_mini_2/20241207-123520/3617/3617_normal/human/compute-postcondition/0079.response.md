To analyze the impact of the code snippet, we need to consider the initial state and how the code modifies the variables involved.

The initial state is:
- `N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 1`
- `i` is greater than 0
- `j` is `i + 1`

In the code:
```
right += abs(diff[j] - diff[i])
```
Here, `right` is being incremented by the absolute difference between the values in the `diff` array at indices `j` and `i`. Since `j` is `i + 1`, we can deduce that `j` is always one index greater than `i`. 

Assuming `diff` is defined and contains enough elements (at least `N`), the following points can be noted:
- `diff[i]` refers to the value at index `i` in the `diff` array.
- `diff[j]` (which is `diff[i + 1]`) refers to the value at index `i + 1`.

The variable `right` is modified by adding the absolute difference between these two values.

Since no specific values for `right`, `diff[i]`, and `diff[i+1]` are provided, we cannot determine specific numerical values but can state the relationship.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 1`, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is `i + 1`, and `right` is increased by `abs(diff[i + 1] - diff[i])`.**
