According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `N`. The loop will iterate as long as `j` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 4, and since `N` is at least 4, we need to check the condition for the next iteration. The next value of `j` will be `5` (since `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration). 

For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `N`. Therefore, `N` must be greater than `5` for the loop to execute a second time.

State: **`N` is at least 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, `left` is `abs(diff[0] - diff[2]) + abs(diff[1] - diff[2])`, and `right` is increased by `abs(diff[4] - diff[2])`, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than 5**
