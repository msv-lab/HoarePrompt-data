According to the code, the loop will execute if the variable `j` can take on values within the defined range of `range(i + 1, N)`. Given that `N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 2`, the minimum value of `N` is `i + 3`. This means that `j` will start at `i + 1`, which is a valid value, and will continue until it reaches `N - 1`.

Since `j` is currently less than `i`, it needs to be adjusted to `i + 1` for the loop to execute for the first time. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 2`, `left` is updated to the sum of absolute differences between `diff[0]` to `diff[i-1]` and `diff[i]`, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is now `i + 1`, `right` is 0**
