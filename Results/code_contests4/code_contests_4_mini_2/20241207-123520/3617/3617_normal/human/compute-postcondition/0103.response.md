The code appends the value of `left + right` to the list `m`. The value of `right` is defined as the sum of absolute differences from `diff[i + 1]` to `diff[N - 1]` with respect to `diff[i]`. The value of `left` is not provided in the initial state, but it is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the program. 

Since `N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 2`, and `j` is equal to `N`, it follows that the range for `right` is valid. However, we don't have specific values for `left` or the contents of the `diff` list.

Therefore, the output state summarizes the situation without specific numerical results for `left` or `right`. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 2`, `i` is at least `1`, `j` is `N`, `right` is the sum of absolute differences from `diff[i + 1]` to `diff[N - 1]` with respect to `diff[i]`, and `m` now includes the value of `left + right`.**
