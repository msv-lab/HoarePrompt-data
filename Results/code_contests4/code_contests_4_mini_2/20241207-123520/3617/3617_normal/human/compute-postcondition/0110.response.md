According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `i`. The loop is set to iterate from `0` to `i - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, which means `j` can take the values `0` and `1`. Currently, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to `2`, but since `i` is 2, the loop will not execute again because `j` will reach the limit of `i`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than `3`, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `left` is updated to `abs(diff[0] - diff[2]) + abs(diff[1] - diff[2])`, `right` is the sum of absolute differences from `diff[3]` to `diff[N - 1]` with respect to `diff[2]`, `m` includes the value of `left + right`; for the loop to execute a third time, `i` must be greater than 2.**
