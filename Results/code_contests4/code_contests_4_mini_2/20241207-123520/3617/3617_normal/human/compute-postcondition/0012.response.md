According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`. If `j` is less than `i`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is a variable that starts at 0 and increments by 1 until it reaches `i`. Since `j` is currently less than `i`, we can determine that for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1.

Thus, if `j` is currently at its maximum value of `i - 1`, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be at least 1 greater than the current `j`. 

State: **`left` is increased by abs(diff[0] - diff[2]) + abs(diff[1] - diff[2]), for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be greater than 1, and `j` is 1**
