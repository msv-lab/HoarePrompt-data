According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `i`, which means for the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be greater than 0. Given that `N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 1`, it follows that `i` must be at least 1 for the loop to have any iterations. 

At the start of the loop, `j` will be initialized to 0, which is the first value in the range. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `i` needs to be greater than 0, and `j` starts at 0.

State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 1`, `left` is 0, `right` is incremented by the sum of absolute differences, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 0**
