According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `i`, and `N`. The loop starts with `j` being initialized to `i + 1`, which is 3 in this case. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `N`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3, `i` is 2, and `N` is at least 4. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 4. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `N` must be greater than 4.

State: **`N` is at least 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `left` is `abs(diff[0] - diff[2]) + abs(diff[1] - diff[2])`, `right` is increased by `abs(diff[3] - diff[2])` for the loop to execute one more time `N` must be greater than 4.**
