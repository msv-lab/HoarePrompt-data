The variable `right` is assigned the value 0. The previous states of the other variables (`N`, `left`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged as this assignment does not affect them. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 1`, `left` is the sum of absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for all `j` in range(0, i), `i` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `i - 1`, and `right` is now 0.
