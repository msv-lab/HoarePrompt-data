According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `N`. The loop starts with `j` initialized to `i + 1`, which means that for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `N`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i + 2`, and since `i` is less than `N - 1`, it follows that `j` (which is `i + 2`) is currently less than `N`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will become `i + 3`.

Thus, for the loop to execute a third time, `j` must be less than `N`, which translates to the condition `i + 3 < N`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 200000; `i` is less than `N - 1; j` is `i + 3; right` is updated by adding `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`, for the loop to execute a third time `N` must be greater than `i + 3`**
