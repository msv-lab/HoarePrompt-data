According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `N` and the starting value of `j`. The loop will execute if `j` can take on any value in the range from `i + 1` to `N - 1`. Given that `N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 2`, the first value that `j` will take when the loop executes is `i + 1`. 

At the start of the loop, `j` is equal to `i`, and for the loop to execute for the first time, `j` needs to be incremented to `i + 1`. Therefore, `j` should be adjusted to `i + 1`, and the condition of `N` ensures that `N` is greater than `i + 1`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 2`, `i` is at least `1`, `j` is adjusted to `i + 1` for the loop to execute**
