The value of `left` is assigned the value `0`. The states of the other variables (`N`, `i`, `j`, `right`, `m`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 1`, `j` is `N`, `right` is incremented by the sum of absolute differences between `diff[j]` for `j` in range(`i + 2`, `N`) and `diff[i + 1]`, `m` is updated to include the value of `left + right`, and now `left` is 0.
