According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop is set to iterate over the range from 0 to `i`, which means that `i` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once. 

Given that `N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 2`, and `i` has already been incremented to `i + 1`, we must ensure that `i` is at least 1 before the loop starts.

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to confirm that `i` is at least 1 (which it is) and that `j` will start from 0.

State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 2`, `i` is at least 1, `j` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is defined by the sum of absolute differences as stated**.
