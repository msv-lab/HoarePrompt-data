The value of `right` is incremented by `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`. Given that `j` is now `i + 1`, we can substitute `j` with `i + 1`. The previous value of `right` is `0`, and since `diff` is an array that contains at least `N` elements, `diff[j]` (which is `diff[i + 1]`) and `diff[i]` are both valid indices. Thus, after executing the code, the new value of `right` is `0 + abs(diff[i + 1] - diff[i])`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 2`, `left` is updated to the sum of absolute differences between `diff[0]` to `diff[i-1]` and `diff[i]`, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is now `i + 1`, `right` is now `abs(diff[i + 1] - diff[i])`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 2`, `left` is updated to the sum of absolute differences between `diff[0]` to `diff[i-1]` and `diff[i]`, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is now `i + 1`, `right` is now `abs(diff[i + 1] - diff[i])`**.
