The loop iterates over the range from `i + 1` to `N`, incrementing `right` by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for each `j`. If `N` is greater than `i + 1`, the loop will execute as many times as there are elements from `i + 1` to `N - 1`. 

If `N` is equal to `i + 1`, the loop will not execute, and `right` will remain 0. 

After all iterations, `right` will contain the sum of absolute differences for all `j` from `i + 1` to `N - 1` with respect to `diff[i]`. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 200000; `i` is at least 1; `j` is `N`; `right` is the sum of absolute differences for all `j` from `i + 1` to `N - 1` with respect to `diff[i]`.**
