According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `N`. The loop starts with `j` set to `i + 1`, and for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i + 1`, and since `N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 2`, it follows that `j` can be incremented. 

To execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1, resulting in `j` being `i + 2`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `N` must be greater than `i + 2`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 2`, `left` is updated to the sum of absolute differences between `diff[0]` to `diff[i-1]` and `diff[i]`, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is now `i + 2`, `right` is now `abs(diff[i + 1] - diff[i])`**
