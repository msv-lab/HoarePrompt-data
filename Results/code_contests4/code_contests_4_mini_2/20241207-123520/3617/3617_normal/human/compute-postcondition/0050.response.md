Given the provided initial state and code of the loop, we can analyze the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed.

Initial State: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 200000; `i` is 2; `left` is 0.

The loop iterates `j` from 0 up to `i - 1`, which means it will execute for `j = 0` and `j = 1` (since `i` is 2).

- After the loop executes 1 time (for `j = 0`), `left` becomes `left + abs(diff[0] - diff[2])`.
- After the loop executes 2 times (for `j = 1`), `left` becomes `left + abs(diff[1] - diff[2])`.

After the loop completes its iterations, the value of `left` will be the sum of the absolute differences between `diff[0]` and `diff[2]` and between `diff[1]` and `diff[2]`. 

Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have finished, we can represent the output state as follows:

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 200000; `i` is 2; `left` is `abs(diff[0] - diff[2]) + abs(diff[1] - diff[2])`.**
