According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `i`, and `N`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` has been adjusted to `i + 2`, and since `N` is greater than `i + 2`, we have `j` at `i + 2`. 

To execute the loop one more time, `j` must be increased by 1. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be `i + 3`, and for the loop to execute again, `N` must be greater than `i + 3`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 3`, `i` is at least `1`, `j` is adjusted to `i + 3`, and `right` is increased by `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])**
