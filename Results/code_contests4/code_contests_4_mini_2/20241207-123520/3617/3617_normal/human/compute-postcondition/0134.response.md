According to the code, the loop iterates based on the variable `j` which starts from 0 and goes up to `i - 1`. The current state indicates that `i` is greater than 0, meaning that the loop has executed at least once. At the end of the last iteration, `j` would be `i - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must increase to `i`. Since `j` is currently at `i - 1`, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be at least 1, which it is.

So, we need to set `j` to `i` for the next iteration. The `left` variable has already been updated based on the previous iteration. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `m` is an empty list, `line` is non-empty, `A` is a list of integers obtained from raw_input() split by spaces, `diff` is a sorted list of differences calculated from A, `i` is greater than 0, `left` is updated, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be `i` (which is greater than 0)**
