According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 1`, which means `i` is currently less than `N - 1`. Since `i` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1. This means `i` will be `i + 1`, and for the loop to execute again, `N` must be greater than `i + 1` (which is now `i + 2`).

State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 2`, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is greater than `i + 1`, and `right` is the sum of absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i + 1]` for all `j` from `i + 2` to `N - 1`; `m` is updated by appending the value of `left + right`.**
