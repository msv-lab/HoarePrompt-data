According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute if `i` is greater than 0, as the range for `j` is from 0 to `i - 1`. Given that `i` is currently 0, the loop will not execute. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `i` needs to be greater than 0.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `m` is an empty list, `A` is created from input values, `diff` is sorted list of differences, for the loop to execute the first time `i` needs to be greater than 0, `left` is 0**
