The code `left += abs(diff[j] - diff[i])` updates the variable `left` by adding the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. The initial state indicates that `left` is 0, and since `i` is at least 1, `j` will take values starting from 1 up to `N - 1`. Therefore, the first execution of this line will modify `left` based on the values of `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`.

Since `left` is initialized to 0, after executing this line for a specific `j`, `left` will be updated to the absolute difference calculated. The exact value of `left` after execution depends on the specific values of `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, which are not provided. However, we can state that `left` will now be the absolute difference for the first execution.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 200000, `i` is at least 1, `j` is 0, `right` is the updated sum of absolute differences calculated from the `diff` list for all values of `j` from `i + 1` to `N - 1` with respect to `diff[i]`, `m` is updated to include `left + right`, `left` is updated to `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])` for the first execution.**
