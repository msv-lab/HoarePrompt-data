According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute again as long as `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than 0, and `j` is 1. For the loop to execute a second time, `j` will be incremented by 1, which means `j` will become 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be greater than 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 2`, `left` is updated to `left + abs(diff[1] - diff[i])`, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be greater than 2**
