According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates `j` from `0` to `i - 1`. Given that `i` is currently `2`, the loop will execute for `j` values 0 and 1 (two iterations in total). 

Before the loop starts, `N` is a positive integer greater than `3`, `i` is `2`, and `j` is currently set to `N`, which is not relevant for the current execution of the loop. The important states that need to be adjusted are the initial values of `j` to ensure it starts from `0` for the loop. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than `3`, `i` is 2, `j` is 0 (for the loop to execute the first time), `right` is the sum of absolute differences from `diff[3]` to `diff[N - 1]` with respect to `diff[2]`, `m` now includes the value of `left + right`, and `left` is now 0**
