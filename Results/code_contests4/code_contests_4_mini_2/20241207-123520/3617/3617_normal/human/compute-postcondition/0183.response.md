Output State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 2`, `left` is updated to the sum of absolute differences between `diff[0]` to `diff[i-1]` and `diff[i]`, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is now `N`, `right` is the sum of absolute differences between `diff[j]` for `j` from `i + 1` to `N - 1` and `diff[i]`; `m` now contains the value of `left + right` appended to it.**
