According to the code, the loop will execute if the condition for the range is satisfied. The loop will run for `j` starting from `i + 1` to `N - 1`. Since `i` is currently 2, `j` will start at 3. 

For the loop to execute at least once, `N` must be greater than `i + 1`, which is 3. Therefore, `N` needs to be at least 4. 

At the start of the loop, `j` will be initialized to 3. 

State: **`N` is at least 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `left` is `abs(diff[0] - diff[2]) + abs(diff[1] - diff[2])`, `right` is 0**
