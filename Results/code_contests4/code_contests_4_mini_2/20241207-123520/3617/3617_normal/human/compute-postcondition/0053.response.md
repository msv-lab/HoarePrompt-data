To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we analyze the impact of the operation.

1. The variable `right` is updated with the expression `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`.
2. The variables `i` and `j` have values `2` and `3`, respectively.
3. Since the value of `diff` is not provided, we cannot calculate the exact numerical result of `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`, but we can state that `right` will be incremented by this value.
4. The initial value of `right` is `0`, so after the operation, `right` will be equal to `abs(diff[3] - diff[2])`.

Thus, the output state reflects the updated value of `right` and maintains the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `left` is `abs(diff[0] - diff[2]) + abs(diff[1] - diff[2])`, `right` is increased by `abs(diff[3] - diff[2])`**
