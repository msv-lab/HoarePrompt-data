The value of `right` is incremented by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. Given the initial state, `j` is defined as `i + 1`, and `N` is greater than `i + 1`, ensuring that `j` is within bounds. The exact values of `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` are not defined in the initial state, but it is understood that they are valid indices based on the setup. 

Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `right` without specifying exact numerical values since they are unknown.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 1`, `j` is `i + 1; right is incremented by abs(diff[j] - diff[i])**
