According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `i` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be 2, and `i` must be greater than 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 200000; `i` is at least 1; `j` is 2; `right` is the updated sum of absolute differences calculated from the `diff` list for all values of `j` from `i + 1` to `N - 1` with respect to `diff[i]`; `m` is updated to include `left + right`; `left` is updated to include `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`, for the loop to execute a third time `i` must be greater than 2.**
