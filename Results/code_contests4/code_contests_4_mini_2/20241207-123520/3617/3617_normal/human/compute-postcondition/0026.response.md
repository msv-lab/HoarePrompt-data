According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop is designed to iterate over the range from `0` to `i - 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be greater than `0`. 

Given that `N` is a positive integer (1 <= `N` <= 200000), if `i` is `i + 1`, it means that `i` has already been incremented by 1. Thus, if the original value of `i` was `0`, it would now be `1`. Therefore, `i` can take values starting from `1` and can go up to `N`.

At the start of the loop, `j` is initialized from `0` to `i - 1`, which implies the loop will execute for `j = 0` when `i` is `1`. Hence, `i` must be at least `1` for the loop to execute.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 200000, `i` is at least 1, `j` is 0, `right` is the updated sum of absolute differences calculated from the `diff` list for all values of `j` from `i + 1` to `N - 1` with respect to `diff[i]`, `m` is updated to include `left + right`, `left` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is greater than 0**
