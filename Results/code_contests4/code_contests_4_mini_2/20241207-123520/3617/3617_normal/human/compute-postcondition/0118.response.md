According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `N`. The loop starts from `j` equal to `i + 1` and goes up to `N - 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `j` is 4. Since `N` is greater than 3, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `N - 1`. 

To execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will become 5. For the loop to execute again, `N` must be greater than 5 (since the loop runs while `j` is less than `N`).

State: **`N` is greater than 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than 5**
