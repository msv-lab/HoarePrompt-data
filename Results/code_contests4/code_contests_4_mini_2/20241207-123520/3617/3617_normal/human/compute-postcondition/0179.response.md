The variable `right` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` to its current value. The previous value of `j` is `i + 2`, and since `i` is greater than 0, `j` is at least 2. The absolute difference is calculated using the values from the `diff` array at indices `j` and `i`. Other variables remain unchanged during this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 2`, `left` is updated, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is now `i + 2`, `right` has increased by `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 2`, `left` is updated, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is now `i + 2`, `right` has increased by `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`.**
