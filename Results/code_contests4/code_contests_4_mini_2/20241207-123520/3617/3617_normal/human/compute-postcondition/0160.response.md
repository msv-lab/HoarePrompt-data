According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `N`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i + 1` and `N` is greater than `i + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to `i + 2`. 

Since `N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 1`, the condition for the loop to execute again is satisfied if `N` is greater than `i + 2`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 2`, `left` is the sum of absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for all `j` in range(0, i), `i` is greater than 0, `j` is `i + 2`, `right` is now the previous value of `right` plus abs(diff[j] - diff[i])**
