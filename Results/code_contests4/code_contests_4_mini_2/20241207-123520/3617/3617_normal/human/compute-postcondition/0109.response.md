The value of `left` is incremented by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. Given that `j` is 1 and `i` is 2, the expression `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])` calculates the absolute difference between `diff[1]` and `diff[2]`. The previous value of `left` is `abs(diff[0] - diff[2])`, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer greater than `3`, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `left` is updated to `abs(diff[0] - diff[2]) + abs(diff[1] - diff[2])`, `right` is the sum of absolute differences from `diff[3]` to `diff[N - 1]` with respect to `diff[2]`, `m` includes the value of `left + right`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than `3`, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `left` is updated to `abs(diff[0] - diff[2]) + abs(diff[1] - diff[2])`, `right` is the sum of absolute differences from `diff[3]` to `diff[N - 1]` with respect to `diff[2]`, `m` includes the value of `left + right`.**
