Output State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 1`, `left` is the sum of absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for all `j` in range(0, i), `i` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `N - 1`, `right` is the sum of absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for all `j` in range(i + 1, N); `m` is updated to include the value `left + right`.**
