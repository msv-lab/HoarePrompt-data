According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `N`. The loop starts executing with `j` initialized to `i + 1` and continues as long as `j` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `i + 2` since it increments by 1 in each iteration, and `N` is greater than `i + 2`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to `i + 3`, and `N` must be greater than `i + 3`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 3`, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is `i + 3`**
