According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and its range. The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `i - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0, which means the loop has not executed yet for any value of `j`. 

To execute the loop one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be 1, and it can only do so if `i` is at least 2 (since `j` must be less than `i`).

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 200000, `i` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `right` is the updated sum of absolute differences calculated from the `diff` list for all values of `j` from `i + 1` to `N - 1` with respect to `diff[i]`, `m` is updated to include `left + right`, `left` is updated to `abs(diff[j] - diff[i])` for the second execution.**
