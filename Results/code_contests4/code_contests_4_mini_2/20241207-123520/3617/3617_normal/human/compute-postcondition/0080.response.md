According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `N`. Since `j` starts at `i + 1` and must be less than `N` for the loop to execute, we need to check the values of these variables. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i + 1` and `N` is greater than `i + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it `j` equal to `i + 2`. For the loop to execute again, `N` must be greater than `i + 2`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 2`, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is `i + 2`, and `right` is increased by `abs(diff[i + 2] - diff[i + 1])**.
