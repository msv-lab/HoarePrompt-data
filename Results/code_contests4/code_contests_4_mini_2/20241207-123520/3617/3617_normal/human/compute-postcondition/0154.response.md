According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates while `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `i` is greater than 0, and since `N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 1`, `i` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again. 

To execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `i`, which requires that `i` is greater than 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 1`, `left` is updated by adding the absolute difference, `right` remains unchanged, `i` is greater than 1, `j` is 2**
