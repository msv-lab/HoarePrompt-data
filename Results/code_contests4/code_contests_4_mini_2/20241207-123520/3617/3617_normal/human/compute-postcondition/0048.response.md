According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute again as long as `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `i` is 2. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. Since `i` is 2, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `i`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 200000, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `left` is updated based on abs(diff[1] - diff[2]) for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than 2**
