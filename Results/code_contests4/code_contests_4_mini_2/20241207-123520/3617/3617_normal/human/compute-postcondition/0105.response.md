The variable `left` is assigned the value `0`. The previous states of the other variables (`N`, `i`, `j`, `right`, and `m`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer greater than `3`, `i` is 2, `j` is `N`, `right` is the sum of absolute differences from `diff[3]` to `diff[N - 1]` with respect to `diff[2]`, `m` now includes the value of `left + right`, and `left` is now 0.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than `3`, `i` is 2, `j` is `N`, `right` is the sum of absolute differences from `diff[3]` to `diff[N - 1]` with respect to `diff[2]`, `m` now includes the value of `left + right`, and `left` is now 0.**
