The variable `right` is incremented by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. Given that `j` is equal to `i + 2`, we can substitute this into the equation. Therefore, `right` is updated as follows: 

`right += abs(diff[i + 2] - diff[i + 1])`, where `j = i + 2`. The previous value of `right` is not specified, but its value will increase by the result of the absolute difference calculation. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than `i + 2`, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is `i + 2`, `right` is increased by `abs(diff[i + 2] - diff[i + 1])**
