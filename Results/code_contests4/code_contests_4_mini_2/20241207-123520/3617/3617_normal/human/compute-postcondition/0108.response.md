According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit defined by `i`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `j` is 0. Since `j` is currently less than `i`, the loop can execute again. 

In the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 1. For the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be less than `i`, which is still 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than `3`, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `left` is `abs(diff[0] - diff[2])`, `right` is the sum of absolute differences from `diff[3]` to `diff[N - 1]` with respect to `diff[2]`, `m` includes the value of `left + right`**
