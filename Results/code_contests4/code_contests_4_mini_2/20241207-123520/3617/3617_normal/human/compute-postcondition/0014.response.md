Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 200000; `A` is a list of `N` integers; `diff` is a sorted list of differences calculated as [(A_i - (i + 1)) for i in range(N)]; `m` is an empty list; `i` is at least 0; `left` is the sum of absolute differences calculated from the `diff` list for all values of `j` from 0 to `i-1` with respect to `diff[i]`.**
