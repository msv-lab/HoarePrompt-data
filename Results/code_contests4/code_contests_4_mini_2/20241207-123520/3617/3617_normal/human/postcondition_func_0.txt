The function reads multiple lines of input where each line specifies a positive integer N followed by N integers. For each line, it calculates the minimum sum of absolute differences between the sorted differences of the integers and their respective indices plus one, and prints this minimum value. The function processes until there are no more lines of input. It does not return any value; instead, it prints the results directly.
