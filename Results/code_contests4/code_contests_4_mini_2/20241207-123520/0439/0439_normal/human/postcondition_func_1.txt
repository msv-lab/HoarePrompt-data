The function accepts two parameters, `i` and `j`, representing the coordinates in a grid, and returns a list of tuples containing the coordinates of all adjacent cells that are black ('#'). This includes checking the cells to the right, down, left, and up of the given coordinates, while ensuring that the indices remain within the bounds of the grid. It does not handle cases where `i` and `j` are out of bounds prior to checking the adjacent cells, as it assumes valid input based on the surrounding context.
