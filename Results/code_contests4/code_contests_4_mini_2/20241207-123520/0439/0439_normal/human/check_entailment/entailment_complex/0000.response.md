Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description. Specifically, the `dfs` function always returns 1, which means it inaccurately counts the size of connected components of black cells. This undermines the logic needed to evaluate how many north magnets are required based on the connected components of black cells.

Moreover, the validation in `func_2` checks for the presence of black cells in each row and column but does not ensure that there is at least one south magnet in every row and column, which is a requirement of the problem. The annotations indicate that if any row fails the checks for black cells, the function will return -1, which may not always reflect the actual state of the grid.

For instance, the input case with a grid completely filled with white cells should return 0, as stated in the problem description, but the code does not adequately handle this situation in terms of returning the correct number of magnets needed or verifying the conditions comprehensively. 

Thus, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
