The function accepts two integers, `n` and `m`, which represent the dimensions of a grid consisting of `n` strings of length `m`. It checks if the grid is entirely composed of '.' (white cells), in which case it calls `func_3(0)` and returns None. It then validates each row to ensure that if a '#' (black cell) exists, there are no '.' (white cells) between the first and last '#' in that row. If any row fails this check, it calls `func_3(-1)` and returns None. The function also transposes the grid and performs the same validation on the columns. If all rows and columns are valid, it calls `func_3` with the result of `func_1(n, m, grid)`. The function ultimately returns None in all scenarios as no explicit return value is defined.
