The function `dfs` accepts two integer parameters `i` and `j`, which represent coordinates in a grid (where `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000`). It is intended to perform a depth-first search (DFS) starting from the position `(i, j)`. However, the function does not correctly calculate the size of the connected component, as it always returns 1 regardless of the actual number of connected cells. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to always return 1, indicating that at least one cell (the starting cell) has been visited, but it does not reflect the actual size of the connected component.
