Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 1000, `sep` is either a value from `kwargs` or ' ', `file` has written the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable, and `file` has written the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')`. If `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is True, then the buffer of `file` is flushed. Otherwise, the buffer of `file` remains unchanged.***
