The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to perform operations based on the predefined constraints of `n` and `m`, which are integers representing the dimensions of a grid. However, the function does not return any value in any of its cases. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to perform operations without accepting parameters and ultimately returns None in all cases.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns None in all cases.**
