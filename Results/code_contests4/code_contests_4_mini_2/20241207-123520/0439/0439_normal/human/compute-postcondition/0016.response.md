The `file.write(str(x))` function call writes the string representation of `x` to the `file`. The values of `n`, `m`, `sep`, and `at_start` remain unchanged as they are not impacted by this operation. The state of the `file` is updated to include the string representation of `x`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 1000, `sep` is either a value from `kwargs` or ' ', `file` has written the value of `sep` and now contains the string representation of `x`, `at_start` is False, `args` has at least 3 elements.**
