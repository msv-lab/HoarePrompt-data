The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters directly, as indicated by its definition. However, it implicitly relies on external input, specifically integers `n` and `m`, which are constrained to be between 1 and 1000. Additionally, it processes `n` lines of strings, where each string has a length of `m` and consists of characters that are either '#' (representing black) or '.' (representing white).

The function's output is not specified directly in the provided information, so we cannot establish explicit return values. Therefore, we cannot describe the specific functionality related to the return value since it is not provided.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly but relies on external input of integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000) and processes n strings of length m consisting of characters '#' and '.'. The exact output of the function is not specified.**
