The code `stack.append((ai, aj))` adds the tuple `(ai, aj)` to the end of the `stack` list. The values of `ai` and `aj` are not specified, but `visited[ai][aj]` is False, indicating that this coordinate has not been visited yet. The other variables in the state are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `si` and `sj` are assigned the values of the last element in `stack`, `component` is 1, `stack` has at least one unvisited coordinate, `visited[si][sj]` is True, `visited[ai][aj]` is False, and `(ai, aj)` has been added to `stack`.

Output State: **`si` and `sj` are assigned the values of the last element in `stack`, `component` is 1, `stack` has at least one unvisited coordinate, `visited[si][sj]` is True, `visited[ai][aj]` is False, and `(ai, aj)` has been added to `stack`.**
