Postcondition: ***`si` and `sj` are assigned the values of the last element in `stack`, `component` remains 1, and if `visited[si][sj]` is True, we continue to the next iteration without changing any variable values. Otherwise, `stack` contains all previously unvisited coordinates added during the loop execution, and all coordinates in `visited` corresponding to those in `stack` are set to True.***
