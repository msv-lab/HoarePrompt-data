According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `args` iterable. If `args` is non-empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `at_start` is set to False, and since `args` is a non-empty iterable, the loop has already started processing its elements. 

To execute one more time, `args` must still be non-empty, and we need to move to the next element within the iterable. Therefore, if the loop has processed one element, the next iteration will process the second element in `args`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 1000, `sep` is either a value from `kwargs` or ' ', `file` is either a value from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, and `args` has at least 2 elements; for the loop to execute one more time, `args` must have at least 2 elements remaining to process.**
