The variables `sep` and `file` are assigned values from the `kwargs` dictionary, where `sep` receives the value associated with the key 'sep', and `file` receives the value associated with the key 'file'. If these keys do not exist in `kwargs`, they default to ' ' (a space) for `sep` and `sys.stdout` for `file`. The initial state does not affect the values of `n` and `m`, which are still integers within the specified range.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000; `sep` is either a value from `kwargs` or ' '; `file` is either a value from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`.**
