Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 1000, `sep` is either a value from `kwargs` or ' ', `file` is either a value from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, and `args` is a non-empty iterable; if `at_start` is False, `file` writes `sep`.***
