The variables `start` and `stop` are assigned the values based on the indices of the first and last occurrences of the character `'#'` in the string `row`. The `find` method locates the first occurrence, and `rfind` locates the last occurrence. The state of `row` is not affected by this assignment.

Therefore, the Output State is: `start` is the index of the first '#' in `row`, `stop` is the index of the last '#' in `row`.
Output State: **`start` is the index of the first '#' in `row`, `stop` is the index of the last '#' in `row`**
