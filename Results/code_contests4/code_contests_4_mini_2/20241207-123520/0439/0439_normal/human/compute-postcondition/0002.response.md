According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `args`. The loop will execute if `args` contains at least one element. The current states of `n`, `m`, `sep`, `file`, and `at_start` do not directly affect the execution of the loop, but we need to ensure that `args` is not empty for the loop to iterate. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, we need `args` to contain at least one element.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 1000, `sep` is either a value from `kwargs` or ' ', `file` is either a value from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `args` is a non-empty iterable**.
