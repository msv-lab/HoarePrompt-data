Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 1000, `sep` is either a value from `kwargs` or ' ', `file` is either a value from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` has at least 3 elements, and `file` has written the value of `sep`. If `at_start` is False, the program will proceed with the next operations.***
