Postcondition: ***`si` and `sj` are assigned the values of the last element in `stack`, `component` is 1, `stack` has at least one unvisited coordinate, `visited[si][sj]` is True, and `visited[ai][aj]` is False. For the loop to execute the first time, `get_adj(si, sj)` must return at least one adjacent coordinate.***
