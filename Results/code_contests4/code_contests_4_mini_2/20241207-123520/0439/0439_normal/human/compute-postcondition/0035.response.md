According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the iterable `grit`. If `grit` has at least one more element after the current `row`, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `start` is the index of the first '#', `stop` is the index of the last '#' in `row`. For the loop to execute one more time, `row` must be the next element in `grit`. 

State: **`start` is the index of the first '#', `stop` is the index of the last '#' in the current `row`, for the loop to execute one more time `grit` must have at least one more element.**
