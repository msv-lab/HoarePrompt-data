To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and see if it adheres to the problem requirements.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Grid representation**: The grid consists of cells that are either black (`#`) or white (`.`).
2. **Placement of magnets**:
   - There must be at least one south magnet in every row and column.
   - North magnets must be able to reach black cells and must not reach white cells after operations.
3. **Output**: The program should return the minimum number of north magnets needed or `-1` if it's impossible to satisfy the conditions.

### Code Analysis
- The program defines a function `func_1` that performs a depth-first search (DFS) to count connected components of black cells (`#`). This helps in determining the number of north magnets needed to ensure that every component has a north magnet.
- The function `func_2` checks the grid for compliance with the problem requirements. It verifies whether there are `#` in every row and column while ensuring that no `.` is located between `#` in any row or column.
- If all conditions are met, it calls `func_1` to compute the answer.

### Potential Cases
To evaluate correctness, we need to consider edge cases and situations that might not be handled properly:

1. **All white grid**: If the grid contains only `.` (white cells), the program should return `0`. This is handled correctly by checking if the grid is all white.
   
2. **Isolated black cells**: If there are black cells that are not connected to others and do not fulfill the requirement of having a south magnet in the same row/column, the program must return `-1`. The code appears to check for this by looking for `.` between `#`, which should be valid.

3. **Non-rectangular arrangements**: If there are rows or columns that fail to contain at least one `#`, the program should return `-1`. The program checks this condition before proceeding.

4. **Valid configurations**: If the grid allows for a configuration where all conditions can be fulfilled with a certain number of north magnets, this should also return the correct count.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the code and considering various edge cases, it seems that the provided code properly checks for all the outlined conditions from the problem description. It ensures:
- At least one south magnet per row/column.
- Black cells can be reached by north magnets.
- White cells cannot be reached by north magnets.

Based on the structure of the code and the logical checks in place, I could not find any case where the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
