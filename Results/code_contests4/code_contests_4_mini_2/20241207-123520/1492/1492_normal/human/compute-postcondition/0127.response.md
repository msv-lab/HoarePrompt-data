Postcondition: ***`maxstack` contains only elements that are greater than or equal to `x`, and `maxidx` contains the indices corresponding to these elements. `minstack` is not empty and its top element equals `x`, which has been popped, resulting in one less element in `minstack`. Additionally, `dp[i]` remains unchanged if `maxidx` is empty or is updated to the minimum of its current value and `dp[maxidx[-1]] + 1` if `maxidx` is non-empty. The last element of `maxstack` is equal to `x`.***
