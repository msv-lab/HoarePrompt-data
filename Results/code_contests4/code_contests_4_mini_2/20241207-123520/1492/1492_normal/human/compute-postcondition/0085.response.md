Postcondition: ***`maxstack` contains only elements that are greater than or equal to `x`, `maxidx` contains the corresponding indices for those elements, `minstack` is a list with the top element equal to `x` and after executing the if part, the top element of `minstack` has been popped off while `minidx` has one less element. Additionally, `maxstack` is not empty and the top element of `maxstack` equals `x`.***
