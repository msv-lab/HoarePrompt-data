The value of `dp[i]` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `dp[minidx[-1]] + 1`. The variable `minidx` represents the index of the minimum element in `maxstack`, and since `maxstack` contains only elements greater than or equal to `x`, `minidx[-1]` is a valid index within `dp`. The variable `dp` is modified based on the current state of `dp[i]` and the value at `dp[minidx[-1]]`. Other variables remain unchanged during this operation. 

Output State: **`maxstack` contains only elements that are greater than or equal to `x`, `maxidx` contains the indices corresponding to the remaining elements in `maxstack`, `dp[i]` is updated to min(dp[i], dp[minidx[-1]] + 1)**.
