The `minstack` is updated by appending the value `x`, which means `x` is added to the end of `minstack`. The other variables (`maxstack`, `maxidx`, and `minidx`) remain unchanged. The initial state indicates that `maxstack` contains only elements greater than or equal to `x`, and the top element of `minstack` may or may not have been equal to `x`, but since we're appending `x`, it will now be there regardless.

Output State: **`maxstack` contains only elements greater than or equal to `x`; `minstack` now has `x` appended; `maxidx` remains unchanged; `minidx` remains unchanged.**
