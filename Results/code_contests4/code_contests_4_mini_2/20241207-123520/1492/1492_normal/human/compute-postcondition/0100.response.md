According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `minstack` and the comparison between the last element of `minstack` and `x`. The loop can execute again if `minstack` is not empty and its last element is greater than `x`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `minstack` has one less element after popping, so for the loop to execute one more time, `minstack` must still contain at least one element, and that element must be greater than `x` before the pop occurred. Therefore, we need to ensure that `minstack` had at least two elements before the last iteration, with the last element being greater than `x`.

State: **`maxstack` includes the appended value `x`, `minstack` has `x` appended, `minstack` now has one less element after popping and for the loop to execute again `minstack` must have had at least 2 elements, and the last element before popping was greater than `x`.**
