The `minstack.pop()` operation removes the last element from the `minstack`. The state of the other variables is not affected by this operation, and since `minstack` contains an integer greater than `x`, we do not know the specific value that is being popped. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000, `h` is a list of integers, `first` is the first element of `h`, `dp` is a list of `n` zeros, `maxstack` contains the value of `first`, `maxidx` is [0], `minstack` is now missing its last element, `ar` is a non-empty list, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element of `ar`, and `minidx` is now empty.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000, `h` is a list of integers, `first` is the first element of `h`, `dp` is a list of `n` zeros, `maxstack` contains the value of `first`, `maxidx` is [0], `minstack` is now missing its last element, `ar` is a non-empty list, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element of `ar`, and `minidx` is now empty.**
