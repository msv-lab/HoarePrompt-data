The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxstack` is now updated to include `x`, `maxidx` now contains the previously existing values plus `0`, `minstack` contains `x`, `minidx` has one more element, `dp[i]` is unchanged, `ar` is a non-empty list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and `x` is the second element of `ar` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
