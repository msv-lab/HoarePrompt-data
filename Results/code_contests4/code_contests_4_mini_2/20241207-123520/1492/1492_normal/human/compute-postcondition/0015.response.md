The `minidx.pop()` operation removes the last element from the `minidx` list, which currently contains the value `[0]`. After this operation, `minidx` will be empty. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000, `h` is a list of integers, `first` is the first element of `h`, `dp` is a list of `n` zeros, `maxstack` contains the value of `first`, `maxidx` is [0], `minstack` is empty, `ar` is a non-empty list, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element of `ar`, and `minidx` is now empty after popping the last element.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000, `h` is a list of integers, `first` is the first element of `h`, `dp` is a list of `n` zeros, `maxstack` contains the value of `first`, `maxidx` is [0], `minstack` is empty, `ar` is a non-empty list, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element of `ar`, and `minidx` is now empty.**
