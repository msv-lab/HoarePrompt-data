The `maxstack.pop()` operation removes the last element from the `maxstack`. Given that `maxstack` initially contains the value of `first`, after this operation, `maxstack` will be empty. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000, `h` is a list of integers, `first` is the first element of `h`, `dp` is a list of `n` zeros, `maxstack` is empty, `maxidx` is [0], `minstack` contains elements less than or equal to `x`, `ar` is a non-empty list, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element of `ar`, and for the loop to execute the first time, `first` must be less than `x`.**
