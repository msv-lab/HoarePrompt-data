To determine the conditions under which the `while` loop can execute, we need to analyze the loop condition: `minstack and minstack[-1] > x`. 

1. The first part of the condition, `minstack`, checks if `minstack` is non-empty. Since `minstack` contains `x`, which is the second element of `ar`, we can assume it is not empty in the current state.

2. The second part of the condition, `minstack[-1] > x`, checks if the last element of `minstack` is greater than `x`. In the current state, `minstack` contains `x` (the second element of `ar`). Therefore, for the loop to execute, the last element of `minstack` must be greater than `x`. 

Given that `minstack` contains `x`, it means `minstack[-1]` is equal to `x`, which does not satisfy the condition `minstack[-1] > x`. 

To allow the loop to execute, we need to adjust the content of `minstack` so that the last element is greater than `x`. This could be achieved by ensuring that `minstack` contains a value greater than `x`.

Therefore, we must adjust `minstack` to contain an element greater than `x`.

State: **`maxstack` includes `x`, `maxidx` contains the previously existing values plus `0`, `minstack` must contain an element greater than `x`, `minidx` has one more element, `dp[i]` is updated, `ar` is a non-empty list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and `x` is the second element of `ar**.
