The `pop()` method removes the last element from the `minidx` list. Since `minidx` is currently empty, attempting to pop an element will not change its state, and this operation will not have any effect on any other variables. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000, `h` is a list of integers, `first` is the first element of `h`, `dp` is a list of `n` zeros, `maxstack` contains the value of `first`, `maxidx` is [0], `minstack` is now missing its last element, `ar` is a non-empty list, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element of `ar`, and `minidx` remains empty.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000, `h` is a list of integers, `first` is the first element of `h`, `dp` is a list of `n` zeros, `maxstack` contains the value of `first`, `maxidx` is [0], `minstack` is now missing its last element, `ar` is a non-empty list, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element of `ar`, and `minidx` is empty.**
