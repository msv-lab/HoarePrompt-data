The function `func_5` accepts two parameters: `f`, which is an integer representing the total number of skyscrapers, and `dim`, which is a tuple containing `f` integers that represent the heights of the skyscrapers. The constraints specify that `f` must be between 2 and 300,000, and each height value in `dim` must be between 1 and 1,000,000,000. 

The function checks if `dim` is not empty. If it is not empty, it returns a list created by repeating the second element of the tuple `dim` (i.e., `dim[1]`) a number of times equal to the first element of the tuple `dim` (i.e., `dim[0]`). If `dim` is empty, the function returns the value of `f`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_5` is to accept an integer `f` and a tuple `dim`, and based on the contents of `dim`, it either returns a list of repeated heights or the value of `f` if `dim` is empty. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `f` and a tuple `dim`, returns a list of the second element of `dim` repeated `dim[0]` times if `dim` is not empty, or returns `f` if `dim` is empty.**
