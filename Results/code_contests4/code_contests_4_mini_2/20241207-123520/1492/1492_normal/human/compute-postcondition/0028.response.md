Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000, `h` is a list of integers, `first` is the first element of `h`, `dp` is a list of `n` zeros, `maxstack` remains empty, `minstack` contains elements less than or equal to `x`, `ar` is a non-empty list, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element of `ar`, and the first element of `maxstack` has been removed, resulting in `maxidx` having its last element popped.**
