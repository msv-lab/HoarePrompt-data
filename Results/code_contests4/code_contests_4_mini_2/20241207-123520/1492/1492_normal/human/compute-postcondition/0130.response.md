Postcondition: ***`maxstack`, `maxidx`, `minstack`, and `dp` are updated accordingly. If `maxstack` is not empty and its top element equals `x`, then `maxstack` has one less element, `minstack` has one less element, and `dp[i]` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `dp[maxidx[-1]] + 1` if `maxidx` is non-empty; otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.***
