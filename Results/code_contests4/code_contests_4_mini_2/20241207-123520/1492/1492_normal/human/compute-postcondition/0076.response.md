The value of `dp[i]` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `dp[minidx[-1]] + 1`. Since `minidx` is defined and has a truthy value, `minidx[-1]` retrieves the last index from `minidx`. The value of `dp[minidx[-1]]` is accessed, and `1` is added to it. The states of `maxstack` and `maxidx` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`maxstack` contains only elements that are greater than or equal to `x`, `maxidx` contains the corresponding indices for those elements; `minidx` is defined and has a truthy value; `dp[i]` is updated to min(dp[i], dp[minidx[-1]] + 1).**
