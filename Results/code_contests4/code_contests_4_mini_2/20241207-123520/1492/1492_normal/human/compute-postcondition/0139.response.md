Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `h` of integers representing the heights of skyscrapers. It processes the heights to calculate a list `dp`, which holds the minimum number of operations required to account for the skyscrapers based on their heights. The function then prints the last value of `dp`, which indicates the result for the entire list of skyscrapers. The exact nature of the operations is not explicitly described, and potential edge cases related to the constraints on heights and the relationship between consecutive skyscrapers are handled through the use of stacks and indexing. **
