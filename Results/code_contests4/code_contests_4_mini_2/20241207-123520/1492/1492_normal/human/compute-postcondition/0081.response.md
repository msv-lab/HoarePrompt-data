Postcondition: ***`maxstack` contains only elements that are greater than or equal to `x`, `maxidx` contains the corresponding indices for those elements, `minstack` is a list, and the top element of `minstack` is equal to `x`. If `maxidx` is truthy and `minidx` is defined with a truthy value, `dp[i]` has been updated to the minimum of its current value and `dp[maxidx[-1]] + 1`. If `maxidx` is truthy but `minidx` is not, there are no updates to `dp[i]`.***
