To determine whether the `while` loop can execute, we need to analyze the condition `maxstack and maxstack[-1] < x`. The loop will execute if both conditions are satisfied:

1. `maxstack` must not be empty.
2. The last element of `maxstack` (i.e., `maxstack[-1]`) must be less than `x`.

Given the state right before the loop: `maxstack` includes the appended value `x`, it implies that the last element of `maxstack` could be equal to `x`, which would make the condition `maxstack[-1] < x` false, hence preventing the loop from executing.

For the loop to execute for the first time, we need to ensure that `maxstack` is not empty and that the last element of `maxstack` is strictly less than `x`. Therefore, we must adjust the state of `maxstack` so that its last element is less than `x`.

State: **`maxstack` includes the appended value `x`, for the loop to execute the first time then `maxstack` must not be empty and `maxstack[-1]` must be less than `x**.
