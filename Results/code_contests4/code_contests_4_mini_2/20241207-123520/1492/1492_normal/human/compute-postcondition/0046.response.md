Postcondition: ***`maxstack` is not empty, `maxidx` remains unchanged, `minstack` still does not contain the last element equal to `x`, `minidx` has one less element, `dp[i]` is unchanged, `ar` is non-empty, `i` is 0, and `x` is the first element of `ar`. If `maxstack` is not empty and its last element equals `x`, then the last element of `maxidx` has been removed.***
