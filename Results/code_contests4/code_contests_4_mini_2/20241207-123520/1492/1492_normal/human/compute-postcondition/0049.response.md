`maxstack` is not empty, and we are appending the value of `x` (which is the first element of `ar`) to `maxstack`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxstack` is now updated to include `x`, `maxidx` remains unchanged, `minstack` contains `x`, `minidx` has one more element, `dp[i]` is unchanged, `ar` is non-empty, `i` is 0, and `x` is the first element of `ar`.
