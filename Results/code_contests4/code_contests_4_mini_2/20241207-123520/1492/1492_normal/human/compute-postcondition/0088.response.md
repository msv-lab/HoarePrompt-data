Postcondition: ***`maxstack` contains only elements greater than or equal to `x`, and if the last element of `maxstack` equals `x`, it is removed, while `maxidx`, `minstack`, and `minidx` remain unchanged. If `minstack` is not empty and its top element equals `x`, the state is updated accordingly; otherwise, no changes occur to the other variables.***
