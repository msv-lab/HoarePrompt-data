According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition involving `minstack` and the value of `x`. The loop will execute again if `minstack` is not empty and the last element of `minstack` (i.e., `minstack[-1]`) is greater than `x`. 

At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that `minstack` has one less element after popping, and it must have had at least 2 elements before popping. This means that there was a last element before popping that was greater than `x`, which allowed the loop to run. 

To ensure that the loop can execute again, `minstack` must not only have at least one element left but also that the new last element of `minstack` (after popping) needs to be greater than `x`. Since the previous last element was greater than `x`, it implies that the second last element (the new last element after popping) must also be greater than `x`.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we must ensure that `minstack` still has at least one element that is greater than `x`. 

State: **`maxstack` includes the appended value `x`, `minstack` has one less element after popping, and for the loop to execute again, `minstack` currently has at least one element that is greater than `x`.**
