`maxstack` is modified by appending the value `x` to it. The conditions state that `maxstack` originally contains only elements greater than or equal to `x`, so the addition of `x` maintains this condition. The other variables `minstack`, `maxidx`, and `minidx` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxstack` now includes the appended value `x`, `minstack` has `x` appended, `maxidx` remains unchanged, and `minidx` now includes `i`.

Output State: **`maxstack` now includes the appended value `x`, `minstack` has `x` appended, `maxidx` remains unchanged, and `minidx` now includes `i`.**
