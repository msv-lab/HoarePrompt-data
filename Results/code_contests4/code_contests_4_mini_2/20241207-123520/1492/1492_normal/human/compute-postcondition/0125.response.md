Output State: **`maxstack` contains only elements that are greater than or equal to `x`; `maxidx` contains the indices corresponding to these elements; `dp[i]` remains unchanged if `maxidx` is empty, or is updated to the minimum of its current value and `dp[maxidx[-1]] + 1` if `maxidx` is non-empty; `minstack` now has one less element after popping the top element, and the top element of `minstack` was equal to `x`.**
