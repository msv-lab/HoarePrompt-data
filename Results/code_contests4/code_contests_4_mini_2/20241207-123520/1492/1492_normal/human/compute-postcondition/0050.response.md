The code `maxidx.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `maxidx`. The initial state indicates that `maxidx` remains unchanged before this operation, so the value of `i` (which is 0) will be added to `maxidx`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxstack` is now updated to include `x`, `maxidx` now contains the previously existing values plus `0`, `minstack` contains `x`, `minidx` has one more element, `dp[i]` is unchanged, `ar` is non-empty, `i` is 0, and `x` is the first element of `ar`.
