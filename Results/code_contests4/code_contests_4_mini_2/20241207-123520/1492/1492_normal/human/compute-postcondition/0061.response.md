According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `minstack` and `x`. The loop will execute again if `minstack` is non-empty and its last element is greater than `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `minstack` has one element removed, and `minstack` must still be non-empty for the loop to continue. 

Additionally, since `x` is the second element of `ar`, we should ensure that the last element of `minstack` must be greater than `x` for the loop to execute again. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `minstack` must have at least one element remaining and that element must be greater than `x`.

State: **`maxstack` includes `x`, `maxidx` contains the previously existing values plus `0`, `minstack` has one element remaining and for the loop to execute again, the last element of `minstack` must be greater than `x`**
