The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `h`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 300000\), and the parameter `h` is a list of integers representing the heights of skyscrapers, where each height \(h_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq h_i \leq 10^9\). The function will process these inputs and return a specific output based on the relationship between the heights of the skyscrapers. However, the exact nature of the return value based on these inputs is not provided in the output description.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n`, and a list of integers `h` representing skyscraper heights, and processes them according to the defined logic to produce a result.**
