The operation `minstack.pop()` removes the last element from `minstack`. Since the last element of `minstack` is equal to `x`, this element will be removed from the stack. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `minstack` now has one less element, and the specific element that was removed is equal to `x`.

Output State: **`maxstack` is empty, `maxidx` is not empty, `minstack` no longer contains the last element equal to `x`, `ar` is a non-empty list, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element of `ar`, and the last element of `minstack` has been removed.**
