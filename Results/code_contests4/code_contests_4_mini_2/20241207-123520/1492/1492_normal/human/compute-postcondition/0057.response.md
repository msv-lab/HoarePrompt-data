The `minidx.pop()` operation removes the last element from the `minidx` list. Since `minidx` has one less element before the operation, it will now have one less element after the `pop()`. The other variables, `maxstack`, `maxidx`, `dp[i]`, `ar`, `i`, and `x`, remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxstack` includes `x`, `maxidx` contains the previously existing values plus `0`, `minstack` has one element removed, `minidx` has one less element, `dp[i]` is updated, `ar` is a non-empty list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and `x` is the second element of `ar`.
