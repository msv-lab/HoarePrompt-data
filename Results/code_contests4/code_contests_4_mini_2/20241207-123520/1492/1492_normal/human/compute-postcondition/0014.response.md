The operation `minstack.pop()` removes the last element from the list `minstack`. Given that `minstack` initially contains the value of `first`, which is the first element of `h`, after executing this operation, `minstack` will be empty. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000, `h` is a list of integers, `first` is the first element of `h`, `dp` is a list of `n` zeros, `maxstack` contains the value of `first`, `maxidx` is [0], `minstack` is empty, `minidx` is [0], `ar` is a non-empty list, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element of `ar`, and the last element of `minstack` has been popped.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000, `h` is a list of integers, `first` is the first element of `h`, `dp` is a list of `n` zeros, `maxstack` contains the value of `first`, `maxidx` is [0], `minstack` is empty, `minidx` is [0], `ar` is a non-empty list, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element of `ar`, and the last element of `minstack` has been popped.**
