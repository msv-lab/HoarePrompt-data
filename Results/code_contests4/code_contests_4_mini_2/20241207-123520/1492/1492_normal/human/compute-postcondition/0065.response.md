According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `maxstack`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `maxstack` is not empty and the last element of `maxstack` is less than `x`. 

Right before the loop, it is stated that `maxstack` includes `x`, which means `maxstack` is not empty. However, for the loop to execute, the last element of `maxstack` must be less than `x`. Since `x` is the second element of `ar`, we need to ensure that the last element in `maxstack` is indeed less than `x`.

Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute, we need to adjust the last element of `maxstack` to be less than `x`. 

State: **`maxstack` includes `x`, for the loop to execute the first time the last element of `maxstack` must be less than `x`**
