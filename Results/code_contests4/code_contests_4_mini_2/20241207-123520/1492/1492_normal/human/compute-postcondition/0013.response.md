To determine if the loop can execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition of the `while` loop: `minstack and minstack[-1] > x`. 

1. The first part of the condition `minstack` checks if `minstack` is non-empty. Since `minstack` is initialized with the value of `first`, which is the first element of `h`, it is non-empty as long as `h` itself is not an empty list. The problem states that `ar` is a non-empty list, but it does not provide explicit information about `h`. However, since `n` is bounded with the condition `2 ≤ n ≤ 300000`, it implies `h` must also have valid heights (at least two heights due to `n`).

2. The second part of the condition `minstack[-1] > x` requires that the last element of `minstack` (which is the first element of `h`, `first`) must be greater than `x`, which is the first element of `ar`. 

Given that `first` is the first element of `h`, we can conclude:
- For the loop to execute, we need `first > x`.

Since `first` is defined as the first element of `h` and `x` is the first element of `ar`, we will adjust the state to ensure that `first` is greater than `x`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000, `h` is a list of integers, `first` is the first element of `h`, `dp` is a list of `n` zeros, `maxstack` contains the value of `first`, `maxidx` is [0], `minstack` is [first], `minidx` is [0], `ar` is a non-empty list, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element of `ar`, for the loop to execute the first time then `first` must be greater than `x`**.
