The `minidx` list has one element removed due to the `pop()` method, which removes the last element of the list. The previous state indicates that `minidx` had one element remaining, which is now reduced by one. The other variables (`maxstack`, `maxidx`, `dp[i]`, `ar`, `i`, `x`) are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `maxstack` includes `x`, `maxidx` contains the previously existing values plus `0`, `minstack` has one element removed, `minidx` has one element remaining minus one, `dp[i]` is updated, `ar` is a non-empty list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and `x` is the second element of `ar`.
