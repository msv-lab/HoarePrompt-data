According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `maxstack` and `x`. The loop will execute again if `maxstack` is not empty and the last element of `maxstack` is less than `x`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `maxstack` is not empty (since the loop only executes when `maxstack` has elements) and that the last element of `maxstack` is less than `x` (because the loop condition checks for this).

Since `maxstack` was not empty at the end of the last iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there is still at least one element in `maxstack` that is less than `x`. Therefore, we need to add an element to `maxstack` that is less than `x`.

No other states need to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000, `h` is a list of integers, `first` is the first element of `h`, `dp` is a list of `n` zeros, `maxstack` remains empty, `minstack` contains elements less than or equal to `x`, `ar` is a non-empty list, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element of `ar`, and for the loop to execute again, `maxstack` must contain at least one element less than `x`.**
