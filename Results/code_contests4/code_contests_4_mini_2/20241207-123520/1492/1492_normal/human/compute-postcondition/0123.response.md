Postcondition: ***`maxstack` contains only elements that are greater than or equal to `x`, `maxidx` contains the indices corresponding to these elements. If `maxidx` is non-empty, then `dp[i]` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `dp[maxidx[-1]] + 1`. If `maxidx` is empty, then there is no change to `dp[i]`. The `minstack` is not empty, and the top element of `minstack` is equal to `x`.***
