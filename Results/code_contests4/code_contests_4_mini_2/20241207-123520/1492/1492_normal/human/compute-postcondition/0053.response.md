Postcondition: ***`maxstack` includes `x`, `maxidx` contains the previously existing values plus `0`, `minstack` contains `x`, `minidx` has one more element, `dp[i]` remains unchanged, `ar` is a non-empty list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and `x` is the second element of `ar`. If `i` is equal to 0, we continue to the next iteration of the loop.***
