Postcondition: ***`maxstack` contains only elements that are greater than or equal to `x`, `maxidx` contains the indices corresponding to the remaining elements in `maxstack`, both `maxstack` and `maxidx` may have been reduced to contain only relevant elements based on the initial values, and the loop has finished executing when `maxstack` is empty or its last element is not less than `x`. Additionally, `minidx` is a defined value indicating the index of the minimum element in `maxstack` or represents a valid state in the context of the program.***
