The `minidx` list is currently empty. The operation `minidx.pop()` attempts to remove the top element from `minidx`. However, since `minidx` has no elements, this operation has no effect and does not change the state of any variables. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000, `h` is a list of integers, `first` is the first element of `h`, `dp` is a list of `n` zeros, `maxstack` contains the value of `first`, `maxidx` is [0], `minstack` must contain an element greater than `x`, `ar` is a non-empty list, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element of `ar`, `minidx` is empty and the pop operation from `minidx` has no effect.`**
