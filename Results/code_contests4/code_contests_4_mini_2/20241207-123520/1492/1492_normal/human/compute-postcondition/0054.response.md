The value of `dp[i]` is assigned the value of `dp[i - 1] + 1`. Since `i` is 1, we look at `dp[0]` (which is unchanged) and add 1 to it. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxstack` includes `x`, `maxidx` contains the previously existing values plus `0`, `minstack` contains `x`, `minidx` has one more element, `dp[i]` is updated, `ar` is a non-empty list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and `x` is the second element of `ar`.
