Postcondition: ***`maxstack` is not empty, and the last element of `maxstack` is equal to `x`. `maxidx` is not empty, and `minstack` no longer contains the last element equal to `x`. The last element of `minidx` has been popped. Additionally, if `maxidx` is not empty, then `dp[i]` is modified to be the minimum of its current value and `dp[maxidx[-1]] + 1. The list `ar` is non-empty, `i` is 0, and `x` is the first element of `ar`.***
