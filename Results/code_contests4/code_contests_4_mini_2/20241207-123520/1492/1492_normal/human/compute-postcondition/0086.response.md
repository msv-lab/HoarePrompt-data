The `maxstack.pop()` operation removes the top element from `maxstack`. Since we know that `maxstack` is not empty and that its top element is equal to `x`, after executing this code, the top element (which is `x`) will be removed from the stack. The other variables (`maxidx`, `minstack`, and `minidx`) are not directly affected by this operation, so their states remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`maxstack` does not contain `x` anymore, `maxidx` remains unchanged, `minstack` remains unchanged, and `minidx` remains unchanged.**
