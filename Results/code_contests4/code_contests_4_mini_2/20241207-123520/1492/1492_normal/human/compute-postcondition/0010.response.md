The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state will reflect that no changes have occurred, and the program continues execution without modifying any variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000, `h` is a list of integers representing the heights of the skyscrapers, `first` is assigned the value of the first element of `h`, `dp` is a list of `n` zeros, `maxstack` contains the value of `first`, `maxidx` is [0], `minstack` is [first], `minidx` is [0], `ar` is a non-empty list, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element of `ar`, and `i` is equal to 0; continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
