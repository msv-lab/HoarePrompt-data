The `minidx` list is updated by appending the value of `i` to it. The initial state indicates that `minstack` already has `x` appended, and `maxstack` and `maxidx` remain unchanged. The only change occurs in `minidx`, which will now include the additional element `i`. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`maxstack` contains only elements greater than or equal to `x`; `minstack` now has `x` appended; `maxidx` remains unchanged; `minidx` now includes `i`.**
