`maxstack` is assigned a list containing the value of `first`, which is the first element of `ar`. The other variables `n`, `h`, and `dp` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000; `h` is a list of integers representing the heights of the skyscrapers; `first` is assigned the value of the first element of `ar`; `dp` is a list of `n` zeros; `maxstack` contains the value of `first`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000; `h` is a list of integers representing the heights of the skyscrapers; `first` is assigned the value of the first element of `ar`; `dp` is a list of `n` zeros; `maxstack` contains the value of `first`.**
