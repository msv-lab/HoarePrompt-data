`minidx` is updated by appending the value of `i`, which is currently 0. This means that 0 will be added to `minidx`, increasing its length by one. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxstack` is not empty; `maxidx` remains unchanged; `minstack` now contains `x`; `minidx` now has one more element; `dp[i]` is unchanged; `ar` is non-empty; `i` is 0; and `x` is the first element of `ar`.

Output State: **`maxstack` is not empty; `maxidx` remains unchanged; `minstack` now contains `x`; `minidx` now has one more element; `dp[i]` is unchanged; `ar` is non-empty; `i` is 0; and `x` is the first element of `ar`.**
