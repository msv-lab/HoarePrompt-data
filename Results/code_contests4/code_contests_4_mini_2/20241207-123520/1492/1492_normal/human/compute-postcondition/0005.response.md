The variable `maxidx` is assigned the value `[0]`, initializing a list with a single element `0`. The other variables (`n`, `h`, `first`, `dp`, `maxstack`) remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000; `h` is a list of integers representing the heights of the skyscrapers; `first` is assigned the value of the first element of `ar`; `dp` is a list of `n` zeros; `maxstack` contains the value of `first`; `maxidx` is [0].
