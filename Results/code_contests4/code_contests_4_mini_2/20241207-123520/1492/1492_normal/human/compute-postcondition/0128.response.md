Output State: **`maxstack` has one less element, and the last element of `maxstack` before the pop was equal to `x`. `maxidx` remains unchanged if it is empty; otherwise, it is updated to reflect the change in `maxstack`. `minstack` has one less element after popping `x`. The value of `dp[i]` remains unchanged if `maxidx` is empty or is updated to the minimum of its current value and `dp[maxidx[-1]] + 1` if `maxidx` is non-empty.**
