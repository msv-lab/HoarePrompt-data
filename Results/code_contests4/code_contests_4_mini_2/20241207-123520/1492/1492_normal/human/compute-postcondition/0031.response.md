The operation `maxidx.pop()` attempts to remove the last element from the list `maxidx`. However, since `maxstack` is currently empty (as stated in the initial state), this operation will not affect any variables or lists, and it may raise an error if not handled.

Since there are no changes to the other variables, the output state remains the same except for the indication that `maxstack` was empty and a pop operation was attempted.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000, `h` is a list of integers, `first` is the first element of `h`, `dp` is a list of `n` zeros, `maxstack` is empty, `minstack` contains elements less than or equal to `x`, `ar` is a non-empty list, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element of `ar`, and an attempt to pop from an empty `maxstack` was made.**
