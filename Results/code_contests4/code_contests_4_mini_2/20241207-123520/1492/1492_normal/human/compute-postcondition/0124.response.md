Output State: **`maxstack` contains only elements that are greater than or equal to `x`; `maxidx` contains the indices corresponding to these elements; if `maxidx` is non-empty, then `dp[i]` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `dp[maxidx[-1]] + 1`; if `maxidx` is empty, then there is no change to `dp[i]`; `minstack` is not empty; the top element of `minstack` is equal to `x`; `minstack` now has one less element after popping the top element.**
