According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ar`. For the loop to execute at least once, `ar` must be a non-empty list. Since `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000, the size of `ar` is also relevant, but it is not explicitly defined in the provided state. 

Assuming `ar` is initialized and has at least one element, the `i` variable will start at 0, and `x` will be assigned the first element of `ar`. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need `ar` to be a non-empty list. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000, `h` is a list of integers representing the heights of the skyscrapers, `first` is assigned the value of the first element of `h`, `dp` is a list of `n` zeros, `maxstack` contains the value of `first`, `maxidx` is [0], `minstack` is [first], `minidx` is [0], for the loop to execute the first time `ar` must be a non-empty list, `i` is 0, and `x` is the first element of `ar`.**
