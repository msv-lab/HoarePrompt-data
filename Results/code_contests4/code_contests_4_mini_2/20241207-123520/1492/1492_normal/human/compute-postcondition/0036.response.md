Postcondition: ***`maxstack` is empty, `maxidx` is not empty, `minstack` contains elements less than or equal to `x`, `ar` is a non-empty list, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element of `ar`, every element in `maxstack` was less than `x` until it was empty, and if `minidx` is true, then `dp[i]` is modified to be the minimum of its current value and `dp[minidx[-1]] + 1.***
