The function accepts no parameters and returns a list of integers obtained from user input. Each integer in the list is converted from a string to an integer and is expected to be within the range of 1 to 1,000,000,000. However, the function does not enforce any input validation, so it may fail or produce unexpected results if the input does not conform to this expected range.
