Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Specifically, the annotations and the code itself indicate potential issues:

1. **Handling of Input**: The function `func_1` expects to read heights from the input using `func_2`. However, `func_2` does not validate the input, and it is unclear how the heights are processed in relation to their indices. The logic in `func_1` assumes valid input but does not handle unexpected or malformed input.

2. **Logic for Jumps**: The main logic in `func_1` is meant to calculate the minimum number of discrete jumps. However, it does not correctly implement the conditions for a discrete jump as specified in the problem. Specifically, the handling of the stacks (`maxstack`, `minstack`) and the indices (`maxidx`, `minidx`) does not guarantee that all conditions for a discrete jump are checked correctly. The annotations suggest that it checks for the maximum and minimum heights but does not validate that all skyscrapers between the two jumped-to skyscrapers fulfill the conditions.

3. **Missing Edge Cases**: The annotations imply that certain edge cases might be handled (like equal heights or heights that do not allow for jumps) but do not provide concrete examples. For instance, if all skyscrapers have the same height, `dp` will be incorrectly calculated, leading to an incorrect output since the jumps may not be counted as discrete.

4. **Functionality of Other Functions**: The other functions (`func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`) have issues that suggest they may not be contributing correctly to the main logic. For example, `func_3` contains an invalid operation and will raise an error, which implies that not all functions are properly implemented or even utilized correctly.

Overall, due to these issues, there exist cases (like skyscrapers of equal height or various configurations of heights that do not lead to valid jumps) that the program does not handle correctly, leading to incorrect outputs. Thus, the program cannot be considered correct for all potential inputs as described in the problem statement.
