You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are n beautiful skyscrapers in New York, the height of the i-th one is h_i. Today some villains have set on fire first n - 1 of them, and now the only safety building is n-th skyscraper.

Let's call a jump from i-th skyscraper to j-th (i < j) discrete, if all skyscrapers between are strictly lower or higher than both of them. Formally, jump is discrete, if i < j and one of the following conditions satisfied: 

  * i + 1 = j 
  * max(h_{i + 1}, …, h_{j - 1}) < min(h_i, h_j) 
  * max(h_i, h_j) < min(h_{i + 1}, …, h_{j - 1}). 



At the moment, Vasya is staying on the first skyscraper and wants to live a little longer, so his goal is to reach n-th skyscraper with minimal count of discrete jumps. Help him with calcualting this number.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) — total amount of skyscrapers.

The second line contains n integers h_1, h_2, …, h_n (1 ≤ h_i ≤ 10^9) — heights of skyscrapers.

Output

Print single number k — minimal amount of discrete jumps. We can show that an answer always exists.

Note

In the first testcase, Vasya can jump in the following way: 1 → 2 → 4 → 5.

In the second and third testcases, we can reach last skyscraper in one jump.

Sequence of jumps in the fourth testcase: 1 → 3 → 5.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 300000, and h is a list of integers representing the heights of the skyscrapers, where each height h_i satisfies 1 ≤ h_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    ar = func_2()
    first = ar[0]
    dp = [0] * n
    maxstack = [first]
    maxidx = [0]
    minstack = [first]
    minidx = [0]
    for (i, x) in enumerate(ar):
        if i == 0:
            continue
        
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 1
        
        while minstack and minstack[-1] > x:
            minstack.pop()
            minidx.pop()

        if minidx:

        if maxidx:
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[maxidx[-1]] + 1)
        
        if minstack and minstack[-1] == x:
            minstack.pop()
            minidx.pop()
        
        if maxstack and maxstack[-1] == x:
            maxstack.pop()
            maxidx.pop()
        
        minstack.append(x)
        
        minidx.append(i)
        
        maxstack.append(x)
        
        maxidx.append(i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `dp` is the final list of operations for each element, `maxstack` contains heights of skyscrapers in decreasing order, `maxidx` contains indices of those heights, `minstack` contains heights of skyscrapers in increasing order, `minidx` contains indices of those heights.
    debug_print(dp)
    print(dp[n - 1])
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `h` of integers representing the heights of skyscrapers. It processes the heights to calculate a list `dp`, which holds the minimum number of operations required to account for the skyscrapers based on their heights. The function then prints the last value of `dp`, which indicates the result for the entire list of skyscrapers. The exact nature of the operations is not explicitly described, and potential edge cases related to the constraints on heights and the relationship between consecutive skyscrapers are handled through the use of stacks and indexing.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 300,000, and h is a list of n integers where each integer h_i satisfies 1 ≤ h_i ≤ 1,000,000,000.
def func_2():
    return [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained from user input, where each integer is within the range of 1 to 1,000,000,000
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns a list of integers obtained from user input. Each integer in the list is converted from a string to an integer and is expected to be within the range of 1 to 1,000,000,000. However, the function does not enforce any input validation, so it may fail or produce unexpected results if the input does not conform to this expected range.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: o is a tuple where the first element is an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 300000) representing the number of skyscrapers, and the second element is a list of n integers h_i (1 ≤ h_i ≤ 10^9) representing the heights of the skyscrapers.
def func_3(o):
    return [(int(x) + o) for x in input().split()]
    #The program attempts to return a list of integers created by adding each element from the input (after splitting by space) to the tuple 'o', but the operation is not valid since 'o' is a tuple and cannot be added directly to individual integers from input. Thus, the return is invalid.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `o` containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing skyscraper heights. It attempts to return a list of integers created by adding each element from the input (after splitting by space) to the tuple `o`. However, this operation is invalid because the tuple cannot be directly added to individual integers from input, resulting in an error. Thus, the function does not produce a valid output.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 300000, and m is a list of integers representing the heights of n skyscrapers, where each height is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ h_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_4(n, m):
    return [func_2() for _ in range(n)]
    #The program returns a list of n values generated by the function func_2()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` and a list of integers `m`, and returns a list containing `n` instances of values generated by the function `func_2()`. The parameter `m` is not used in the function, which may be a potential oversight or missing logic in the implementation.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: f is an integer representing the total number of skyscrapers (2 ≤ f ≤ 300,000), and *dim is a tuple of f integers representing the heights of the skyscrapers (1 ≤ dim[i] ≤ 1,000,000,000) for i from 1 to f.
def func_5(f):
    return [func_5(f, *dim[1:]) for _ in range(dim[0])] if dim else f()
    #The program returns a list created by calling func_5 with the total number of skyscrapers 'f' and the heights of the skyscrapers from the second element of the tuple 'dim' repeated 'dim[0]' times, if 'dim' is not empty; otherwise, it returns the value of 'f'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `f`, and a tuple `dim`. It returns a list created by calling `func_5` with `f` and the heights of the skyscrapers from the second element of `dim` repeated `dim[0]` times if `dim` is not empty; otherwise, it returns the value of `f`. However, there is a missing definition for `dim` in the function, which would lead to a NameError if `dim` is not defined in the surrounding scope. Moreover, the function should handle the case where `dim` has fewer than two elements, as accessing `dim[1]` would raise an IndexError.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
