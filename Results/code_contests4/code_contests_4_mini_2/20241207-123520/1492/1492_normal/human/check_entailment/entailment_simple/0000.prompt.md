You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: There are n beautiful skyscrapers in New York, the height of the i-th one is h_i. Today some villains have set on fire first n - 1 of them, and now the only safety building is n-th skyscraper.

Let's call a jump from i-th skyscraper to j-th (i < j) discrete, if all skyscrapers between are strictly lower or higher than both of them. Formally, jump is discrete, if i < j and one of the following conditions satisfied: 

  * i + 1 = j 
  * max(h_{i + 1}, …, h_{j - 1}) < min(h_i, h_j) 
  * max(h_i, h_j) < min(h_{i + 1}, …, h_{j - 1}). 



At the moment, Vasya is staying on the first skyscraper and wants to live a little longer, so his goal is to reach n-th skyscraper with minimal count of discrete jumps. Help him with calcualting this number.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) — total amount of skyscrapers.

The second line contains n integers h_1, h_2, …, h_n (1 ≤ h_i ≤ 10^9) — heights of skyscrapers.

Output

Print single number k — minimal amount of discrete jumps. We can show that an answer always exists.

Note

In the first testcase, Vasya can jump in the following way: 1 → 2 → 4 → 5.

In the second and third testcases, we can reach last skyscraper in one jump.

Sequence of jumps in the fourth testcase: 1 → 3 → 5.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

    debug_print(dp)
    print(dp[n - 1])

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 300,000, and h is a list of n integers where each integer h_i satisfies 1 ≤ h_i ≤ 1,000,000,000.

#Function 3:

    #The program attempts to return a list of integers created by adding each element from the input (after splitting by space) to the tuple 'o', but the operation is not valid since 'o' is a tuple and cannot be added directly to individual integers from input. Thus, the return is invalid.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 300000, and m is a list of integers representing the heights of n skyscrapers, where each height is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ h_i ≤ 10^9.

    #The program returns a list of n values generated by the function func_2()

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: f is an integer representing the total number of skyscrapers (2 ≤ f ≤ 300,000), and *dim is a tuple of f integers representing the heights of the skyscrapers (1 ≤ dim[i] ≤ 1,000,000,000) for i from 1 to f.
def func_5(f):
    return [func_5(f, *dim[1:]) for _ in range(dim[0])] if dim else f()
    #The program returns a list created by calling func_5 with the total number of skyscrapers 'f' and the heights of the skyscrapers from the second element of the tuple 'dim' repeated 'dim[0]' times, if 'dim' is not empty; otherwise, it returns the value of 'f'.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
