To determine whether the provided program meets the requirements of the problem description, we need to analyze the main function, `func_1`, which is responsible for calculating the minimal number of discrete jumps Vasya can make to reach the last skyscraper from the first one.

### Breakdown of the Program:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program first reads the integer `n` (the number of skyscrapers) and then reads the heights of the skyscrapers into a list `ar`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The program uses a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the minimal number of discrete jumps needed to reach the i-th skyscraper.
   - It initializes `dp[0]` to `0` and assumes that reaching the first skyscraper requires no jumps (`dp[0] = 0`), and for subsequent skyscrapers, it initially assumes that it takes one more jump than the previous skyscraper (`dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 1`).

3. **Maintaining Stacks**:
   - Two stacks (`maxstack` and `minstack`) are maintained to keep track of the heights of skyscrapers in a way that helps identify valid jumps based on the conditions provided in the problem statement.
   - The program checks conditions for valid jumps by examining the top of the stacks and updating the `dp` array accordingly.

4. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the value of `dp[n - 1]`, which should represent the minimal number of discrete jumps to get to the last skyscraper.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The program correctly implements the conditions for discrete jumps as outlined in the problem description. It uses a dynamic programming approach to ensure it finds the minimal number of jumps. The stacks help efficiently check the conditions for valid jumps (i.e., whether the heights in between satisfy the required conditions).
- The approach ensures that the number of jumps is minimized by considering both the height of the current skyscraper and the previously visited skyscrapers.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as per the description provided. Thus, it correctly calculates the minimal number of discrete jumps needed for Vasya to reach the last skyscraper.

Correctness: **True**
