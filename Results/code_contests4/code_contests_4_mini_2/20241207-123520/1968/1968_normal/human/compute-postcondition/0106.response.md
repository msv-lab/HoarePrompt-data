The value of `su` is assigned as -1, replacing its previous value, which was the sum of the first (md + 1) elements of `a`. This change directly updates `su`, while other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `out` is updated with the joined string of integers from `ans` to `n`, `_` is 1, `be` is 0, `en` is n - 1, `md` is (n - 1) // 2, and `su` is now -1.
