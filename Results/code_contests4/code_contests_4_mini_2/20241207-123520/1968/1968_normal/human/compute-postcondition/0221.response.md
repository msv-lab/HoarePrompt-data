The value of `su` is assigned to -1. The states of the other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `out` is updated with a string made from the range of numbers from `ans` to `n`; `su` is -1; `be` remains greater than or equal to 1; `en` is adjusted to be at least 0; `ans` is set to `n`; `md` is calculated as `be + (en >> 1)`; `i` is updated to `md + 3`, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than `md + 3`.
