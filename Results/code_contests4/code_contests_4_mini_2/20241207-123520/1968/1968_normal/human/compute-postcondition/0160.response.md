Postcondition: ***`out` is updated with the joined string of integers from `ans` to `n`. If `su` is less than `a[i]`, then `su` is set to -1, `n` remains greater than `md + 2`, `i` is `md + 2`, `be` is `md + 1`, and `md` is calculated based on `be` and `en`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
