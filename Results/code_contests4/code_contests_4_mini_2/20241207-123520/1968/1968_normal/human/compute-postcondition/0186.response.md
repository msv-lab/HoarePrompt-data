The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `out` is updated with a string made from the range of numbers from `ans` to `n`, `be` is 0, `en` is `n - 1`, `ans` is `n`, `su` is -1, `md` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `md + 1`, and `su` is less than the `i`-th element of `a`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
