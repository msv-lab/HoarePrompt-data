The variables `be`, `en`, and `ans` are assigned the following values: `be` is assigned the value `0`, `en` is assigned the value `n - 1` (where `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1), and `ans` is assigned the value `n`. The initial state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `out` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers from input, `be` is 0, `en` is `n - 1`, `ans` is `n`.

Output State: **`out` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers from input, `be` is 0, `en` is n - 1, `ans` is n**
