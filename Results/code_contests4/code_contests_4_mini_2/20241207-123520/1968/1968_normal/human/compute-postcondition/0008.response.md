The variable `ceil1` is assigned a lambda function that takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, and computes the ceiling of the division `a / b` using the formula `(a + b - 1) // b`. The variable `out` is assigned an empty list. The state of `pr` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `pr` is a lambda function that takes `args` and `sep` as arguments and writes the joined string of `args` using `sep` to standard output followed by a newline; `ceil1` is a lambda function that computes the ceiling of `a / b`; `out` is an empty list.
