Postcondition: ***`out` is updated with a string made from the range of numbers from `ans` to `n`. If `su` is -1, then `be` is greater than or equal to 1, `en` is `n - 1`, `ans` is `n`, and `su` has become less than any `a[i]`. Otherwise, `be` is 0, `en` is `(n - 1) // 2 - 1`, `ans` is `((n - 1) // 2) + 1`, and `su` is greater than or equal to 0 while `su` is not equal to -1. `md` is `(n - 1) // 2` and `n` is greater than 1 in both cases.***
