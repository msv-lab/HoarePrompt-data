Postcondition: ***`out` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers from input, `be` is 0, `en` is n - 1, `md` is (n - 1) >> 1, `ans` is n, `su` is -1, and `i` is md + 1. If the sum `su` is less than the element `a[i]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
