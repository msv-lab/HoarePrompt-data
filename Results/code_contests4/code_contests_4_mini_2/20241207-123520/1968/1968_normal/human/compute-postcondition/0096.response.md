According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `be` and `en`. The loop can execute as long as `be` is less than or equal to `en`. Right before the loop, `be` is 0 and `en` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute for the first time, `be` must be less than or equal to `en`.

Given that `en` is `n - 1`, this means that `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 (since `en` must not be negative). Therefore, we require that `n` is at least 1 for `be` (which is 0) to be less than or equal to `en`.

State: **`out` is updated with the joined string of integers from `ans` to `n`, `_` is 1, `be` is 0, `en` is `n - 1`, for the loop to execute the first time then `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
