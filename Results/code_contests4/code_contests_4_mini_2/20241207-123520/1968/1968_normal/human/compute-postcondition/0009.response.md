According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input provided to `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the input must be a non-negative integer, indicating the number of iterations. Since `out` is an empty list, it does not affect the loop execution. So, for the loop to execute at least once, the input must be at least 1, and the loop variable `_` is initialized to 0 during the first iteration.

State: **`out` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time input must be a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1, `_` is 0**
