The code assigns the value `-1` to `su`. The previous value of `su` is not specified, but it is updated to `-1`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `out` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 3, `md` is less than `n - 1`, `i` is `md + 2`, and `su` is now `-1`.

Output State: **`out` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 3, `md` is less than `n - 1`, `i` is `md + 2`, `su` is -1**
