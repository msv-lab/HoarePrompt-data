According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `md + 1`, which is the midpoint of the range plus one. Given that `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `md` is computed as `(n - 1) >> 1`, which means `md` is at least 1 when `n` is at least 3. Therefore, `i` starts at `md + 1`, which indicates it is starting from a value greater than or equal to 2 when `n` is 3 or more.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and it must still be less than `n`. Hence, if `i` is currently `md + 1`, after incrementing for the next iteration, `i` will be `md + 2`.

To summarize:
- At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `md + 1`.
- After incrementing, `i` will be `md + 2`.
- For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`, which is already guaranteed since `n` is greater than or equal to 3 and `md + 2` will be less than `n`.

State: **`out` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers from input, `be` is 0, `en` is n - 1, `md` is (n - 1) >> 1, `ans` is n, `su` is the previous value of `su` plus `a[i]`, and `i` is md + 2.**
