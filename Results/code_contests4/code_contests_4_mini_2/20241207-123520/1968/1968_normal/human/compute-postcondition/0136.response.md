According to the code, the loop iterates over a range from `md + 1` to `n`. Currently, `i` is `md + 2`, which is the value for the next iteration of the loop. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Given that `n` is greater than `md + 2`, this condition is satisfied.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `md + 2`. In the next iteration, `i` will increment by 1 to `md + 3`. For the loop to execute a second time, `n` must also be greater than `md + 3`.

State: **`out` is updated with the joined string of integers from `ans` to `n`, `su` is updated to a value greater than or equal to `a[i]`, `n` is greater than `md + 2`, `i` is `md + 3`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `md + 3`.**
