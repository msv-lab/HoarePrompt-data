Postcondition: ***`out` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 3, and `a` is a sorted list of integers from input. If `su` is -1, then `be` is updated to ((n - 1) >> 1) + 1, while `en`, `md`, and `ans` remain as n - 1, (n - 1) >> 1, and n respectively. Otherwise, `be` is set to 0, `en` is updated to ((n - 1) // 2) - 1, `md` becomes (n - 1) // 2, and `ans` is set to ((n - 1) // 2) + 1.***
