The variable `be` is assigned the value `md + 1`. The initial state indicates that `n` is greater than `md + 1`, which means that `be` will take a value greater than or equal to 1, depending on the value of `md`. Other variables such as `out`, `su`, and `i` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `out` is updated with the joined string of integers from `ans` to `n`, `su` is -1, `n` is greater than `md + 1`, `i` is `n - 1`, and `be` is `md + 1`.

Output State: **`out` is updated with the joined string of integers from `ans` to `n`, `su` is -1, `n` is greater than `md + 1`, `i` is `n - 1`, `be` is `md + 1`**.
