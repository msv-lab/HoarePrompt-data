`be` is assigned the value `md + 1`. The value of `md` is less than `n - 1`, so `be` will be at least `0` and at most `n`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `out` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 3, `md` is less than `n - 1`, `su` is -1, and `be` is `md + 1`.

Output State: **`out` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 3, `md` is less than `n - 1`, `su` is -1, `be` is `md + 1`**.
