`en` is assigned the value of `md - 1`. The value of `md` is less than `n - 1`, which means `md` is a non-negative integer that is at least 1 (since `n` is at least 3). Thus, `en` will also be a non-negative integer, specifically less than `n - 2`. The states of the other variables (`out`, `_`, `n`, `su`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `out` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 3, `md` is less than `n - 1`, `su` is not equal to -1, and `en` is equal to `md - 1`.

Output State: **`out` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 3, `md` is less than `n - 1`, `su` is not equal to -1, and `en` is equal to `md - 1.**
