The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `out` is updated with a string made from the range of numbers from `ans` to `n`; `su` is -1; `be` is greater than or equal to 1; `en` is adjusted to be at least 0; `ans` is `n`; `md` is calculated as `be + (en >> 1)`; `i` is `md + 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
