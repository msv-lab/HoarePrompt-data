The value of `su` is explicitly set to -1. The initial state indicates that `su` was previously updated to the sum of the first `md + 1` elements of `a`, but this previous state is overridden by the new assignment. The other variables `out`, `ans`, `n`, `md`, and `i` remain unaffected by this assignment. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `out` is a string made from the range of numbers from `ans` to `n`, `su` is -1, `i` is `md + 2` and `n` must be greater than `md + 2` for the loop to execute a second time.

Output State: **`out` is a string made from the range of numbers from `ans` to `n`, `su` is -1, `i` is `md + 2`, and `n` must be greater than `md + 2` for the loop to execute a second time.**
