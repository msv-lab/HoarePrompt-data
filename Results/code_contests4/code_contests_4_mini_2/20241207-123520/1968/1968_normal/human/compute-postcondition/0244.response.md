Postcondition: ***`out` is a string made from the range of numbers from `ans` to `n`, `su` is updated to the sum of the first `md + 1` elements of `a`, which was previously -1, and if `su` is less than `a[i]`, the value of `su` is -1, `i` is `md + 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
