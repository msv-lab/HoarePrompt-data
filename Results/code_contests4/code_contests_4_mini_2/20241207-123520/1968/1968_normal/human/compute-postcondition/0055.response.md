Postcondition: ***`out` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than `md + 3`, `md` is less than `n - 1`, `i` is `md + 3`, and if `su` is less than `a[i]`, then `su` is set to -1 and the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. There is no else part in the code.***
