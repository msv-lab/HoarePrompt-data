According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will execute while `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is in the range from `md + 1` (which is `(n - 1) // 2 + 1`) to `n`. Since `md` is calculated as `(n - 1) // 2`, `md + 1` will be equal to `(n + 1) // 2`. 

Therefore, if `i` starts from `(n + 1) // 2`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 

So if `i` was `md + 1` at the end of the last iteration, after incrementing, `i` becomes `md + 2`, which is `(n + 2) // 2`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

State: **`out` is updated with the joined string of integers from `ans` to `n`, `_` is 1, `be` is 0, `en` is n - 1, `md` is (n - 1) // 2, `su` is updated to -1 + `a[i]`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than (n + 2) // 2 (which is `md + 2`)**
