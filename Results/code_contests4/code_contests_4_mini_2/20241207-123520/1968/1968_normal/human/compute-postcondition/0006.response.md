The variable `rints_2d` is assigned a lambda function that takes an argument `n` and returns a list of integers. This list is generated by calling the `rints()` function `n` times, where `rints()` itself is defined as a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and returns a list of integers. The previous values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `rstr` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and strips whitespace; `rstrs` is a lambda function that returns a list of strings from standard input; `rstr_2d` is a lambda function that returns a list of n strings read from input and stripped of whitespace; `rint` is a lambda function that returns an integer read from standard input; `rints` is a lambda function that returns a list of integers from a line read from standard input; `rint_2d` is a lambda function that returns a list of integers by calling `rint()` n times; `rints_2d` is a lambda function that returns a list of integers by calling `rints()` n times.

Output State: **`rstr` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and strips whitespace; `rstrs` is a lambda function that returns a list of strings from standard input; `rstr_2d` is a lambda function that returns a list of n strings read from input and stripped of whitespace; `rint` is a lambda function that returns an integer read from standard input; `rints` is a lambda function that returns a list of integers from a line read from standard input; `rint_2d` is a lambda function that returns a list of integers by calling `rint()` n times; `rints_2d` is a lambda function that returns a list of integers by calling `rints()` n times.**
