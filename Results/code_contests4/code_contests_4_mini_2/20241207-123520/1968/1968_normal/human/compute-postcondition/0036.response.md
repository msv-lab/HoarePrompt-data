`ans` is assigned the value of `md + 1`. Given that `md` is `(n - 1) // 2`, we can express `ans` as `(n - 1) // 2 + 1`. Since `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 3, `ans` will be at least 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `out` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers from input, `be` is 0, `en` is `((n - 1) // 2) - 1`, `md` is `(n - 1) // 2`, and `ans` is `((n - 1) // 2) + 1`.

Output State: **`out` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers from input, `be` is 0, `en` is `((n - 1) // 2) - 1`, `md` is `(n - 1) // 2`, and `ans` is `((n - 1) // 2) + 1`**.
