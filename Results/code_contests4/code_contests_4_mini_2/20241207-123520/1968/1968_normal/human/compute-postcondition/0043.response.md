`su` is assigned the value -1. The previous value of `su` was the sum of the first `md + 1` elements of `a`, but it is now overwritten with -1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `out` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 3, `md` is less than `n - 1`, `su` is -1, and `su` is less than `a[i]`.

Output State: **`out` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 3, `md` is less than `n - 1`, `su` is -1, and `su` is less than `a[i]**
