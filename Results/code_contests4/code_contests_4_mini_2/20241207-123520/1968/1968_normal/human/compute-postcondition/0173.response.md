Postcondition: ***`out` is updated with the joined string of integers from `ans` to `n`; if `su` is -1, then at least one element of `a` is greater than the initial `su`, `su` is -1, `n` is greater than `md + 1`, `i` is `n - 1`, and `be` is `md + 1`, with `md` calculated based on `be` and `en`. Otherwise, `su` is the sum of `a[md + 1]` to `a[n - 1]`, `n` is greater than `md + 1`, `i` is `n - 1`, `be` is `md + 1`, `md` is calculated based on `be` and `en`, and `en` is `md - 1`, with `ans` being `md + 1`.***
