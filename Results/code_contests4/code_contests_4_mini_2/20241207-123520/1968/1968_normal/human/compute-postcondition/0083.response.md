To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we analyze the loop's behavior based on the provided code and the initial state:

Initial State: `out` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 3, `md` is calculated as `be + (en >> 1)`, and `su` is the sum of the first `md + 1` elements of the list `a`.

The loop runs from `md + 1` to `n - 1`, which means it will execute a total of `n - md - 1` times if all conditions are met. The loop checks if `su` is less than `a[i]` on each iteration. If it is, `su` is set to -1, and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `su` accumulates the value of `a[i]`.

After the loop completes:

1. If `su` was never set to -1, it will be the sum of all elements from `a[md + 1]` to `a[n - 1]`.
2. If `su` was set to -1 in any iteration, then that will be the final value of `su`.
3. The variable `out` remains an empty list throughout.
4. The variable `_` remains 0 throughout.
5. The variable `n` remains unchanged as a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 3.
6. The variable `md` remains calculated based on its initial definition and is less than `n - 1`.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop will be as follows:

Output State: **`out` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 3, `md` is less than `n - 1`, `su` is either the sum of elements from `a[md + 1]` to `a[n - 1]` or -1 if any `su < a[i]` occurred during the iterations.**
