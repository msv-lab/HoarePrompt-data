The initial state indicates that `rstr` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and strips whitespace. The code snippet defines a new lambda function `rstrs` that accepts no arguments and returns a list of strings. This list is created by splitting the input read from `stdin.readline()` on whitespace and converting each split element to a string.

Since the initial state does not change any of the existing variables and solely introduces a new function `rstrs`, the output state reflects the introduction of this new variable. 

Output State: **`rstr` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and strips whitespace; `rstrs` is a lambda function that returns a list of strings from standard input.**
