To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, let's analyze the loop and the initial state step by step.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `out` is an empty list.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 3.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers from input.
   - `md` is assigned the value of `(be + en) // 2`, which means `md` is a valid index that is less than `n - 1`.
   - `su` is the sum of the first `md + 1` elements of `a`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   The loop iterates from `md + 1` to `n - 1` (inclusive). For each iteration:
   - The loop checks if `su` is less than `a[i]`.
     - If it is, `su` is set to -1 and the loop breaks.
     - If not, `su` is updated by adding `a[i]`.

3. **Understanding the Output State After All Iterations**:
   - If at any point `su` becomes less than `a[i]` during any iteration, the loop breaks immediately, and `su` will be -1.
   - If `su` remains greater than or equal to `a[i]` throughout all iterations (from `md + 1` to `n - 1`), then `su` will be the sum of all `a[i]` from `md + 1` to `n - 1`.

4. **Final Values**:
   - Regardless of the outcome, `out` remains an empty list, and `_` remains 0.
   - If the loop executed and did not break, `su` would be the sum of the values of `a` from index `md + 1` to `n - 1`.
   - If the loop broke, `su` would be -1.

Given that `n` is at least 3, and considering the conditions described above, we can summarize the output state as follows:

Output State: **`out` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 3, `md` is less than `n - 1`, and `su` is either -1 (if broken) or the sum of `a[md + 1]` to `a[n - 1] (if completed).**
