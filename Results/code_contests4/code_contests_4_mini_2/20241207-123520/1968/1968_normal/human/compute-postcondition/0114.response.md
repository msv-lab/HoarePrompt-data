The value of `su` is incremented by the value of `a[i]`. The previous value of `su` is -1, so after execution, `su` becomes `-1 + a[i]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `out` is updated with the joined string of integers from `ans` to `n`, `_` is 1, `be` is 0, `en` is n - 1, `md` is (n - 1) // 2, and `su` is now `-1 + a[i]`.
