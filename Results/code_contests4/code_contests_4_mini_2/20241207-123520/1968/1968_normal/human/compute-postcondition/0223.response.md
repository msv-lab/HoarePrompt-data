Postcondition: ***`out` is updated with a string made from the range of numbers from `ans` to `n`. If `su` is less than `a[i]`, then `su` is set to -1, `be` remains greater than or equal to 1, `en` is adjusted to be at least 0, `ans` is set to `n`, `md` is calculated as `be + (en >> 1)`, `i` is updated to `md + 3`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop.***
