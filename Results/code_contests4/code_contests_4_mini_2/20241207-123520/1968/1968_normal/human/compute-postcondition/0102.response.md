The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `out` is updated with the joined string of integers from `ans` to `n`, `_` is 1, `be` is 0, `en` is n - 1, `md` is (n - 1) // 2, `su` is -1, `i` is md + 1, and the sum `su` is less than the element `a[i]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
