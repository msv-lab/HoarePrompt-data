The value of `su` is assigned the value of `-1`. The previous value of `su` is not specified, but it's implied that it has been updated to `-1`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `out` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than `md + 3`, `a` is a sorted list of integers from input, `be` is 0, `en` is n - 1, `md` is (n - 1) >> 1, `ans` is n, `i` is md + 3, and `su` is -1.
