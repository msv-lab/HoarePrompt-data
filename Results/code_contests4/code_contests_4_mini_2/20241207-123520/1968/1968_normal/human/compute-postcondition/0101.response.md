The value of `su` is assigned to -1, which overrides the previous value of `su`. The other variables remain unaffected, so the output state reflects the updated value of `su`. Therefore, the Output State is: `out` is updated with the joined string of integers from `ans` to `n`, `_` is 1, `be` is 0, `en` is n - 1, `md` is (n - 1) // 2, `su` is -1, `i` is md + 1, and the sum `su` is less than the element `a[i]`.
