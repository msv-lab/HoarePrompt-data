Postcondition: ***`out` is updated with the joined string of integers from `ans` to `n`, `_` is 1, `be` is 0, `en` is n - 1, `md` is (n - 1) // 2, `su` is the sum of the first (md + 1) elements of `a`, and if `su` is less than `a[i]`, then `su` is updated to -1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
