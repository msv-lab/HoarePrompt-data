To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the loop statement and the provided state before the loop.

Given the for loop:
```
for i in range(md + 1, n):
```
The loop will start executing if `md + 1` is less than `n`. 

Now, let's break down the components:
1. `md` is calculated as `(be + en) // 2`.
2. The loop starts at `md + 1` and continues until `n`, so it will execute if `md + 1 < n`.

Given that:
- `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 3.
- `_` is 0, which does not affect the execution of the loop.
- `out` is an empty list, which also does not affect the execution of the loop.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers from input, which may not directly impact the loop execution but could be relevant for operations within the loop.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to establish the relationship between `md` and `n`:
1. Since `n` is at least 3, we want to ensure that `md + 1 < n`, which means `md` must be less than `n - 1`.

To summarize:
- `md` must be less than `n - 1` for the loop to execute.
- Since `md` is derived from the expression `(be + en) // 2`, we also need to ensure that the values of `be` and `en` are set accordingly.

Thus, we can conclude:
State: **`out` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 3, `md` is less than `n - 1`, and `su` is the sum of the first md + 1 elements of a.**
