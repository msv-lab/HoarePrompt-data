The variable `su` is assigned the value `-1`, which directly updates its value. The other variables (`out`, `n`, `i`, `be`, `md`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State reflects the updated value of `su` while retaining the previous states of the other variables.

Output State: **`out` is updated with the joined string of integers from `ans` to `n`; `su` is -1; `n` remains greater than `md + 3`; `i` is `md + 3`; `be` is `md + 1`; `md` is calculated based on `be` and `en`.**
