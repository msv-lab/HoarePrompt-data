The variable `su` is assigned the value of `-1`. This directly updates `su`, while the other variables (`out`, `be`, `en`, `ans`, `md`, `n`, and `i`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects this change in `su`.

Output State: **`out` is updated with a string made from the range of numbers from `ans` to `n`, `be` is 0, `en` is `n - 1`, `ans` is `n`, `su` is -1, `md` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `n` is greater than `md + 3`, and `i` is `md + 3`**
