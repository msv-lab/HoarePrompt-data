Output State: **`out` is updated with a string made from the range of numbers from `ans` to `n`, `be` is 0, `en` is `n - 1`, `ans` is `n`, `su` is updated to `su + a[i]`, `md` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `n` is greater than `md + 3`, and `i` is `md + 3`, if `su` is less than `a[i]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
