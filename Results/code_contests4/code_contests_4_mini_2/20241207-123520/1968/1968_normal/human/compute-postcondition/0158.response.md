The variable `su` is assigned the value of `-1`. This directly updates `su` to `-1`, while all other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `out` is updated with the joined string of integers from `ans` to `n`, `su` is -1, `n` is greater than `md + 2`, `i` is `md + 2`, `be` is `md + 1`, and `md` is calculated based on `be` and `en`.
