Output State: **`out` is updated with a string made from the range of numbers from `ans` to `n`, `su` is -1, `be` is greater than or equal to 1, `en` is adjusted to be at least equal to `be`, `ans` is `n`, `md` is calculated as `be + (en >> 1)`, `i` is `n` if the loop executes fully, or it will be the first index where `su` is less than `a[i]`, and `be` is updated to `md + 1; `md` is updated to the calculated value of `be + (en >> 1)`**
