According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `be` and `en`. The loop can execute again if `be` is less than or equal to `en`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we have two cases:

1. If `su` is -1, then:
   - `be` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `en` is `n - 1`.
   - Since `be` is at least 1 and `en` is `n - 1` (which is at least 0 given that `n` is greater than 1), `be` could be less than or equal to `en`, but we need to confirm that.

2. If `su` is not -1:
   - `be` is 0.
   - `en` is `(n - 1) // 2 - 1`.
   - Here, since `n` is greater than 1, `(n - 1) // 2 - 1` can be -1 when `n` is 2 or 3, which means `be` (0) would not be less than or equal to `en` (which can be -1).

In both scenarios, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `be` is less than or equal to `en`. 

Thus, if `su` is not -1, we need to adjust `en` to be at least 0 so that `be` can be less than or equal to `en`.

State: **`out` is updated with a string made from the range of numbers from `ans` to `n`, `su` is -1, then `be` is greater than or equal to 1, `en` is `n - 1`, `ans` is `n`, and `su` has become less than any `a[i]` or `be` is 0, `en` is adjusted to be at least 0 for the loop to execute again**.
