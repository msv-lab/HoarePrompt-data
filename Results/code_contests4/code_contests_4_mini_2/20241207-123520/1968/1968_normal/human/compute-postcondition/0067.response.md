According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from `md + 1` to `n`. For the loop to execute at least once, the starting point `md + 1` must be less than `n`. Given that `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 3, we need to ensure that `md + 1` is less than `n`. 

Let's analyze the conditions:
1. Since `n` is at least 3, we need `md + 1 < n`.
2. Therefore, we can conclude that `md` must be less than `n - 1`.

With the current state:
- `out` is an empty list.
- `_` is 0.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 3.
- `md` is calculated from `be + (en >> 1)`, but we need to ensure it satisfies the condition above.
- `su` is the sum of the first `md + 1` elements of the list `a`.

Assuming `be` and `en` are set such that `md` is less than `n - 1`, we can proceed. 

To summarize for the loop to execute:
- `md` must be less than `n - 1` (ensuring `md + 1 < n`).
- The variable `i` should start at `md + 1`, which will be the first value in the loop.

Thus, the state can be expressed as follows:

State: **`out` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 3, `md` is less than `n - 1`, `i` is `md + 1`**
