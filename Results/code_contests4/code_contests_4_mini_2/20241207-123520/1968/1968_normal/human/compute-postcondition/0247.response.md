The variable `su` is assigned the value of `-1`. The initial states of `out`, `i`, and other variables do not change with this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `out` is a string made from the range of numbers from `ans` to `n`, `su` is -1, `i` is `md + 3`, and the loop condition remains intact.

Output State: **`out` is a string made from the range of numbers from `ans` to `n`, `su` is -1, `i` is `md + 3`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `md + 3.**
