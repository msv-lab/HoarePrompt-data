Postcondition: ***`out` is updated with the joined string of integers from `ans` to `n`, `su` is -1, `n` is greater than `md + 1`, `i` is `md + 1`, `be` is `md + 1`, and `md` is calculated based on `be` and `en`. If `su` is less than `a[i]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
