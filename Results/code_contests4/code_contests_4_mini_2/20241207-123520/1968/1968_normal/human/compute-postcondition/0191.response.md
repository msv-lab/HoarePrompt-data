The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `out` is updated with a string made from the range of numbers from `ans` to `n`, `be` is 0, `en` is `n - 1`, `ans` is `n`, `su` is -1, `md` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `n` is greater than `md + 2`, `i` is `md + 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
