The value of `su` is updated by adding `a[i]` to it. The previous value of `su` was -1, so after executing the code, `su` will be -1 + `a[i]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `out` is updated with the joined string of integers from `ans` to `n`, `_` is 1, `be` is 0, `en` is n - 1, `md` is (n - 1) // 2, and `su` is updated to -1 + `a[i]`.
