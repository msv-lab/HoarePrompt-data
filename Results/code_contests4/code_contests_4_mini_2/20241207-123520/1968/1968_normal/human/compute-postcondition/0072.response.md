The value of `su` is incremented by `a[i]`. The previous value of `su` is not specified, but it is impacted by the addition of `a[i]`, where `i` is `md + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `out` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 3, `md` is less than `n - 1`, `i` is `md + 1`, and `su` is updated to `su + a[i]`.
