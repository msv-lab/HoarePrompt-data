According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop iterates from `md + 1` to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `md + 2`, and since `n` is greater than or equal to 3, we need to check if `i` is less than `n`. 

Given that `i` is currently `md + 2`, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `md` is less than `n - 1`, it follows that `md + 2` is less than `n` under the condition that `n` is at least 3. 

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it `md + 3`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than `md + 3`.

State: **`out` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than `md + 3`, `md` is less than `n - 1`, `i` is `md + 3`, and `su` is updated by adding `a[i]` to its previous value.**
