The variable `su` is assigned the value of `-1`. This directly changes the value of `su` from its previous state (which is the previous value of `su` plus `a[i]`) to `-1`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `out` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers from input, `be` is 0, `en` is n - 1, `md` is (n - 1) >> 1, `ans` is n, `su` is -1, and `i` is md + 2.

Output State: **`out` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers from input, `be` is 0, `en` is n - 1, `md` is (n - 1) >> 1, `ans` is n, `su` is -1, `i` is md + 2**
