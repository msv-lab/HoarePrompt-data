`be` is assigned the value `md + 1`. The value of `md` is less than `n - 1`, and since `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 3, `md` can take various values but will always be less than `n - 1`. Therefore, `be` will be greater than or equal to 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`out` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 3, `md` is less than `n - 1`, `su` is -1, `be` is `md + 1`**
