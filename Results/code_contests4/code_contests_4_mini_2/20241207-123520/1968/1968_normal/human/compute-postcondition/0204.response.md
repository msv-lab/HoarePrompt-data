To determine the output state, let's analyze the provided code snippet step by step.

1. The variable `md` is already defined and is calculated as `(n - 1) // 2`. 
2. The code assigns `ans` the value of `md + 1`. 
3. Since `md = (n - 1) // 2`, then `ans` will be `((n - 1) // 2) + 1`.

Now, let's summarize what we know:
- `out` remains unchanged.
- `be` is still 0.
- `en` is `(n - 1) // 2 - 1`.
- `ans` is updated to `((n - 1) // 2) + 1`.
- `su` remains as it was, not specified exactly but confirmed to be greater than or equal to 0 and not equal to -1.
- `md` is still `(n - 1) // 2`.
- `n` is greater than 1.

The output state consists of the updated value of `ans` while the other variables remain unchanged.

Given this information, we can formulate the output state.

Output State: **`out` is updated with a string made from the range of numbers from `ans` to `n`, `be` is 0, `en` is `(n - 1) // 2 - 1`, `ans` is `((n - 1) // 2) + 1`, `su` is not equal to -1, `su` is greater than or equal to 0, `md` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `n` is greater than 1**
