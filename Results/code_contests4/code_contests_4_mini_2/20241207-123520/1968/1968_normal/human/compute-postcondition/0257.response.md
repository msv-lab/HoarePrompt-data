Postcondition: ***`out` is a string made from the range of numbers from `ans` to `n`. If `su` is -1, indicating a break from the loop, then `be` is assigned the value `md + 1`. Otherwise, `su` is the sum of elements `a[md + 1]` to `a[n - 1]`, `su` is not equal to -1, `en` is assigned the value `md - 1`, and `ans` is updated to `md + 1`.***
