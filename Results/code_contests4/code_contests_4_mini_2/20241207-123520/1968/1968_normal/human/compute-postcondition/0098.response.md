To determine the output state, let's analyze the initial conditions and the code snippet provided.

Initial State:
- `out` is updated with the joined string of integers from `ans` to `n`
- `_` is 1
- `be` is 0
- `en` is `n - 1`
- `md` is assigned the value of `be + en >> 1`, which evaluates to `(0 + (n - 1)) // 2`

Since `be` is 0 and `en` is `n - 1`, we can calculate `md`:
- `md = 0 + (n - 1) >> 1`
- The expression `>> 1` indicates right shift, which is equivalent to integer division by 2.
- Therefore, `md = (n - 1) // 2`

Next, we look at the code snippet:
```
su = sum(a[:md + 1])
```
This line computes the sum of the first `md + 1` elements of the list `a`.

However, the value of `a` is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `su`, but we can note that it is the sum of the first `md + 1` elements from `a`.

Since there is no change to the other variables, they remain unaffected.

Thus, the output state will include the evaluation of `md` and the operation defined by `su`.

Output State: **`out` is updated with the joined string of integers from `ans` to `n`, `_` is 1, `be` is 0, `en` is n - 1, `md` is (n - 1) // 2, `su` is the sum of the first (md + 1) elements of `a`**.
