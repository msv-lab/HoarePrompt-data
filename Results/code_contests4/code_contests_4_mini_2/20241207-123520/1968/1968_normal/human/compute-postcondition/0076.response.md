Postcondition: ***`out` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 3, `md` is less than `n - 1`, `i` is `md + 2`, and if `su` is less than `a[i]`, then `su` is updated to -1 and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, there is no else part to consider.***
