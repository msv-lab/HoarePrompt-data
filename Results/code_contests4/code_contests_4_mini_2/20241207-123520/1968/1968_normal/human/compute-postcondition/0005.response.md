The `rint_2d` variable is assigned a lambda function that takes an argument `n` and returns a list of integers. This list is constructed by calling the `rint` function `n` times, which reads an integer from standard input each time. The previous states of `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rstr_2d`, `rint`, and `rints` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `rstr` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and strips whitespace; `rstrs` is a lambda function that returns a list of strings from standard input; `rstr_2d` is a lambda function that returns a list of n strings read from input and stripped of whitespace; `rint` is a lambda function that returns an integer read from standard input; `rints` is a lambda function that returns a list of integers from a line read from standard input; `rint_2d` is a lambda function that returns a list of integers by calling `rint()` n times.

Output State: **`rstr` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and strips whitespace; `rstrs` is a lambda function that returns a list of strings from standard input; `rstr_2d` is a lambda function that returns a list of n strings read from input and stripped of whitespace; `rint` is a lambda function that returns an integer read from standard input; `rints` is a lambda function that returns a list of integers from a line read from standard input; `rint_2d` is a lambda function that returns a list of integers by calling `rint()` n times.**
