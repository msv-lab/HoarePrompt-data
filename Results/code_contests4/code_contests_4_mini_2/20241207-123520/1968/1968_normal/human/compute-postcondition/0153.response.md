The variable `su` is assigned the value of `-1`, which directly updates its previous value. The other variables (`out`, `ans`, `n`, `i`, `be`, `md`, and `a`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `out` is updated with the joined string of integers from `ans` to `n`, `su` is -1, `n` is greater than `md + 1`, `i` is `md + 1`, `be` is `md + 1`, and `md` is calculated based on `be` and `en`. The sum `su` is less than the element `a[i]`.
