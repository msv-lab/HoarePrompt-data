The variable `su` is assigned the value `-1`. This assignment does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `su` without any changes to the other variables.

Output State: **`out` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 3, `md` is less than `n - 1`, `i` is `md + 2`, `su` is -1**
