According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i`, `md`, and `n`. The loop starts with `i` initialized to `md + 1` and continues as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 3, and `md` is less than `n - 1`. 

Since the loop is structured to execute for values of `i` starting from `md + 1`, we can determine that for the current state, `i` must be updated to `md + 2` for the loop to execute one more time. 

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`, so we need to ensure that `md + 2` is still less than `n`. Given that `md` is less than `n - 1`, it follows that `md + 2` is less than `n`. 

Thus, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:
State: **`out` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 3, `md` is less than `n - 1`, `i` is `md + 2` for the loop to execute a second time.**
