Postcondition: ***`out` is updated with the joined string of integers from `ans` to `n`. If `su` is -1, `_` is set to 1, `be` is updated to (n - 1) // 2 + 1, `en` remains n - 1, `md` is (n - 1) // 2, and `su` is -1. Otherwise, `_` is set to 1, `be` is 0, `en` is (n - 1) // 2 - 1, `md` is (n - 1) // 2, `su` is the sum of a[i] from index md + 1 to n - 1, and `ans` is md + 1.***
