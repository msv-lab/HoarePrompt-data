To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the initial state.

Initial State: 
- `out` is a string made from the range of numbers from `ans` to `n`, 
- `su` is updated to the sum of the first `md + 1` elements of `a`, 
- `su` was previously -1.

Code of the loop:
```
for i in range(md + 1, n):
    if su < a[i]:
        su = -1
        break
    su += a[i]
```

1. The loop will iterate from `md + 1` to `n - 1`, which means it will execute at least once if `n > md + 1`.
2. Inside the loop:
   - If `su` is less than `a[i]`, `su` is set to -1 and the loop breaks.
   - If not, `su` is increased by `a[i]`.
3. If `su` remains greater than or equal to all `a[i]` in the specified range, the loop will continue until `i` reaches `n`.

Therefore, at the end of the loop:
- If the loop did not execute (i.e., if `n <= md + 1`), then `su` remains as the sum of the first `md + 1` elements of `a`.
- If the loop executed and `su` was set to -1 due to the condition being met, then `su` would be -1.
- If the loop ran through all iterations without breaking, `su` will have accumulated the sum of the elements `a[md + 1]` to `a[n - 1]`.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:
Output State: **`out` is a string made from the range of numbers from `ans` to `n`, `su` is either -1 (if it broke out of the loop) or the sum of elements `a[md + 1]` to `a[n - 1]` (if the loop completed without breaking).**
