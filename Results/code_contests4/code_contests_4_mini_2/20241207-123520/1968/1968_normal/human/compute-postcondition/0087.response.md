The variable `en` is assigned the value of `md - 1`. The previous value of `md` is less than `n - 1`, which means `md` must be at least 0 (since `n` is at least 3). Therefore, `en` will be less than `md` and could be negative or zero, depending on the value of `md`.

Since the values of `out`, `_`, `n`, and `su` are not affected by this assignment, they remain the same. 

Output State: **`out` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 3, `md` is less than `n - 1`, and `su` is not equal to -1; `en` is `md - 1`.**
