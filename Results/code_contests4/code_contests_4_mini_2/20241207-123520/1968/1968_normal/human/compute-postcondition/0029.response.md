Postcondition: ***`out` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than `md + 3`, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `be` is 0, `en` is n - 1, `md` is (n - 1) >> 1, `ans` is n, `i` is md + 3, and if `su` is less than `a[i]`, then `su` is -1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
