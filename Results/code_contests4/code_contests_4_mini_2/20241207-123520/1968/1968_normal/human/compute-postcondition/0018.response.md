The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `out` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers from input, `be` is 0, `en` is n - 1, `md` is (n - 1) >> 1, `ans` is n, `su` is -1, `i` is md + 1, and the sum `su` is less than the element `a[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
