To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the variables involved:

1. The loop is defined as `for i in range(md + 1, n)`. This means that the loop will execute if the starting point `md + 1` is less than `n`.
2. The variable `md` is defined as `(n - 1) // 2`. This means `md + 1` evaluates to `(n - 1) // 2 + 1`.
3. Therefore, the loop condition becomes `((n - 1) // 2 + 1) < n`.

For the loop to execute at least once:
- We need `((n - 1) // 2 + 1) < n` to hold true. This condition will always be satisfied if `n` is greater than 1, making `md` at least 0.

Now, let's summarize the states:
- `out` is updated with a string from `ans` to `n`, which doesn't affect the loop execution.
- `be`, `en`, `ans`, and `su` also do not impact the loop's ability to execute.
- We must ensure that `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to have a valid starting point.

Thus, we can summarize our state modifications as follows:

State: **`out` is updated with a string made from the range of numbers from `ans` to `n`, `be` is 0, `en` is `n - 1`, `ans` is `n`, `su` is the sum of the first `md + 1` elements of `a`, `md` is `(n - 1) // 2`, for the loop to execute `n` must be greater than 1 and `i` is `md + 1`**
