Postcondition: ***`out` is updated with the joined string of integers from `ans` to `n`. If `su` is -1, then `su` remains -1, `n` is greater than `md + 1`, `i` is `n - 1`, and `be` is `md + 1`. Otherwise, `su` is the sum of the elements from `a[md + 1]` to `a[n-1]` and is not equal to -1, `n` is greater than `md + 1`, `i` is `n - 1`, `en` is assigned the value `md - 1`, and `ans` is `md + 1`.***
