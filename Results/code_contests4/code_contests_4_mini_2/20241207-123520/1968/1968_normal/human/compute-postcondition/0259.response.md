The code `out.append(n - ans + 1)` modifies the list `out` by appending a new value. The expression `n - ans + 1` is calculated using the current value of `n` and the previously determined value of `ans`. 

Since `be` is greater than `en`, and `en` is less than `0`, it implies that `n` is likely a positive integer or at least greater than `ans`. The sum value `su` is not equal to -1, which doesn't directly affect the calculation but indicates that `su` has a valid state.

After the execution of the code, a new value will be appended to `out`. The output state will reflect the unchanged values of `be`, `en`, `ans`, and `su`, while `out` will have one additional entry.

Output State: **`be` is greater than `en`, `en` is less than `0`, `ans` is the final value determined by the last successful mid-point calculation, `su` is a sum value that is not equal to -1, and `out` is updated with a new value `n - ans + 1` appended.**
