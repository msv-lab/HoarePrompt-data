Output State: **`out` contains the results of the calculations performed in all iterations of the outer loop, `_` is equal to the number of iterations executed, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 3, `be` is greater than `en`, `md` is the last calculated mid-point index, `ans` is the maximum valid index found across all iterations, and `su` represents the last calculated sum value based on the evaluations performed in the inner loop.**
