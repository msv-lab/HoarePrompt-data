The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `out` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 3, `md` is less than `n - 1`, `i` is `md + 1`, `su` is -1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
