The variable `su` is assigned the value `-1`. The previous value of `su` was not specified but is being updated. The other variables (`out`, `ans`, `n`, `md`, `i`, and `a`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State reflects the updated value of `su` while noting that the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`out` is updated with the joined string of integers from `ans` to `n`, `su` is -1, `n` is greater than `md + 2`, `i` is `md + 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
