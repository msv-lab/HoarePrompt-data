Output State: **`out` is updated with a string made from the range of numbers from `ans` to `n`; `su` is either the sum of all elements from `a[md + 1]` to `a[n-1]` or a value that does not indicate -1; `be` is greater than or equal to 1; `en` is adjusted to be at least 0; `ans` is `n`; `md` is calculated as `be + (en >> 1)`; `i` is `n` if the loop executes fully, or it will be the first index where `su` is less than `a[i]` if the loop breaks early, and `su` is not -1; `en` is now `md - 1`.**
