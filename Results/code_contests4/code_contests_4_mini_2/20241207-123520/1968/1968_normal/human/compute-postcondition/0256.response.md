The value of `ans` is assigned the value `md + 1`. The previous value of `md` is unknown, but `ans` will be one greater than `md`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `out` is a string made from the range of numbers from `ans` to `n`; `su` is the sum of elements `a[md + 1]` to `a[n - 1]`; `su` is not equal to -1; `en` is assigned the value `md - 1`; `ans` is `md + 1`.
