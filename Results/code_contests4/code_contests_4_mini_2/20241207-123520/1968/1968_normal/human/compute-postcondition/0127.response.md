The value of `su` is assigned to -1. The previous value of `su` was less than `a[i]`, and since we are not changing any other variables, they remain as they were. The output state reflects the updated value of `su` while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`out` is updated with the joined string of integers from `ans` to `n`, `su` is -1, `n` is greater than `md + 1`, `i` is `md + 1`, and `su` is less than `a[i]**
