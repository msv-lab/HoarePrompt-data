Postcondition: ***`out` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers from input, `be` is 0, `en` is n - 1, `md` is (n - 1) >> 1, `ans` is n, `su` is -1, indicating that the sum of elements from index `md + 1` to `n - 1` became less than `a[i]` during any iteration.***
