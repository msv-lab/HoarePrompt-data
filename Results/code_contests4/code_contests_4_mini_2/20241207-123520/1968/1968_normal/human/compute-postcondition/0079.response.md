The variable `su` is assigned the value of `-1`. The other variables remain unaffected, so their values do not change. Therefore, the Output State is: `out` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 3, `md` is less than `n - 1`, `i` is md + 3, and `su` is -1.
