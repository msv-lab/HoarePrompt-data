The code snippet assigns the value -1 to the variable `su`. The previous value of `su` was updated to -1 + `a[i]`, but since the code snippet directly assigns a new value to `su`, we override the previous calculation. Other variables are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`out` is updated with the joined string of integers from `ans` to `n`, `_` is 1, `be` is 0, `en` is n - 1, `md` is (n - 1) // 2, `su` is -1**
