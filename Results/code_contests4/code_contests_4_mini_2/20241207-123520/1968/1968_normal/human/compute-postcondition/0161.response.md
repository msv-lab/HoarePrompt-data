Output State: **`out` is updated with the joined string of integers from `ans` to `n`; if `su` is less than `a[i]`, then `su` is set to -1; `n` remains greater than `md + 2`; `i` is `md + 2`; `be` is `md + 1`; `md` is calculated based on `be` and `en`; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; `su` is updated by adding `a[i]` to it.**
