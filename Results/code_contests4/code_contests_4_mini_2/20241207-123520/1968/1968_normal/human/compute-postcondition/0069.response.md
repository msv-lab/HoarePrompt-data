The code assigns the value -1 to the variable `su`. The other variables (`out`, `_`, `n`, `md`, `i`, and `a[i]`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `su` while maintaining the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`out` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 3, `md` is less than `n - 1`, `i` is `md + 1`, `su` is -1**
