According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the condition defined by `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at `md + 1`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. This means that for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `md + 1`. After the last iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration, so `i` will be `md + 2`.

State: **`out` is a string made from the range of numbers from `ans` to `n`, `su` is updated to the sum of the first `md + 1` elements of `a`, which was previously -1; `su` is increased by `a[i]`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `md + 2, i` is `md + 2`**
