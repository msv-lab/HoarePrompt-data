The value of `su` is assigned to -1. The values of the other variables (`out`, `ans`, `n`, `a[i]`, `md`, and `i`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `out` is updated with the joined string of integers from `ans` to `n`, `su` is -1, `n` is greater than `md + 2`, `i` is `md + 3`, and for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than `md + 3`.

Output State: **`out` is updated with the joined string of integers from `ans` to `n`, `su` is -1, `n` is greater than `md + 2`, `i` is `md + 3`, and for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than `md + 3.**
