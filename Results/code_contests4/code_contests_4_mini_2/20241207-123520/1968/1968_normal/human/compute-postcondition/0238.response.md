The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `out` is a string made from the range of numbers from `ans` to `n`, `su` is -1, `n` is greater than `md + 1`, `i` is `md + 1`, and `su` is less than `a[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
