The function accepts multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` positive integers. It processes each test case to determine the maximum number of elements from the list that can be summed without exceeding the next largest element and returns the count of such elements. Additionally, it outputs the indices of these elements in the sorted list. The function handles cases where no elements can be summed without exceeding the next element and returns appropriate results based on the input constraints.
