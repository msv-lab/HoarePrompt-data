To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the program's logic and check whether it correctly computes the weight of the minimum spanning tree (MST) for the given complete undirected weighted graph.

### Key Points from the Problem Description:
1. The graph is complete, meaning every vertex is connected to every other vertex.
2. The edges have weights of either 0 or 1, with exactly `m` edges having a weight of 1.
3. We need to calculate the weight of the minimum spanning tree (MST).

### Analyzing the Program:
1. The program uses a union-find (disjoint set) data structure to manage connected components.
2. It reads the number of vertices `n` and the number of edges `m`.
3. It initializes a parent array `p` and a rank array `r` for union-find operations.
4. The graph edges with weight 1 are stored in a set `sg`.
5. It identifies the vertex with the minimum number of connections and attempts to union all other vertices to it.
6. Finally, it counts the number of distinct roots to determine the number of connected components.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Union Operation Logic**: The union operation is not considering the weights of the edges correctly. The logic only connects vertices based on the adjacency in the `sg` set and ignores edges of weight 0. In a complete graph with `n` vertices, we have `n(n-1)/2` edges, and only `m` of them have weight 1. The remaining `n(n-1)/2 - m` edges should have weight 0. The program does not account for these edges correctly when determining the MST.
2. **MST Weight Calculation**: The program should output the weight of the MST. In a complete graph where we have `m` edges with weight 1 and `n-1` edges can be selected from the remaining 0 weight edges, the MST weight should be the maximum of `0` and the number of edges with weight 1 that are needed. However, the program only prints `len(roots) - 1`, which does not accurately reflect the MST weight.

### Example Cases:
1. **Case with all edges of weight 0**:
   Input:
   ```
   4 0
   ```
   Expected output: `0` (since all edges have weight 0).
   The program would output `3` (since there are 4 vertices, it erroneously computes `len(roots) - 1`).

2. **Case with some edges of weight 1**:
   Input:
   ```
   3 2
   1 2
   1 3
   ```
   Expected output: `2` (the MST can include both edges).
   The program may not calculate this correctly depending on the union-find logic.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic needed to compute the weight of the minimum spanning tree as described. It miscalculates the connections and does not account properly for the weights of the edges. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
