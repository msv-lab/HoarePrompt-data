To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze how the program calculates the weight of the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a complete graph with given edge weights.

### Key Points from the Problem Description:
1. The graph is a complete graph with `n` vertices.
2. Out of the edges, `m` edges have a weight of 1, and the rest have a weight of 0.
3. The goal is to output the weight of the minimum spanning tree.

### Analyzing the Program:
- The program begins by reading `n` and `m`. It initializes a parent array `p` for union-find operations and a rank array `r`.
- It constructs a set `sg` to store the edges with weight 1.
- The union-find operations are used to connect components of the graph effectively.
- The root of each vertex is determined, and the number of unique roots (connected components) is calculated.
- The output is given as `len(roots) - 1`, which suggests that the program is trying to count the number of edges needed to connect the components.

### Correctness Check:
1. **Case with Zero Edges (m = 0)**: According to the problem description, if `m = 0`, all edges have weight 0, and hence the MST should weigh 0. The program correctly returns 0 in this case.
  
2. **Case with Multiple Edges (m > 0)**:
   - The program counts the number of connected components and returns `len(roots) - 1`. However, this approach does not directly consider the minimum weight of edges.
   - For a complete graph with `n` vertices, the MST should use `n - 1` edges. If there are `m` edges of weight 1, the MST should utilize these edges first until all components are connected. If `m` is less than `n - 1`, the program does not account for this scenario correctly.

3. **Potential Failure Case**: Consider the input:
   ```
   4 1
   1 2
   ```
   Here, we have 4 vertices and 1 edge with weight 1 connecting vertex 1 and 2. The MST should have a weight of 1 (using the edge 1-2) and then we need to connect vertices 3 and 4 using edges of weight 0. The output should be 1 (the minimum spanning tree can connect all vertices with a total weight of 1).

   However, the program may not handle this correctly, leading to incorrect outputs in some configurations.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly calculate the weight of the minimum spanning tree in all cases, especially when the number of edges with weight 1 is less than `n - 1`. Thus, there is at least one input case where the program fails to match the expected output.

Correctness: **False**
