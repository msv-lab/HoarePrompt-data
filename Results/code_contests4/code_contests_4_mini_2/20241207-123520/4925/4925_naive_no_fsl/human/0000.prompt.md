You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Ujan has a lot of useless stuff in his drawers, a considerable part of which are his math notebooks: it is time to sort them out. This time he found an old dusty graph theory notebook with a description of a graph.

It is an undirected weighted graph on n vertices. It is a complete graph: each pair of vertices is connected by an edge. The weight of each edge is either 0 or 1; exactly m edges have weight 1, and all others have weight 0.

Since Ujan doesn't really want to organize his notes, he decided to find the weight of the minimum spanning tree of the graph. (The weight of a spanning tree is the sum of all its edges.) Can you find the answer for Ujan so he stops procrastinating?

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5)), the number of vertices and the number of edges of weight 1 in the graph. 

The i-th of the next m lines contains two integers a_i and b_i (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i), the endpoints of the i-th edge of weight 1.

It is guaranteed that no edge appears twice in the input.

Output

Output a single integer, the weight of the minimum spanning tree of the graph.

Examples

Input

1 3
1 4

Input


3 0


Output


0

Note

The graph from the first sample is shown below. Dashed edges have weight 0, other edges have weight 1. One of the minimum spanning trees is highlighted in orange and has total weight 2.

In the second sample, all edges have weight 0 so any spanning tree has total weight 0.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
