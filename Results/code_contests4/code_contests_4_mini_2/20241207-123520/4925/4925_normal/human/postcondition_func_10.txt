The function accepts a list `l` of pairs of integers representing edges, an integer `start`, and an integer `end`. It returns a range object that starts from `start` and extends to `len(l) + end`, where `len(l)` is the number of edges in the list `l`. There are no checks for the validity of `start` or `end`, which could lead to unexpected results if they are outside the expected bounds or if `start` is greater than `len(l) + end`.
