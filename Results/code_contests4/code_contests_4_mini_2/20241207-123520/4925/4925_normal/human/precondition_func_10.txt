l is a list of pairs of integers representing edges with weight 1 in a complete undirected graph, start and end are integers that represent the range of vertices (1 ≤ start, end ≤ n) where n is the number of vertices in the graph and m is the number of edges in the graph such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5).
