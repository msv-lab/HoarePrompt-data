The function accepts two integer parameters, `n` (representing the number of vertices in a graph) and `m` (representing the number of edges), and returns a list containing `n` elements. Each element in the list is generated by calling the function `func_4()`, which is not defined in the provided code. The function does not utilize the value of `m` or the details regarding edges in its functionality.
