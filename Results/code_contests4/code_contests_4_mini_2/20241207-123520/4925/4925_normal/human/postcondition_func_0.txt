The function processes a graph defined by an integer number of vertices `n` and edges `m`, constructing the graph using sets to represent connections between vertices. It then performs union operations to determine connected components in the graph and prints the number of unique connected components minus one. The function assumes all inputs are valid according to specified constraints and does not handle cases where `n` or `m` are outside the defined limits.
