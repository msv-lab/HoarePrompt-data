x is a tuple containing two integers n and m, where n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) is the number of vertices and m (0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5)) is the number of edges of weight 1 in the graph. Additionally, the next m lines contain pairs of integers (a_i, b_i) representing the endpoints of the edges of weight 1, where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n and a_i ≠ b_i.
