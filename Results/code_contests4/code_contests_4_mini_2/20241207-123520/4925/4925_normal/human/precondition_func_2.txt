n is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), m is a non-negative integer representing the number of edges with weight 1 (0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5)), and for each of the m edges, a_i and b_i are integers (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n) representing the endpoints of the edges, with a_i ≠ b_i.
