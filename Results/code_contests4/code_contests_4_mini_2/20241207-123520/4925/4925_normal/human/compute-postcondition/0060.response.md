The loop checks if each value of `j` from `0` to `n-1` is not in `sg[i]`. If it is not, it performs a union operation between `i` and `j`. Given that `n` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop will execute `n` times.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, `j` will take on each value from `0` to `n-1`. The final state will depend on whether the union operation was executed for each `j`. Since `j` iterates through all values from `0` to `n-1`, and if there are any values of `j` that are not in `sg[i]`, those unions will be performed.

Thus, the output state after all iterations will reflect that `i` is still `2`, `n` is the same as the initial value, and `j` will be equal to `n-1` after the loop completes, with the unions performed for each `j` that was not already in `sg[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is the initial value, `i` is 2, `j` is `n-1`, and the union function may have been executed multiple times for each `j` not in `sg[i]`.**
