The code `roots.add(find(i))` indicates that the result of the function `find(i)` is being added to the set `roots`. The variable `i` has a value of 2. Since `n` is greater than 0 and must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute a second time, we do not know the exact value of `n`, but it does not affect the operation here. The variable `roots` will now include the result of `find(2)`. 

Since the output of `find(i)` is not specified, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we can conclude that `roots` is modified by adding this result. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `roots` now includes the result of `find(2)`**
