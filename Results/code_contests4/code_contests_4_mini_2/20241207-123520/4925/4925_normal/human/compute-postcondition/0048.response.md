According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1, which implies that the loop has executed at least once. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 2. Since `n` is still greater than or equal to 1, it must also be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
