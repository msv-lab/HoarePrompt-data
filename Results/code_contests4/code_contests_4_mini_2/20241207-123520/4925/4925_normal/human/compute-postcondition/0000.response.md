The code snippet contains a comment and does not perform any operations on the variables `x` and `r`. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The output state reflects the initial conditions of the variables.

Output State: **`x` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^5), `r` is a non-negative integer representing the number of edges of weight 1 (0 ≤ r ≤ min((x(x-1))/(2), 10^5))**
