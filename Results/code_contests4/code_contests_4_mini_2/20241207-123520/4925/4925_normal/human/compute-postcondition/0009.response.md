Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `x` and `y`. It calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm. If `y` is initially 0, it returns `x` as the GCD. If `y` is non-zero, it performs a series of calculations until `y` reaches 0, at which point it returns the GCD. The function handles cases where `x` is 0 or `y` is 0, returning the other value appropriately. **
