The function `union(i, j)` is executed with `i` being 0 and `j` being 1. The specifics of what `union()` does are not provided, but it typically would involve combining or processing the elements represented by `i` and `j`. Given the initial state, we know that `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and since `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute a second time, we can infer that the execution of `union(i, j)` is likely part of a loop that may affect `i` and `j` in some way.

However, without additional context on the function's implementation or any changes to `i` or `j`, we can only conclude that the values remain unchanged after executing `union(i, j)`. The execution of the function does not alter `n`, `i`, or `j` based on the information given.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `union(i, j)` has been executed.**
