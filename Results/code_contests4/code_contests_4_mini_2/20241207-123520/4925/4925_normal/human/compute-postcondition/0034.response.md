According to the code, for the loop to execute again, the variable `i` must be less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration. The loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
