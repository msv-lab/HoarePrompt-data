The statement `roots = set()` initializes a new empty set assigned to the variable `roots`. This operation does not affect the other variables (`n`, `m`, `sg`, `v`), which retain their previous values. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices, `m` is the number of edges added, `sg` is a list of sets representing the connections after unions, `v` is the index of the vertex with the minimum connections in `sg`, `roots` is an empty set**.
