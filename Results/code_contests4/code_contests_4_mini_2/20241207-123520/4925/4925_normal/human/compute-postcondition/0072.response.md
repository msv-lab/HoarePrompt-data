The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It processes a graph defined by the number of vertices `n` and the number of edges `m`, along with the endpoints of each edge provided in the input. After executing the function body, it returns a result based on the properties of the graph formed by these vertices and edges. 

Functionality: **The function processes a graph defined by an integer number of vertices `n` and edges `m`, and returns a result based on the graph structure derived from the input edges.**
