According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop can execute at least once. However, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 1. Given that `i` is already set to 1, which indicates that the loop has executed once, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time**
