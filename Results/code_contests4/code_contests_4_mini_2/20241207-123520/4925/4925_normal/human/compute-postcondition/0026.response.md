According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, and `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will become 1. The loop can execute again if `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
