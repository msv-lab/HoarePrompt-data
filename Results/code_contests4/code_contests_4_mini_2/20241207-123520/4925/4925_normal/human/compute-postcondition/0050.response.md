According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop can execute at least once. Given that `i` is 2 and the loop is about to execute for the second time, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 for that second execution to be valid. 

Thus, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must indeed be greater than 1. The current state indicates that `i` is already 2, which is appropriate for the second iteration of the loop.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
