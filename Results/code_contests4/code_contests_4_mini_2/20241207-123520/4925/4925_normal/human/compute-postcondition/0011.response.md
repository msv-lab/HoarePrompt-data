The function `union` accepts two parameters: `u` and `v`. The parameters `u` and `v` are integers representing endpoints of an edge in a graph. The function does not return any value, as it returns None by default. Therefore, the functionality of the function `union` is to accept two integer parameters representing endpoints of an edge in a graph, and it does not return any value. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters u and v, which are integers representing endpoints of an edge in a graph, and returns None.**
