The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are integers, where `x` represents the number of vertices (with constraints 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^5) and `y` represents the number of edges with weight 1 (with constraints 0 ≤ y ≤ min((x(x-1))/(2), 10^5)). After executing the function body, the program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `x` and `y`. Specifically, if `y` is 0, the GCD is `x`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept two integers `x` and `y`, and it returns the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, which is `x` when `y` is 0. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, and returns the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, which is `x` if `y` is 0.**
