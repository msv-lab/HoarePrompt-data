The function `union(i, j)` is called, which typically modifies the state of a union-find data structure. In this case, `i` is 1 and `j` is not in `sg[i]`, indicating that they belong to different sets. The `union(i, j)` function will merge the sets containing `i` and `j`. 

Since the exact structure of `sg` and how the union operation specifically modifies the states of `n`, `i`, `j`, or `sg` is not defined in this context, I can conclude that while the values of `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged, the state of the union-find structure has been altered. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is not in `sg[i]`, and the union operation merges the sets containing `i` and `j`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is not in `sg[i]`, and the union operation merges the sets containing `i` and `j`.**
