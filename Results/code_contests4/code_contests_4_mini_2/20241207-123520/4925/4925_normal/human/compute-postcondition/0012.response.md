Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer parameters, `u` and `v`, which represent endpoints of an edge in a graph. It performs a union operation on the sets containing `u` and `v`, effectively connecting them in a disjoint-set data structure. If `u` and `v` are already in the same set, the function returns None without making any changes. If they are in different sets, it updates the parent of one set to the other and adjusts the rank if necessary, but does not return any value. **
