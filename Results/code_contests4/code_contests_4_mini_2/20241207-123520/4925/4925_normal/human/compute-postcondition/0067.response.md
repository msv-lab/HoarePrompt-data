In this case, the code `roots.add(find(i))` indicates that we are adding the result of the `find(i)` function to a collection called `roots`. The value of `i` is currently 1, and since `n` is greater than 0, the function `find(i)` will return a value based on the input `i`. The specific output of the function is not provided, but it will be added to `roots`.

Since we don't have the exact value returned by `find(i)`, we can state that the `roots` collection is being modified. The state of `n` and `i` remains unchanged as the operation does not modify these variables.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `find(i)` is added to `roots`.**
