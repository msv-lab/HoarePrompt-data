The function `union(i, j)` is called, which typically combines or merges the elements represented by `i` and `j`. However, the specific implementation details of the `union` function are not provided, and it is unclear how it affects the values of `i`, `j`, or any other variables. Given that `i` is 0 and `j` is 2, the execution of this function may not result in any changes to the values of `i` and `j` unless specified otherwise in the function's behavior.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and the union of `i` and `j` has been executed.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and the union of `i` and `j` has been executed.**
