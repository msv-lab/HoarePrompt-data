According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the range defined by `n`. Since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 for each iteration, the loop will execute again as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1, implying that `j` could be 0 or 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be 2, which is the next value in the range.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be 2.**
