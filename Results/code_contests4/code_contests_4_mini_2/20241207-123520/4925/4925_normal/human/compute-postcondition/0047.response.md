Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1 and `i` is 1. If `i` is not in `sg[v]`, the union operation is called with `i` and `v`, but no modifications are made to `n` or `i`. Otherwise, the union operation has been performed for each `j` (from 0 to `n-1`) not in `sg[i]`, merging the sets containing `i` with the sets of those `j` values.***
