The code `roots.add(find(i))` adds the result of `find(i)` to the set `roots`. The value of `i` is currently 0, so the `find(i)` function will be called with `i` as 0. The initial state of `n` is greater than 0, but it does not affect the execution of this line. We do not know the return value of `find(i)`, but it will be added to the `roots` set. 

Since the state of other variables is not affected, the output state reflects the addition to the `roots` set.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `find(i)` has been added to `roots`.**
