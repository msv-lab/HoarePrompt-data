According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will iterate from `0` to `n - 1`, which means that for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 1. The current state indicates that `n` is an integer, but does not specify its value. Additionally, the variable `i` will be initialized to `0` at the start of the loop.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to confirm that `n` is greater than 0. Thus, the states need to be adjusted accordingly.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
