According to the code, the loop will continue executing as long as there are more values for `j` in the range defined by `n`. In the last iteration, `j` is 2, and since `n` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again for `j = 3`. 

At the end of the last iteration, the values are:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 2

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented to 3. Since `n` is greater than 3, the loop can continue executing.

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 3**
