Functionality: ** The function accepts a parameter `v`, which is expected to be an integer representing a vertex in a union-find (disjoint-set) structure. It follows the union-find algorithm to find the representative or root of the set containing `v` by traversing through a mapping `p`. The function returns the stable value (or root) of the set for the given vertex, based on the mapping defined by `p`. The input parameter `v` is not a tuple containing two integers; rather, it should be a single integer corresponding to a vertex.**
