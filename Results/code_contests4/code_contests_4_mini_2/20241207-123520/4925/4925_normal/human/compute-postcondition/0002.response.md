The function `func_11` accepts two parameters: `x` and `r`. The parameter `x` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, constrained between 1 and 100,000 (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^5). The parameter `r` is a non-negative integer representing the number of edges of weight 1, constrained between 0 and the minimum of either (x(x-1)/2) or 100,000 (0 ≤ r ≤ min((x(x-1))/(2), 10^5)). After executing the function body, it returns the integer result of the expression (x + r - 1) // r, which is calculated using the values of `x` and `r`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_11` is to accept two parameters, an integer `x` for the number of vertices and a non-negative integer `r` for the number of edges, and return the integer result of the expression (x + r - 1) // r. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters x (the number of vertices in the graph) and r (the number of edges of weight 1), and returns the integer result of the expression (x + r - 1) // r.**
