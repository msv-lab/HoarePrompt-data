To analyze the output state after the while loop executes, we need to understand that the loop effectively implements the Euclidean algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. 

The loop continues executing as long as `y` is not zero. Each iteration updates `x` to the previous value of `y`, and `y` to the result of `x` modulo `y`. When `y` becomes 0, the loop terminates, and `x` will hold the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`.

Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have executed:

- `x` will be the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `x` and `y`.
- `y` will be 0, indicating the termination condition of the loop.

Output State: **`y` is 0, `x` is the greatest common divisor of the initial values of `x` and `y`.**
