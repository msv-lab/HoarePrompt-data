According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute `n` times, starting from `i = 0` up to `i = n - 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 1. The states that need to be adjusted are as follows: the value of `n` needs to be greater than or equal to 1, and `i` should be initialized to 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0**
