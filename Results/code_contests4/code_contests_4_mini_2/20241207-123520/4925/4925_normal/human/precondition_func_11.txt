n is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, and m is a non-negative integer representing the number of edges with weight 1 such that 0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/2, 10^5). Each of the next m lines contains two distinct integers a_i and b_i (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n) representing the endpoints of an edge with weight 1.
