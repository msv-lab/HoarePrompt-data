The function accepts a tuple `x` containing two integers, which represent the number of vertices `n` and the number of edges `m`. It returns the result of raising the tuple `x` to the power of `(MOD - 2)` modulo `MOD`. However, it is important to note that raising a tuple to a power is not a typical operation in Python, and this may lead to unexpected behavior or errors if `x` is not a numeric type. The function does not handle cases where `x` is not a number and does not check for the validity of the tuple's contents.
