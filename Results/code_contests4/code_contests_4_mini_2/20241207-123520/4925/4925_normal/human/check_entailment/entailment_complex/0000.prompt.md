You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Ujan has a lot of useless stuff in his drawers, a considerable part of which are his math notebooks: it is time to sort them out. This time he found an old dusty graph theory notebook with a description of a graph.

It is an undirected weighted graph on n vertices. It is a complete graph: each pair of vertices is connected by an edge. The weight of each edge is either 0 or 1; exactly m edges have weight 1, and all others have weight 0.

Since Ujan doesn't really want to organize his notes, he decided to find the weight of the minimum spanning tree of the graph. (The weight of a spanning tree is the sum of all its edges.) Can you find the answer for Ujan so he stops procrastinating?

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5)), the number of vertices and the number of edges of weight 1 in the graph. 

The i-th of the next m lines contains two integers a_i and b_i (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i), the endpoints of the i-th edge of weight 1.

It is guaranteed that no edge appears twice in the input.

Output

Output a single integer, the weight of the minimum spanning tree of the graph.

In the second sample, all edges have weight 0 so any spanning tree has total weight 0.

For each of the next m lines, a_i and b_i are integers representing the endpoints of the edges with weight 1, where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n and a_i ≠ b_i.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices, `m` is the number of edges added, `sg` is a list of sets representing the connections after unions, `v` is the index of the vertex with the minimum connections in `sg`.
    roots = set()
    for i in range(n):
        roots.add(find(i))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices, `roots` is a set containing the unique roots from `find(i)` for all `i` in range `n`, `m` is unchanged, `sg` is unchanged, and `v` is unchanged.
    print(len(roots) - 1)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a graph defined by an integer number of vertices `n` and edges `m`, constructing the graph using sets to represent connections between vertices. It then performs union operations to determine connected components in the graph and prints the number of unique connected components minus one. The function assumes all inputs are valid according to specified constraints and does not handle cases where `n` or `m` are outside the defined limits.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: v is a tuple containing two integers n and m, where n is the number of vertices (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and m is the number of edges with weight 1 (0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5)). Additionally, there are m pairs of integers (a_i, b_i) representing the endpoints of the edges with weight 1, where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n and a_i ≠ b_i.
def find(v):
    vc = v
    while v != p[v]:
        v = p[v]
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `v` is equal to `p[v]`, indicating that the final value of `v` is a stable state defined by the mapping of `p`.
    while vc != v:
        p[vc], vc = v, p[vc]
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `v` is equal to the stable value defined by the mapping `p`, `vc` is also equal to `v`.
    return v
    #The program returns the stable value defined by the mapping `p`, which is equal to `v`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `v`, which is expected to be an integer representing a vertex in a union-find (disjoint-set) structure. It follows the union-find algorithm to find the representative or root of the set containing `v` by traversing through a mapping `p`. The function returns the stable value (or root) of the set for the given vertex, based on the mapping defined by `p`. The input parameter `v` is not a tuple containing two integers; rather, it should be a single integer corresponding to a vertex.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), m is a non-negative integer representing the number of edges with weight 1 (0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5)), and for each of the m edges, a_i and b_i are integers (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n) representing the endpoints of the edges, with a_i ≠ b_i.
def union(u, v):
    u, v = find(u), find(v)
    if (u == v) :
        return
        #The program returns None because there is no value specified to return.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`u` and `v` are assigned the values returned by the `find` function when called with their current values. `u` is not equal to `v`. Other variables remain unaffected.
    if (r[u] < r[v]) :
        u, v = v, u
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`u` and `v` are assigned the values returned by the `find` function when called with their current values, and `u` is not equal to `v`. If the value of `r[u]` is less than the value of `r[v]`, then the values of `u` and `v` are swapped. Otherwise, the values of `u` and `v` remain unchanged.
    p[u] = v
    if (r[u] == r[v]) :
        r[u] += 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`u` and `v` are assigned the values returned by the `find` function when called with their current values, `u` is not equal to `v`, and `p[u]` is assigned the value of `v`. If the values at index `u` and `v` in array `r` are equal, then `r[u]` is incremented by 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters, `u` and `v`, which represent endpoints of an edge in a graph. It performs a union operation on the sets containing `u` and `v`, effectively connecting them in a disjoint-set data structure. If `u` and `v` are already in the same set, the function returns None without making any changes. If they are in different sets, it updates the parent of one set to the other and adjusts the rank if necessary, but does not return any value.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a tuple containing two integers n and m, where n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) is the number of vertices and m (0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5)) is the number of edges of weight 1 in the graph. Additionally, the next m lines contain pairs of integers (a_i, b_i) representing the endpoints of the edges of weight 1, where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n and a_i ≠ b_i.
def func_2(x):
    return pow(x, MOD - 2, MOD)
    #The program returns the result of raising the tuple x to the power of (MOD - 2) modulo MOD
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `x` containing two integers, which represent the number of vertices `n` and the number of edges `m`. It returns the result of raising the tuple `x` to the power of `(MOD - 2)` modulo `MOD`. However, it is important to note that raising a tuple to a power is not a typical operation in Python, and this may lead to unexpected behavior or errors if `x` is not a numeric type. The function does not handle cases where `x` is not a number and does not check for the validity of the tuple's contents.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer representing the number of vertices (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^5), and y is an integer representing the number of edges with weight 1 (0 ≤ y ≤ min((x(x-1))/(2), 10^5)).
def func_3(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `y` is 0, `x` is the greatest common divisor of the initial values of `x` and `y`.
    return x
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor of the initial values of `x` and `y`, which is `x` since `y` is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers `x` and `y`. It calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm. If `y` is initially 0, it returns `x` as the GCD. If `y` is non-zero, it performs a series of calculations until `y` reaches 0, at which point it returns the GCD. The function handles cases where `x` is 0 or `y` is 0, returning the other value appropriately.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of vertices in a graph, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; m is an integer representing the number of edges with weight 1, where 0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5); for each edge, a_i and b_i are integers representing the endpoints of the edge, where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n and a_i ≠ b_i.
def func_4():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained from the input, which represents the values entered by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns a list of integers obtained from user input, which represents the values entered by the user. The function does not handle any validation or constraints related to the integers, such as ensuring they are within specified ranges or handling non-integer inputs.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: o is a tuple containing two integers n and m, where n is the number of vertices (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and m is the number of edges with weight 1 (0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/(2), 10^5)). Following this, there are m pairs of integers (a_i, b_i) representing the endpoints of each edge with weight 1, ensuring that 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n and a_i ≠ b_i, with no duplicate edges.
def func_5(o):
    return list(map(lambda x: int(x) + o, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers, where each integer is the sum of the corresponding input integer and the tuple 'o' containing two integers n and m.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `o` containing two integers `n` and `m`, and returns a list of integers where each integer is the sum of the corresponding input integer and the first integer of the tuple `o`. The function does not consider the second integer of the tuple `o` or handle any input validation regarding the number of integers entered, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the input does not match the expected format.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), m is an integer representing the number of edges with weight 1 (0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/2, 100,000)), and m edges are defined by pairs of integers (a_i, b_i) where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n and a_i ≠ b_i.
def func_6(n, m):
    return [func_4() for _ in range(n)]
    #The program returns a list of n elements, each being the result of calling func_4()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters, `n` (representing the number of vertices in a graph) and `m` (representing the number of edges), and returns a list containing `n` elements. Each element in the list is generated by calling the function `func_4()`, which is not defined in the provided code. The function does not utilize the value of `m` or the details regarding edges in its functionality.

#Function 9:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: f is a 2D list representing the vertices of a complete undirected weighted graph, where each edge has a weight of either 0 or 1; dim is a tuple containing two integers n and m, where n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) is the number of vertices and m (0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5)) is the number of edges with weight 1, and for each edge, the endpoints a_i and b_i (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i) are provided.
def func_7(f):
    return [func_7(f, *dim[1:]) for _ in range(dim[0])] if dim else f()
    #The program returns a list containing the result of func_7 applied to the second element of dim for each vertex in the complete undirected weighted graph represented by f, repeated dim[0] times, if dim is not empty; otherwise, it returns f()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a 2D list `f` representing a complete undirected weighted graph and a tuple `dim` that describes the number of vertices and edges. If `dim` is not empty, it returns a list containing the result of recursively applying `func_7` to the second element of `dim`, repeated `dim[0]` times. If `dim` is empty, it returns `f()` directly. It is important to note that the function's behavior depends on the definition of `f` and `dim`, which are not fully detailed in the provided code, leading to potential ambiguity regarding the exact structure and expected input.

#Function 10:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: start is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph (1 ≤ start ≤ 10^5), step is an integer representing the number of edges of weight 1 (0 ≤ step ≤ min((start(start-1))/(2),10^5)), and count is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (a_i, b_i) representing the endpoints of edges with weight 1 (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ start, a_i ≠ b_i).
def func_8(start, step, count):
    return range(start, start + step * count, step)
    #The program returns a range starting from `start` to `start + step * len_count` with a step of `step`, where `len_count` is the number of tuples in the list `count`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `start`, an integer `step`, and a list of tuples `count`. It returns a range object starting from `start` to `start + step * len(count)` with a step of `step`, where `len(count)` is the number of tuples in the list. The function does not validate the input parameters, so it assumes they are within the specified constraints. If `count` is empty, the range will start and end at `start`.

#Function 11:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list of pairs of integers representing edges with weight 1 in a complete undirected graph, start and end are integers that represent the range of vertices (1 ≤ start, end ≤ n) where n is the number of vertices in the graph and m is the number of edges in the graph such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5).
def func_9(l, start, end):
    return range(start, len(l) + end)
    #The program returns a range object from 'start' to 'len(l) + end', where 'len(l)' is the number of edges in the list 'l' representing pairs of integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `l` of pairs of integers representing edges, an integer `start`, and an integer `end`. It returns a range object that starts from `start` and extends to `len(l) + end`, where `len(l)` is the number of edges in the list `l`. There are no checks for the validity of `start` or `end`, which could lead to unexpected results if they are outside the expected bounds or if `start` is greater than `len(l) + end`.

#Function 12:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, and m is a non-negative integer representing the number of edges with weight 1 such that 0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/2, 10^5). Each of the next m lines contains two distinct integers a_i and b_i (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n) representing the endpoints of an edge with weight 1.
def func_10(n):
    """ [0, 1, 2, 4, 4, 8, 8, 8, 8, 16, 16, ...] """
    return 2 ** (n - 1).bit_length()
    #The program returns the number of bits required to represent 2 raised to the power of (n - 1), which is equivalent to n - 1 + 1, hence the return value is n.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns `n`, which is the number of bits required to represent \(2^{(n-1)}\). It effectively calculates the value of `n` based on the bit length of \(2^{(n-1)}\).

#Function 13:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^5), and r is a non-negative integer representing the number of edges of weight 1 (0 ≤ r ≤ min((x(x-1))/(2), 10^5)).
def func_11(x, r):
    """ = ceil(x / r) """
    return (x + r - 1) // r
    #The program returns the integer result of the expression (x + r - 1) // r, where x is the number of vertices in the graph and r is the number of edges of weight 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `x` representing the number of vertices in a graph and a non-negative integer `r` representing the number of edges of weight 1. It returns the integer result of the expression (x + r - 1) // r, which effectively computes the ceiling of the division x / r. If `r` is 0, it would lead to a division by zero error, which is not handled in the code, indicating a potential edge case that needs attention.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
