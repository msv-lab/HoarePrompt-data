To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the program and its functions, particularly focusing on how it handles the input parameters, and whether it produces the correct output for all specified cases.

### Summary of the Problem:
Ujan needs to find the weight of the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a complete undirected graph with `n` vertices, where `m` edges have a weight of 1 and the rest have a weight of 0. The output should be the total weight of the minimum spanning tree.

### Key Observations:
1. **Graph Properties**:
   - In a complete graph with `n` vertices, there are `n * (n - 1) / 2` edges.
   - Given `m` edges with weight 1, the remaining edges will have weight 0.

2. **MST Calculation**:
   - The minimum spanning tree can be constructed by including all edges with weight 1 until we connect all components, and then filling in with edges of weight 0 if necessary.
   - The maximum number of edges with weight 1 that can be included in the MST is `min(n - 1, m)`.

3. **Special Cases**:
   - If `m == 0`, the MST weight is `0`.
   - If `m >= n - 1`, the MST should include `n - 1` edges with weight 1.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Union-Find Structure**:
   - The functions `find` and `union` are used to manage connected components of the graph.
   - The program constructs a union-find structure to keep track of which vertices are connected.

2. **Logic in `func_1`**:
   - The algorithm identifies the vertex with the fewest connections and attempts to connect all other vertices to it, which is not a typical way to construct an MST.

3. **Final Output**:
   - The output is calculated as `len(roots) - 1`, representing the number of components minus one, which does not correctly account for the weights of the edges added to the MST.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- The algorithm does not properly handle the case when there are fewer edges with weight 1 than required to connect all vertices.
- The logic that connects vertices based on their minimum connections does not guarantee that the MST is formed correctly or that it minimizes the total weight.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not comply with the problem description and fails in key cases, particularly when there are not enough edges of weight 1 to connect all vertices. For instance, if `n = 5` and `m = 2`, the MST cannot be formed correctly, yet the code would still produce an output based on the number of connected components rather than the actual weight of the MST.

Thus, the correctness of the program based on the problem description is:

Correctness: **False**
