start is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph (1 ≤ start ≤ 10^5), step is an integer representing the number of edges of weight 1 (0 ≤ step ≤ min((start(start-1))/(2),10^5)), and count is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (a_i, b_i) representing the endpoints of edges with weight 1 (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ start, a_i ≠ b_i).
