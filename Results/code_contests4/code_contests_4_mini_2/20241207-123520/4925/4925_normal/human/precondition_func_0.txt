n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, and m is an integer representing the number of edges with weight 1, where 0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/2, 100,000). For each of the next m lines, a_i and b_i are integers representing the endpoints of the edges with weight 1, where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n and a_i ≠ b_i.
