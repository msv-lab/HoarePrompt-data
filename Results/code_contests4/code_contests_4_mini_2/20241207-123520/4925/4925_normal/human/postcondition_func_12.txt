The function accepts an integer `x` representing the number of vertices in a graph and a non-negative integer `r` representing the number of edges of weight 1. It returns the integer result of the expression (x + r - 1) // r, which effectively computes the ceiling of the division x / r. If `r` is 0, it would lead to a division by zero error, which is not handled in the code, indicating a potential edge case that needs attention.
