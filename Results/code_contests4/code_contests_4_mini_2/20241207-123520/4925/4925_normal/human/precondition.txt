n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), m is an integer representing the number of edges with weight 1 (0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/(2), 100,000)), and for each of the next m lines, a_i and b_i are integers representing the endpoints of the edges with weight 1 (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n and a_i ≠ b_i).
