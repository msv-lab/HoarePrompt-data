n is an integer representing the number of vertices in a graph, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; m is an integer representing the number of edges with weight 1, where 0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5); for each edge, a_i and b_i are integers representing the endpoints of the edge, where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n and a_i ≠ b_i.
