f is a 2D list representing the vertices of a complete undirected weighted graph, where each edge has a weight of either 0 or 1; dim is a tuple containing two integers n and m, where n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) is the number of vertices and m (0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5)) is the number of edges with weight 1, and for each edge, the endpoints a_i and b_i (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i) are provided.
