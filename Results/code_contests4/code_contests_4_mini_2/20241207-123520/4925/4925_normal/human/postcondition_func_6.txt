The function accepts a tuple `o` containing two integers `n` and `m`, and returns a list of integers where each integer is the sum of the corresponding input integer and the first integer of the tuple `o`. The function does not consider the second integer of the tuple `o` or handle any input validation regarding the number of integers entered, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the input does not match the expected format.
