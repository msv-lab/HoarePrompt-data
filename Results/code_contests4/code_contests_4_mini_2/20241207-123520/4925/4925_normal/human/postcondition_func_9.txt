The function accepts an integer `start`, an integer `step`, and a list of tuples `count`. It returns a range object starting from `start` to `start + step * len(count)` with a step of `step`, where `len(count)` is the number of tuples in the list. The function does not validate the input parameters, so it assumes they are within the specified constraints. If `count` is empty, the range will start and end at `start`.
