The loop continues to append values to the list `nom` until its length reaches 10. Given that the loop starts from 999999 and decrements down to 1, it will append values until `nom` contains 10 elements. The loop will break before adding more than 10 elements. 

Since the initial state of `nom` is [1, res_], which contains 2 elements, the loop will continue appending until it reaches a length of 10. Therefore, it will append 8 more values (999999, 999998, 999997, ..., down to 999992) to reach a total of 10 elements.

After the loop has executed fully, `nom` will have exactly 10 elements and will not change further since the loop breaks once `nom` reaches the length of 10.

Output State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^5; `n` is an input integer (11 ≤ n ≤ 100); `change` is 1000000; `nom` is a list of integers containing 10 elements; `res` is between 10 and 99; `res_` is between 10101 and 100000.**
