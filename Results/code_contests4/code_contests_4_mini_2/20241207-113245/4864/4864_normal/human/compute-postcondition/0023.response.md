According to the code, the `for` loop will execute as long as the range provided is valid. The loop is defined to iterate from `1000000 - 1` down to `1`, which means it will run 999999 times. The loop will execute regardless of the values of `A`, `n`, `change`, `nom`, and `res_`, as these variables do not affect the loop's execution.

However, we can identify the starting point of the loop variable `x`. The value of `x` will be `999999` on the first iteration, as it starts from `1000000 - 1`. 

Thus, the necessary states to be adjusted for the loop to execute are that `x` must start at `999999`. The other states (like `A`, `n`, `change`, `nom`, `res`, and `res_`) do not need to be altered to ensure the loop runs.

State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^5; `n` is an input integer (11 ≤ n ≤ 100); `change` is 1000000; `nom` is [1, res_]; `res` is between 10 and 99; `res_` is between 10101 and 100000; for the loop to execute the first time `x` is 999999**
