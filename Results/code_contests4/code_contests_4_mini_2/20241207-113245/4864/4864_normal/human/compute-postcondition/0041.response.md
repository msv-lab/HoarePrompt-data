To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we need to analyze the impact of the code on the existing variables.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^5.
   - `n` is an integer larger than 100 and within the range of 100 to 1000.
   - `change` is 1000000.
   - `nom` is [1].
   - `res` is calculated as `n - n % 10 - 1`.
   - `res_` is calculated as `change // res`.

2. **Execution of the Code**:
   - The code `nom.append(res_)` appends the value of `res_` to the list `nom`.

3. **Calculating `res`**:
   - Since `n` is larger than 100 and between 100 and 1000, `n % 10` will yield a value between 0 and 9.
   - Therefore, `res` will be `n - (n % 10) - 1`, which simplifies to a value between 98 and 999 (since the minimum value of `n` is 101 and maximum is 1000).

4. **Calculating `res_`**:
   - Given `change` is 1000000, `res_` is computed as `change // res`. Since `res` is always greater than 98, `res_` will yield a value between approximately 10101 and 1000 (as `res` approaches 999).
   
5. **Appending to `nom`**:
   - The value `res_` gets appended to the list `nom`, which originally was [1]. Thus, `nom` will now contain at least two elements: 1 and the computed `res_`.

6. **Finalizing the Output State**:
   - The specific value of `res_` isn't defined without knowing the exact value of `n`, but we can denote that it is a calculated integer based on the earlier steps. 
   - Therefore, `nom` will now have two elements: the initial value 1 and the calculated value `res_`.

Output State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^5; `n` is an integer larger than 100 and within the range of 100 to 1000; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is [1, res_]; `res` is between 98 and 999; `res_` is between 1000 and 10101.**
