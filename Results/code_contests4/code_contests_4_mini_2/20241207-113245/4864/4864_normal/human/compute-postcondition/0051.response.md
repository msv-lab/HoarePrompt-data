According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `x`, which is initialized to `999999` and decremented by `1` with each iteration until it reaches `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is `999999`. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be decremented to `999998`. 

The variable `A`, `n`, `change`, `nom`, `res`, and `res_` do not affect the execution of this specific loop but are part of the overall program state. Since the loop execution depends solely on the value of `x`, we can summarize the state as follows:

State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^5, `n` is an integer larger than 100 and within the range of 100 to 1000, `change` is 1000000, `nom` has exactly 10 elements, `res` is between 98 and 999, `res_` is between 1000 and 10101, `x` is 999998 for the loop to execute a second time.**
