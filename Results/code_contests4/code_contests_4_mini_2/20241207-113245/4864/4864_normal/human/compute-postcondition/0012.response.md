The code `nom.append(x)` appends the value of `x`, which is 999999, to the list `nom`. Since the initial state specifies that `nom` has not yet reached a length of `n`, the length of `nom` will increase by 1 after this operation. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^5, `n` is an input integer within that range and `n` is less than or equal to 10, `nom` has a length of less than `n` after appending `x`, `x` is 999999.**
