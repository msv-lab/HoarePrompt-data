`nom` is a list that initially contains 11 elements. The code appends the value of `x`, which is 999998, to `nom`. Since the length of `nom` is already equal to 11, the conditions specified (length equal to 10 or length equal to `n % 10 + 2`) do not apply. Therefore, the state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is 100000, `change` is 1000000, `nom` contains 12 elements (after appending `x`), `res` is 99999, `res_` is 10, and `x` is 999998.**
