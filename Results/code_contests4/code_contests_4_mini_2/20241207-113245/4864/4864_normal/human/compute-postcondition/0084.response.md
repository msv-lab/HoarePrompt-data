According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `x`. The loop iterates while `x` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 999999. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be decreased by 1. Therefore, `x` will be 999998 at the start of the next iteration. The other variables (`A`, `n`, `change`, `nom`, `res`, `res_`) remain unchanged.

State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is 10000, `change` is 10000, `nom` is a list containing 3 elements, the output is "10000 2", printed output is "1 9", `res` is 9999, `res_` is 1, `x` is 999998, for the loop to execute a second time `x` must be greater than 0**
