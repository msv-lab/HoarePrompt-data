Postcondition: ***`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5. If `n` is 10000, `change` is updated to 10000, `nom` becomes a list containing 2 elements, the output is "10000 2", printed output is "1 9", `res` is 9999, `res_` is 1, and `x` is 999999. Otherwise, if `n` is greater than 100 but less than or equal to 100000, then if 10000 < `n` ≤ 100000, `n` is set to 100000, `change` remains 1000000, `nom` contains 10 elements, `res` is 99999, `res_` is 10, and `x` is 999992.***
