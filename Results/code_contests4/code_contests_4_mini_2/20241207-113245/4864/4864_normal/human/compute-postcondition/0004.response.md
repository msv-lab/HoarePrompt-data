According to the code, the for loop is set to iterate from 1000000 down to 1 (exclusive). The loop will execute regardless of the values of `A`, `n`, `change`, or `nom`, as the for loop depends solely on the range specified. 

However, we need to acknowledge the state before the loop starts. Since the loop will begin with `x` set to 1000000 on the first iteration, we need to ensure that `x` can be initialized correctly.

Thus, for the loop to be executed the first time:
- `x` will be 1000000 (the starting point of the range).

State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^5, `n` is an input integer within that range and `n` is less than or equal to 10, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is [1], `x` is 1000000**
