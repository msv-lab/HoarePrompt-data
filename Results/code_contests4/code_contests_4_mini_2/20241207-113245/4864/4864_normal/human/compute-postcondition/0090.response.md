According to the code, the loop iterates from `999999` down to `1`, decrementing `x` by `1` in each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is `999998`. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be decremented. 

So, at the start of the next iteration, `x` will be `999997`. The range for the loop is still valid since it will execute as long as `x` is greater than `0`.

State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is 10000, `change` is 10000, `nom` is a list containing 4 elements, `res` is 9999, `res_` is 1, `x` is 999997**
