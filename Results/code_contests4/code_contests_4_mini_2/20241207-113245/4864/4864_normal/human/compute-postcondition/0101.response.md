The code prints a string that concatenates the value of `change` and the integer `2`. The previous values of the affected variables are `change` is `100000` and the integer `2` is directly used. The output of the print statement will be the string "100000 2".

Output State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is an input integer larger than 100 and within the specified ranges; `change` is `100000`; `nom` is [1]; `n` is equal to 100000; output is "100000 2".**
