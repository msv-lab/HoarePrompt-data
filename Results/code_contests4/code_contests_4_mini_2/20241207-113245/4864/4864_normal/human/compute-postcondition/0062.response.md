The variable `nom` has 11 elements, and the code appends the value of `x` (which is 999997) to `nom`. However, since the length of `nom` is already 11, it does not meet the conditions for breaking out of the most internal loop, as it is neither equal to 10 nor equal to `n % 10 + 2`. Therefore, the length of `nom` will increase to 12 after the append operation.

Thus, the Output State is: `A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^5, `n` is an integer larger than 100 and within the range of 100 to 1000, `change` is 1000000, `nom` has 12 elements, `res` is between 98 and 999, `res_` is between 1000 and 10101, and `x` is 999997.

Output State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^5, `n` is an integer larger than 100 and within the range of 100 to 1000, `change` is 1000000, `nom` has 12 elements, `res` is between 98 and 999, `res_` is between 1000 and 10101, and `x` is 999997.**
