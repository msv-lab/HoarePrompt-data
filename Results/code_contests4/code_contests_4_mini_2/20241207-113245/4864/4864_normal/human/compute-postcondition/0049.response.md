Postcondition: ***`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^5, `n` is an integer larger than 100 and within the range of 100 to 1000, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list with exactly 10 elements and `res` is between 98 and 999, `res_` is between 1000 and 10101, and `x` will start at 999999 and decrement to 1 if the length of `nom` is 10. If the length of `nom` is not equal to 10, then it is either not equal to `n % 10 + 2` or it is, in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
