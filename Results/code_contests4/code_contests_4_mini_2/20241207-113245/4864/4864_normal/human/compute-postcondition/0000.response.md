`n` is assigned the value `int(sys.stdin.readline().rstrip('\n'))`, where `sys.stdin.readline()` reads a line of input and `rstrip('\n')` removes the newline character. The input will be converted to an integer, and this will assign a specific integer value to `n`. Since the initial state specifies that `A` is a single integer within the range 1 to 100,000, `n` will also be a single integer within that range based on the input provided. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^5; `n` is an input integer within that range.**
