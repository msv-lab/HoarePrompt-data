`res` is assigned the value of `n - n % 10 - 1`. Given that `n` is 10000, we first calculate `n % 10`, which is 0. Thus, the calculation becomes `10000 - 0 - 1`, resulting in `res` being equal to 9999. The values of `A`, `change`, `nom`, and the printed outputs remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is 10000; `change` is 10000; `nom` is [1]; the output is "10000 2"; printed output is "1 9"; `res` is 9999.
