To determine the output state, we first analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet.

Initial State:
- `A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^5
- `n` is an input integer within that range and is larger than 10 (10 < n ≤ 100)
- `change` is 1000000
- `nom` is [1]

Now, we evaluate the code:
```
res = n - n % 10 - 1
```

Step by Step:
1. The expression `n % 10` computes the remainder of `n` when divided by 10, which effectively gives us the last digit of `n`.
2. Subtracting this last digit from `n` removes the unit place, resulting in the largest multiple of 10 that is less than or equal to `n`.
3. Finally, we subtract 1 from that result, which gives us the largest integer that is one less than that multiple of 10.

Given the constraints for `n` (between 11 and 100), the output will depend on the specific value of `n`. However, since `n` is an input integer that is guaranteed to be greater than 10 and less than or equal to 100, `res` will take on a calculated value based on the specific input.

Thus, the output state is dependent on `n` but can be generalized as follows:

Output State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^5; `n` is an input integer (11 ≤ n ≤ 100); `change` is 1000000; `nom` is [1]; `res` is calculated as `n - n % 10 - 1`.**
