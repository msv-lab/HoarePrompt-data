According to the code, the loop iterates from `999999` down to `1` (inclusive), meaning it will execute as long as `x` is greater than `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is `999998`. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` will be decreased by `1`, resulting in `x` being `999997` for the next iteration. 

Since the loop continues until `x` reaches `0`, it can still execute again as `x` is currently `999998` and will be `999997` in the next iteration.

State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is 100000, `change` is 1000000, `nom` contains 12 elements (after appending `x`), `res` is 99999, `res_` is 10, and `x` is 999997 for the loop to execute a second time.**
