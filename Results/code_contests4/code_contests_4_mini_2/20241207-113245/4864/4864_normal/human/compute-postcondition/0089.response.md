The code `nom.append(x)` adds the value of `x` to the list `nom`. The current value of `x` is 999998. Since the initial state does not provide the length of `nom`, we cannot determine if the length conditions for breaking out of the loop are met. However, the execution of the append operation does not change any other variables.

Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is 10000, `change` is 10000, `nom` is a list containing 3 elements plus the newly appended value, `res` is 9999, `res_` is 1, `x` is 999998.

Output State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is 10000, `change` is 10000, `nom` is a list containing 4 elements, `res` is 9999, `res_` is 1, `x` is 999998**
