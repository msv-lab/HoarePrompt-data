Output State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^5; `n` is an input integer (11 ≤ n ≤ 100); `change` is 1000000; `nom` is a list of integers containing 10 elements and now `nom` has 11 elements including `x`, where `x` is 999999; `res` is between 10 and 99; `res_` is between 10101 and 100000; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
