`nom` is a list containing 4 elements, and `x` is 999997. The code appends `x` to `nom`, which increases the length of `nom` to 5. Since the length of `nom` is not 10, and it is not equal to `n % 10 + 2` (which is 2), no break occurs. Therefore, the output state reflects the new length of `nom` and the value appended. 

Output State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is 10000, `change` is 10000, `nom` is a list containing 5 elements, `res` is 9999, `res_` is 1, `x` is 999997.**
