According to the code, the loop iterates from `999999` down to `1`. The current state indicates that `x` is `999999` at the end of the last iteration. For the loop to execute again, `x` needs to be decremented. 

At the end of the last iteration:
- `x` is `999999`.

The loop will decrement `x` by `1` for the next iteration. Therefore, `x` will become `999998`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `x` must be `999998`.

State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is 100000, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing 11 elements (after appending `x`), `res` is 99999, `res_` is 10, and `x` is 999998.**
