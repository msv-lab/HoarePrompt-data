To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the `for` loop to execute, we need to analyze the loop structure and the initial state of the variables provided.

The loop is defined as:
```
for x in range(1000000 - 1, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```
This means that the loop will iterate starting from `999999` down to `1`. The loop will execute as long as `x` is greater than `0`.

Now, let's evaluate the provided state:
- `A` is a single integer such that \(1 \leq A \leq 10^5\).
- `n` is an integer larger than `100` and within the range of `100` to `1000`.
- `change` is `1000000`.
- `nom` is a list containing two elements: `1` and `res_`.
- `res` is between `98` and `999`.
- `res_` is between `1000` and `10101`.

The loop's execution does not depend on the values of `A`, `n`, `change`, `nom`, `res`, or `res_` directly. The loop will execute based solely on the range provided in the `for` statement.

The important point here is that the loop is set to execute when `x` starts at `999999` and decrements until `x` is `1`. Since the range is correctly defined, the loop will execute as expected.

Thus, there are no specific adjustments needed for the loop to execute, as the current state already allows for the loop to run properly.

State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^5, `n` is an integer larger than 100 and within the range of 100 to 1000, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is [1, res_], `res` is between 98 and 999, `res_` is between 1000 and 10101, for the loop to execute `x` will start at 999999 and decrement to 1**
