Postcondition: ***`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5. If `n` is less than or equal to 10, then `nom` contains the values [1, 1000000, 999999, 999998, 999997, 999996, 999995, 999994, 999993, 999992] if `n` is 10, otherwise `nom` contains the values [1, 1000000, 999999, ..., 1000000 - (n - 1)]. If `n` is between 11 and 100, then `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list of integers containing 10 elements, `res` is between 10 and 99, and `res_` is between 10101 and 100000. If `n` is between 101 and 1000, `change` remains 1000000, `nom` has at most 11 elements with the last element being either 999990 or 999989, `res` is between 98 and 999, and `res_` is between 1000 and 10101. If `n` is exactly 10000, then `change` is updated to 10000, `nom` contains 2 elements, the output is "10000 2", printed output is "1 9", `res` is 9999, `res_` is 1, and `x` is 999999. If `n` is greater than 100 but less than or equal to 100000, and if 10000 < `n` ≤ 100000, then `n` is set to 100000, `change` remains 1000000, `nom` contains 10 elements, `res` is 99999, `res_` is 10, and `x` is 999992.***
