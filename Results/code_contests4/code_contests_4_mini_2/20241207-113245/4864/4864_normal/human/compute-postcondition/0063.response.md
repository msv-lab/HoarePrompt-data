After analyzing the loop code and the initial state, the loop will continue to execute until either `nom` has exactly 10 elements or `nom` has `n % 10 + 2` elements. Given that `n` is larger than 100 and at most 1000, `n % 10` can take values from 0 to 9, meaning `n % 10 + 2` can range from 2 to 11. 

Since the loop starts with `nom` containing 2 elements (1 and `res_`), it will append values until either of the break conditions is met. 

1. If `nom` reaches 10 elements, the loop will stop since the first condition in the loop will be fulfilled.
2. If `nom` reaches `n % 10 + 2` elements, which can be at most 11, the second condition will also cause the loop to terminate.

Thus, the maximum number of elements `nom` can achieve is 11. Additionally, since the loop appends values from `x`, starting from 999999 down to 1, the last value appended will depend on how many iterations the loop runs.

Given the constraints:
- If `nom` reaches 10 elements, the last appended value will be `999990` (i.e., the first 9 decremented values from 999999).
- If `nom` reaches 11 elements, the last appended value will be `999989`.

Since the loop will continue until it meets one of the break conditions, and considering the values of `n` can affect the number of iterations, we can conclude that in the final state:

- If the loop breaks due to `nom` having 10 elements, `nom` will have exactly 10 elements, with the last value being `999990`.
- If the loop breaks due to `nom` having `n % 10 + 2` (11 elements), `nom` will have exactly 11 elements, with the last value being `999989`.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the final state of `nom` based on these conditions. 

Output State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^5, `n` is an integer larger than 100 and within the range of 100 to 1000, `change` is 1000000, `nom` has at most 11 elements with the last element being either 999990 or 999989 depending on the break condition, `res` is between 98 and 999, `res_` is between 1000 and 10101.**
