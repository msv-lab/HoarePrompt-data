According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range defined in the `for` loop. The loop is set to iterate over the range from 999999 down to 1 (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, the value of `x` is 999999. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `x` must be decremented by 1.

Since `x` is currently 999999, on the next iteration it will be 999998. The loop will continue to execute until `x` reaches 1, which means the loop can execute a total of 999999 times starting from 999999 down to 1.

State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^5; `n` is an input integer (11 ≤ n ≤ 100); `change` is 1000000; `nom` is a list of integers containing 10 elements and now `nom` has 11 elements including `x`, where `x` is 999998; `res` is between 10 and 99; `res_` is between 10101 and 100000; for the loop to execute a second time `x` must be 999998.**
