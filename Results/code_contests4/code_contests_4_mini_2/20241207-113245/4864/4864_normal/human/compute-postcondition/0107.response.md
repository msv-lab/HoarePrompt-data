`nom` is updated by appending the value of `res_`, which is 10, to the list `nom`. The previous value of `nom` is [1], so after the operation, `nom` will become [1, 10]. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is 100000; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is [1, 10]; `res` is 99999; `res_` is 10**
