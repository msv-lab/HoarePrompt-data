The code snippet executes a print statement that concatenates the string representation of `change` and the string representation of the number 2, separated by a space. The value of `change` is 10000, so the output will be the string "10000 2". The other variables `A` and `n` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^5; `n` is 10000; `change` is 10000; `nom` is [1]; output is "10000 2".**
