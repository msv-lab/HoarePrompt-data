In this code snippet, `x` is currently at `999999`, and `nom` has exactly 10 elements. The operation `nom.append(x)` will add the value of `x` to the list `nom`. However, since `nom` already has 10 elements, appending an additional element will not be allowed in most contexts, as it typically exceeds the expected length of the list.

As a result, there will be no change to `nom`, and the values of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^5, `n` is an integer larger than 100 and within the range of 100 to 1000, `change` is 1000000, `nom` has exactly 10 elements, `res` is between 98 and 999, `res_` is between 1000 and 10101, and `x` is 999999 while attempting to append to `nom`.

Output State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^5, `n` is an integer larger than 100 and within the range of 100 to 1000, `change` is 1000000, `nom` has exactly 10 elements, `res` is between 98 and 999, `res_` is between 1000 and 10101, `x` is 999999 while attempting to append to `nom`.**
