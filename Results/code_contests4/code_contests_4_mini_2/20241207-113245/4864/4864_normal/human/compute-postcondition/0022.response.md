`nom` is a list that initially contains the value [1]. The code appends the value of `res_` to the list `nom`. Since `res_` is between 10101 and 100000, the new value that will be appended to `nom` is within that range. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^5; `n` is an input integer (11 ≤ n ≤ 100); `change` is 1000000; `nom` is [1, res_]; `res` is between 10 and 99; `res_` is between 10101 and 100000.

Output State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^5; `n` is an input integer (11 ≤ n ≤ 100); `change` is 1000000; `nom` is [1, res_]; `res` is between 10 and 99; `res_` is between 10101 and 100000.**
