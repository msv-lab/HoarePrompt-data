The variable `res_` is assigned the value of `change // res`. Given that `change` is 1000000 and `res` is calculated as `n - n % 10 - 1`, we can evaluate `res` based on the value of `n`. Since `n` is an input integer between 11 and 100, `res` will take values ranging from 10 to 99. The exact value of `res` depends on the specific input for `n`.

For example, if `n` is 11, then:
- `res = 11 - 11 % 10 - 1 = 10`

If `n` is 100, then:
- `res = 100 - 100 % 10 - 1 = 99`

Thus, `res` will range between 10 and 99, leading to `res_` being calculated as follows:
- For `res = 10`, `res_ = 1000000 // 10 = 100000`
- For `res = 99`, `res_ = 1000000 // 99 ≈ 10101`

Therefore, the output state will reflect the range of possible values for `res_` depending on the input integer `n`.

Output State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^5; `n` is an input integer (11 ≤ n ≤ 100); `change` is 1000000; `nom` is [1]; `res` is between 10 and 99; `res_` is between 10101 and 100000.**
