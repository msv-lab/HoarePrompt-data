Postcondition: ***`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is an input integer within that range and `n` is less than or equal to 10, `nom` has a length of less than `n`, and `x` is 999998. If the length of `nom` is equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop. Otherwise, the loop continues to execute.***
