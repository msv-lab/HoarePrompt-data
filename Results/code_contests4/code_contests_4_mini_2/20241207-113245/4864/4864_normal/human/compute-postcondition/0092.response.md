The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is 10000, `change` is 10000, `nom` is a list containing 4 elements, `res` is 9999, `res_` is 1, `x` is 999997 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
