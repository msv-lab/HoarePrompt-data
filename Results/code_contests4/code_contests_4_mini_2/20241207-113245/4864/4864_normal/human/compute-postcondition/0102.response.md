The code executes a print statement that concatenates two string representations of integers. The values being printed are `1` and `9`. The variables `A`, `n`, `change`, and `nom` are not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is an input integer larger than 100 and within the specified ranges; `change` is `100000`; `nom` is [1]; `n` is equal to 100000; output is "100000 2"; printed output is "1 9".

Output State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is an input integer larger than 100 and within the specified ranges; `change` is `100000`; `nom` is [1]; `n` is equal to 100000; output is "100000 2"; printed output is "1 9".**
