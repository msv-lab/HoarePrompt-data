The variable `res` is assigned the value of `n - n % 10 - 1`. The value of `n` is larger than 100 and within the range of 100 to 1000, which means `n` can take on values like 101, 200, 999, etc. 

Calculating `res`, we can see that:
- `n % 10` gives the remainder when `n` is divided by 10, which ranges from 0 to 9 depending on the last digit of `n`.
- Subtracting `n % 10` from `n` gives us the largest multiple of 10 that is less than or equal to `n`.
- Then, we subtract 1 from that result.

Therefore, `res` will be the largest multiple of 10 less than `n`, minus 1. 

Since `n` is an integer in the given range, the output state can be described generally as:
- `A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^5
- `n` is an integer larger than 100 and within the range of 100 to 1000
- `change` is 1000000
- `nom` is [1]
- `res` will be calculated as described.

Output State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^5; `n` is an integer larger than 100 and within the range of 100 to 1000; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is [1]; `res` is calculated as `n - n % 10 - 1`.**
