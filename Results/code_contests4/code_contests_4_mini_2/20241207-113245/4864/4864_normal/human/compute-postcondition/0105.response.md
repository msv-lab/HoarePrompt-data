The variable `res` is assigned the value of the expression `n - n % 10 - 1`. Here, `n` is an input integer larger than 100 and within the specified ranges. The operation `n % 10` gives the remainder when `n` is divided by 10, which is subtracted from `n`, and then 1 is further subtracted from that result. 

Since the conditions for the output state indicate that if `n` is 100000, the output is "100000 2", we can infer that `n` is indeed 100000 in this case. Therefore:

- `n % 10` equals `0` (since 100000 is divisible by 10).
- Thus, `n - n % 10 - 1` simplifies to `100000 - 0 - 1`, which results in `99999`.

The states of the other variables (`A`, `change`, `nom`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is 100000; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is [1]; `res` is 99999**
