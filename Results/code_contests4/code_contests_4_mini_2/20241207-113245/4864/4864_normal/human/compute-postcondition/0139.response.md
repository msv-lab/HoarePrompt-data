Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` from input, which is constrained to the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000. Depending on the value of `n`, the function generates a list `nom` and outputs its length and contents. If `n` is 10 or less, `nom` will contain the integers from 1 to 1,000,000 down to a certain value. If `n` is between 11 and 100, `nom` will include a calculated value based on `n` and then fill up to 10 elements. For `n` between 101 and 1000, it behaves similarly but with additional break conditions based on the length of `nom`. If `n` equals 10,000 or 100,000, the function will print specific output and exit. The function does not return a value but prints the result directly. It also handles edge cases for input values at the boundaries of the defined ranges.**
