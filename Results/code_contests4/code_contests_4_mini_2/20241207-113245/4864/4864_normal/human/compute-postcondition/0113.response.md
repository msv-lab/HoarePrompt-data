The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is 100000, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is [1, 10], `res` is 99999, `res_` is 10, the length of `nom` is not equal to 10, and the length of `nom` is equal to `n % 10 + 2`, which is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
