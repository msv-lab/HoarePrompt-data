To analyze the impact of the code snippet provided, we first need to understand the initial state and the variables involved.

Initial State:
- `A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^5
- `n` is an integer larger than 100 and within the range of 100 to 1000
- `change` is 1000000
- `nom` is [1]
- `res` is calculated as `n - n % 10 - 1`

From the information given, `res` is derived from `n`. Since `n` is larger than 100 and less than or equal to 1000, it can be either a three-digit or a two-digit integer.

Now we will calculate `res`:
- `n % 10` gives the remainder when `n` is divided by 10, which is the last digit of `n`.
- Therefore, `res` would be `n - (last digit of n) - 1`, which effectively gives the largest multiple of 10 that is less than `n`.

Next, we calculate `res_`:
- `res_ = change // res` means we are performing integer division of `change` by `res`.

Since we do not have specific values for `n`, we can summarize the output based on the calculations:

- `res` would be a value that is a multiple of 10 and is less than `n`.
- `change` is 1000000, and thus `res_` will be calculated as `1000000 // res`.

However, we will acknowledge that `res` will be dependent on the specific value of `n`, which is between 100 and 1000.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the calculations done on `res` and `res_` without specific numerical outputs since `n` is not specified. 

Output State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^5; `n` is an integer larger than 100 and within the range of 100 to 1000; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is [1]; `res` is calculated as `n - n % 10 - 1`; `res_` is calculated as `change // res`.**
