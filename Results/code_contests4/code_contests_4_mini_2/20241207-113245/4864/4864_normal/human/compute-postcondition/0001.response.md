The value of `change` is assigned the constant value of 1000000. The variables `A` and `n` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^5; `n` is an input integer within that range; `change` is 1000000.

Output State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^5; `n` is an input integer within that range; `change` is 1000000**.
