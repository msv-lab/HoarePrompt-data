The code `exit(0)` is executed, which terminates the program immediately with a status code of 0. This means that there is no change to the values of the variables `change` and `len(nom)`, nor is there any output generated from the program. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`change` is 1000000, `len(nom)` is 10, and the output is a space-separated string of the string representations of the 10 elements in `nom`, and the program has exited.**
