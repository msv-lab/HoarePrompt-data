Postcondition: ***`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is 10000, `change` is 10000, `nom` is a list containing 3 elements, the output is "10000 2", printed output is "1 9", `res` is 9999, `res_` is 1, `x` is 999998, and if the length of `nom` is equal to `n % 10 + 2`, we break out of the most internal loop.***
