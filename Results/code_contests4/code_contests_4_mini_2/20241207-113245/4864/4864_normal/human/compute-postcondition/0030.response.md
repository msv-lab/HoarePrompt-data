Postcondition: ***`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^5; `n` is an input integer (11 ≤ n ≤ 100); `change` is 1000000; `nom` has 11 elements including `x` which is 999998; `res` is between 10 and 99; `res_` is between 10101 and 100000; if the length of `nom` is 10, the most internal loop is exited.***
