Output State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is an input integer within that range and `n` is less than or equal to 10; `nom` contains the values [1, 1000000, 999999, 999998, 999997, 999996, 999995, 999994, 999993, 999992] if `n` is 10, and if `n` is less than 10, `nom` contains the values [1, 1000000, 999999, ..., 1000000 - (n - 1)].**
