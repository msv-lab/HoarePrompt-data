The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^5; `n` is an input integer (11 ≤ n ≤ 100); `change` is 1000000; `nom` has 12 elements including `x` which is 1; `res` is between 10 and 99; `res_` is between 10101 and 100000 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
