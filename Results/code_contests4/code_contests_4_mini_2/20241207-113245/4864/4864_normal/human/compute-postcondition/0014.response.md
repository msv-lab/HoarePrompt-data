The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^5, `n` is an input integer within that range and `n` is less than or equal to 10, `nom` has a length of less than `n`, `x` is 999998, and we break out of the most internal loop.
