The line of code `nom.append(res_)` appends the value of `res_` to the list `nom`. The previous value of `res_` is 1, so after executing this line, the list `nom` will now contain the values [1, 1]. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is 10000; `change` is 10000; `nom` is [1, 1]; the output is "10000 2"; printed output is "1 9"; `res` is 9999; `res_` is 1.
