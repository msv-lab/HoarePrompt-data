The code appends `x` (which is 999998) to the list `nom`. Since `nom` already has 11 elements, adding another element will increase its length to 12. However, the condition states that if the length of `nom` is 10, the most internal loop is exited. Given that `nom` already exceeds this length, there is no exit from the loop based on this condition.

Therefore, the output state reflects the updated length of `nom`, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^5; `n` is an input integer (11 ≤ n ≤ 100); `change` is 1000000; `nom` has 12 elements including `x` which is 999998; `res` is between 10 and 99; `res_` is between 10101 and 100000.**
