According to the code, the loop is set to execute for values of `x` starting from 999999 down to 1. At the end of the last iteration, `x` must be 1 for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, the state of `x` will be decremented by 1. 

For the loop to execute again, `x` will be 0, which is not within the range specified by the loop condition. Thus, the loop will not execute again since the next value of `x` will not satisfy the loop condition of being greater than 0.

State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^5; `n` is an input integer (11 ≤ n ≤ 100); `change` is 1000000; `nom` has 12 elements including `x` which is 1; `res` is between 10 and 99; `res_` is between 10101 and 100000.**
