The code `nom.append(x)` adds the value of `x` (which is 999998) to the list `nom`. Given that `nom` already has exactly 10 elements, the length condition for breaking out of the most internal loop is satisfied. Therefore, even though `nom` will now have 11 elements after the append operation, the condition for breaking out of the loop is already fulfilled.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^5, `n` is an integer larger than 100 and within the range of 100 to 1000, `change` is 1000000, `nom` now has 11 elements (previously 10), `res` is between 98 and 999, `res_` is between 1000 and 10101, and `x` is 999998 and we break out of the most internal loop.
