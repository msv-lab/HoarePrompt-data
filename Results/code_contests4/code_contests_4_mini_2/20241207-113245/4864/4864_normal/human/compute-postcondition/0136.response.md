The `print` function outputs a string created by joining elements of `nom` with a space. The `map` function converts each element of `nom` to a string, and `list` collects these string values. The length of `nom` is given as 10, which indicates there are 10 elements in it. The value of `change` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `change` is 1000000, `len(nom)` is 10, and the output is a space-separated string of the string representations of the 10 elements in `nom`.

Output State: **`change` is 1000000, `len(nom)` is 10, and the output is a space-separated string of the string representations of the 10 elements in `nom`**.
