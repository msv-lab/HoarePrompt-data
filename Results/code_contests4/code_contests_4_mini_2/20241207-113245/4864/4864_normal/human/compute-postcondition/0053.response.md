The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^5, `n` is an integer larger than 100 and within the range of 100 to 1000, `change` is 1000000, `nom` has exactly 10 elements, `res` is between 98 and 999, `res_` is between 1000 and 10101, `x` is 999998 and we break out of the most internal loop.
