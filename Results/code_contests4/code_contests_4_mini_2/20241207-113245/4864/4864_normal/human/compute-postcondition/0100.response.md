The variable `change` is assigned the value `100000`. The previous value of `change` was `1000000`, so after execution, `change` is now `100000`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is an input integer larger than 100 and within the specified ranges; `change` is `100000`; `nom` is [1]; `n` is equal to 100000.
