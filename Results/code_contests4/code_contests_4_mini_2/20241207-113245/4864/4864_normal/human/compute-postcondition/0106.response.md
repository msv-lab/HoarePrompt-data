`res_` is assigned the value of `change // res`, where `change` is 1000000 and `res` is 99999. Performing the integer division gives us `res_ = 1000000 // 99999`, which equals 10 (since 1000000 divided by 99999 is approximately 10.001, and integer division truncates the decimal). The states of the other variables (`A`, `n`, `change`, `nom`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is 100000; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is [1]; `res` is 99999; `res_` is 10.

Output State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is 100000; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is [1]; `res` is 99999; `res_` is 10**
