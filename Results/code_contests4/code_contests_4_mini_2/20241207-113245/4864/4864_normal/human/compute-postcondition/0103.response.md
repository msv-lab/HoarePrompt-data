The `exit(0)` command is executed, which terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables `A`, `n`, `change`, `nom`, and `output` do not change, but the program stops running, and no further computation occurs. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of these variables before the program exits.

Output State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5; `n` is an input integer larger than 100 and within the specified ranges; `change` is `100000`; `nom` is [1]; `n` is equal to 100000; output is "100000 2"; printed output is "1 9" and the program exits.**
