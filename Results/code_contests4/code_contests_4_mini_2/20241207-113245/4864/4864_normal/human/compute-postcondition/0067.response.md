The variable `change` is assigned the value 10000. The previous value of `change` was 1000000, so after execution, `change` is now 10000. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^5; `n` is 10000; `change` is 10000; `nom` is [1].

Output State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^5; `n` is 10000; `change` is 10000; `nom` is [1]**
