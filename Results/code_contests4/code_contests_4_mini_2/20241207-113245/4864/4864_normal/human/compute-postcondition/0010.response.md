The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^5, `n` is an input integer within that range and `n` is less than or equal to 10, `nom` has not yet reached a length of `n`, `x` is 999999, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
