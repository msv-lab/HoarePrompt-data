Since `nom` has a length of less than `n`, the statement `nom.append(x)` will add the value of `x` (which is 999998) to the list `nom`. The length of `nom` will then increase by 1. However, since we have not reached the length of `n` yet, the loop will continue to execute.

The output state reflects that `nom` now contains one additional element (999998), and the loop continues to execute as the length of `nom` is still less than `n`.

Output State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is an input integer within that range and `n` is less than or equal to 10, `nom` now has a length of less than `n` plus 1, containing the value 999998, and the loop continues to execute.**
