After executing the code `nom.append(x)`, the value of `x`, which is `999997`, is appended to the list `nom`. The initial state indicates that `nom` originally contains 12 elements. Therefore, after appending `x`, the length of `nom` becomes 13. 

Next, we check the conditions:
1. If the length of `nom` equals 10, we would break out of the most internal loop. This condition is false since the length is 13.
2. If the length of `nom` equals `n % 10 + 2`, we need to calculate `n % 10 + 2`. Since `n` is `100000`, `n % 10` equals `0`, so `n % 10 + 2` equals `2`. This condition is also false since 13 does not equal 2.

Since neither condition for breaking out of the loop is met, we do not break out of the most internal loop.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5,
- `n` is 100000,
- `change` is 1000000,
- `nom` contains 13 elements after appending `x`,
- `res` is 99999,
- `res_` is 10,
- `x` is 999997,
- and we do not break out of the most internal loop.

Output State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is 100000, `change` is 1000000, `nom` contains 13 elements after appending `x`, `res` is 99999, `res_` is 10, `x` is 999997, and we do not break out of the most internal loop.**
