The code snippet `exit(0)` is a command that terminates the program execution immediately. The values of the variables remain unchanged because the program exits before any modifications can occur. Therefore, the output state remains as it is before the execution of the `exit` statement. 

Output State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^5; `n` is 10000; `change` is 10000; `nom` is [1]; `output` is "10000 2"; printed output is "1 9".**
