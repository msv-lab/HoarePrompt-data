Postcondition: ***`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^5, `n` is an integer larger than 100 and within the range of 100 to 1000, `change` is 1000000, `nom` has 11 elements, `res` is between 98 and 999, `res_` is between 1000 and 10101, and `x` is 999997. If the length of `nom` equals 10, we break out of the most internal loop. Otherwise, if the length of `nom` equals `n % 10 + 2`, we also break out of the most internal loop.***
