Postcondition: ***`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is 100000, `change` is 1000000, `nom` contains 12 elements (after appending `x`), `res` is 99999, `res_` is 10, and `x` is 999997. If the length of `nom` equals 10, we break out of the most internal loop. Otherwise, if the length of `nom` equals `n % 10 + 2`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop.***
