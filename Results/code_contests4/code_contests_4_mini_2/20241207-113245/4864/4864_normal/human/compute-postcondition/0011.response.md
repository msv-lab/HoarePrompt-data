Postcondition: ***`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^5, `n` is an input integer within that range and `n` is less than or equal to 10, `nom` has not yet reached a length of `n`, `x` is 999999. If the length of `nom` equals `n`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
