The code appends the value of `x` (which is 999999) to the list `nom`. In the initial state, `nom` has either 10 elements or 2 elements; however, since the length of `nom` is 2 (as per the condition leading to breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement), the new state of `nom` after appending will contain 3 elements. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is 10000, `change` is 10000, `nom` is a list containing 3 elements, the output is "10000 2", printed output is "1 9", `res` is 9999, `res_` is 1, `x` is 999999, and the condition for breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement is satisfied.**
