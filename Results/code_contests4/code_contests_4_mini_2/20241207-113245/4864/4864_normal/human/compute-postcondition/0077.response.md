The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is a single integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 10^5, `n` is 10000, `change` is 10000, `nom` is [1, 1], the output is "10000 2", printed output is "1 9", `res` is 9999, `res_` is 1, `x` is 999999, and the length of `nom` is 10, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
