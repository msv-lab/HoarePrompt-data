Correctness: **False**

The program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. The key issues are as follows:

1. **Input Handling**: The program is supposed to generate a test case for a given integer `A`, which represents the desired number of ways to make change. However, the program does not generate a variety of outputs based on different values of `A`. Instead, it uses predefined logic based on the range of `n` (which is derived from `A`), but it does not ensure that the output corresponds to the desired number of ways specified by `A`.

2. **Output Format**: The output should consist of an amount of change `N` and the number of denominations `M`, followed by the denominations themselves. While the program does output `change` and the length of `nom`, it does not guarantee that the denominations will produce the specified number of ways to make change.

3. **Inadequate Test Case Generation**: The manner in which denominations are generated is hardcoded and does not consider the combinatorial aspect of generating different ways to make change. The problem requires producing a test case that has exactly `A` ways to achieve the specified change, but the program's logic does not ensure this. For example, hardcoded values or patterns may not yield the required number of combinations for various inputs.

4. **Failure for Edge Cases**: The program has specific cases for when `n` equals certain values (like `10000` or `100000`), but it does not generalize well to other values of `A`, leading to a lack of robustness in generating valid test cases for the entire range of possible inputs.

For all these reasons, the program does not correctly adhere to the requirements of the problem description, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
