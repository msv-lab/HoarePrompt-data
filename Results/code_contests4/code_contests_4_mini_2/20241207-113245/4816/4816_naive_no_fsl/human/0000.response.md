To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze the requirements and the logic implemented in the code.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to find the one episode Polycarpus has not watched from a total of `n` episodes, given he has watched `n-1` distinct episodes. 

### Code Analysis
The relevant part of the code is the function `func_1(N, NUMBERS)`, which takes:
- `N`: the total number of episodes.
- `NUMBERS`: a string of watched episode numbers.

1. The code reads `n` and splits `NUMBERS` into a list of integers.
2. It asserts that the length of `numbers` is `n-1` (i.e., `n == len(numbers) + 1`).
3. It calculates the sum of the watched episodes and computes the missing episode number using the formula for the sum of the first `n` natural numbers:
   \[
   \text{missing\_episode} = \frac{n \cdot (n + 1)}{2} - \text{sum}
   \]
4. It prints the missing episode.

### Edge Cases and Issues
1. **Input Type Handling**: The function takes `N` as a string, which is converted to an integer. If `N` is not a valid integer string, it would raise a ValueError, but this is not checked.
2. **Assertions**: The assertion `assert n + 0 == len(numbers) + 1` could be problematic if the input does not adhere to the problem constraints (e.g., `len(numbers)` being less than `n-1`), which would raise an AssertionError and stop execution without a proper error message.
3. **Negative Episodes**: The code does not handle cases where the input list might contain invalid episode numbers (e.g., numbers outside the range `1 to n`), although the problem states that all values of `ai` are distinct and within the bounds.
4. **Input Reading**: The method `raw_input()` is used, which is not compatible with Python 3 (it should be `input()`). This would lead to a runtime error if executed in a Python 3 environment.

### Conclusion
The implementation has several points of failure:
- It relies on assertions that could cause termination without handling erroneous input gracefully.
- It does not check for input validity (e.g., negative numbers, out of bound values).
- It uses Python 2 syntax that would fail in Python 3.

Given these issues, we can conclude that the program does not correctly handle all potential cases as required by the problem description.

Correctness: **False** 

### Example of Failure
For an input like:
```
10
3 8 10 1 7 9 6 5 -2
```
The function would incorrectly process the `-2` as a valid episode number leading to incorrect output or runtime error if executed.
