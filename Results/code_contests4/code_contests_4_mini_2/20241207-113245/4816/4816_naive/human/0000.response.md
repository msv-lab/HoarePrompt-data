To analyze the given Python program based on the problem description, we need to verify if it correctly identifies the episode that Polycarpus hasn't watched.

The program does the following:
1. It reads an integer `n`, which represents the total number of episodes.
2. It reads the watched episodes, which are `n - 1` distinct integers.
3. It computes the missing episode by calculating the difference between the sum of the first `n` natural numbers and the sum of the watched episodes.

Let's break down the analysis:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The first input line reads the total number of episodes `n`.
   - The second input line reads `n - 1` integers that represent the watched episodes.

2. **Computation**:
   - The program correctly uses the formula for the sum of the first `n` integers: \( \text{sum} = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).
   - It then computes the sum of the watched episodes and finds the missing episode by subtracting this sum from the total sum.

3. **Edge Cases**: 
   - The program assumes that the input is well-formed and that the watched episodes are distinct and within the range of 1 to n.
   - The program does not handle cases where the input might be invalid, such as if `n` is less than 2 or if the list of episodes doesn't conform to the expected length of `n - 1`.

4. **Potential Failure Case**:
   - If the input is not correctly formatted, such as if fewer than `n - 1` episodes are provided or if an episode number is out of the bounds `1` to `n`, the program will fail.
   - Additionally, the program uses `raw_input()` which is not compatible with Python 3. If the program is intended for Python 3, it should use `input()` instead.

Therefore, considering that the program does not handle potential input errors or invalid cases, the correctness of the program is compromised.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program could fail with improperly formatted input or in a different Python version context, violating the problem description's requirement for robust handling.
