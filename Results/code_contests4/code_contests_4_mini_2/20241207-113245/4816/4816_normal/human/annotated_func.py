#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer with a value between 2 and 100000, and NUMBERS is a list of n - 1 distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and N.
def func_1(N, NUMBERS):
    n = int(N)
    numbers = [int(s) for s in NUMBERS.split(' ')]
    sum = 0
    for num in numbers:
        sum += num
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is an integer between 2 and 100000, `n` is equal to `N`, `sum` is equal to the sum of all integers in `numbers`, `numbers` is a list of integers parsed from the string `NUMBERS`.
    sys.stdout.write(str(int(n * (n + 1) / 2 - sum)) + '\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `N` (between 2 and 100000) and a string `NUMBERS` that represents a list of `n - 1` distinct integers (where each integer is between 1 and `N`). It calculates the sum of these integers and then computes the difference between the total sum of integers from 1 to `N` and the calculated sum. The result is printed to standard output, representing the missing integer that is not included in `NUMBERS`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result.
