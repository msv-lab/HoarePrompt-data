The function accepts an integer `N` (between 2 and 100000) and a string `NUMBERS` that represents a list of `n - 1` distinct integers (where each integer is between 1 and `N`). It calculates the sum of these integers and then computes the difference between the total sum of integers from 1 to `N` and the calculated sum. The result is printed to standard output, representing the missing integer that is not included in `NUMBERS`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result.
