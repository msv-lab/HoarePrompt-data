To analyze the impact of the code snippet provided, we need to break down the components involved:

1. `n` is equal to `N`, and since `N` is an integer between 2 and 100000, `n` takes on the same value as `N`.
2. The variable `sum` is equal to the sum of all integers in the list `numbers`, which is parsed from the string `NUMBERS`.
3. The expression `int(n * (n + 1) / 2 - sum)` calculates the difference between the sum of the first `n` integers and the sum of the `numbers` list.

The code writes the result of this calculation to standard output. 

Now, we can summarize the output based on the given initial state and the computation performed by the code:

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 100000; `n` is equal to `N`; `sum` is equal to the sum of all integers in `numbers`; the output is the result of `int(n * (n + 1) / 2 - sum)` printed to standard output.**
