`sum` is incremented by the value of `num`, which is the first integer in the list `numbers`. The previous value of `sum` is 0, so after execution, `sum` will be equal to `num`. The values of `N`, `n`, and `numbers` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 100000, `n` is equal to `N`, `sum` is equal to `num`, and `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 100000, `n` is equal to `N`, `sum` is equal to `num`, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer.**
