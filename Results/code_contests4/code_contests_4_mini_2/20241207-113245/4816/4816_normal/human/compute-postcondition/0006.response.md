`sum` is assigned the value of `sum + num`. The value of `sum` was previously equal to `num`, so after execution, `sum` will be equal to `num + num`, which is `2 * num`. The values of `N`, `n`, `numbers`, and `num` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 100000, `n` is equal to `N`, `sum` is equal to `2 * num`, `numbers` is a list of integers, `num` is the second integer in the list.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 100000, `n` is equal to `N`, `sum` is equal to `2 * num`, `numbers` is a list of integers, `num` is the second integer in the list.**
