The variable `sum` is updated by adding the value of `num` to it. The previous value of `sum` is `2 * num`, so after executing the code, `sum` becomes `2 * num + num`, which simplifies to `3 * num`. The values of `N`, `n`, and `numbers` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 100000, `n` is equal to `N`, `sum` is equal to `3 * num`, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, `num` is the third integer in the list.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 100000, `n` is equal to `N`, `sum` is equal to `3 * num`, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, `num` is the third integer in the list.**
