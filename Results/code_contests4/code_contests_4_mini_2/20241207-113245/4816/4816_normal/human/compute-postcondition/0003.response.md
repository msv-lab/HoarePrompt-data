According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `numbers` list. If the list contains at least one integer, the loop will execute. Given that `n` is equal to `N`, which is between 2 and 100000, it is implied that there should be at least 2 integers in `numbers` for the loop to execute.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to confirm that `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 element. After the first iteration, `num` will represent the first integer in the list. 

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 100000, `n` is equal to `N`, `sum` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, and `num` is the first integer in `numbers`**
