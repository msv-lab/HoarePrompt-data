The variable `sum` is assigned the value `0`. This does not affect the other variables `N`, `n`, or `numbers`. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 100000; `n` is equal to `N`; `numbers` is a list of integers parsed from the string `NUMBERS`; `sum` is 0.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 100000; `n` is equal to `N`; `numbers` is a list of integers parsed from the string `NUMBERS`; `sum` is 0**.
