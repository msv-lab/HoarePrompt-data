The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(N)`, where `N` is an integer with a value between 2 and 100000. Since `N` is already an integer, `n` will take the same value as `N`. The state of the other variable `NUMBERS` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 100000; `n` is equal to `N`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 100000; `n` is equal to `N`**
