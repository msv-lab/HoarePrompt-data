The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `N` and `NUMBERS`. The parameter `N` is an integer with a value between 2 and 100000. The parameter `NUMBERS` is a list containing `n - 1` distinct integers, where each integer is between 1 and `N`. The function processes these inputs and returns a specific result based on the values in `NUMBERS`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer N (between 2 and 100000) and a list of distinct integers NUMBERS (with length n - 1, each integer between 1 and N), and processes these inputs to return a specific result based on the integers in NUMBERS.**
