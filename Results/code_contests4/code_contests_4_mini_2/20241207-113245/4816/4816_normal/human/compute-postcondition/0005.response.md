According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `numbers` list. If the list has at least 2 integers, the loop can execute again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` has at least 1 integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `numbers` must have at least 2 integers, and `num` must be the second integer in the list.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 100000, `n` is equal to `N`, `sum` is equal to `num`, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, `num` is the second integer in the list**
