To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we will analyze the code as well as the output hints.

### Problem Description
Polycarpus has watched all episodes except one from a season that has `n` episodes. The task is to identify which episode he has not watched based on the input of `n - 1` watched episodes.

### Program Analysis
The program reads the number of episodes `n` and the list of watched episodes. It then calculates the sum of the watched episodes and determines the missing episode by subtracting this sum from the total sum of the first `n` natural numbers, which is calculated using the formula `n * (n + 1) / 2`.

**Key Points:**
1. The assertion `assert n + 0 == len(numbers) + 1` checks if the length of watched episodes is indeed `n - 1`. This is a good check.
2. The calculation of the total sum is correct.
3. The difference is calculated correctly to find the missing episode.

### Edge Cases
1. **Minimum Input Values:** 
   - If `n = 2`, the input should be `1` (the watched episode). The function should return `2`, which it does.
2. **Maximum Input Values:** 
   - If `n = 100000`, with maximum episode numbers, the function should still work correctly as it uses integer arithmetic.
3. **Consecutive and Non-Consecutive Episodes:** 
   - Both cases should work correctly. For example, if the input is `10` with watched episodes `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9`, it should return `10`.

### Output Hints Analysis
The output hints state that the function calculates the sum of the watched episodes and then computes the difference between the total sum of integers from `1` to `N` and the calculated sum. This aligns with the program's logic and confirms its correctness.

The output hints do not specify any edge cases that are not handled by the code, and the function seems to be robust against the input constraints provided in the problem description.

### Conclusion
After analyzing both the code and the output hints, the program appears to handle all cases correctly as described in the problem. There are no detected edge cases that would lead to incorrect outputs.

Correctness: **True**.
