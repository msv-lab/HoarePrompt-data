To assess the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's break down the requirements and the implementation.

### Problem Requirements:
1. **Input**: 
   - An integer `n` representing the total number of episodes (with values from 2 to 100,000).
   - A list of `n-1` distinct integers representing the episodes that have been watched (with values from 1 to n).
   
2. **Output**: 
   - The function must output the number of the episode that has not been watched.

### Analysis of the Program:
The program does the following:
1. It reads the integer `N` and the subsequent `n-1` integers from the input. 
2. It calculates the sum of the watched episodes.
3. It computes the expected sum of all episodes from 1 to `n` using the formula \( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).
4. It finds the missing episode by subtracting the sum of watched episodes from the expected total sum and outputs that value.

### Correctness Check:
- The formula \( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \) accurately computes the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.
- By subtracting the sum of the watched episodes from this total, the program effectively identifies the missing episode.
- Since all watched episodes are distinct and within the range of valid episode numbers, the approach correctly identifies the missing episode.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- The program handles the minimum value of `n = 2`, where the only un-watched episode must be the one not present in the list.
- The program correctly accounts for any value of `n` up to 100,000, ensuring that the list of watched episodes remains valid and distinct.

### Conclusion:
The program adheres to the requirements set out in the problem description. It correctly identifies the unwatched episode using arithmetic summation and subtraction, and it handles the constraints provided by the problem.

Therefore, the final evaluation of the program's correctness is:

Correctness: **True**
