Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements stated in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes an integer `N` (the total number of episodes) and a string `NUMBERS` that contains `n - 1` distinct integers representing the episodes that Polycarpus has watched. This input format aligns with the problem description.

2. **Sum Calculation**: The program calculates the sum of the watched episodes. It uses a loop to iterate through the numbers and compute their total, which is necessary to identify the missing episode.

3. **Total Sum Calculation**: The program calculates the expected total sum of all episodes from `1` to `N` using the formula `n * (n + 1) / 2`. This formula is mathematically correct for finding the sum of the first `N` natural numbers, which is what the problem requires.

4. **Missing Episode Identification**: The program identifies the missing episode by subtracting the sum of the watched episodes from the total sum of episodes. This step directly corresponds to the task of finding which episode has not been watched.

5. **Output**: Finally, the function prints the missing episode number, which matches the expected output format specified in the problem description.

The program has been constructed to handle all possible edge cases within the constraints (such as the smallest and largest values for `N`), and it guarantees that the correct missing episode will always be identified based on the logic implemented.

Therefore, the implementation adheres to the problem description, and the correctness of the program is confirmed.
