#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000; (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are integers representing the coordinates of the opposite corners of the mousetrap, constrained by 0 ≤ x1 ≤ x2 ≤ 100,000 and 0 ≤ y1 ≤ y2 ≤ 100,000; for each mouse, (rix, riy) are integers representing the initial coordinates of the mouse (0 ≤ rix, riy ≤ 100,000) and (vix, viy) are integers representing the speed of the mouse (-100,000 ≤ vix, viy ≤ 100,000).
def func_1():
    for line in sys.stdin:
        for value in line.split():
            yield value
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `line` is a string with space-separated values from the input, `value` is the last value yielded from all space-separated values in all lines, and all values from each line have been yielded.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts multiple lines of input, yielding each space-separated value one at a time. It does not process or determine any outcomes related to the mice, mousetrap coordinates, or their speeds as indicated in the annotations, which are misleading. The function only reads and yields values from standard input without any further logic.
