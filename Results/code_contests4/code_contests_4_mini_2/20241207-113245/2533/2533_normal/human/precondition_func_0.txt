n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000; (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are integers representing the coordinates of the opposite corners of the mousetrap, constrained by 0 ≤ x1 ≤ x2 ≤ 100,000 and 0 ≤ y1 ≤ y2 ≤ 100,000; for each mouse, (rix, riy) are integers representing the initial coordinates of the mouse (0 ≤ rix, riy ≤ 100,000) and (vix, viy) are integers representing the speed of the mouse (-100,000 ≤ vix, viy ≤ 100,000).
