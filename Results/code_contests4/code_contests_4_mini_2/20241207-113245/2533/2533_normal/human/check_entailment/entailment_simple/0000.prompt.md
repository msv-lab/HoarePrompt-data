You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Igor the analyst fell asleep on the work and had a strange dream. In the dream his desk was crowded with computer mice, so he bought a mousetrap to catch them.

The desk can be considered as an infinite plane, then the mousetrap is a rectangle which sides are parallel to the axes, and which opposite sides are located in points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).

Igor wants to catch all mice. Igor has analysed their behavior and discovered that each mouse is moving along a straight line with constant speed, the speed of the i-th mouse is equal to (vix, viy), that means that the x coordinate of the mouse increases by vix units per second, while the y coordinates increases by viy units. The mousetrap is open initially so that the mice are able to move freely on the desk. Igor can close the mousetrap at any moment catching all the mice that are strictly inside the mousetrap.

Igor works a lot, so he is busy in the dream as well, and he asks you to write a program that by given mousetrap's coordinates, the initial coordinates of the mice and their speeds determines the earliest time moment in which he is able to catch all the mice. Please note that Igor can close the mousetrap only once.

Input

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of computer mice on the desk.

The second line contains four integers x1, y1, x2 and y2 (0 ≤ x1 ≤ x2 ≤ 100 000), (0 ≤ y1 ≤ y2 ≤ 100 000) — the coordinates of the opposite corners of the mousetrap.

The next n lines contain the information about mice.

The i-th of these lines contains four integers rix, riy, vix and viy, (0 ≤ rix, riy ≤ 100 000,  - 100 000 ≤ vix, viy ≤ 100 000), where (rix, riy) is the initial position of the mouse, and (vix, viy) is its speed.

Output

In the only line print minimum possible non-negative number t such that if Igor closes the mousetrap at t seconds from the beginning, then all the mice are strictly inside the mousetrap. If there is no such t, print -1.

Your answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 6. 

Formally, let your answer be a, and the jury's answer be b. Your answer is considered correct if <image>.

10 5 -7 -10


Output

-1

Note

Here is a picture of the first sample

Points A, B, C, D - start mice positions, segments are their paths.

<image>

Then, at first time when all mice will be in rectangle it will be looks like this:

<image>

Here is a picture of the second sample

<image>

Points A, D, B will never enter rectangle.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000; (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are integers representing the coordinates of the opposite corners of the mousetrap, constrained by 0 ≤ x1 ≤ x2 ≤ 100,000 and 0 ≤ y1 ≤ y2 ≤ 100,000; for each mouse, (rix, riy) are integers representing the initial coordinates of the mouse (0 ≤ rix, riy ≤ 100,000) and (vix, viy) are integers representing the speed of the mouse (-100,000 ≤ vix, viy ≤ 100,000).
def func_1():
    for line in sys.stdin:
        for value in line.split():
            yield value
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `line` is a string with space-separated values from the input, `value` is the last value yielded from all space-separated values in all lines, and all values from each line have been yielded.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
