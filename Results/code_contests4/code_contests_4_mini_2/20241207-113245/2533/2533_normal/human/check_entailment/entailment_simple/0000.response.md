Correctness: **False**

The provided program snippet only includes a generator function that reads input values from standard input. It does not implement any logic to determine the earliest time at which all mice can be caught in the mousetrap, as described in the problem statement. 

The problem requires:

1. Reading the number of mice and their initial positions as well as their velocities.
2. Calculating the time at which all mice will be strictly within the bounds of the mousetrap.
3. Returning the earliest time or -1 if it is not possible for all mice to be caught.

The current implementation only handles input parsing and does not contain any calculations or logic to solve the problem. Hence, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description. 

A complete solution would need to analyze the position of each mouse over time based on its velocity, check when they would fall within the bounds of the mousetrap, and determine the earliest time at which all mice can be caught. Since this functionality is missing, the program is not correct.
