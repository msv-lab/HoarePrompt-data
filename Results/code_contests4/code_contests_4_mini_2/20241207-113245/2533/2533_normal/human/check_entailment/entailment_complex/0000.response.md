Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description. The annotations in the code suggest that the program is designed to read input values, but it does not implement any logic to calculate the earliest time at which all the mice can be caught inside the mousetrap. 

Key reasons for the failure to meet the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1()` only reads and yields values from standard input without any processing or calculations related to the positions and speeds of the mice or the coordinates of the mousetrap.

2. **No Logic for Catching Mice**: There is no implementation of any algorithm that determines the time `t` at which all the mice are strictly within the boundaries of the mousetrap. The problem requires an analysis of the mice's movements over time and checks if they can be within the mousetrap at any given moment, which is entirely absent from the code.

3. **Missing Output**: The function does not produce any output as specified in the problem description. It fails to return the minimum time `t` or `-1` if it's impossible to catch all the mice.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem statement, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
