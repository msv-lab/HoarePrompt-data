According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `sys.stdin`. The loop will continue to execute as long as there is another line to read from standard input. At the end of the last iteration, the variable `line` contains a string with space-separated values, and `value` is the last of those values obtained from splitting `line`. For the loop to execute one more time, `line` must contain another string with space-separated values.

Since `value` has been yielded for each space-separated value in `line`, it indicates that the loop has processed all values in the current `line`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `line` will be updated to the next line read from standard input.

State: **`line` is the next string of space-separated values from sys.stdin, `value` is the last of those values obtained from splitting the new line.**
