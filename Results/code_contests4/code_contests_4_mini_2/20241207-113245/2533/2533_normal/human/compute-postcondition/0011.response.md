According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `line` and how it is split into values. If `line` contains more space-separated values, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `line` is a string with at least 1 value, and `value` is the last value that has been yielded from `line.split()`. 

Since `value` has been taken from the split result, for the loop to execute one more time, `line` must still contain at least one more space-separated value after `value`. Therefore, `value` should be updated to the next value in the split result.

State: **`line` is a string of space-separated values with at least 2 values, `value` is the next value from `line.split()` that has not yet been yielded.**
