The function `func_1` accepts the following parameters:

1. `n`: an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), representing the number of mice.
2. `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`: integers representing the coordinates of the opposite corners of the mousetrap, constrained by \(0 \leq x1 \leq x2 \leq 100,000\) and \(0 \leq y1 \leq y2 \leq 100,000\).
3. For each mouse, `(rix, riy)`: integers representing the initial coordinates of the mouse, constrained by \(0 \leq rix, riy \leq 100,000\).
4. For each mouse, `(vix, viy)`: integers representing the speed of the mouse, constrained by \(-100,000 \leq vix, viy \leq 100,000\).

The function processes these parameters to determine the fate of the mice with respect to the mousetrap. The exact output is not specified in the provided information, but it can be inferred that the function likely returns information about whether the mice are captured by the mousetrap or not, based on their initial positions and velocities.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of mice, coordinates `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` for the mousetrap, initial coordinates `(rix, riy)` for each mouse, and speeds `(vix, viy)` for each mouse, and determines the outcome for each mouse in relation to the mousetrap.**
