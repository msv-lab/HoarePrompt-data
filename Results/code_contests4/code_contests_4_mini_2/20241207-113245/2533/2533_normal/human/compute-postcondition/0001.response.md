According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input available from `sys.stdin`. For the loop to execute at least once, `line` must contain at least one element when it is split. Since `sys.stdin` must have input available, we need to ensure that `line` is initialized with a string that contains at least one space-separated value.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `line` should be a non-empty string. For the first execution of the loop, `value` would then correspond to the first element obtained after splitting `line`.

State: **for the loop to execute at least once, `line` is a string with at least one space-separated value, `value` is the first value obtained from splitting `line`**
