The `yield` statement produces a value from a generator function without terminating it. In this case, `value` is yielded, which is the first value obtained from the non-empty `line.split()`. The rest of the state remains unchanged because `yield` does not affect other variables.

Output State: **`line` is a non-empty string of space-separated values, `value` is the first value from the non-empty `line.split()`, and `value` has been yielded.**
