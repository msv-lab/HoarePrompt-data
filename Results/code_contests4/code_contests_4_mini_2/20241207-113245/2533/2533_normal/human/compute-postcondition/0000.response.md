According to the code, the for loop iterates over the input from `sys.stdin`. For the loop to execute at least once, there must be something to read from the standard input. Therefore, we need to ensure that there is data available in `sys.stdin`. 

The state of `n`, `(x1, y1)`, `(x2, y2)`, and the mouse coordinates `(rix, riy)` and `(vix, viy)` do not directly affect the execution of the loop since they do not control the input stream.

Thus, the necessary adjustment is to ensure that `sys.stdin` contains data to read. 

State: **for the loop to execute at least once, sys.stdin must have input available to read**
