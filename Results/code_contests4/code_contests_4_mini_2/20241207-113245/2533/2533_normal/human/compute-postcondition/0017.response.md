According to the code, the loop iterates over the values obtained by splitting the string `line` into a list of space-separated values. For the loop to execute at least once, the `line` string must contain at least one non-empty value. If `line` is an empty string, then `line.split()` would produce an empty list, and the loop would not execute. 

At the beginning of the loop, `value` is assigned the first element from the result of `line.split()`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `line` must contain at least one value, and the initial state of `value` will be equal to the first value obtained from `line.split()`.

State: **`line` is a non-empty string of space-separated values, `value` is the first value from the non-empty `line.split()`**
