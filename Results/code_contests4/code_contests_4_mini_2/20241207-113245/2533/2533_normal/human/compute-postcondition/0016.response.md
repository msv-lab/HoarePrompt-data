According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input being read from `sys.stdin`. If there is more input available, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `line` is a string of space-separated values, and it has yielded all values from `line.split()`. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, there must be a new `line` available from `sys.stdin`. 

State: **`line` is a new string of space-separated values, `value` is the first value from the new `line.split()`**
