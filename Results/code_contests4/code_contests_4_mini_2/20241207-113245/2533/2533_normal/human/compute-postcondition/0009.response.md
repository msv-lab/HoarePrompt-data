According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `line` variable. The loop will iterate over the space-separated values in `line`, and it will execute if `line` contains at least one value. The current `value` is set to the last element obtained from splitting `line`. 

To ensure the loop executes at least once, `line` must contain at least one space-separated value, and `value` should be set to the last value in `line`. 

State: **`line` is a string of space-separated values with at least 1 value, `value` is the last value from `line.split()`**
