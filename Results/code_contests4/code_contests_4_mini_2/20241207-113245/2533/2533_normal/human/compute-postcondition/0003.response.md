According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the contents of the `line` string after it has been split. If `line` has more space-separated values, the loop can execute for the next value. At the end of the last iteration, `line` is a string with at least one space-separated value, and `value` is the first value obtained from splitting `line`. For the loop to execute one more time, `line` must contain at least two space-separated values, and `value` would then be the second value from the split operation.

State: **`line` is a string with at least two space-separated values, `value` is the second value obtained from splitting `line`**
