According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `line` variable. If the `line` contains more than one space-separated value, the loop will execute for each value in the line. At the end of the last iteration, `line` is a non-empty string of space-separated values, and `value` is the second value from the split result. This means that `value` is currently the second element in the list of values generated by `line.split()`.

To execute the loop one more time, `line` must contain at least three space-separated values, and since `value` is taken from the split result, we need to adjust the loop state accordingly. 

Thus, after the current iteration where `value` is the second element, for the loop to execute again, we need to have the next `value` as the third element from the split result of `line`.

State: **`line` is a non-empty string of space-separated values with at least 3 values, `value` is the third value from the split result, for the loop to execute a second time.**
