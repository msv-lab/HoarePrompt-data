The `yield` statement produces a value without terminating the function, allowing it to be resumed later. In this case, `value` is being yielded, which is the third value obtained from splitting `line`. The variable `line` remains unchanged, and it is not affected by the yield operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the yielding of `value`.

Output State: **`line` is a string with at least three space-separated values, `value` is the third value obtained from splitting `line`, and `value` has been yielded.**
