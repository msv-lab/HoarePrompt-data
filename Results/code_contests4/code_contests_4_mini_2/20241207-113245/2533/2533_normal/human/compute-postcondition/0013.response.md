According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the number of values in `line` after it has been split. At the end of the last iteration, `line` is a string containing at least 2 space-separated values. The variable `value` is assigned the next value from the split operation on `line`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `line` must still contain at least one more value after the current `value`. Given that the loop has already processed one of the values, for the loop to execute again, there must be at least 2 values remaining in `line.split()` (1 already processed and 1 still available).

Therefore, if `value` represents the current value from the split, the next `value` will be the next item from the split values, and the iteration count will have increased by 1.

State: **`line` is a string of space-separated values with at least 2 values remaining, `value` is the next value yielded from the next value of `line.split()`**
