The `yield` statement is used to produce a value from a generator function, essentially pausing its execution and returning the value specified. In this case, `value` is given as the third value from the split result of `line`. This means that when `yield value` is executed, it returns the value of `value`, but the state of the generator remains intact for the next iteration. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`line` is a non-empty string of space-separated values with at least 3 values, `value` is the third value from the split result, and `value` has been yielded.**
