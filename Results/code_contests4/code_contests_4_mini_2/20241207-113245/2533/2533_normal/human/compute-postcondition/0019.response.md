According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `line` variable. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more values in the `line` string after it has been split. At the end of the last iteration, `line` is a non-empty string of space-separated values, and `value` is the first value from the split result and has been yielded. 

To execute the loop one more time, there must be another value remaining in the `line` after the first value has already been yielded. This means that `line.split()` must contain at least 2 values. Since `value` has already been set to the first of those values, we need to adjust `value` to the next value in the split list. 

Thus, after yielding `value`, it implies that `value` needs to be updated to the second value in the list, and `line` must still contain at least one more value.

State: **`line` is a non-empty string of space-separated values, `value` is the second value from the split result, and for the loop to execute a second time `line.split()` must contain at least 2 values.**
