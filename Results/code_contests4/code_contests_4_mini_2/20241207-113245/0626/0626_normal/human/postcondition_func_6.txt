The function accepts a list of integers `a` representing the number of apples at each vertex of a tree and a list of tuples `b` representing the edges of the tree. It performs an integer division of the list `a` by the output of `func_6(a, b)` and multiplies the result by the list of edges `b`. However, there are potential issues: the function does not handle the case where `func_6(a, b)` returns zero, which could lead to a division by zero error. Additionally, as it stands, the operation involving lists is not valid in Python without further context on how to handle the division and multiplication of lists. Thus, the function may not operate as intended.
