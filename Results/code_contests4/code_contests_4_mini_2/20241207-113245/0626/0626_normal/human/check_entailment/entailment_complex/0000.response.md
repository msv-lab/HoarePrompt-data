Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description. Specifically, it lacks the logic necessary to actually calculate the minimum number of apples that need to be removed to balance the tree. 

1. **Input Handling**: The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` primarily focus on obtaining input and do not contribute to the main logic of solving the problem. They do not validate the input or process it meaningfully.

2. **Core Logic Missing**: The primary functions that should perform calculations related to the tree structure and the apples (like `func_6`, `func_7`, `func_8`, and `func_9`) do not seem to have the correct logic to determine the weight of subtrees or to check if a tree is balanced. Instead, they seem to perform unrelated operations such as calculating the least common multiple or handling indices without addressing the problem of balancing the tree based on apple counts.

3. **Edge Cases**: There is no handling for edge cases. For example, if all leaves have the same number of apples, the tree is already balanced, and thus the output should be zero. The code does not account for such scenarios since it lacks the necessary computation logic.

4. **Annotations**: The annotations hint at various operations that do not relate to the problem at hand, and some of the operations (like those in `func_6` and `func_7`) may raise potential division errors or logical inconsistencies due to incorrect assumptions about the inputs.

Given these issues, the code does not correctly implement the required functionality to address the problem of balancing the tree, which directly leads to the conclusion that the implementation is incorrect.
