Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: The program seems to focus heavily on reading input and processing it into various data structures, but it lacks a cohesive function that directly addresses the problem of calculating the minimum number of apples to remove to balance the tree. The program includes multiple functions that do not collectively implement the logic described in the problem.

2. **Core Logic for Balancing the Tree**: The essence of the problem is to calculate the minimum number of apples to remove to balance the tree, which requires determining the weights of all subtrees and ensuring that all subtrees of any given node have equal weights. The provided functions (especially `func_9`) do not correctly implement the logic for calculating the weights of the subtrees nor do they determine how many apples need to be removed to achieve balance.

3. **Incorrect Functionality**: Functions like `func_6` and `func_7` seem to perform mathematical operations (like calculating the last non-zero value and least common multiple), but they do not relate to the specific task of balancing a tree by removing apples from its leaves. The logic for identifying how many apples to remove based on the subtree weights is absent.

4. **Misleading Comments**: The comments in the code do not accurately reflect what the functions are supposed to do in the context of the problem. For instance, `func_7` and `func_6` claim to return results based on the input lists, but their operations do not help in achieving the goal of balancing the tree.

In summary, the program does not implement the required logic for determining the minimum number of apples to remove to balance the tree, making it incorrect according to the problem description.
