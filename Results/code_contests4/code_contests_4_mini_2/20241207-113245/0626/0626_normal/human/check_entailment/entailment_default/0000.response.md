The given problem requires determining the minimum number of apples to remove from a tree structure in order to make it balanced. A tree is balanced if all subtrees corresponding to the children of any vertex have equal weights. 

Upon examining the functions provided, the program does not seem to correctly address the requirements of the problem description. The functions primarily focus on input handling and tree traversal but lack the core logic needed to compute the total number of apples to be removed in order to balance the tree.

1. **Functionality**: 
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` are focused on reading input and converting it into a usable format. However, they do not contribute to the actual calculation of the apples to be removed.
   - The functions `func_5`, `func_8`, and `func_9` attempt to process the tree structure but do not handle the balancing logic correctly. For example, `func_9` seems to be calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of values from child nodes, which is not directly related to balancing the tree based on the number of apples.
   - Additionally, the logic in `func_7` and `func_6` does not appear to integrate with the overall goal of determining the minimum number of apples to remove.

2. **Edge Cases**: 
   - The program does not handle cases where all leaves have the same number of apples, as it does not explicitly check for equality across all child nodes' weights.
   - If the tree contains multiple leaves with varying weights (e.g., some leaves having 0 apples), the logic to equalize these weights is not present.

3. **Output Hints**: 
   - The output hints do not align with the actual functionalities of the program. They indicate that certain functions could lead to errors (e.g., potential division by zero in `func_7`), and the traversal logic in `func_8` does not effectively support the balancing requirement.

Given this analysis, the program does not correctly implement the required logic to balance the tree according to the problem description. 

Correctness: **False**. 

The program lacks the necessary calculations and checks to ensure that the minimum number of apples is removed to balance the tree, especially in cases where leaves have varying numbers of apples.
