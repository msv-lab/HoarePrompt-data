o is a tuple where the first element is an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), the second element is a list of n integers (0 ≤ ai ≤ 10^8) representing the number of apples at each leaf vertex, and the subsequent elements are pairs of integers representing the edges of the tree connecting vertices (1 ≤ xi, yi ≤ n, xi ≠ yi).
