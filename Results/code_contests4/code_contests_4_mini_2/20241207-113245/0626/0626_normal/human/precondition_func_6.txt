a is a list of integers representing the number of apples at each vertex of a tree with n vertices, where 0 ≤ ai ≤ 10^8, and b is a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree, where each tuple contains two integers (xi, yi) with 1 ≤ xi, yi ≤ n and xi ≠ yi. The number of vertices n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
