a is a list of integers where 0 ≤ ai ≤ 10^8 for each leaf vertex i, and b is a list of tuples representing edges of the tree, where each tuple contains two distinct integers (xi, yi) such that 1 ≤ xi, yi ≤ n and there are n - 1 such edges connecting n vertices. The number of vertices n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
