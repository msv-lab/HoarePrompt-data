The function `func_9` accepts a parameter `node`. `node` represents a tree structure as an integer, with the tree having `n` vertices, where `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`. Each leaf vertex contains a non-negative integer number of apples, specified by `0 ≤ ai ≤ 10^8`. After executing the function body, it returns the tree structure represented by `node`, along with the number of apples at the leaf vertices. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_9` is to accept a tree structure and return that structure along with the non-negative integer values of apples located at the leaf vertices. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `node` representing a tree structure and returns the tree with its vertices and the non-negative integer values of apples at the leaf vertices.**
