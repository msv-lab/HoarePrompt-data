Postcondition: ***`node` is a tree represented as an integer with `n` vertices (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), each leaf vertex contains a non-negative integer number of apples (0 ≤ ai ≤ 10^8), the tree is described by `n - 1` edges connecting the vertices, and the value at `node[1]` is greater than or equal to 0.***
