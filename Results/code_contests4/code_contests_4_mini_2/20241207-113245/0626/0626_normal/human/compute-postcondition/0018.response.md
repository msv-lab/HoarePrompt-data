The variable `max` is assigned the value of `t`. Since `t` is defined as `child[1]`, and we know that `max` can either be less than 0 or greater than `t`, the value of `max` will now equal `t`. The states of the other variables, `node` and `child`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `node` is a tree with `n` vertices; `child` is the first child in `node[2]`; `t` is assigned the value of `child[1]`; `max` is now equal to `t`.

Output State: **`node` is a tree with `n` vertices; `child` is the first child in `node[2]`; `t` is assigned the value of `child[1]`; `max` is now equal to `t`.**
