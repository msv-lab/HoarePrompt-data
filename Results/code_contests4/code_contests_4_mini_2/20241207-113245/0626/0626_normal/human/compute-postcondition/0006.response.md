The function `func_9(child)` is invoked. However, without further context or details about the implementation of `func_9`, we can't ascertain how it affects the state of the variables. The invocation of the function does not change the values of `node`, `lcm`, or `max` directly, and since it requires `node` to have at least 3 elements and `node[2]` to contain at least 1 child for the loop to execute, we can infer the following:

1. The state of `node`, `lcm`, and `max` remains unchanged unless `func_9` modifies them internally, which we can't determine.
2. Assuming `func_9` could potentially perform operations, but since we lack specifics, we conclude that the output state reflects the current values of the variables.

Therefore, the Output State is: `node` is a tree represented as an integer with `n` vertices; `lcm` is 1; `max` is -1; and function `func_9(child)` has been called.

Output State: **`node` is a tree represented as an integer with `n` vertices; `lcm` is 1; `max` is -1; and function `func_9(child)` has been called.**
