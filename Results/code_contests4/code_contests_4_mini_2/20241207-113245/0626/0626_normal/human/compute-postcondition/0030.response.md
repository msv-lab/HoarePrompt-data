The variable `node[1]` is assigned the value of `max` multiplied by the length of `node[2]`. The previous value of `max` is the minimum value of `child[1]` for all children in `node[2]` that are greater than or equal to 0, and the length of `node[2]` is the number of elements in that list. The value of `node[1]` will thus depend on these two factors. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `node` is a tree with `n` vertices; `max` is the minimum value of `child[1]` for all children in `node[2]` that are greater than or equal to 0; `lcm` is the least common multiple of all `child[0]` values processed by func_7; `child` is the last child in `node[2]` processed in the loop; `node[0]` is assigned the value of `lcm`; `node[1]` is `max * len(node[2])`.
