Functionality: ** The function accepts a tree structure represented by a list `node`, where each node has a value indicating the least common multiple (LCM) of its children's values and a maximum value derived from the children's values. It recursively computes the LCM of the children's values, updates the maximum value based on the children's values, and returns the updated tree structure with the calculated LCM and maximum value. If the value of `node[1]` is non-negative, the function exits early without modification. **
