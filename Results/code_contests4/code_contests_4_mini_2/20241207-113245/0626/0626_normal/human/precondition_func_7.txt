node is an integer representing a vertex in a tree, parent is an integer representing the parent vertex of the given node. The tree has n vertices (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) with vertex apples represented as a list of integers (0 ≤ ai ≤ 10^8) where ai denotes the number of apples in leaf vertices and non-leaf vertices have a value of zero. The edges between vertices form a connected graph with vertex indices ranging from 1 to n.
