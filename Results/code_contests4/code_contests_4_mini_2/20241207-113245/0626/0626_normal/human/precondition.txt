n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and there is a list of n integers representing the number of apples in each vertex, where each integer is in the range 0 ≤ ai ≤ 10^8. The tree is represented by n - 1 edges connecting the vertices, with each edge defined by a pair of integers (xi, yi) such that 1 ≤ xi, yi ≤ n and xi ≠ yi. Vertex 1 is the root of the tree.
