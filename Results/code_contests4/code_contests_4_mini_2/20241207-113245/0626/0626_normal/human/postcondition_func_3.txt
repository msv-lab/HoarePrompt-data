The function accepts no parameters and returns the first element of the result from `func_3()`, which presumably processes a list of integers representing the number of apples in the leaf vertices of a tree structure. However, the specifics of how `func_3()` operates and the nature of its output are not defined within this function, meaning the behavior of `func_4()` is contingent on `func_3()`. If `func_3()` fails or returns an empty list, this could lead to an error, as the function does not handle such cases.
