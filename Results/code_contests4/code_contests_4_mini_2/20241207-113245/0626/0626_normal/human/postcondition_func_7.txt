The function accepts a list `node` that contains an integer representing a vertex in a tree and another integer `parent` representing the parent vertex of the given node. It traverses the tree structure to remove the last occurrence of the `parent` vertex from the list of child vertices in `node[2]`. If the `parent` is not found in `node[2]`, the list remains unchanged. The function does not return any value.
