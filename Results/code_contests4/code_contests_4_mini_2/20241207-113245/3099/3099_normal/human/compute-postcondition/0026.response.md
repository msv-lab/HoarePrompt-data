According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `x` and `i`. The loop condition `x % i == 0` indicates that `x` must be a multiple of `i` for the loop to run. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `x` is 1. Since 1 is not a multiple of 3, the loop cannot execute again. 

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `x` needs to be adjusted to a value that is a multiple of 3. The smallest multiple of 3 that is greater than 1 is 3. Therefore, `x` must be set to at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 10^4, `i` is 3, `cnt[3]` has been incremented by 1 from its previous value, and for the loop to execute again `x` must be at least 3**
