The code `cnt[i] = cnt.get(i, 0) + 1` affects the variable `cnt`. The value of `cnt.get(i, 0)` retrieves the current count of the key `i` in the dictionary `cnt`. If `i` is not present in `cnt`, it returns `0` (due to the default argument). Since `cnt` is initially an empty dictionary, `cnt.get(i, 0)` will return `0`. The code then increments this value by 1, resulting in `cnt[i]` being assigned the value `1`. 

The other variables `N`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 10^4, `i` is 2, `cnt` is {2: 1}, `x` is an even number greater than or equal to 2.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 10^4, `i` is 2, `cnt` is {2: 1}, `x` is an even number greater than or equal to 2**.
