According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cnt` dictionary. If `cnt` has at least one key, the loop will execute again for the next key. At the end of the last iteration, `key` is the first key in `cnt`. For the loop to be executed one more time, the next key in `cnt` must be accessed. 

Assuming `cnt` has more keys beyond the current `key`, the `key` will be updated to the next key in `cnt`, and the loop will continue until all keys are processed. 

Since `i` is greater than the square root of `arr[2]`, this condition does not affect the next iteration of the loop. 

State: **`x` is 1.0, `i` is greater than the square root of the original value of `arr[2]`, `cnt` contains at least one key, `key` is the next key in `cnt`**
