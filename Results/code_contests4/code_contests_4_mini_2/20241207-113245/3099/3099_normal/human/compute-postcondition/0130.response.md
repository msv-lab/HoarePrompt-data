`cnt[i]` is assigned the value of `cnt.get(i, 0) + 1`. The previous value of `cnt[1]` is not specified, but since it is mentioned that it is incremented by 1 or set to 1 if not present, we can assume the following scenarios:

1. If `cnt[1]` was not present (i.e., it was 0), then `cnt[1]` will be set to `0 + 1`, resulting in `cnt[1]` being 1.
2. If `cnt[1]` was already present and had a value (let's say `n`), then `cnt[1]` will be updated to `n + 1`.

However, since the precise previous value is not defined, we will express it as an increment of the current value.

The variable `x` and `i` remain unchanged. Thus, the output state reflects the increment of `cnt[1]`.

Output State: **`x` is 1.0, `i` is 1, `cnt[1]` is incremented by 1 or set to 1 if not present**.
