According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `answer[prime]`. If `answer[prime]` is greater than the current iteration count (which is represented by `_`), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cnt` is an empty dictionary, `lcm` is the result of `func_2(lcm, prime)` where `lcm` is 1, and `answer` contains the key `prime` with a value of at least 1. 

Since `answer[prime]` is at least 1, the loop has executed once. For the loop to execute one more time, `answer[prime]` must be greater than the current count of iterations (which would now be 1), meaning it must be at least 2. Therefore, the next values would be that the loop will execute again with `_` incremented to 1.

State: **`cnt` is an empty dictionary, `lcm` is the result of func_2(lcm, prime) where lcm is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `answer[prime]` must be at least 2.**
