The code updates the `cnt` dictionary at the key `i`, using the `get` method to retrieve the current count for `i` (defaulting to 0 if `i` is not yet a key in `cnt`) and then increments that count by 1. The previous state of the affected variable is `cnt[i]`, which could be either its current value or 0 if `i` is not in `cnt`. The values of `x` and `i` remain unchanged by this operation. 

Output State: **`x` is updated to `x / i`, `cnt[i]` is updated to `cnt.get(i, 0) + 1`**
