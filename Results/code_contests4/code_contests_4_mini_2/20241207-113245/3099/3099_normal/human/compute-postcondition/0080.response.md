Output State: **`x` is the final value obtained after dividing the original odd number by `i` as many times as `i` divides `x`, `i` is an odd divisor of the original `x`, and `cnt[i]` is the total count of how many times `i` divided the original `x`. If `x` was less than 9 initially, the loop doesn't execute and `cnt` remains unchanged.**
