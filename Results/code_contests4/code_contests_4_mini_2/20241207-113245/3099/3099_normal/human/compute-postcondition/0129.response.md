`x` is assigned the value of `x / i`. Given that `x` is 1.0 and `i` is 1, the calculation results in `x` being 1.0. The value of `cnt[1]` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is 1.0, `i` is 1, `cnt[1]` is incremented by 1 or set to 1 if not present.

Output State: **`x` is 1.0, `i` is 1, `cnt[1]` is incremented by 1 or set to 1 if not present.**
