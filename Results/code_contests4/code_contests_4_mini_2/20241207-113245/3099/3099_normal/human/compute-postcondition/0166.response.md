According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `answer` dictionary. If the dictionary has at least one key, the loop can execute again for the next key. At the end of the last iteration, `answer` contains the key `prime` with a value of at least 1, and `lcm` has been calculated based on `answer[prime]`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, it must iterate over the next key in the `answer` dictionary. Since `prime` is the current key being iterated, to execute again, `prime` will take on the next key in `answer`.

State: **`cnt` is an empty dictionary, `lcm` is the result of func_2 applied `answer[prime]` times starting from 1, for the loop to execute a second time `answer` must still contain at least one more key after `prime`.**
