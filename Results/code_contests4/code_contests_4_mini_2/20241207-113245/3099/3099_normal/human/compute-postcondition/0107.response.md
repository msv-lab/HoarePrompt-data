The variable `x` is assigned the value `arr[i]`. The previous state indicates that `x` is the final value, but it does not provide the current value of `arr[i]`. Therefore, we cannot determine a specific value for `x`. The other variables in the initial state remain unaffected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`x` is assigned the value of `arr[i]`, `answer` contains the maximum values between the current entries of `answer` and `cnt` for each key in `cnt`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `x + 1; `cnt` is {}**
