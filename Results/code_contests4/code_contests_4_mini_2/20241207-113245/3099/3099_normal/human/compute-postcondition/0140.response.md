To determine if the loop can execute again, we need to analyze the condition `x % i == 0`. 

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `x` is 1.0
- `i` is 1
- `cnt[1]` is 2

Now, let's check the condition:
- \( x \% i = 1.0 \% 1 = 0 \), which means the condition is currently true, and the loop can execute again.

Since the loop can execute again, we do not need to adjust any of the states.

State: **`x` is 1.0, `i` is 1, `cnt[1]` is 2**
