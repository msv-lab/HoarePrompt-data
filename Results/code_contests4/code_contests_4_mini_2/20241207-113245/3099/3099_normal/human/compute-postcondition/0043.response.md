The loop divides `x` by each integer starting from 2 until `i * i` exceeds `x`. After all iterations, `cnt` will contain the count of each prime factor of the original value of `N`, and `x` will be reduced to either 1 or a prime number greater than the square root of the original `N`. The variable `i` will be the smallest integer greater than the highest prime factor found.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 10^4, `i` is greater than the largest prime factor of the initial value of `N`, `cnt` contains the count of each prime factor of the original value of `N`, `x` is either 1 or a prime number greater than the square root of the original `N`.**
