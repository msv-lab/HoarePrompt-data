According to the code, the loop execution depends on the value of `answer[prime]`. For the loop to execute at least once, `answer[prime]` must be greater than 0. The state indicates that `cnt` is currently an empty dictionary. Additionally, for the loop to execute one more time, `prime` must be the next key in `answer`, which means it should be defined in the `answer` dictionary.

Thus, to adjust the states for the loop to execute:

1. `answer[prime]` must be greater than 0, which implies that `prime` is a valid key in the `answer` dictionary.
2. The value of `cnt` does not affect the loop execution but should be acknowledged as it is currently empty.
3. The variable `prime` should be set to the next key in `answer`.

State: **`cnt` is an empty dictionary, for the loop to execute one more time `answer[prime]` is greater than 0, `prime` is the next key in `answer`**
