The value of `x` is divided by `i`, where `x` is 1.0 and `i` is 1. The result of the operation `x /= i` is `1.0 / 1`, which equals `1.0`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is 1.0, `i` is 1, `cnt[1]` is assigned the value 1.

Output State: **`x` is 1.0, `i` is 1, `cnt[1]` is assigned the value 1**
