According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `x % i == 0`. For the loop to execute again, `x` must still be a multiple of `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `x` has been adjusted to `x / i`, so we need to ensure that this new value of `x` is still a positive multiple of `i`. 

Since `x` is now a positive multiple of `i` (greater than 0) at the end of the last iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be adjusted so that it remains a positive multiple of `i`. Thus, `x` should be adjusted to be greater than or equal to `i` (e.g., `x` can be set to `i` or a higher multiple of `i`, such as `2*i`, etc.).

State: **`x` is now a positive multiple of `i` (greater than 0), `x` is now adjusted to be greater than or equal to `i`, `i` is a positive divisor of `x`, `cnt[i]` is updated to be `cnt.get(i, 0) + 1`**
