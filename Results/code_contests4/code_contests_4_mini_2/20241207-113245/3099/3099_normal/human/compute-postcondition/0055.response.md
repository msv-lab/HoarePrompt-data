The variable `cnt` is initialized as an empty dictionary. The previous values of `answer`, `i`, and `n` are not affected by this line of code. Since `cnt` is being defined but not used immediately, the output state reflects the current values of the relevant variables.

Output State: **`answer` contains the maximum values from `cnt` for each corresponding `key`, `i` is current value + 1, `cnt` is an empty dictionary**
