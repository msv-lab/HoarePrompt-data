The value of `i` is set to 2, but the value of `arr[i]` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the value of `x`. Additionally, the state of `answer` and `cnt` is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged nature of the other variables, and the unknown value of `x`.

Output State: **`x` is assigned the value of `arr[2]`, `answer` contains the maximum values between the current entries of `answer` and `cnt` for each key in `cnt`, `cnt` is {}**
