The variable `cnt[i]` is assigned the value of `cnt.get(i, 0) + 1`. The method `get(i, 0)` retrieves the current value associated with the key `i` in the dictionary `cnt`, returning `0` if `i` does not exist in `cnt`. The previous value of `cnt[i]` is unknown, but it will be incremented by 1. The variables `answer`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `cnt[i]` has been updated based on its previous value.

Output State: **`answer` contains the maximum values from `cnt` for each corresponding `key`; `i` is 2; `x` is an even number greater than or equal to 2; `cnt[i]` is incremented by 1 based on its previous value.**
