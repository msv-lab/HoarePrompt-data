The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is not specified beyond being a positive divisor of the original value of `arr[2]`. Thus, the output state reflects that `i` has been increased by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`x` is 1, `i` is increased by 1, `cnt` contains the counts of each prime factor of the original value of `arr[2]**
