The code updates the dictionary `cnt` at the key `i`, which is currently 1. The `get` method is used to retrieve the value associated with the key `i` (which is 1) from `cnt`. If the key does not exist, it defaults to 0. In the initial state, `cnt[1]` is 2. Therefore, the value of `cnt.get(i, 0)` is 2. The line then adds 1 to this value, resulting in `cnt[i]` being updated to 2 + 1 = 3. The variable `x` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is 1.0, `i` is 1, `cnt[1]` is 3**
