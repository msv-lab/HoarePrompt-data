The variable `x` is assigned the value of `arr[i]`. The value of `i` is 0, so `x` takes the value from the first element of the array `arr`. The values of `N` and `cnt` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `cnt` is an empty dictionary, and `x` is assigned the value of the first element of `arr`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `cnt` is an empty dictionary, and `x` is assigned the value of the first element of `arr`.**
