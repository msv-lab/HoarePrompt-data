The value of `x` is divided by `i`. Since `x` is adjusted to be divisible by `i`, the result of `x / i` will still be an integer, and `x` is greater than or equal to (i + 1) * (i + 1), so the value of `x` after the operation will be a valid integer that meets these conditions. The values of `i` and any other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`x` is adjusted to be divisible by `i`, `x` is greater than or equal to (i + 1) * (i + 1); `x` is now `x / i`.**
