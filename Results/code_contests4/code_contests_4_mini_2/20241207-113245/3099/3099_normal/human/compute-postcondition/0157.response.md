The variable `lcm` is initialized with the value 1. The values of `answer` and `cnt` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `answer` contains the maximum counts of prime factors for all integers in `arr`, `cnt` is an empty dictionary, `lcm` is 1.

Output State: **`answer` contains the maximum counts of prime factors for all integers in `arr`, `cnt` is an empty dictionary, `lcm` is 1**.
