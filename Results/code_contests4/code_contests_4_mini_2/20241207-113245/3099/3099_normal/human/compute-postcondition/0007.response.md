According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. The loop will execute as long as \( i \times i \) is less than or equal to \( x \). Right before the loop, \( i \) is 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, \( x \) must be greater than or equal to \( i \times i \), which is \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \). Since \( x \) is assigned the value of the first element of `arr`, we need to ensure that the first element of `arr` is at least 4.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 10^4, `i` is 2, `cnt` is an empty dictionary, for the loop to execute the first time `x` (the first element of `arr`) must be greater than or equal to 4**
