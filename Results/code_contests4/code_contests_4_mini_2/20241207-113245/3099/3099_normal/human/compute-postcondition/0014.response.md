According to the code, the loop can execute again if the condition `x % i == 0` holds true. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, so the condition simplifies to checking if `x` is even. If `x` is an even number and currently `x` is the new even number after being divided by 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `x` must still be an even number after division by 2. 

Since it is stated that `x` must be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute again, `x` needs to also satisfy the condition that it remains even after further division. Thus, to ensure the loop executes one more iteration, `x` must be adjusted to be at least 4 (since 4 divided by 2 gives 2, which is still even).

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 10^4, `i` is 2, `cnt` is {2: 2}, and for the loop to execute again `x` is >= 4**
