In the given code, `x` is assigned the value of `x / i`. The initial value of `x` is 3, and `i` is 3. Therefore, after executing the code, `x` will be updated to `3 / 3`, which equals 1. The other variables (`N`, `i`, and `cnt`) remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 10^4; `i` is 3; `cnt` is updated with `cnt[3]` incremented by 1; `x` is 1**.
