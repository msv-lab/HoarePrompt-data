According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `answer` dictionary. If `answer` contains more keys, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cnt` is an empty dictionary, and `lcm` has been updated by applying `func_2(lcm, prime)` `answer[prime]` times for the current `prime`. 

To execute one more time, the loop will iterate for the next key in `answer`. Therefore, `prime` should be updated to the next key in the `answer` dictionary. 

State: **`cnt` is an empty dictionary, `lcm` is updated by `func_2(lcm, prime)` applied `answer[prime]` times, for the loop to execute one more time `prime` must be the next key in `answer`**
