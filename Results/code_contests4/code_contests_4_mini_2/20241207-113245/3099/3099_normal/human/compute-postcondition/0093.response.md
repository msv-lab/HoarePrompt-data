The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is unknown, but since `x` is less than `i`, this increment may affect future operations involving `i`. The values of `x` and `cnt[i]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is the result of the final value of the original odd number divided by `i` as many times as `i` divides the original `x`, `cnt[i]` is the total count of how many times `i` divided the original `x`, and `i` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`x` is the result of the final value of the original odd number divided by `i` as many times as `i` divides the original `x`, `cnt[i]` is the total count of how many times `i` divided the original `x`, and `i` is increased by 1.**
