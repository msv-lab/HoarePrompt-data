The `answer` variable is initialized as an empty dictionary. The previous values of the affected variables `N`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 10^4; `n` is assigned the value of int(raw_input()); `arr` is a list of integers from the input; `answer` is an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 10^4; `n` is assigned the value of int(raw_input()); `arr` is a list of integers from the input; `answer` is an empty dictionary.**
