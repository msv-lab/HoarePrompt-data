According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cnt` dictionary. The loop will execute for each `key` in `cnt`. At the end of the last iteration, `answer[key]` has been updated to the maximum of `answer.get(key, 0)` and `cnt[key]`, and the current `key` has been processed in the last iteration. 

Since `key` is iterated over in the `cnt` dictionary, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to move to the next `key` in the `cnt`. If there are more keys in `cnt`, the loop will execute again with the next `key`.

State: **`answer[key]` is updated to max(`answer.get(key, 0)`, `cnt[key]`), for the loop to execute one more time there must be another `key` in `cnt` that has not been processed yet.**
