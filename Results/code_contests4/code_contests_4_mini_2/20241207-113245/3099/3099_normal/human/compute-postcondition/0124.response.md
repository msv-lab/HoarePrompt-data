The `cnt[i]` is assigned the value of `cnt.get(i, 0) + 1`. The `get` method retrieves the value associated with the key `i` in the dictionary `cnt`, and if `i` is not found, it defaults to `0`. Given that `i` is `1`, we check the current state of `cnt`. If `cnt` does not have the key `1`, it will return `0`, and then `cnt[1]` will be assigned the value `0 + 1`, which is `1`. If `cnt` already has the key `1`, it will increment that value by `1`. However, the state of `cnt` is not provided, so we cannot determine its initial value.

Thus, the output state will reflect that `cnt[i]` is updated based on its previous value or set to `1` if it was not present.

Output State: **`x` is 1, `i` is 1, `cnt[1]` is incremented by 1 or set to 1 if not present**
