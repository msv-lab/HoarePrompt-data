The value of `x` is updated by dividing it by `i`. Since `x` is adjusted to be divisible by `i`, the result of `x / i` will be an integer. The initial conditions state that `x` is greater than or equal to (i + 1) * (i + 1), which ensures that the value of `x` remains valid after the division. The variable `cnt[i]` has already been updated prior to this step, so its value is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the changes made to `x`.

Output State: **`x` is now `x / i`, `cnt[i]` remains updated**
