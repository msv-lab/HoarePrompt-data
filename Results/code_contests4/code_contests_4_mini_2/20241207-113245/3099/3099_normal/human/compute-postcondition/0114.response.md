The value of `x` is divided by `i`. Since `x` is a positive multiple of `i`, the result of `x /= i` will still result in a positive value. The previous values of `x` and `i` are known to maintain the conditions stated in the initial state. The output state reflects the new value of `x` after the operation, while the value of `i` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is now a positive multiple of `i` (greater than 0); `x` is now adjusted to be the result of `x / i`; `i` is a positive divisor of `x`.**
