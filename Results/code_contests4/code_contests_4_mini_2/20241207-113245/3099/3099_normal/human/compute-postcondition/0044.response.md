Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 10^4, `i` is greater than the largest prime factor of the initial value of `N`, `cnt` contains the count of each prime factor of the original value of `N`, `x` is a prime number greater than the square root of the original `N` (since `x` cannot be 1 in this case).***
