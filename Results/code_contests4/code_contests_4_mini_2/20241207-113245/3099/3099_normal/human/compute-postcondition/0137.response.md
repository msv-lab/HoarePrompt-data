According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x` and `i`. The condition for the loop to execute is that `x % i` must be equal to 0. 

At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 1.0 and `i` is 1. The expression `x % i` evaluates to `1.0 % 1`, which is 0, thus allowing the loop to execute at least one more time.

To ensure that the loop can execute again, the states do not need to be adjusted since `x % i` is already 0. Therefore, the loop can continue executing without any changes to the existing states.

State: **`x` is 1.0, `i` is 1, `cnt[1]` is assigned the value 1**
