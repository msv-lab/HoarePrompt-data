The variable `cnt` is initialized as an empty dictionary. The previous values of the affected variables `N` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 10^4, `i` is 0, and `cnt` is an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `cnt` is an empty dictionary**
