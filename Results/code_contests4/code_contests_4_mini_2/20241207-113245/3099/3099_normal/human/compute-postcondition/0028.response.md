The variable `cnt[i]` is assigned the value `cnt.get(i, 0) + 1`. The `get` method retrieves the current value of `cnt[3]`, which has been incremented by 1 from its previous value. Therefore, `cnt[3]` is now equal to its previous value plus 1. The other variables (`N`, `i`, and `x`) remain unchanged in this operation.

Letâ€™s denote the previous value of `cnt[3]` as `previous_cnt_3`. After executing the code, `cnt[3]` will be `previous_cnt_3 + 1`.

The output state reflects the increment of `cnt[3]`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 10^4; `i` is 3; `cnt[3]` has been incremented by 1 from its previous value; `x` remains updated to `x / 3.**
