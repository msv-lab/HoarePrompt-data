Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 10^4, `i` is greater than the largest prime factor of `N`, and `cnt` is updated to include `x` if `x` is a prime number greater than the square root of `N`. If `x` is equal to 1, there are no updates to `cnt` or changes in the program state.***
