`i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is 2, so after execution, `i` becomes 3. The states of the other variables (`x`, `cnt[2]`, `answer`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an odd number or 1, `cnt[2]` contains the total count of how many times `x` was divisible by 2, `answer` contains the maximum values from `cnt` for each corresponding `key`, `i` is 3.

Output State: **`x` is an odd number or 1, `cnt[2]` contains the total count of how many times `x` was divisible by 2, `answer` contains the maximum values from `cnt` for each corresponding `key`, `i` is 3**
