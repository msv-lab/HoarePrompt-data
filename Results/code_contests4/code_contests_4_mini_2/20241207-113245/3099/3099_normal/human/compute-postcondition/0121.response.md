According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `i * i <= x`. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 1 and `i` has been increased by 1. This means that the next value of `i` (let's call it `i'`) will be used to evaluate the condition `i' * i' <= x`.

Since `i` has been increased by 1, we can denote the new value as `i' = i + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, it must hold that `(i + 1) * (i + 1) <= 1`. 

If we analyze this, the only integer value for `i` that satisfies this condition is `i = 0`. If `i` is less than or equal to `0`, then `(i + 1) * (i + 1)` can be equal to `1`, allowing the loop to execute again. Since `i` has been increased by 1, we need to adjust `i` to be `0` at the end of the last iteration.

State: **`x` is 1, `i` is adjusted to 0 for the loop to execute again**
