According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `x`. The condition `i * i <= x` needs to hold true for the loop to execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been increased by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that the new value of `i` (which is `i + 1`) still satisfies the condition when squared against `x`. 

Given that `x` is not divisible by 3 does not provide direct information about the relationship between `i` and `x`. However, we do know that `N` is a positive integer and `1 <= N <= 10^4`, which implies `x` is also a positive integer.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the condition such that `i * i` must be less than or equal to `x`. Since `i` has been increased by 1, we need to ensure that `(i + 1) * (i + 1) <= x`. This means that `x` must be greater than or equal to `(i + 1) * (i + 1)`.

State: **`x` is not divisible by 3, `cnt[3]` is the count of how many times 3 divides the initial value of `x`, `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 10^4, and for the loop to execute again `x` must be greater than or equal to (i + 1) * (i + 1)**
