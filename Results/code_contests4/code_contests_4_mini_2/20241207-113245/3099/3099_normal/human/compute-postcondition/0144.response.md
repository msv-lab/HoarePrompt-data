The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is 1, so after execution, `i` will be 2. The states of the other variables, including `x` and `cnt[1]`, are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is 1.0, `i` is 2, `cnt[1]` is 3.

Output State: **`x` is 1.0, `i` is 2, `cnt[1]` is 3**
