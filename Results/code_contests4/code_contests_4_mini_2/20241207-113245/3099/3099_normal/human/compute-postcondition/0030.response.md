The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown. The variables `x`, `cnt[3]`, and `N` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is not divisible by 3, `cnt[3]` is the count of how many times 3 divides the initial value of `x`, `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 10^4, and `i` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`x` is not divisible by 3, `cnt[3]` is the count of how many times 3 divides the initial value of `x`, `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 10^4, and `i` is increased by 1.**
