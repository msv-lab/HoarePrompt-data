According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the range defined by `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to the final value of `x`, and `answer` contains the maximum values between the current entries of `answer` and `cnt` for each key in `cnt`. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be `x + 1`, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `x + 1`.

State: **`x` is the final value, `answer` contains the maximum values between the current entries of `answer` and `cnt` for each key in `cnt`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `x + 1**.
