The value of `lcm` is updated by applying the function `func_2` with `lcm` and `prime` as arguments. Since `lcm` is the result of `func_2` applied `answer[prime]` times starting from 1, and given that `answer[prime]` is at least 2, `func_2` will be called at least once more. The previous value of `lcm` will change based on the output of `func_2(lcm, prime)`. The state of `cnt` remains unchanged as it is an empty dictionary and not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `cnt` is an empty dictionary, `lcm` is updated by `func_2(lcm, prime)`.

Output State: **`cnt` is an empty dictionary, `lcm` is updated by `func_2(lcm, prime)`**
