The value of `x` is divided by `i`, where `i` is 2. Since the initial value of `x` is not provided, we assume `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4 (to satisfy the condition for the loop to execute again). Therefore, `x` is updated to `x / 2`. The values of `N` and `cnt` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 10^4, `i` is 2, `cnt` is {2: 2}, and `x` is updated to `x / 2`**.
