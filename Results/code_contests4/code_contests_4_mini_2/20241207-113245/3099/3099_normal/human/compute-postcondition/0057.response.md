The value of `i` is assigned to 2, which updates the previous value of `i` (current value + 1). The other variables (`answer`, `cnt`, and `x`) remain unaffected since there are no operations modifying them in this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `answer` contains the maximum values from `cnt` for each corresponding `key`, `i` is 2, `cnt` is an empty dictionary, and `x` is the value of `arr` at index `i`.

Output State: **`answer` contains the maximum values from `cnt` for each corresponding `key`, `i` is 2, `cnt` is an empty dictionary, `x` is the value of `arr` at index `i`**
