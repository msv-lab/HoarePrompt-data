Functionality: ** The function processes a list of positive integers read from input and calculates a result based on the least common multiple (LCM) of the maximum counts of prime factors across the integers. It uses additional functions (func_1, func_2, func_4) to compute intermediate results, and the final output is the integer value of the calculated result printed to the console. It does not return any parameters; instead, it directly prints the result.**
