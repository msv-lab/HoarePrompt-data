The value of `x` is divided by `i`. Given that `i` is 2, `x` will be halved. The values of `answer`, `cnt`, and the specifics of `x` are not affected in this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `answer` contains the maximum values from `cnt` for each corresponding `key`; `i` is 2; `x` is an even number greater than or equal to 2, and `x` is now halved.

Output State: **`answer` contains the maximum values from `cnt` for each corresponding `key`; `i` is 2; `x` is an even number greater than or equal to 2, and `x` is now halved.**
