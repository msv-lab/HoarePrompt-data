The code `cnt[i] = cnt.get(i, 0) + 1` updates the value of `cnt[i]`. The `get` method retrieves the current value of `cnt[i]`, which is previously assigned the value 1. Therefore, `cnt.get(i, 0)` will return 1. Adding 1 gives us a new value of 2 for `cnt[i]`. The values of `x` and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`x` is 1.0, `i` is 1, `cnt[1]` is 2**
