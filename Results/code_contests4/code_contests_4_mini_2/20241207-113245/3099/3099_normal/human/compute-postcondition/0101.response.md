The line of code assigns the maximum value between the current value of `answer` at `key` (which defaults to 0 if `key` is not present) and the value of `cnt` at `key` to `answer[key]`. The impact is that `answer[key]` will be updated to either retain its current maximum value or to take the value of `cnt[key]`, depending on which is larger. The other variables are not affected by this line.

Output State: **`x` is the final value; `answer[key]` is updated to the maximum of `answer.get(key, 0)` and `cnt[key]`.**
