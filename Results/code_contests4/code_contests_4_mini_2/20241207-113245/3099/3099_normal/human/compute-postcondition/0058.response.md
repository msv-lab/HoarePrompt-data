To determine if the `while` loop can execute, we need to analyze the condition `i * i <= x`. 

Currently, the state right before the loop is:
- `i` is 2
- `cnt` is an empty dictionary
- `x` is the value of `arr` at index `i`

For the loop to execute, the condition `i * i <= x` must hold true. Since `i` is 2, we can calculate `i * i` which is `2 * 2 = 4`. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, we require:
- `x` (the value of `arr` at index 2) to be greater than or equal to 4.

Since we have no specific information about the current value of `x`, we can state that for the loop to execute the first time, `x` must be at least 4.

State: **`answer` contains the maximum values from `cnt` for each corresponding `key`, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute the first time then `x` is greater than or equal to 4**
