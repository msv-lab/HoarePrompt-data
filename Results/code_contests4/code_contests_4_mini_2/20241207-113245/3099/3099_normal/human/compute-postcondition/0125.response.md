According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x` and `i`. The loop continues as long as `x % i` equals 0. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 1 and `i` is 1. The expression `1 % 1` equals 0, so the loop can execute again. 

To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to consider the values of `x` and `i`. Since `x` is currently 1 and `i` is also 1, this condition will hold true for the next iteration as well. Therefore, no adjustments to these states are necessary for the loop to execute again.

State: **`x` is 1, `i` is 1, `cnt[1]` is incremented by 1 or set to 1 if not present**
