The value of `i` is assigned the value 2. The previous value of `i` was 0, so now `i` is updated to 2. The states of the other variables (`N`, `cnt`, and `x`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 10^4, `i` is 2, `cnt` is an empty dictionary, `x` is assigned the value of the first element of `arr`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 10^4, `i` is 2, `cnt` is an empty dictionary, `x` is assigned the value of the first element of `arr**
