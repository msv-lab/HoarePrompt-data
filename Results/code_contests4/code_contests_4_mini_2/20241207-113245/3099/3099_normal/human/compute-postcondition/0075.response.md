The value of `x` is divided by `i`, where `i` is an odd divisor of `x`. Since `x` is an odd number (at least 9) and a multiple of `i`, the result of `x / i` will still be an integer. The previous value of `x` is not specified but will be reduced to a smaller odd number. The other variable `i` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an odd number divided by an odd divisor `i`, and `i` remains the same.

Output State: **`x` is a smaller odd number, `i` is an odd divisor of the original `x`**
