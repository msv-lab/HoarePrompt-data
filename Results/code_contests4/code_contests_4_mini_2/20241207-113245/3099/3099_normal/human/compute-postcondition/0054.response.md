According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute another iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has a certain value, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than that value.

Since `i` is currently at its last value, the next value for `i` will be `i + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`answer` contains the maximum values from `cnt` for each corresponding `key`, `i` is current value + 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `i`**
