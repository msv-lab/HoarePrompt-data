According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `answer[prime]`. If `answer[prime]` is greater than the current iteration count (which is represented by `_`), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cnt` is an empty dictionary, `lcm` has been updated, and `answer[prime]` must be greater than 1, meaning it is at least 2. Since the loop iterates based on `answer[prime]`, if it has executed once, we can deduce that the current value of `_` is 0. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `answer[prime]` must still be greater than 1, and `_` will be incremented by 1. Thus, the next value of `_` will be 1.

State: **`cnt` is an empty dictionary, `lcm` has been updated, for the loop to execute a second time `answer[prime]` must be greater than 2, `_` is 1**
