According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `x`. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i * i` must be less than or equal to `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 1.0 and `i` is 2. Given that `i * i` equals 4, which is greater than `x`, the loop cannot execute again unless `i` is adjusted.

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be less than or equal to the square root of `x`. Since the square root of 1.0 is 1.0, `i` must be adjusted to be 1 or less.

State: **`x` is 1.0, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute again `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than or equal to 1**
