After running the code snippet, `arr` is assigned a list of integers created from the input string received from `raw_input()`. The previous state of `N` and `n` remains unchanged, as they are not directly affected by this line of code. The value of `arr` depends on the input provided but will be a list of integers.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 10^4; `n` is assigned the value of int(raw_input()); `arr` is a list of integers from the input.**
