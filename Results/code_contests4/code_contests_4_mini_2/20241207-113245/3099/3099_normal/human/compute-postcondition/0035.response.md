According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `x % i == 0`. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must still be divisible by `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is adjusted to be divisible by `i`, which means `x % i == 0` holds true. However, we also know that `x` is currently greater than or equal to `(i + 1) * (i + 1)`. 

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we must consider that `x` must remain divisible by `i`. If `x` were to change in a way that it no longer remains divisible by `i`, the loop would terminate.

Since there are no additional states that need to be adjusted for `x` to be divisible by `i`, we can maintain the current state. Therefore, no modifications are necessary to ensure that the loop can execute once more.

State: **`x` is adjusted to be divisible by `i` and `x` is greater than or equal to (i + 1) * (i + 1)**
