The value of `x` is divided by `i`. Given that `i` is 3, `x` is updated to `x / 3`. The value of `cnt[3]` is not affected by this operation. Since no specific value for `x` is provided, we can only state that `x` has been modified. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 10^4; `i` is 3; `cnt[3]` has been incremented by 1 from its previous value; `x` has been updated to `x / 3`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 10^4; `i` is 3; `cnt[3]` has been incremented by 1 from its previous value; `x` has been updated to `x / 3**.
