According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `answer[prime]`. If `answer[prime]` is at least 2, the loop will execute again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `cnt` is an empty dictionary, `lcm` is the result of `func_2(1, prime)`, and the current value of `answer[prime]` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again. Since the loop iterates based on the value of `answer[prime]`, which decreases by 1 with each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `answer[prime]` must be at least 3.

State: **`cnt` is an empty dictionary, `lcm` is the result of func_2(1, prime), for the loop to execute a third time `answer[prime]` must be at least 3**
