Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements set out in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to find positive integers \( B_1, B_2, ..., B_N \) such that for any \( i, j \) where \( 1 \leq i < j \leq N \), the condition \( A_i B_i = A_j B_j \) holds. The goal is to minimize the sum \( B_1 + B_2 + ... + B_N \) under the given constraints.

2. **Issues with the Functions**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function incorrectly attempts to add an integer and a list, which will raise a `TypeError`. Thus, it cannot be used to calculate the sums as required.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function returns the product of an integer and the sum of a list, which does not align with the requirement to calculate \( B_i \) values based on the \( A_i \) values.
   - **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: This function seems to deal with exponentiation or certain mathematical properties but does not contribute meaningfully to the problem of finding \( B_i \) values.
   - **Function 4 (`func_4`)**: This function is intended to perform operations that are not relevant to the problem description.
   - **Function 5 (`func_5`)**: This function appears to implement some form of modular arithmetic but does not address the core requirement of calculating \( B_i \) values.
   - **Function 6 (`func_6`)**: This function attempts to calculate some values based on prime factors but does not directly lead to the calculation of the minimum sum \( B_1 + B_2 + ... + B_N \) as described in the problem.

3. **Failure to Meet Requirements**: The overall structure of the provided program does not compute \( B_i \) values based on the condition \( A_i B_i = A_j B_j \). The program lacks a coherent logic flow that leads to calculating the minimum sum of \( B_i \) values as required. 

In summary, the program fails to implement the necessary logic to satisfy the problem description, leading to the conclusion that it does not correctly solve the problem as intended.
