The function accepts an integer `a` and a list `b`. It returns 1 if `b` is 0, or it recursively calls `func_3` and `func_2` based on whether the last element of `b` is odd or even. For odd values, it returns the result of `func_2` called with `a` and the result of `func_3` called with `a` and the last element of `b` decremented by 1. For even values, it computes `temp` as the result of `func_3` with `a` and half of the last element of `b`, and returns `func_2` called with `temp` twice. The function does not handle cases where `b` is an empty list or contains non-positive integers, which may lead to unexpected behavior.
