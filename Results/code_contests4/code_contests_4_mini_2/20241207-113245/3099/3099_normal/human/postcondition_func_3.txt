The function accepts a list of N positive integers and returns the result of calling func_3 with that list and the value 'mod - 2'. There are no checks for the validity of the input list or the value of 'mod', so if 'mod' is not defined or if it leads to an unexpected result, this may cause errors in the execution of func_3.
