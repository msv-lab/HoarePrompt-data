To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's break down the requirements and the logic implemented in the code.

### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find positive integers \( B_1, B_2, \ldots, B_N \) such that for every \( i, j \) (where \( 1 \leq i < j \leq N \)), the condition \( A_i B_i = A_j B_j \) holds. The goal is to find the minimum possible value of \( B_1 + B_2 + \ldots + B_N \) and return this sum modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Code Analysis:
1. **Functionality**:
   - The code reads an integer \( N \) and an array of integers \( A \).
   - It computes the maximum exponent for each prime factor across all elements in \( A \).
   - Using these maximum exponents, it constructs the least common multiple (LCM) of the elements in \( A \).
   - Finally, it computes the sum \( B_1 + B_2 + \ldots + B_N \) using the formula \( B_i = \frac{\text{lcm}}{A_i} \) for each \( A_i \).

2. **Handling of edge cases**:
   - The code appears to handle the case where all elements are equal, as it will calculate the LCM correctly and return \( N \) for such cases.
   - However, it does not explicitly handle the case where \( A_i = 1 \). In such a case, the expected output should be \( N \) because \( B_i \) would all be 1 (since \( 1 \cdot 1 = 1 \cdot 1 \) holds).
   - There's no validation for large values of \( A_i \) and their prime factorization as that could lead to performance issues, although it seems to be handled correctly within the provided constraints.

3. **Potential Case**:
   - Consider the input \( 1 \) (which represents \( N = 1 \) and \( A_1 = 1 \)). The output should be \( 1 \) since the only \( B_1 \) that satisfies the condition is \( 1 \). The program should correctly output \( 1 \).
   - Now, if we take \( 1 \leq N \leq 10^4 \) and \( A_i = 1 \), the expected output should be \( N \). The program correctly calculates this but could be prone to issues if not explicitly handled for larger inputs or edge scenarios.

### Conclusion:
While the code appears to fulfill the requirements of the problem description in most scenarios, it does not explicitly handle edge cases like \( A_i = 1 \) properly. If \( A_i = 1 \) for all elements, it should return \( N \) but may not handle cases where there's a mix of 1s and larger numbers accurately due to how the LCM is constructed. 

Therefore, based on this analysis and the potential for incorrect outputs in specific edge cases, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
