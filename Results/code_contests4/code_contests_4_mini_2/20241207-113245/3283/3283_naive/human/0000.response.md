To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the provided program and see if it meets the criteria for reaching the target point `x` on a number line with the specified jumping mechanism.

Problem description highlights:
- Jack starts at point zero.
- He jumps first by one unit, and each subsequent jump increases by one unit.
- He can jump either left or right.
- We need to compute the minimal number of jumps needed to reach point `x`.

Let's break down the program:

```python
n = abs(input())
d = int(ceil((sqrt(1 + 8 * n) - 1) / 2))
print[[0, 2, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 2]][n % 2][d % 4] + d
```

1. The program takes an input `x`, but it uses `abs(input())` which will convert the input into the absolute value of a string instead of an integer. This is incorrect, as the input should be converted to an integer first.
2. The formula `d = int(ceil((sqrt(1 + 8 * n) - 1) / 2))` seems to be an attempt to calculate how many jumps are needed, but without knowing the derivation, we don't know if it's accurate. 
3. The access to the list `[[0, 2, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 2]][n % 2][d % 4]` is very likely meant to adjust the result based on certain conditions, but without proper context or comments, it's unclear if this fully captures the requirement of moving to position `x`.
4. There's also a mistake in the `print` statement; it uses brackets `[[` instead of parentheses `(` which will raise a syntax error.

Given these observations, we can identify that the program does not correctly handle the input, does not ensure to calculate the minimal jumps correctly, and has syntax errors.

Let's consider an edge case, such as input `1`:
- The expected output should be `1` because Jack can jump directly to `1` in one jump.
- The current program may not return `1` because of the errors mentioned.

Thus, the program does not adhere to the problem description in all potential cases, leading us to conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
