The function `func` does not accept any parameters and operates on an integer input derived from the user, constrained between -10^9 and 10^9. It calculates the absolute value of the input, which is then used in a mathematical expression to determine a value `d`. The function constructs a 2D list and uses the parity of `n` and `d` to select an element from this list, ultimately adding `d` to this selected value. However, this function does not return a value; instead, it prints the result to the console. Furthermore, since the input is taken as a string from `input()`, there is a potential edge case where if the input is not a valid integer, a runtime error could occur. The functionality of the function is to process an integer input, perform calculations, and print a derived value based on those calculations, but it does not handle invalid input types gracefully.

Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer input from the user, calculates a derived value based on that input, and prints the result, but does not return anything and lacks error handling for invalid input types. **
