To determine the output state, we first analyze the provided code snippet.

1. The expression `n % 2` will yield either 0 or 1, depending on whether `n` is even or odd.
2. The expression `d % 4` will yield a remainder between 0 and 3, depending on the value of `d`.
3. The outer list is `[[0, 2, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 2]]`, which has two sublists. The first sublist corresponds to `n % 2 == 0` (i.e., `n` is even), and the second corresponds to `n % 2 == 1` (i.e., `n` is odd).
4. We will access the corresponding sublist and index it with `d % 4`, then add `d` to the result.

Given the initial state:
- `x` is an integer such that -10^9 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^9 (but not directly used in the code).
- `n` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9.
- `d` is calculated based on `n`, but the specific value of `d` is not defined in the initial state.

Since we do not know the exact values of `n` and `d`, we can only express the output state in terms of their possible values.

The output state will reflect the possible outcomes based on `n` being even or odd and the possible values of `d`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9; `d` is an integer calculated from the expression based on `n`; output is either (0, 2, 1, 0)[d % 4] + d or (1, 0, 0, 2)[d % 4] + d based on n % 2.**
