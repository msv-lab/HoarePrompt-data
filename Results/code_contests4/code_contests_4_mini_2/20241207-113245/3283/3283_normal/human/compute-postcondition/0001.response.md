To determine the impact of the provided code snippet, let's analyze the given initial state:

- `x` is an integer such that -10^9 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^9 (this variable is not affected by the code).
- `n` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9.

Now, we have the code:
```
d = int(ceil((sqrt(1 + 8 * n) - 1) / 2))
```

1. We start with the calculation inside the `ceil` function:
   - `8 * n` is computed, which will be a non-negative integer since `n` is between 0 and 10^9. Therefore, `1 + 8 * n` is also a non-negative integer.
   
2. Next, we take the square root of `1 + 8 * n`, which is a non-negative number.

3. We then subtract 1 from the square root result.

4. Next, we divide that result by 2.

5. Finally, we take the ceiling of the value obtained in step 4 and convert it to an integer using `int()`.

The variable `d` will hold the computed integer value from this expression based on the input value of `n`.

Since `x` is not affected by this operation, we keep its value as is.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the variable `d` and the unchanged state of `x` and `n`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that -10^9 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^9; `n` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9; `d` is an integer calculated from the expression based on `n`.**
