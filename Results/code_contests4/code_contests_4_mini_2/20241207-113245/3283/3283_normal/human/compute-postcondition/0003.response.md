The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates on a variable `x`, which is an integer constrained such that -10^9 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. Since there are no specific return values or cases provided in the output, we cannot describe them clearly. Therefore, based on the provided information, we can summarize the functionality as follows:

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates on an integer x constrained between -10^9 and 10^9. The specific return value or behavior is not detailed.**
