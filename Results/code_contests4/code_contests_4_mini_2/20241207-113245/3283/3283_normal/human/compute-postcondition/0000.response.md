The value of `n` is assigned the absolute value of `input()`. The `input()` function accepts a value which can be negative or positive, and the `abs()` function converts that value to a non-negative integer. Since `x` is an integer within the range of -10^9 to 10^9, `n` will take on a value between 0 and 10^9 based on the input. The value of `x` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer such that -10^9 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^9; `n` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that -10^9 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^9; `n` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9**
