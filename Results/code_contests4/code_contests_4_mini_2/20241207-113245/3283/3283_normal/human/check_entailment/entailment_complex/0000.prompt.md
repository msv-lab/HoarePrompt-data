You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Jack is working on his jumping skills recently. Currently he's located at point zero of the number line. He would like to get to the point x. In order to train, he has decided that he'll first jump by only one unit, and each subsequent jump will be exactly one longer than the previous one. He can go either left or right with each jump. He wonders how many jumps he needs to reach x.

Input

The input data consists of only one integer x ( - 109 ≤ x ≤ 109).

Output

Output the minimal number of jumps that Jack requires to reach x.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer such that -10^9 ≤ x ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n = abs(input())
    d = int(ceil((sqrt(1 + 8 * n) - 1) / 2))
    print[[0, 2, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 2]][n % 2][d % 4] + d
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer input from the user, calculates a derived value based on that input, and prints the result, but does not return anything and lacks error handling for invalid input types.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
