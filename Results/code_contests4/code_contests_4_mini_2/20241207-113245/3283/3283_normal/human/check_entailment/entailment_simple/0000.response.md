To determine the correctness of the given Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the problem requirements and how the program attempts to solve it.

### Problem Requirements:
- Jack starts at point 0 on the number line.
- He can jump either left or right.
- His first jump is 1 unit, the second jump is 2 units, the third jump is 3 units, and so on.
- The goal is to find the minimum number of jumps required for Jack to reach a specified point `x`.

### Analysis of the Annotated Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `x` but uses `abs(input())`, which is incorrect as it reads input as a string and takes the absolute value of a non-integer. It should be `n = abs(int(input()))` to ensure that `n` is an integer.

2. **Jump Calculation**:
   - The program uses the formula `d = int(ceil((sqrt(1 + 8 * n) - 1) / 2))` to calculate the number of jumps required. This formula is derived from the triangular number formula and is generally used to find the smallest `d` such that the sum of the first `d` natural numbers (which is `d * (d + 1) / 2`) is at least `n`.
   - However, after calculating `d`, the program uses a complex indexing operation with `print[[0, 2, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 2]][n % 2][d % 4] + d`. This indexing seems to introduce unnecessary complexity and could lead to incorrect results depending on the values of `n` and `d`.

3. **Output**: The final output is printed, but it is unclear why that specific index operation is being used, as it does not relate directly to the problem of determining the minimal jumps.

### Conclusion:
The program has several issues:
- Incorrect input handling.
- Unclear logic in calculating the minimal jumps.
- The indexing operation may produce incorrect results.

Given the analysis, the program does not correctly implement the solution as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
