Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the minimal number of jumps Jack needs to reach point x on the number line. 

For example, if we input `x = 2`, the expected output according to the problem description is `3` (which is correct), but if we input `x = 3`, the expected output should be `2` (jump sequences could be: 1 -> 2 -> 3), but the program's logic may give an incorrect result.

Additionally, the program uses incorrect syntax (e.g., `print[[0, 2, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 2]][n % 2][d % 4] + d` should use parentheses instead of brackets). 

Thus, due to these reasons and potential incorrect outputs for certain inputs, the program does not meet the requirements in the problem description for every potential case.
