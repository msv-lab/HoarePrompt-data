The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `h`. 

- `n` is an integer representing the number of towers, constrained to be between 1 and 200,000.
- `k` is an integer representing the maximum cost of slices, constrained to be between `n` and 1,000,000,000.
- `h` is a list of `n` integers representing the heights of the towers, where each height `h_i` is constrained to be between 1 and 200,000.

The function processes these inputs and returns a value based on the relationships and constraints provided. 

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: an integer `n` (the number of towers), an integer `k` (the maximum cost of slices), and a list `h` (the heights of the towers).**
