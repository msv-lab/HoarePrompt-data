Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer representing the number of towers, `k` is an integer representing the maximum cost of slices, `h` is a Counter object holding the heights of the towers and their respective counts. If `cnt + tot` exceeds `k`, then `tot` is updated to `tot + h[i]`, `cnt` is updated to `tot`, and `slices` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `tot` is updated to `tot + h[i]`, `cnt` is updated to `cnt + tot`, and `slices` is set based on the conditions, as long as `i` is in `h` and the loop condition remains valid with `min(h)` being greater than or equal to 200000.***
