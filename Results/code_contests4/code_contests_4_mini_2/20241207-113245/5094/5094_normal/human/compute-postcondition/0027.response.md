Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer representing the number of towers, `k` is an integer representing the maximum cost of slices, `h` is a Counter object holding the heights of the towers and their respective counts, `tot` is increased by `h[199999]` if `i` is in `h`, and if `cnt + tot` is greater than `k`, then `cnt` is assigned the value of `tot` and `slices` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `cnt` is increased by `tot`.***
