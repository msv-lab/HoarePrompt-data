The code snippet reads two integers from input, which are then assigned to the variables `n` and `k`. The state of the list `h` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this line of code. The values of `n` and `k` will depend on the user input, but the constraints on `n` and `k` are provided in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of towers (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `k` is an integer representing the maximum cost of slices (n ≤ k ≤ 1,000,000,000), and `h` is a list of n integers representing the heights of the towers (1 ≤ h_i ≤ 200,000), and now `n` and `k` are assigned values from input.**
