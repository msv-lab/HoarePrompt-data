Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of towers, `k` is an integer representing the maximum cost of slices, `h` is a Counter object holding the heights of the towers and their respective counts based on input, `tot` is updated to `tot + h[i]`, `cnt` is now equal to `tot`, `slices` is incremented by 1; the minimum height in `h` is less than or equal to 200000, `i` is a key in the Counter object `h`, and the sum of `cnt` and `tot` is greater than `k`.**
