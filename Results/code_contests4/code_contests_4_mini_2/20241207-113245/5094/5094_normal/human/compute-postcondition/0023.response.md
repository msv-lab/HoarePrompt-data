Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer representing the number of towers, `k` is an integer representing the maximum cost of slices, `h` is a Counter object holding the heights of the towers and their respective counts, `i` is 199999, and if `i` is in `h`, then `tot` is increased by `h[199999]`. If `i` is not in `h`, there is no change to `tot`.***
