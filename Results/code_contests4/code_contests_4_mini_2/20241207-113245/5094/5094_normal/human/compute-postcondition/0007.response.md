Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer representing the number of towers, `k` is an integer representing the maximum cost of slices, `h` is a Counter object holding the heights of the towers and their respective counts based on input, `tot` is updated to `tot + h[i]`, `cnt` is 0, `slices` is initialized to 0; the minimum height in `h` is less than or equal to 200000, and `i` is a key in the Counter object `h`.***
