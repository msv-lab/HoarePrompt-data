Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer representing the number of towers, `k` is an integer representing the maximum cost of slices, `h` is a Counter object holding the heights of the towers and their respective counts based on input, and `tot` is updated to `tot + h[i]`. If the sum of `cnt` and `tot` exceeds `k`, then `cnt` is set to `tot`, and `slices` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `cnt` is updated to `cnt + tot`, and `slices` is initialized to 0. The minimum height in `h` remains less than or equal to 200000, and `i` is a key in the Counter object `h`.***
