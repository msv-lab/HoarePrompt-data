The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters, as it is defined without any input variables. However, it operates under the constraints that `n` is a prime integer within the range of 5 to less than 10^9, and `r` is an integer within the range of 1 to 10^9. The output of the function is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, without additional details on the output, we cannot determine the exact functionality.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters explicitly; however, it operates under the constraints that `n` is a prime integer (5 ≤ n < 10^9) and `r` is an integer (1 ≤ r ≤ 10^9). The output behavior is not specified.**
