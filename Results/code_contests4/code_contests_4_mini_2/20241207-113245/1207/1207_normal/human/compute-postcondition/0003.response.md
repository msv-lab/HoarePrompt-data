To determine the output state, we analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state. 

From the initial state:
- `n` is a prime integer such that \(5 \leq n < 10^9\).
- `r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^9\).
- `ans` is calculated using the formula provided.

The `print(ans)` statement outputs the value of `ans` to the console. Since `ans` is calculated based on `n` and `r`, the output will reflect the computed value of `ans`. However, without specific values for `n` and `r`, we cannot provide a numerical output but can describe the state of `ans`.

The output state will summarize that `ans` is calculated based on the given formula involving `n` and `r`.

Output State: **`ans` is calculated as float(n * r * r * math.sin(pi / (2 * n)) * math.sin(pi / n) / math.sin(3 * pi / (2 * n))**
