To calculate `ans`, we can break down the expression step by step while taking into account the initial values of `n`, `r`, and `pi`.

1. The expression involves `math.sin()`, which will need the values of `pi` and `n`.
2. We know that `n` is a prime integer between 5 and 1,000,000,000, and `r` is an integer between 1 and 1,000,000,000.
3. The relevant calculations involve:
   - `math.sin(pi / (2 * n))`
   - `math.sin(pi / n)`
   - `math.sin(3 * pi / (2 * n))`
4. The result of these sine functions will be multiplied by `n * r * r`, and then divided by the result of the last sine function.

Since `n` is a prime integer (for example, let's consider `n = 7`), and `r` can take a value (for example, let's consider `r = 1`), we can compute each component:

- Calculate `math.sin(pi / (2 * 7))`
- Calculate `math.sin(pi / 7)`
- Calculate `math.sin(3 * pi / (2 * 7))`
- Combine these in the formula to get `ans`.

However, since we do not have specific values for `n` and `r`, the output state will describe them in terms of their ranges.

Output State: **`n` is a prime integer such that 5 ≤ n < 10^9; `r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ r ≤ 10^9; `ans` is calculated as float(n * r * r * math.sin(pi / (2 * n)) * math.sin(pi / n) / math.sin(3 * pi / (2 * n)))**.
