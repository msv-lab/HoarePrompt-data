The code assigns values to `n` and `r` using the `map` function applied to the result of `raw_input()`, which will take a space-separated string input and convert it into two integers. Since the values of `n` and `r` are provided through input, the specific values are not known in advance but they will be integers that meet the given conditions. Therefore, after execution, `n` and `r` will hold the integer values from the input.

Output State: **`n` is a prime integer such that 5 ≤ n < 10^9; `r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ r ≤ 10^9**
