The function accepts two integers `n` (a prime integer such that 5 ≤ n < 10^9) and `r` (an integer such that 1 ≤ r ≤ 10^9) as input from the user, and it computes a mathematical expression involving `n` and `r`. The result of this computation is printed to the console. However, the function does not handle any exceptions or edge cases that may arise from invalid inputs or mathematical errors, such as division by zero or invalid input types.
