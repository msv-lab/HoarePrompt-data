Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic necessary to calculate the area of a star as described in the problem statement. Here are the issues:

1. **Mathematical Formula**: The formula used to calculate the area of the star is not accurate. The area calculation for a star involves more complex geometric considerations than what is represented in the formula given in the code. Specifically, the derivation of the area for a star polygon requires knowledge of the angles and the relationships between the vertices and the circumradius.

2. **Input Handling**: The function uses `raw_input()`, which is valid in Python 2, but this will not work in Python 3 (where `input()` should be used). This is a significant oversight for modern Python usage.

3. **Division by Zero**: While the description states that `n` is a prime number greater than or equal to 5, the program does not implement any checks to prevent potential division by zero errors. If the input were to somehow lead to such a situation due to incorrect logic in the formula or external manipulation, it could result in a runtime error.

4. **No Exception Handling**: The function lacks exception handling for invalid inputs or mathematical errors, which could lead to crashes or incorrect outputs.

5. **Output Formatting**: The problem description specifies that the output should have a relative error no greater than \(10^{-7}\), but the program does not ensure that the output meets this precision requirement.

Overall, the program fails to meet the problem requirements and does not implement the correct mathematical logic necessary to calculate the area of the star as per the specifications.
