You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: It was decided in IT City to distinguish successes of local IT companies by awards in the form of stars covered with gold from one side. To order the stars it is necessary to estimate order cost that depends on the area of gold-plating. Write a program that can calculate the area of a star.

A "star" figure having n ≥ 5 corners where n is a prime number is constructed the following way. On the circle of radius r n points are selected so that the distances between the adjacent ones are equal. Then every point is connected by a segment with two maximally distant points. All areas bounded by the segments parts are the figure parts.

Input

The only line of the input contains two integers n (5 ≤ n < 109, n is prime) and r (1 ≤ r ≤ 109) — the number of the star corners and the radius of the circumcircle correspondingly.

Output

Output one number — the star area. The relative error of your answer should not be greater than 10 - 7.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a prime integer such that 5 ≤ n < 10^9, and r is an integer such that 1 ≤ r ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n, r = map(int, raw_input().split())
    pi = 3.141592653589793
    ans = float(n * r * r * math.sin(pi / (2 * n)) * math.sin(pi / n) / math.
    sin(3 * pi / (2 * n)))
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers `n` (a prime integer such that 5 ≤ n < 10^9) and `r` (an integer such that 1 ≤ r ≤ 10^9) as input from the user, and it computes a mathematical expression involving `n` and `r`. The result of this computation is printed to the console. However, the function does not handle any exceptions or edge cases that may arise from invalid inputs or mathematical errors, such as division by zero or invalid input types.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
