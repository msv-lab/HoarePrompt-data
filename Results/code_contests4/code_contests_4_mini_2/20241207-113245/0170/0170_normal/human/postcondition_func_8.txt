The function accepts two integer parameters `n` and `m`, and an integer `num`. It returns a matrix of size `n x m`, where each element in the matrix is filled with the value `num`. The function does not handle cases where `n` or `m` might be less than 1, as the constraints ensure they will be at least 3 and 1 respectively, so it is not expected to raise any errors based on these parameters.
