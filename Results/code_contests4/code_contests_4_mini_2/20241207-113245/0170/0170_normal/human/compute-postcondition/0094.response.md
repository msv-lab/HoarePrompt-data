The function `func_19` does not accept any parameters. It processes a number of test cases specified by the integer `t`, where `t` is in the range of 1 to 100. For each test case, it considers an integer `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 100) and three sequences `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n`. The elements of these sequences are integers (1 ≤ a_i, b_i, c_i ≤ 100) and satisfy the conditions that a_i ≠ b_i, a_i ≠ c_i, and b_i ≠ c_i for all i.

The function's output will depend on the logic contained within it, but generally, it will produce results based on the values processed from the sequences in accordance with the specified constraints. Since the precise output behavior is not provided in the output description, we cannot detail specific return values.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and processes multiple test cases involving sequences of integers while adhering to specific constraints on their values.**
