Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is at least 2, `c` is updated with the return value of `func_5()`, `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with zeros, `a` is equal to `c`, `b` is updated with the return value of `func_5()`, `ans[0]` is now equal to `a[0]`, and `i` is 2. If `ans[i - 1]` is not equal to `b[i]`, then `ans[i]` is now equal to `b[i]`. Otherwise, `ans[2]` is now equal to `c[2]`.***
