According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the return value of `func_1()`. If `func_1()` returns a value greater than the current iteration count (denoted by `_`), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `n` is at least 3, `c` is the return value of `func_5()`, and `ans` is a list of length `n`. The loop has executed a number of times equal to the value returned by `func_1()` minus 1.

To prepare for the next iteration, the loop will execute one more time if `func_1()` returns a value greater than the current iteration count. If the current iteration count is `k`, then for the loop to execute again, `func_1()` must return at least `k + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is at least 3, `c` is the return value of `func_5()`, `ans` is a list of length `n`, for the loop to execute one more time `func_1()` must return a value greater than the current iteration count (let's denote it as `k`).**
