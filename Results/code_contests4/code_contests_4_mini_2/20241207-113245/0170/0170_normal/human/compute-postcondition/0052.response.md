Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is at least 3, and `c` is the return value of `func_5()`. If `ans[1]` is not equal to `b[2]`, then `ans[2]` is assigned the value of `b[2]`. Otherwise, `ans[2]` is assigned the value of `c[2]`, with `a` and `b` both equal to `c`, and `i` is 2.***
