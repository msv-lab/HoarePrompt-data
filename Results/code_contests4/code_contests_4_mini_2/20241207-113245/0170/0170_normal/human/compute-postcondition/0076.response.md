The variable `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `c[i]`. Since `c` is updated with the return value of `func_5()` and we have `i` equal to 1, the output will depend on `c[1]`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `ans` remain unchanged except for `ans[i]`. The other states are not affected directly by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is at least 2, `c` is updated with the return value of `func_5()`, `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with zeros, `a` is equal to `c`, `b` is updated with the return value of `func_5()`, `ans[0]` is now equal to `a[0]`, `i` is 1, `ans[i]` is equal to `c[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is at least 2, `c` is updated with the return value of `func_5()`, `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with zeros, `a` is equal to `c`, `b` is updated with the return value of `func_5()`, `ans[0]` is now equal to `a[0]`, `i` is 1, `ans[i]` is equal to `c[i]**.
