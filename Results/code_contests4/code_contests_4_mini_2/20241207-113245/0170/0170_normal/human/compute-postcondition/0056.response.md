The code assigns the value of `b[i]` to `ans[i]`. The variable `i` has a value of 3, so the assignment affects the 4th element of the arrays `ans` and `b` (considering 0-based indexing). The values of `t`, `n`, and `c` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 3, `c` is the return value of `func_5()`, `i` is 3, and `ans[3]` is assigned the value of `b[3]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 3, `c` is the return value of `func_5()`, `i` is 3, and `ans[3]` is assigned the value of `b[3]`**.
