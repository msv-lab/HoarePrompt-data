`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to `file`. Since `x` is the first element in `args`, its value is determined by the contents of `args`, which is a non-empty iterable. The state of the other variables, including `sep`, `at_start`, and `file`, is not directly affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is set to its default value, `file` is set to its default value and now contains the string representation of `x`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable, and `x` is the first element in `args`.

Output State: **`sep` is set to its default value, `file` is set to its default value and now contains the string representation of `x`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable, and `x` is the first element in `args`.**
