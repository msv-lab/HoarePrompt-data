The variable `ans` is being assigned the value of `a[i]`, where `i` is currently 3. The specific values of `a` and `ans` are not provided, but `i` is known to be 3. The variable `c` does not affect this assignment, and `t` and `n` are also not directly involved in this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the assignment without changing the values of other variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 3, `c` is the return value of `func_5()`, `i` is 3, and `ans[3]` is assigned the value of `a[3]`.**
