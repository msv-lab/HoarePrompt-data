Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is at least 3, `c` is the return value of `func_5()`, `ans` is a list of length `n`, and `ans` contains values from either `a` or `b` or `c` based on conditions checked during the loop iterations. Specifically, for each index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `ans[i]` is assigned either `a[i]`, `b[i]`, or `c[i]` depending on the previous value in `ans` and the corresponding values in `a` and `b`.**
