The variable `b` is assigned the value returned by `func_5()`. The values of `c` and `a` are both equal to the return value of `func_5()`, which means `b` will have the same value as `c` and `a`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `ans`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `n` is now the return value of `func_1()` which is at least 3; `c` is the return value of `func_5()`; `ans` is a list of length `n`; `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_5()`; `b` is equal to `c`, which is also equal to `a`.
