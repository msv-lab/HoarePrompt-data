The value of `at_start` is assigned `False`, which is its current value, so there is no change to this variable. The states of the other variables (`sep` and `file`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is set to its default value, `file` contains the string representation of `x` after writing, and `at_start` is False.

Output State: **`sep` is set to its default value, `file` contains the string representation of `x` after writing, and `at_start` is False.**
