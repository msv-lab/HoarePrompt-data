Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases where each test case involves creating a list `ans` of length `n` (with values from sequences `a`, `b`, and `c`). The function ensures that no two consecutive elements in `ans` are the same, picking values from `a`, `b`, or `c` based on the previous element. It does not accept any parameters and calls `func_20` with the final list `ans` for each test case. The implementation assumes that the sequences contain distinct integers, and the constraints of the input sequences are adhered to. However, the function does not handle cases where `func_1()` or `func_5()` might return invalid or unexpected values, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds error when accessing the lists.**
