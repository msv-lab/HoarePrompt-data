The value of `a` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`. The initial state indicates that `a` is equal to `c`, and since `c` is the return value of `func_5()`, `a` will now hold the value of `c`. The values of `t`, `n`, `b`, `ans`, and the conditions regarding the loop execution are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is the return value of `func_1()`, `c` is the return value of `func_5()`, `ans` contains values ensuring no two consecutive elements are equal, `a` is equal to `c`, `b` is equal to `c`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is the return value of `func_1()`, `c` is the return value of `func_5()`, `ans` contains values ensuring no two consecutive elements are equal, `a` is equal to `c`, `b` is equal to `c`.**
