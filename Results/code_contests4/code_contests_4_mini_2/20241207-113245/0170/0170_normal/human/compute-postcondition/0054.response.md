According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n-1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. Since `n` is at least 3, `i` can increment to 3 for the loop to execute a third time. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be 3, and `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 3, `c` is the return value of `func_5()`, and `i` is 3**
