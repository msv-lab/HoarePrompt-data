According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, the next value of `i` will be 2. 

At this point, we need to ensure that the loop can execute for the third time. Since `n` is at least 3, we know `i` (which is now 2) is still less than `n`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute a second time, `ans` would need to have its states updated based on the conditions involving `a`, `b`, and the comparison between `ans[i - 1]` and `a[i]`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is at least 3, `c` is the return value of `func_5()`, `ans` is a list of length `n`, initialized to all 0s, `a` is equal to `c`, `b` is equal to `c`, `ans[0]` is assigned the value of `a[0]`, `i` is 2**
