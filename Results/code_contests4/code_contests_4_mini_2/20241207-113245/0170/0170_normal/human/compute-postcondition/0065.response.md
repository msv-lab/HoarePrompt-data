The variable `b` is assigned the value returned by `func_5()`. The previous state of `b` was equal to `c`, but now `b` will take on the new value returned by `func_5()`. The other variables, `t`, `n`, `c`, `ans`, and `a`, are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is the return value of `func_1()`, `c` is the return value of `func_5()`, `ans` contains values ensuring no two consecutive elements are equal, `a` is equal to `c`, and `b` is now updated with the return value of `func_5()`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is the return value of `func_1()`, `c` is the return value of `func_5()`, `ans` contains values ensuring no two consecutive elements are equal, `a` is equal to `c`, and `b` is updated with the return value of `func_5()`**.
