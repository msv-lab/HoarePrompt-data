The code assigns the value of `b[i]` to `ans[i]`. Since `i` is 2, it means that `ans[2]` is now equal to `b[2]`. However, the values of `b` and `ans` are not explicitly provided, aside from the fact that `ans` is initialized to all 0s and `b` is equal to `c`, which is the return value of `func_5()`. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `ans[2]` without knowing `b[2]`.

Thus, the output state reflects that `ans[2]` is assigned the value of `b[2]`, but since `b[2]` is not determined, we only state that the assignment has taken place without specifying the values.

Output State: **`ans[2]` is assigned the value of `b[2]`**
