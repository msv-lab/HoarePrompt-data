In this scenario, `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `c[i]`. The variables involved and their states are as follows:

- `i` is 2, so we are focusing on the third element of the list `ans`, which is `ans[2]`.
- `c` is the return value of `func_5()`, and since it is not specified, we denote it as `c[i]` where `c` must be an iterable with at least 3 elements (because `n` is at least 3).
- `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized to all 0s, which means `ans` starts as `[0, 0, 0, ..., 0]` (with `n` total elements).

After executing `ans[i] = c[i]`, the value of `ans[2]` is updated to the value of `c[2]`.

Thus, the Output State reflects the change in the `ans` list:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is at least 3, `c` is the return value of `func_5()`, `ans` is a list of length `n` where `ans[2]` is now `c[2]`, `a` is equal to `c`, `b` is equal to `c`, `i` is 2**.
