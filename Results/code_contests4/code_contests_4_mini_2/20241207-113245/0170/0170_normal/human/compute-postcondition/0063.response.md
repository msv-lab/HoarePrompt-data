Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is the return value of `func_1()`, `c` is the return value of `func_5()`, `ans` contains values ensuring no two consecutive elements are equal, `a` is equal to `c`, `b` is equal to `c`, and for the loop to execute again, `func_1()` must return a value greater than `k` (the current iteration count).**
