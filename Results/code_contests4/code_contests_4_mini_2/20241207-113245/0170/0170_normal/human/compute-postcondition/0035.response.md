The variable `c` is assigned the value returned by the function `func_5()`. The initial state indicates that `c` is the return value of `func_5()` and is thus not changed by this assignment since it already holds that value. The other variables remain unaffected in this step. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `n` is now the return value of `func_1()` which is at least 3; `c` is the return value of `func_5()`; `ans` is a list of length `n`; `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_5()`; `b` is equal to `c` and `a`.
