The variable `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `b[i]`. The previous values of `b` are not specified, but `b` is equal to `c`, which is the return value of `func_5()`. Since `i` is equal to 1, the value of `ans[1]` will now be updated to `b[1]`. The other variables maintain their previous state. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is at least 3, `c` is the return value of `func_5()`, `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized to all 0s, `a` is equal to `c`, `b` is equal to `c`, `ans[0]` is assigned the value of `a[0]`, `i` is 1, `ans[1]` is now equal to `b[1]`, and the value of `ans[i - 1]` is equal to `a[i]` and is not equal to `b[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is at least 3, `c` is the return value of `func_5()`, `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized to all 0s, `a` is equal to `c`, `b` is equal to `c`, `ans[0]` is assigned the value of `a[0]`, `i` is 1, `ans[1]` is now equal to `b[1]`, and the value of `ans[i - 1]` is equal to `a[i]` and is not equal to `b[i]`.**
