The code initializes the list `ans` with `n` elements, all set to 0. The previous values of the affected variables are as follows: `n` is at least 3, which means the length of `ans` will be at least 3. The other variables' values remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `n` is at least 3; `c` is the return value of `func_5()`; `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized to all 0s; `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_5()`; `b` is equal to `c` and `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `n` is at least 3; `c` is the return value of `func_5()`; `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized to all 0s; `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_5()`; `b` is equal to `c` and `a`.**
