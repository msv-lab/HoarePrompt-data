The value of `n` is assigned the return value of `func_1()`. Given that `n` is at least 3, the return value from `func_1()` must also be at least 3. The previous state of `n` is unknown, but it is affected by the assignment. The state of `t`, `c`, `ans`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is now the return value of `func_1()` which is at least 3, `c` is the return value of `func_5()`, `ans` is a list of length `n`, and `func_1()` must return a value greater than `k` for the loop to execute one more time.
