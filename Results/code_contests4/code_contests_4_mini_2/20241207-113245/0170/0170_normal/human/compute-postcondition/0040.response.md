The statement assigns the value of `a[i]` to `ans[i]`. The value of `i` is 1, and since `ans[i - 1]` (which is `ans[0]`) is not equal to `a[i]`, we can proceed with the assignment. The previous value of `ans[0]` is `a[0]`, and `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized to all 0s.

After the execution:
- `ans[1]` will be assigned the value of `a[1]`.

The output state will reflect that `ans[1]` is now equal to `a[1]`, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is at least 3, `c` is the return value of `func_5()`, `ans` is a list of length `n` with `ans[0]` equal to `a[0]` and `ans[1]` equal to `a[1]`, `a` is equal to `c`, `b` is equal to `c`, `i` is 1, and `ans[i - 1]` is not equal to `a[i]`**.
