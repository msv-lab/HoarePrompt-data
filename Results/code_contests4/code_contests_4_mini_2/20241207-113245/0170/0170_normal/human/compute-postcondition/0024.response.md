The function `func_20` does not accept any explicit parameters as per the provided definition. However, it operates based on the following input constraints: 

- The first argument is an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, there is an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by three sequences of `n` integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, where each integer in the sequences is in the range (1 ≤ a_i, b_i, c_i ≤ 100). It is guaranteed that a_i ≠ b_i, a_i ≠ c_i, b_i ≠ c_i for all i.

The output is not explicitly detailed, but the function presumably processes these inputs in some manner, likely returning results based on the evaluations of the input sequences. 

Since the specific outputs or return values are not defined in the information provided, we will summarize the functionality based on the accepted constraints.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly; it processes multiple test cases containing sequences of integers, and it evaluates these sequences based on the specified constraints and relationships. The exact output is not specified.**
