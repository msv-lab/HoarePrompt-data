The `file.write(sep)` method is called, which writes the value of `sep` to the `file`. The variable `file` contains the string representation of `x`. The value of `sep` is set to its default, but the specific default value is not provided; thus, it remains unknown. The other variables `at_start` and `args` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is set to its default value, `file` contains the string representation of `x`, `at_start` is False, and `args` is a non-empty iterable.

Output State: **`sep` is set to its default value, `file` contains the string representation of `x`, `at_start` is False, and `args` is a non-empty iterable.**
