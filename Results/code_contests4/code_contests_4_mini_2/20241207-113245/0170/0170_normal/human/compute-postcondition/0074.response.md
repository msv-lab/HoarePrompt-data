The variable `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `b[i]`. The previous state indicates that `b` has been updated with the return value of `func_5()`, and `ans` is a list initialized with zeros. The index `i` is currently 1, and it is provided that `ans[i - 1]` is equal to `a[i]` and not equal to `b[i]`. 

Therefore, `ans[1]` is now assigned the value of `b[1]`. This means that `ans` at index 1 will now hold the value of whatever `b[1]` is, while the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is at least 2, `c` is updated with the return value of `func_5()`, `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with zeros, `a` is equal to `c`, `b` is updated with the return value of `func_5()`, `ans[0]` is now equal to `a[0]`, `i` is 1, `ans[i - 1]` is equal to `a[i]`, `ans[i - 1]` is not equal to `b[i]`, `ans[i]` is now equal to `b[i]`.**
