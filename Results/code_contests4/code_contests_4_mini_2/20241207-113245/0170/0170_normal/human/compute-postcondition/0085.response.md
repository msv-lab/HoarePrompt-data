According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. Given that `n` is at least 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. The value of `i` will then be 3. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 3 because the upper limit of the loop is `n - 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 3, `c` is updated with the return value of `func_5()`, `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with zeros, `a` is equal to `c`, `b` is updated with the return value of `func_5()`, `ans[0]` is now equal to `a[0]`, `i` is 3**
