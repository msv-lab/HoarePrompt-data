Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is at least 2, `c` is updated with the return value of `func_5()`, `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with zeros, `a` is equal to `c`, `b` is updated with the return value of `func_5()`, `ans[0]` is now equal to `a[0]`, and `i` is 1. If `ans[0]` is not equal to `a[1]`, then `ans[1]` is now equal to `a[1]`. Otherwise, if `ans[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`, then `ans[1]` is now equal to `b[1]`; if not, `ans[1]` is equal to `c[1]`.***
