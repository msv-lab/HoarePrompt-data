To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we analyze the loop and its conditions carefully. 

1. The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `n - 1`.
2. Each iteration checks the values of `ans[i - 1]`, `a[i]`, and `b[i]`, assigning `ans[i]` based on specific conditions:
   - If `ans[i - 1]` is not equal to `a[i]`, then `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `a[i]`.
   - If that condition is not met but `ans[i - 1]` is not equal to `b[i]`, then `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `b[i]`.
   - If both conditions fail, `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `c[i]`.

Given that `a` and `b` are both initialized to `c`, this means that in all iterations, if `ans[i - 1]` is equal to `c[i]`, then any previous values assigned from `a` and `b` will likely dictate the outcome.

After iterating through the loop for all values from `1` to `n - 1`, `ans` will be populated as follows:
- `ans[0]` is initialized to `a[0]`.
- For each subsequent index `i`, depending on the previous value in `ans`, it will either take a value from `a`, `b`, or `c`.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop, `ans` will contain values based on the distinct values found in `a`, `b`, and `c`, ensuring that no two consecutive elements are the same.

In the case where `n = 3`, the loop will execute two times (for `i = 1` and `i = 2`), and the output state will reflect the contents of `ans` as determined by the aforementioned conditions.

Considering that `t` remains constrained between `1` and `100`, and `n` is at least `3`, the final output state encapsulates the structure of `ans` after all iterations.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is at least 3, `c` is the return value of `func_5()`, `ans` contains values ensuring no two consecutive elements are equal, `a` is equal to `c`, `b` is equal to `c`.**
