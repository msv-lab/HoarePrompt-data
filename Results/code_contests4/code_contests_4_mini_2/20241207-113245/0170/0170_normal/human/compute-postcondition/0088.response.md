In the provided code, `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `c[i]`. Since `i` is equal to 3, the value assigned to `ans[3]` is `c[3]`. 

The previous values are:
- `c` is updated with the return value of `func_5()`, which means `c` is defined, but its specific values are not known.
- Since `ans` is initialized with zeros and has a length of `n`, `ans[3]` will be updated to the value of `c[3]`.

Other variables remain unchanged and are not directly affected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state reflects the update made to `ans` and acknowledges the values of other variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `n` is greater than 3; `c` is updated with the return value of `func_5()`; `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with zeros; `a` is equal to `c`; `b` is updated with the return value of `func_5()`; `ans[0]` is now equal to `a[0]`; `i` is 3; `ans[3]` is updated to `c[3]`.**
