The value of `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `a[i]`. The initial state indicates that `a` is equal to `c`, and since `c` is the return value of `func_5()`, it can be assumed that `a` is a list or similar structure with at least 3 elements (since `n` is at least 3). 

The variable `i` is 2, which means we are accessing the third element of the list `a` (considering 0-based indexing). The value at `a[2]` will be assigned to `ans[2]`. 

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is at least 3, `c` is the return value of `func_5()`, `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized to all 0s, `a` is equal to `c`, `b` is equal to `c`, `ans[0]` is assigned the value of `a[0]`, and `ans[2]` is now assigned the value of `a[2]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is at least 3, `c` is the return value of `func_5()`, `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized to all 0s, `a` is equal to `c`, `b` is equal to `c`, `ans[0]` is assigned the value of `a[0]`, `ans[2]` is assigned the value of `a[2]`.**
