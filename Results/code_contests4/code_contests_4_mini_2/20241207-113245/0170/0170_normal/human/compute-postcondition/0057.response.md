The code assigns the value of `c[i]` to `ans[i]`. The variable `i` is 3, so the code accesses the value at index 3 of `c` and assigns it to index 3 of `ans`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` do not change as a result of this line. Since `c` is the return value of `func_5()`, we assume that `c` has been defined and holds a value for index 3. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 3, `c` is the return value of `func_5()`, `i` is 3, and `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `c[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 3, `c` is the return value of `func_5()`, `i` is 3, and `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `c[i]`.**
