The `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` method attempts to remove the key `'end'` from the `kwargs` dictionary and returns its value if it exists; otherwise, it returns the default value `'\n'`. The returned value is then written to `file`.

Since the initial state does not provide specific details about the contents of `kwargs`, we can only conclude that the value written to `file` will either be the value associated with the key `'end'` in `kwargs` (if it exists) or the default newline character `'\n'` (if it does not).

The other variables (`sep`, `file`, `at_start`, and `args`) are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state will reflect the impact of the `pop` operation on `kwargs` and the action of writing the value to `file`.

Output State: **`sep` is set to its default value, `file` contains the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable, and a value has been written to `file` (either the value of kwargs['end'] or '\n').**
