According to the code, the loop iterates over the `args` iterable. For the loop to execute again, there must be at least one more item in `args` that hasn't been processed yet. At the end of the last iteration, `at_start` is False, which means the loop has already started iterating over `args`. Since `args` is a non-empty iterable, we have already consumed at least one item from it, and `x` is currently set to the last item processed in the last iteration.

To determine the state for the next iteration, we need to consider that if there are more items in `args`, `x` will take the next item in the iterable. Therefore, the state needs to reflect that `x` will be set to the next item in `args`, and we need to indicate that the iteration has progressed.

State: **`sep` is set to its default value, `file` contains the string representation of `x`, `at_start` is False, and for the loop to execute one more time `args` must contain at least one more item, and `x` will be the next item in `args`.**
