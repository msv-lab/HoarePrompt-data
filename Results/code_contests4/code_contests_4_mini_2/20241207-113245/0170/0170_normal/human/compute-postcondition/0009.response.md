According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `args` iterable. If `args` contains more elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is the first element in `args`, and `at_start` is set to False, indicating that we are not at the start. Since `args` is a non-empty iterable and `x` is the first element, for the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be updated to the next element in `args`. Therefore, if `x` is currently the first element, we need to set `x` to the second element.

State: **`sep` is set to its default value, `file` is set to its default value and now contains the string representation of `x`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable, and `x` is the second element in `args`.**
