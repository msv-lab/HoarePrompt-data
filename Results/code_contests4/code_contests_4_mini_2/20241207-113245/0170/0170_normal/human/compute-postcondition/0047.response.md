Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is at least 3, `c` is the return value of `func_5()`, `ans` is a list of length `n`, initialized to all 0s, `a` is equal to `c`, `b` is equal to `c`, `ans[0]` is assigned the value of `a[0]`, and `i` is 1. If `ans[i - 1]` is not equal to `a[i]`, then `ans[1]` is equal to `a[1]` and `ans[i - 1]` is equal to `a[i]`. Otherwise, `ans[i - 1]` is equal to `b[i]` and `ans[i]` is equal to `c[i]`.***
