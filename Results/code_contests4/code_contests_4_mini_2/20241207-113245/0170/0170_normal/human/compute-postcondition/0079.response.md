According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop is set to iterate from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `1`, and since `n` is at least `2`, the loop has the potential to execute again. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by `1`, resulting in `i` being `2`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `2`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is at least 2, `c` is updated with the return value of `func_5()`, `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with zeros, `a` is equal to `c`, `b` is updated with the return value of `func_5()`, `ans[0]` is now equal to `a[0]`, and `i` is 2; for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 2.**
