The code `ans[i] = a[i]` assigns the value of `a[i]` to `ans[i]`. The previous state indicates that `a` is equal to `c`, which is updated with the return value of `func_5()`, and `ans` is initialized with zeros. The value of `i` is 1, so `ans[1]` will be updated with the value of `a[1]`. The other variables remain unaffected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is at least 2, `c` is updated with the return value of `func_5()`, `ans` is a list of length `n`, initialized with zeros, `a` is equal to `c`, `b` is updated with the return value of `func_5()`, `ans[0]` is now equal to `a[0]`, `i` is 1, and `ans[1]` is now equal to `a[1]`.**
