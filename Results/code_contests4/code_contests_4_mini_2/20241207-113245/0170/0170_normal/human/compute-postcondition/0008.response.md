The value of `at_start` is assigned as `False`, and since it was already `False`, there are no changes to the value of `at_start`. The other variables `sep`, `file`, and `args` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is set to its default value, `file` is set to its default value and now contains the string representation of `x`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable, and `x` is the first element in `args`.

Output State: **`sep` is set to its default value, `file` is set to its default value and now contains the string representation of `x`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable, and `x` is the first element in `args`.**
