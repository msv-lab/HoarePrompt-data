The value of `b` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`, and since `i` is 3, `ans[i]` will be updated to `b[i]`. The list `ans` was initialized with zeros, so `ans[3]` will now hold the value of `b[3]`. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 3, `c` is updated with the return value of `func_5()`, `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with zeros, `a` is equal to `c`, `b` is updated with the return value of `func_5()`, `ans[0]` is equal to `a[0]`, `i` is 3, and `ans[3]` is now equal to `b[3]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 3, `c` is updated with the return value of `func_5()`, `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with zeros, `a` is equal to `c`, `b` is updated with the return value of `func_5()`, `ans[0]` is equal to `a[0]`, `i` is 3, and `ans[3]` is now equal to `b[3]**
