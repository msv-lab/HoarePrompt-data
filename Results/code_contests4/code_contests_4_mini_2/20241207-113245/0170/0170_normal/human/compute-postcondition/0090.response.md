Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 3, `c` is updated with the return value of `func_5()`, `ans` is a list of length `n`, initialized with zeros except `ans[3]`, which is now equal to `a[3]`, `a` is equal to `c`, `b` is updated with the return value of `func_5()`, `ans[0]` is equal to `a[0]`, and `i` is 3. If `ans[2]` is not equal to `a[3]`, then `ans[3]` is now equal to `b[3]`. Otherwise, `ans[3]` is updated to `c[3]`.***
