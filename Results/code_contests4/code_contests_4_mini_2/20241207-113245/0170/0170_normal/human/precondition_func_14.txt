x is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ x ≤ 100), y is an integer representing the number of elements in the sequences for each test case (3 ≤ y ≤ 100), and p consists of three lists of integers (a, b, c) where each list has y integers (1 ≤ a_i, b_i, c_i ≤ 100) and for all i, a_i ≠ b_i, a_i ≠ c_i, b_i ≠ c_i.
