l is a list of tuples, each containing three sequences of integers where each sequence has the same length n (3 ≤ n ≤ 100) and the elements are such that a_i ≠ b_i, a_i ≠ c_i, b_i ≠ c_i for all i. The value of t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) indicates the number of test cases. Each sequence element is an integer within the range 1 ≤ a_i, b_i, c_i ≤ 100.
