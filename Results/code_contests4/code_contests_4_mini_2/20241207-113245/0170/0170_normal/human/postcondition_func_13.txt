The function accepts an integer `x`, representing the number of test cases, and a list `y` containing three sequences of integers. It attempts to return the result of integer division of `x` by `y`, but the implementation is incorrect as it tries to perform integer division between an integer and a list, which will raise a TypeError. Therefore, the function does not work as intended and will not return any valid results.
