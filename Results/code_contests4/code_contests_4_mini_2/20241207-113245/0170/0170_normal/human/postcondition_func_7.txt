The function accepts a list of tuples `l`, where each tuple contains three sequences of integers. It returns the list sorted in descending order based on a key defined by `getKey`. The function assumes that the input list always contains valid tuples as per the specified constraints and does not handle cases where the input may be malformed or does not meet these constraints.
