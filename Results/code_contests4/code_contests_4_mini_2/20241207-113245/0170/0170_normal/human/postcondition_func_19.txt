The function does not directly accept parameters but is intended to print multiple values formatted according to specified keyword arguments. It writes string representations of elements in `args` to a specified output stream, separated by a defined separator and ending with a defined end character. However, the function does not handle or process the test cases or sequences of integers as described in the precondition comments. The actual implementation does not include logic to evaluate or manipulate these sequences.
