Precondition: **The first argument is an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by three sequences of n integers a, b, and c, where each integer in the sequences is in the range (1 ≤ a_i, b_i, c_i ≤ 100) and it is guaranteed that a_i ≠ b_i, a_i ≠ c_i, b_i ≠ c_i for all i.**
