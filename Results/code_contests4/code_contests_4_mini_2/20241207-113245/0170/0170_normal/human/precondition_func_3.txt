t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, n is an integer (3 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of elements in the sequences. The sequences a, b, and c each contain n integers (1 ≤ a_i, b_i, c_i ≤ 100) such that a_i ≠ b_i, a_i ≠ c_i, and b_i ≠ c_i for all i.
