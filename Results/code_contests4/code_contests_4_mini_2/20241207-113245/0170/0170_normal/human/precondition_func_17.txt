The function is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case consists of three sequences (a, b, c) of integers with the same length n (3 ≤ n ≤ 100), and for each index i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), a_i, b_i, and c_i are distinct integers (1 ≤ a_i, b_i, c_i ≤ 100). The number of test cases t is such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
