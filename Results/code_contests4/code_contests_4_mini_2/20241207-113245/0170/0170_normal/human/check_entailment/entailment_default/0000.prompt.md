You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those output hints describes certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given three sequences: a_1, a_2, …, a_n; b_1, b_2, …, b_n; c_1, c_2, …, c_n.

For each i, a_i ≠ b_i, a_i ≠ c_i, b_i ≠ c_i.

Find a sequence p_1, p_2, …, p_n, that satisfy the following conditions:

  * p_i ∈ \\{a_i, b_i, c_i\}
  * p_i ≠ p_{(i mod n) + 1}.



In other words, for each element, you need to choose one of the three possible values, such that no two adjacent elements (where we consider elements i,i+1 adjacent for i<n and also elements 1 and n) will have equal value.

It can be proved that in the given constraints solution always exists. You don't need to minimize/maximize anything, you need to find any proper sequence.

Input

The first line of input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100): the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 100): the number of elements in the given sequences.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, …, b_n (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 100).

The fourth line contains n integers c_1, c_2, …, c_n (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100).

It is guaranteed that a_i ≠ b_i, a_i ≠ c_i, b_i ≠ c_i for all i.

Output

For each test case, print n integers: p_1, p_2, …, p_n (p_i ∈ \\{a_i, b_i, c_i\}, p_i ≠ p_{i mod n + 1}).

If there are several solutions, you can print any.

1 2 3
1 2 1 2
1 3 4 3 2 4 2
1 3 2
1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 2

Note

In the first test case p = [1, 2, 3].

It is a correct answer, because:

  * p_1 = 1 = a_1, p_2 = 2 = b_2, p_3 = 3 = c_3 
  * p_1 ≠ p_2 , p_2 ≠ p_3 , p_3 ≠ p_1 



All possible correct answers to this test case are: [1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], [3, 2, 1].

In the second test case p = [1, 2, 1, 2].

In this sequence p_1 = a_1, p_2 = a_2, p_3 = a_3, p_4 = a_4. Also we can see, that no two adjacent elements of the sequence are equal.

In the third test case p = [1, 3, 4, 3, 2, 4, 2].

In this sequence p_1 = a_1, p_2 = a_2, p_3 = b_3, p_4 = b_4, p_5 = b_5, p_6 = c_6, p_7 = c_7. Also we can see, that no two adjacent elements of the sequence are equal.
Functions with output description for each function:
Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output decription for function1:  The function accepts no parameters and returns an integer value obtained from user input. This integer is independent of the initial values of t, n, a, b, or c.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return input()
''' 

 Output decription for function2:  The function accepts user input and returns it as output. However, it does not enforce any constraints or validate the input against the specified conditions (1 ≤ t ≤ 100, 3 ≤ n ≤ 100, and lists a, b, and c containing integers between 1 and 100 with specific inequality conditions). Thus, the function may return any input without checking if it adheres to these constraints.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().strip().split(' '))
''' 

 Output decription for function3:  The function accepts input from the user, which consists of multiple integers representing three sequences a, b, and c for each test case. It returns an iterable sequence of integers extracted from the input, but it does not handle the number of test cases or any validation of the input format. It only processes the input as a single string of integers separated by spaces and converts them to integers.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    return map(str, input().strip().split(' '))
''' 

 Output decription for function4:  The function accepts no parameters and reads a line of input, returning a map object that contains the string representations of the integers inputted, split by spaces. It does not handle any test cases directly within the function and assumes that the input will be provided correctly according to the stated constraints.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return list(func_3())
''' 

 Output decription for function5:  The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters and returns a list generated by the call to `func_3`. The specifics of that list depend on the implementation of `func_3`, which is not provided here. However, it is assumed that the list adheres to the integer and list constraints defined in the initial state.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1000000)
    threading.stack_size(1024000)
    thread = threading.Thread(target=main)
    thread.start()
''' 

 Output decription for function6:  The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters and starts a new thread that runs the `main` function. It is designed to handle multiple test cases, but the actual logic for processing these test cases is not included in this function; it only sets up the threading environment for executing `main`.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7(item):
    return item[1]
''' 

 Output decription for function7:  The function accepts a tuple `item` containing three sequences (lists of integers) and returns the second sequence (list of integers) from the tuple. It does not perform any validation on the input structure or contents, so it assumes that the input is always correctly formatted as specified in the annotations.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(l):
    return sorted(l, key=getKey, reverse=True)
''' 

 Output decription for function8:  The function accepts a list of tuples `l`, where each tuple contains three sequences of integers. It returns the list sorted in descending order based on a key defined by `getKey`. The function assumes that the input list always contains valid tuples as per the specified constraints and does not handle cases where the input may be malformed or does not meet these constraints.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9(n, m, num):
    return [[num for x in range(m)] for y in range(n)]
''' 

 Output decription for function9:  The function accepts two integer parameters `n` and `m`, and an integer `num`. It returns a matrix of size `n x m`, where each element in the matrix is filled with the value `num`. The function does not handle cases where `n` or `m` might be less than 1, as the constraints ensure they will be at least 3 and 1 respectively, so it is not expected to raise any errors based on these parameters.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10(x):
    return x and (not x & x - 1)
''' 

 Output decription for function10:  The function accepts a tuple `x` containing three sequences of integers (a, b, c) and returns a boolean value that indicates whether `x` is not equal to `x & (x - 1)`. The function does not return the tuple `x` as stated in the annotations; it only evaluates and returns the boolean expression. Note that the boolean expression evaluates to `True` if `x` is not a power of two, and `False` if it is. The conditions on the sequences (a[i] ≠ b[i], a[i] ≠ c[i], b[i] ≠ c[i]) do not affect the functionality of the boolean expression.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11(n):
    return bin(n).replace('0b', '')
''' 

 Output decription for function11:  The function accepts an integer `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 100) and returns its binary representation as a string, omitting the '0b' prefix.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(n):
    return [int(i) for i in str(n)]
''' 

 Output decription for function12:  The function accepts an integer `n`, where 3 ≤ n ≤ 100, and returns a list of integers representing the individual digits of `n`.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(n, r):
    return factorial(n) // (factorial(r) * factorial(max(n - r, 1)))
''' 

 Output decription for function13:  The function accepts an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 100) and an integer `r` (1 ≤ r < n) and returns the binomial coefficient C(n, r) computed as factorial(n) // (factorial(r) * factorial(n - r)). Note that the provided `r` must be an integer and not a list, as the code suggests the use of a single integer for `r` in the computation. The function does not handle cases where `r` is out of the specified range (i.e., less than 1 or greater than n-1), which may lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14(x, y):
    if x % y == 0:
        return x // y
    else:
        return x // y + 1
''' 

 Output decription for function14:  The function accepts an integer `x`, representing the number of test cases, and a list `y` containing three sequences of integers. It attempts to return the result of integer division of `x` by `y`, but the implementation is incorrect as it tries to perform integer division between an integer and a list, which will raise a TypeError. Therefore, the function does not work as intended and will not return any valid results.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15(x, y, p):
    res = 1
    x %= p
    while y > 0:
        if y & 1:
            res = res * x % p
        y = y >> 1
        x = x * x % p
    return res
''' 

 Output decription for function15:  The function accepts three integer parameters `x`, `y`, and `p`. It calculates `x` raised to the power of `y` modulo `p`, returning the result. The final output is dependent on the values of `x`, `y`, and `p`, and it does not always return 1; the return value can vary based on the input values.
Function number 16 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_16(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
''' 

 Output decription for function16:  The function accepts an integer `x` representing the number of test cases and a list `y` of tuples containing test case details. It calculates and returns the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of `x` and the first element of the last tuple in `y`. However, if `y` is initially empty, the function will return `x` as it won't enter the loop. The function does not utilize any of the integers or lists in the tuples beyond the first integer of the last tuple in `y`, which may not be the intended behavior based on the provided context.
Function number 17 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_17(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i = i + 6
    return True
''' 

 Output decription for function17:  Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (where `3 ≤ n ≤ 100`) and evaluates whether `n` is a prime number. It returns `False` if `n` is less than or equal to 1, if `n` is less than or equal to 3 (but greater than 1), or if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3. It also checks divisibility by other potential factors up to the square root of `n`. If `n` passes all these checks, it returns `True`, indicating that `n` is a prime number. However, since the function does not handle cases where `n` is exactly 3 correctly in the annotations, it should return `True` for `n = 3`, which is a prime number.
Function number 18 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_18():
    sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
    sys.stdout = open('output.txt', 'w')
''' 

 Output decription for function18:  The function reads multiple test cases from 'input.txt', where each test case consists of three sequences of distinct integers. It does not process or return any results based on the sequences, as there is no further logic implemented after reading the input. The function also does not handle any output beyond opening 'output.txt' for writing, leaving the actual handling of the sequences and their results unimplemented. Therefore, it simply prepares to read input and write output without performing any operations on the sequences.
Function number 19 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_19():
    for _ in range(func_1()):
        n = func_1()
        a = func_5()

            else:
                ans[i] = c[i]
        func_20(*ans)
''' 

 Output decription for function19:  The function processes multiple test cases where each test case involves creating a list `ans` of length `n` (with values from sequences `a`, `b`, and `c`). The function ensures that no two consecutive elements in `ans` are the same, picking values from `a`, `b`, or `c` based on the previous element. It does not accept any parameters and calls `func_20` with the final list `ans` for each test case. The implementation assumes that the sequences contain distinct integers, and the constraints of the input sequences are adhered to. However, the function does not handle cases where `func_1()` or `func_5()` might return invalid or unexpected values, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds error when accessing the lists.

 Output decription for function20:  The function does not directly accept parameters but is intended to print multiple values formatted according to specified keyword arguments. It writes string representations of elements in `args` to a specified output stream, separated by a defined separator and ending with a defined end character. However, the function does not handle or process the test cases or sequences of integers as described in the precondition comments. The actual implementation does not include logic to evaluate or manipulate these sequences.



First I want you to try to see if the program (including all the functions) does what the description says. Look at only the code and the description and make an initial assesment.Try to think of any edge cases that the code might not be handling.

Then I want you to see if the output hints agree with the code. Sometimes the output hints hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the output hints says are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to make a more informed decision and detrmine if the code is correct or not.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code.
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
