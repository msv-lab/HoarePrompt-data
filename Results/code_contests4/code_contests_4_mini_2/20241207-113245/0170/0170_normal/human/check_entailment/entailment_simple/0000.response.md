To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the specified problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the `func_19` function, which is the core function responsible for producing the required output based on the input sequences `a`, `b`, and `c`.

### Breakdown of the Program Logic

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The function first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` (the number of elements in each sequence) and the sequences `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Output Sequence Construction**:
   - An output list `ans` is initialized to store the selected values.
   - The first element of `ans` is directly assigned from `a[0]`.
   - The program then iterates over the remaining indices from `1` to `n-1`:
     - If the last added value (from `ans`) is not equal to the current value in `a`, it assigns `ans[i] = a[i]`.
     - If the last added value is equal to `a[i]` but not equal to `b[i]`, it assigns `ans[i] = b[i]`.
     - If both conditions fail, it assigns `ans[i] = c[i]`.

3. **Final Output**:
   - The function `func_20` is called to print the constructed sequence `ans`.

### Analysis Against Problem Description

The problem requires:
- For each index `i`, `p[i]` must be chosen from the set `{a[i], b[i], c[i]}`.
- No two adjacent elements (`p[i]` and `p[(i mod n) + 1]`) should be equal.

The implemented logic does:
- Ensure that `p[i]` is always chosen from `{a[i], b[i], c[i]}` since it directly assigns from these sequences.
- Ensure that `p[i]` is not equal to `p[i-1]` (the previous element) due to the checks before assignment:

  - The first element is assigned from `a`, and each subsequent element checks against the last added value in `ans` to prevent duplicates.

### Conclusion

The program correctly adheres to the problem's requirements. It is guaranteed that a valid sequence can be constructed based on the provided constraints (distinct values in each sequence) and the conditions are enforced during the construction of `ans`.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
