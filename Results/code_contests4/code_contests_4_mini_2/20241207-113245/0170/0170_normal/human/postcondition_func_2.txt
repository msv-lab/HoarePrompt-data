The function accepts input from the user, which consists of multiple integers representing three sequences a, b, and c for each test case. It returns an iterable sequence of integers extracted from the input, but it does not handle the number of test cases or any validation of the input format. It only processes the input as a single string of integers separated by spaces and converts them to integers.
