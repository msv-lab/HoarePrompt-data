Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (where `3 ≤ n ≤ 100`) and evaluates whether `n` is a prime number. It returns `False` if `n` is less than or equal to 1, if `n` is less than or equal to 3 (but greater than 1), or if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3. It also checks divisibility by other potential factors up to the square root of `n`. If `n` passes all these checks, it returns `True`, indicating that `n` is a prime number. However, since the function does not handle cases where `n` is exactly 3 correctly in the annotations, it should return `True` for `n = 3`, which is a prime number.
