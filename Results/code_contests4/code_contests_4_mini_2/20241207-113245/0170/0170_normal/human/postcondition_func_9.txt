The function accepts a tuple `x` containing three sequences of integers (a, b, c) and returns a boolean value that indicates whether `x` is not equal to `x & (x - 1)`. The function does not return the tuple `x` as stated in the annotations; it only evaluates and returns the boolean expression. Note that the boolean expression evaluates to `True` if `x` is not a power of two, and `False` if it is. The conditions on the sequences (a[i] ≠ b[i], a[i] ≠ c[i], b[i] ≠ c[i]) do not affect the functionality of the boolean expression.
