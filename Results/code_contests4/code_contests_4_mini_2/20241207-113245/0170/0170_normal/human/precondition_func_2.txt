t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases; for each test case, n is an integer (3 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of elements in each sequence, followed by three sequences a, b, and c, each containing n integers (1 ≤ a_i, b_i, c_i ≤ 100) where for all i, a_i ≠ b_i, a_i ≠ c_i, and b_i ≠ c_i.
