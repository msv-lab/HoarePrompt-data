The function accepts an integer `x` representing the number of test cases and a list `y` of tuples containing test case details. It calculates and returns the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of `x` and the first element of the last tuple in `y`. However, if `y` is initially empty, the function will return `x` as it won't enter the loop. The function does not utilize any of the integers or lists in the tuples beyond the first integer of the last tuple in `y`, which may not be the intended behavior based on the provided context.
