The function reads multiple test cases from 'input.txt', where each test case consists of three sequences of distinct integers. It does not process or return any results based on the sequences, as there is no further logic implemented after reading the input. The function also does not handle any output beyond opening 'output.txt' for writing, leaving the actual handling of the sequences and their results unimplemented. Therefore, it simply prepares to read input and write output without performing any operations on the sequences.
