The function accepts an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 100) and an integer `r` (1 ≤ r < n) and returns the binomial coefficient C(n, r) computed as factorial(n) // (factorial(r) * factorial(n - r)). Note that the provided `r` must be an integer and not a list, as the code suggests the use of a single integer for `r` in the computation. The function does not handle cases where `r` is out of the specified range (i.e., less than 1 or greater than n-1), which may lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
