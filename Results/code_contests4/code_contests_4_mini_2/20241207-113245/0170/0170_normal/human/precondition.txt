t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases; for each test case, n is an integer (3 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of elements in the sequences; a, b, and c are lists of n integers where each integer (1 ≤ a_i, b_i, c_i ≤ 100) meets the condition that a_i ≠ b_i, a_i ≠ c_i, and b_i ≠ c_i for all i.
