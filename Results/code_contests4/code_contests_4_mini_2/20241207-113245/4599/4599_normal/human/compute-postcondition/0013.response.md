The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `s`. The parameter `t` is a positive integer constrained between 1 and 1000, inclusive. The parameter `n` is also a positive integer constrained between 1 and 50, inclusive, for each test case. The parameter `s` is a binary string with a length of 2n - 1, consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'. 

The function processes these inputs and returns an output based on the contents of the binary string `s` in relation to the values of `t` and `n`. However, since the explicit return value and conditions are not provided in the output section, we cannot specify the exact nature of the return value.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t` (a positive integer), `n` (a positive integer), and `s` (a binary string of length 2n - 1).**
