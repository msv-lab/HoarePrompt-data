The code `print(s[::2])` outputs every second character from the string `s`. The variable `t` is incremented by 1, but its final value is not relevant to the output since the code does not affect its display. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not used in this snippet. The output will be the characters of `s` at even indices.

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is `t + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, and the output is the even-indexed characters of `s`.

Output State: **`t` is `t + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, and the output is the even-indexed characters of `s`.**
