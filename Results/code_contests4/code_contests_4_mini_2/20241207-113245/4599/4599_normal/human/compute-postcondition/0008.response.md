According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the number of iterations defined by the input integer (let's call it `input_value`). If `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, this means that the loop has executed `t` times so far. At the end of the last iteration, the loop has processed the first `t` iterations, which indicates that it must execute again if `input_value` is greater than `t`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` will be incremented by 1, making `t` equal to `t + 1`. Moreover, for the loop to execute again, it is necessary that `input_value` is greater than `t`. 

State: **`t` is `t + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time `input_value` must be greater than `t + 1`**
