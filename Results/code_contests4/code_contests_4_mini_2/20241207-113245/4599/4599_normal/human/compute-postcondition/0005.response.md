The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variable `t` is not directly affected by this code, but it is provided that `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000. Therefore, the output state reflects that `t` remains unchanged and `n` is an input integer.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000); `n` is an input integer**
