The value of `s` is assigned the value from `input()`, which accepts a user input. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is already defined as `t + 1`, and `n` is an input integer that is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is `t + 1`, `n` is an input integer, and `s` is an input string.

Output State: **`t` is `t + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string**
