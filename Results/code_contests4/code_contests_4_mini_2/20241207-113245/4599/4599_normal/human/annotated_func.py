#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) for each test case, and s is a binary string of length 2n - 1 consisting only of characters '0' and '1'.
def func_1():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        print(s[::2])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), `s` is the last input binary string of length `2n - 1`, and the output consists of the even-indexed characters of each binary string `s` from each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a binary string `s` of length `2n - 1`. The function then prints the characters from `s` located at even indices for each test case. If no input is provided for `n` or `s`, it may lead to unexpected behavior, as the function does not handle input validation or errors.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) for each test case, and s is a binary string of length 2n - 1 containing only the characters '0' and '1'.
def func_2():
    return [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    #The program returns a list of integers parsed from the input string, where each integer is derived from splitting the binary string 's' by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a binary string input, splits it by spaces, and returns a list of integers parsed from the resulting substrings. It does not handle any input validation or error checking, so it assumes the input format is correct and that the split results in valid integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: o is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a binary string s of length 2n - 1 consisting of characters '0' and '1'. The length of the list o is between 1 and 1000.
def func_3(o):
    return [(int(x) + o) for x in input().split()]
    #The program returns a list of integers where each integer is the sum of an element from the input split by spaces and the list 'o' which contains tuples of integers and binary strings.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of tuples `o` and reads a line of input containing space-separated values. It returns a list of integers, where each integer is the sum of each integer from the input and the list `o`. However, the code currently will raise an error because `o` is treated as an integer in the expression `int(x) + o`, which is not valid. The intended behavior seems to be to add the integer from the input to the first element of each tuple in `o`, but this logic is not correctly implemented in the current code.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, m is a binary string of length 2n - 1 consisting of characters '0' and '1'.
def func_4(n, m):
    return [func_2() for _ in range(n)]
    #The program returns a list of length n containing the results of func_2() called n times
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a binary string `m`. It returns a list containing the results of calling `func_2()` a total of `n` times. The binary string `m` is not utilized within the function, which may indicate a potential oversight or missing functionality.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 for each test case, and s is a binary string of length 2n - 1 containing only characters '0' and '1'.
def func_5(f):
    return [func_5(f, *dim[1:]) for _ in range(dim[0])] if dim else f()
    #The program returns a list created by calling func_5 with f and additional dimensions for each iteration in the range defined by dim[0] if dim is not empty; otherwise, it returns the result of calling f().
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a callable parameter `f` and recursively generates a list of results by calling `func_5` with `f` and additional dimensions from `dim`, specified by `dim[0]`. If `dim` is empty, it returns the direct result of calling `f()`. The function relies on the existence of `dim`, which must be defined beforehand, otherwise, it will raise an error if `dim` is not initialized.
