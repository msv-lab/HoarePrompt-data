The function accepts a list of tuples `o` and reads a line of input containing space-separated values. It returns a list of integers, where each integer is the sum of each integer from the input and the list `o`. However, the code currently will raise an error because `o` is treated as an integer in the expression `int(x) + o`, which is not valid. The intended behavior seems to be to add the integer from the input to the first element of each tuple in `o`, but this logic is not correctly implemented in the current code.
