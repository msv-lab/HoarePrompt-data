The function accepts a positive integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a binary string `s` of length `2n - 1`. The function then prints the characters from `s` located at even indices for each test case. If no input is provided for `n` or `s`, it may lead to unexpected behavior, as the function does not handle input validation or errors.
