You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A binary string is a string where each character is either 0 or 1. Two binary strings a and b of equal length are similar, if they have the same character in some position (there exists an integer i such that a_i = b_i). For example:

  * 10010 and 01111 are similar (they have the same character in position 4); 
  * 10010 and 11111 are similar; 
  * 111 and 111 are similar; 
  * 0110 and 1001 are not similar. 



You are given an integer n and a binary string s consisting of 2n-1 characters. Let's denote s[l..r] as the contiguous substring of s starting with l-th character and ending with r-th character (in other words, s[l..r] = s_l s_{l + 1} s_{l + 2} ... s_r).

You have to construct a binary string w of length n which is similar to all of the following strings: s[1..n], s[2..n+1], s[3..n+2], ..., s[n..2n-1].

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).

The second line of each test case contains the binary string s of length 2n - 1. Each character s_i is either 0 or 1.

Output

For each test case, print the corresponding binary string w of length n. If there are multiple such strings — print any of them. It can be shown that at least one string w meeting the constraints always exists.

Note

The explanation of the sample case (equal characters in equal positions are bold):

The first test case: 

  * 1 is similar to s[1..1] = 1. 



The second test case: 

  * 000 is similar to s[1..3] = 000; 
  * 000 is similar to s[2..4] = 000; 
  * 000 is similar to s[3..5] = 000. 



The third test case: 

  * 1010 is similar to s[1..4] = 1110; 
  * 1010 is similar to s[2..5] = 1100; 
  * 1010 is similar to s[3..6] = 1000; 
  * 1010 is similar to s[4..7] = 0000. 



The fourth test case: 

  * 00 is similar to s[1..2] = 10; 
  * 00 is similar to s[2..3] = 01. 
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) for each test case, and s is a binary string of length 2n - 1 consisting only of characters '0' and '1'.
def func_1():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        print(s[::2])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), `s` is the last input binary string of length `2n - 1`, and the output consists of the even-indexed characters of each binary string `s` from each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a binary string `s` of length `2n - 1`. The function then prints the characters from `s` located at even indices for each test case. If no input is provided for `n` or `s`, it may lead to unexpected behavior, as the function does not handle input validation or errors.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) for each test case, and s is a binary string of length 2n - 1 containing only the characters '0' and '1'.
def func_2():
    return [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    #The program returns a list of integers parsed from the input string, where each integer is derived from splitting the binary string 's' by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a binary string input, splits it by spaces, and returns a list of integers parsed from the resulting substrings. It does not handle any input validation or error checking, so it assumes the input format is correct and that the split results in valid integers.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: o is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a binary string s of length 2n - 1 consisting of characters '0' and '1'. The length of the list o is between 1 and 1000.
def func_3(o):
    return [(int(x) + o) for x in input().split()]
    #The program returns a list of integers where each integer is the sum of an element from the input split by spaces and the list 'o' which contains tuples of integers and binary strings.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of tuples `o` and reads a line of input containing space-separated values. It returns a list of integers, where each integer is the sum of each integer from the input and the list `o`. However, the code currently will raise an error because `o` is treated as an integer in the expression `int(x) + o`, which is not valid. The intended behavior seems to be to add the integer from the input to the first element of each tuple in `o`, but this logic is not correctly implemented in the current code.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, m is a binary string of length 2n - 1 consisting of characters '0' and '1'.
def func_4(n, m):
    return [func_2() for _ in range(n)]
    #The program returns a list of length n containing the results of func_2() called n times
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a binary string `m`. It returns a list containing the results of calling `func_2()` a total of `n` times. The binary string `m` is not utilized within the function, which may indicate a potential oversight or missing functionality.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 for each test case, and s is a binary string of length 2n - 1 containing only characters '0' and '1'.
def func_5(f):
    return [func_5(f, *dim[1:]) for _ in range(dim[0])] if dim else f()
    #The program returns a list created by calling func_5 with f and additional dimensions for each iteration in the range defined by dim[0] if dim is not empty; otherwise, it returns the result of calling f().
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a callable parameter `f` and recursively generates a list of results by calling `func_5` with `f` and additional dimensions from `dim`, specified by `dim[0]`. If `dim` is empty, it returns the direct result of calling `f()`. The function relies on the existence of `dim`, which must be defined beforehand, otherwise, it will raise an error if `dim` is not initialized.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
