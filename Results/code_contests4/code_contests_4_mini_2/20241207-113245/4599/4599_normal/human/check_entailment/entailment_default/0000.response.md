To assess the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the provided code and the descriptions step by step.

### Problem Description Recap:
We need to construct a binary string `w` of length `n` that is similar to multiple contiguous substrings of a binary string `s` of length `2n - 1`. The substrings of `s` we are concerned with are `s[1..n], s[2..n+1], ..., s[n..2n-1]`.

### Function Analysis:
#### Function 1:
```python
def func_1():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        print(s[::2])
```
- This function reads an integer `t` (number of test cases).
- For each test case, it reads `n` and the binary string `s`.
- It prints every second character from `s` (starting from index 0), which corresponds to the characters at even indices.

### Output Description Check:
- The function is designed to output a string of length `n` that is formed by taking characters from `s` at even indices. 
- The output description suggests that while the function does produce a binary string, it does not ensure that this string is similar to all required substrings of `s`. 

### Edge Case Analysis:
1. **Length Constraints**: The length of `s` is `2n - 1`, so the indices accessed by `s[::2]` will always be valid for the given constraints.
2. **Similarity Check**: By only taking characters from even indices, we may not form a string that is similar to all required substrings of `s`. 
   - For instance, consider the case where `s = "1110000"` and `n = 4`. The substrings to compare against are:
     - `s[1..4] = "1110"`
     - `s[2..5] = "1100"`
     - `s[3..6] = "1000"`
     - `s[4..7] = "0000"`
   - Taking `s[::2]` produces `w = "100"`, which may not be similar to all substrings since it fails to match the character positions of all substrings.

### Agreement with Output Hints:
The output description mentions that the function prints characters at even indices, but does not verify if the resulting string `w` holds similarity to all required substrings from `s`. This indicates a mismatch between what the function does and what is required by the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The function does not guarantee that the output string `w` is similar to all specified substrings of `s`. This misalignment with the problem requirements leads to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**. 

The function can output a string that is not similar to all required substrings, violating the problem's constraints. For example, using the input `n = 4` and `s = "1110000"` leads to an output that does not match all expected substring similarities.
