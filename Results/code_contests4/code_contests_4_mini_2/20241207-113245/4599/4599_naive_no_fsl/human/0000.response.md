Correctness: **False**

The provided program attempts to construct a binary string `w` of length `n` that is similar to the specified substrings of the binary string `s`. However, the logic used in `print(s[::2])` selects every second character from the input string `s`, starting from the first character. 

This approach does not guarantee that the resulting string `w` will be similar to all the required substrings. For example, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
4
1010101
```

The substrings to check for similarity are:
- `s[1..4] = 1010`
- `s[2..5] = 0101`
- `s[3..6] = 1010`
- `s[4..7] = 0101`

If we run the program with this input, `print(s[::2])` will produce `111`, which is not similar to the required substrings. 

Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements for every potential case, confirming that it is incorrect.
