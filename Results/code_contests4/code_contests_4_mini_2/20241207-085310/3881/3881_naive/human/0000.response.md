To analyze the given program against the problem description, let's break down the requirements and assess the code.

### Problem Description:
- The program reads pairs of words and page numbers.
- Each word can appear with multiple page numbers, but each pair is unique (a word does not appear on the same page more than once).
- The output should list words in alphabetical order followed by their respective page numbers in ascending order.

### Provided Program:
```python
def func_1():
    index = defaultdict(list)
    for line in stdin:
        (word, page) = line.split()
        index[word].append(int(page))
    for word in sorted(index):
        print(word)
        print(*sorted(index[word]))
    exit()
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()
```

### Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads from `stdin` which is appropriate for capturing multiple lines of input until EOF.
   - It splits each line into a word and a page number. The conversion of the page number to an integer is correct.

2. **Storing Data**:
   - The program uses `defaultdict(list)` to store page numbers for each word, ensuring that multiple pages can be recorded for the same word.

3. **Sorting and Output**:
   - The program sorts the words alphabetically and the page numbers in ascending order before printing them, which meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

### Potential Issues:
- The program does not handle the case where the input is malformed. For example, if a line does not contain exactly two elements (a word and a page number), the program will raise an error when trying to unpack the result of `line.split()`. 
- If a page number is not a valid integer, the program will also raise a ValueError when trying to convert it using `int(page)`.
- There are no checks for the constraints mentioned in the problem description, such as a word exceeding 30 characters or a page number being greater than 1000.

### Conclusion:
Since the program lacks error handling for malformed input and does not enforce constraints specified in the problem description, it may fail for certain inputs. Therefore, it does not meet the completeness required by the problem.

Correctness: **False**. 

**Example of failure**: If the input contains a line like `style abc`, it will raise a ValueError because `abc` cannot be converted to an integer.
