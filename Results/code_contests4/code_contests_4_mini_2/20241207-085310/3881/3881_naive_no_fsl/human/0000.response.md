To determine the correctness of the provided Python program according to the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads pairs of words and page numbers from standard input. It splits each line into a word and a page number.

2. **Data Structure**: The program uses a `defaultdict` from the `collections` module to create a mapping from words to a list of their corresponding page numbers. This allows the program to handle multiple entries for the same word.

3. **Storing Page Numbers**: The program appends the page number (converted to an integer) to the list corresponding to the word. According to the problem description, a word cannot appear more than once on the same page, so there are no concerns about duplicate page numbers for a specific word in the list.

4. **Sorting**: After collecting all inputs, the program sorts the words alphabetically and then sorts the page numbers for each word in ascending order.

5. **Output**: The program prints each word followed by its corresponding sorted list of page numbers.

Now, let's consider edge cases and potential issues:

- **Empty Input**: The program does not handle the case where there is no input at all. It will still attempt to process and print, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

- **Input Format**: The program assumes that every line contains a valid word and a valid page number. If the input does not conform to this format (e.g., missing page number or non-integer values), it will raise an error.

- **Character Limits**: The program does not enforce the restriction that a word consists of at most 30 characters. If a word longer than 30 characters is input, it will still be processed without any error.

- **Page Number Limits**: The program does not enforce the restriction that page numbers must be less than or equal to 1000. If a page number greater than 1000 is input, it will still be accepted without an error.

Given these points, the program does not meet the complete specifications of the problem description due to its handling of various potential input scenarios. There are cases where it does not work as expected.

Correctness: **False** 

The program fails to handle empty input, invalid input formats, and does not enforce the specified character and page number limits.
