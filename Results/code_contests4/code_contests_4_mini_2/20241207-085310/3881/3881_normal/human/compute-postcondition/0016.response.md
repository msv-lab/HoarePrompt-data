The code prints the values associated with the key `word` in the `index` dictionary, where the values are sorted. The variable `word` contains the second word in sorted order from the keys of `index`, and `index` is a defaultdict that holds lists as values. Since `word` has already been printed, it is being used here to access the corresponding list in `index`.

The output will be the sorted list of words associated with `word`. The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`index` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory containing at least two words as keys; `word` is the second word in sorted order from `index`; the associated words from `index[word]` have been printed in sorted order.**
