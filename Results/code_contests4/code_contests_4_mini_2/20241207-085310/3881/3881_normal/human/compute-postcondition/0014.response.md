According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the contents of the `index`. The loop iterates over the sorted keys of the `index`. At the end of the last iteration, `word` is the first word in sorted order from `index`, which means there are still more words to iterate over in the `index`. 

To execute the loop one more time, we need to consider that `word` must be updated to the next key in the sorted order of `index`. If `index` contains at least two words, the next iteration can take place. After the current iteration, `word` will change to the second word in sorted order.

State: **`index` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory containing at least two words as keys; `word` is the second word in sorted order from `index`.**
