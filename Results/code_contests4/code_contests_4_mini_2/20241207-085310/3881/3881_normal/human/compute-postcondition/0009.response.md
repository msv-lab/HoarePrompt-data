The code `index[word].append(int(page))` takes the `word` variable and uses it as a key in the `index` defaultdict. The `page` variable, which is a string that can be converted to an integer, is converted to an integer using `int(page)`. This integer value is then appended to the list associated with the `word` key in the `index` defaultdict.

The state of the `index` defaultdict will be updated to include the new integer value under the list corresponding to the `word`. Since `word` and `page` are assigned values that allow the loop to execute one more time, it indicates that the operation is being performed within a loop context.

Therefore, the output state reflects the changes to the `index` defaultdict based on the values of `word` and `page`. 

Output State: **`index` is updated with `word` as key and `int(page)` appended to its list**.
