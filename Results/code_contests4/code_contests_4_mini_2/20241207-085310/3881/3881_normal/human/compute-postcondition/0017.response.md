According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `index` and how many unique keys it has. If `index` contains at least 3 unique words, the loop can execute again for the next word in sorted order. At the end of the last iteration, `word` is the second word in sorted order from `index` and we have printed the associated words from `index[word]`. 

Since `word` is the second word, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to move to the third word in sorted order. Therefore, `word` must be updated to the third word in sorted order from `index`.

State: **`index` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory containing at least three words as keys, `word` is the third word in sorted order from `index`.**
