According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on whether there are more lines in stdin to read. At the end of the last iteration, `index` is a defaultdict with lists as the default factory, `word` and `page` are set to the values obtained from the last line read. For the loop to be executed one more time, there needs to be another line available in stdin to split into `word` and `page`.

State: **`index` is a defaultdict with lists as the default factory; for the loop to execute one more time, there must be another line in stdin to read and split into `word` and `page`.**
