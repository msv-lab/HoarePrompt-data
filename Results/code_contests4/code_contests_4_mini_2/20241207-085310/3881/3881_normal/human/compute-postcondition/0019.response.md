The `print(*sorted(index[word]))` statement prints the elements of the list associated with the key `word` in the `index` dictionary, sorted in ascending order. The previous state indicates that `word` is the third word in sorted order from `index`, meaning `index[word]` is a list that contains the words associated with `word`. 

Since `word` is specifically defined as the third word in the sorted order of the keys present in `index`, the output will include the sorted list of words related to that key.

The states of the other variables are not affected, and the output will be a printed result of the sorted list. Therefore, the Output State is: `index` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory containing at least three words as keys; `word` is the third word in sorted order from `index`, and it is printed as a sorted list.

Output State: **`index` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory containing at least three words as keys; `word` is the third word in sorted order from `index`, and it is printed as a sorted list.**
