The code `exit()` is called, which terminates the program execution. No variables are modified or affected by this command. Therefore, the output state is simply the existing state of the variables, along with the indication that the program has exited.

Output State: **`index` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory containing all words as keys in sorted order; each word has been printed followed by its associated page numbers in sorted order, and the program has exited.**
