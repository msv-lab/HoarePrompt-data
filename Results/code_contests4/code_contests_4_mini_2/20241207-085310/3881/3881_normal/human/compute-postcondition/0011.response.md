According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the contents of `index`. The loop will iterate over the sorted keys of the `index`, which means that `index` must contain at least one key (word) for the loop to execute. 

At the beginning of the loop, `index` is a defaultdict that may or may not contain any entries. If it is empty, the loop will not execute. So, we need to ensure that `index` contains at least one word, and the first word in sorted order would be the first key of `index`.

State: **`index` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory containing at least one word as a key for the loop to execute, and the first word in sorted order is the first key in `index`**
