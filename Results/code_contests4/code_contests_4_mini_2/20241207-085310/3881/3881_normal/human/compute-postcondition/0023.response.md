Functionality: ** The function processes pairs of strings (words) and positive integers (page numbers) inputted from standard input. It creates a mapping of each word to a list of page numbers where the word appears. After processing the input, it prints each word in sorted order followed by the sorted list of page numbers associated with that word. The function does not return any value but terminates after printing the results. It assumes valid input constraints such as words being at most 30 characters long, page numbers being positive integers not exceeding 1000, and each word appearing at most once per page.**
