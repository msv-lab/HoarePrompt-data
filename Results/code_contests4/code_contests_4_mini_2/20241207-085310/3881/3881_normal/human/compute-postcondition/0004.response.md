According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the availability of more lines in `stdin`. At the end of the last iteration, `word` and `page` are assigned values from splitting the first line of `stdin`, and `index[word]` has been updated with the integer value of `page`. To execute the loop one more time, there must be another line in `stdin` to read. Therefore, `index` remains the same, but `word` and `page` must be updated based on the new line read from `stdin`.

State: **`index` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory; `word` and `page` are assigned the values obtained by splitting the next line of stdin; `index[word]` is updated to include the integer value of `page`.**
