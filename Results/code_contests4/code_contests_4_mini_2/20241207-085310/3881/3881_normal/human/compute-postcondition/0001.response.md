According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are lines to read from `stdin`. The state of `index` before the loop starts does not affect whether the loop can execute since it is purely a structure for storing data. The relevant condition for the loop's execution is the availability of input from `stdin`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `stdin` must have at least 1 line to read.

State: **`index` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, for the loop to execute the first time stdin has at least 1 line**
