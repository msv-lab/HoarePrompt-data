Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads pairs of words and page numbers from standard input, which aligns with the requirement to process a list of word-page number pairs.

2. **Data Structure**: It uses a `defaultdict` from the `collections` module to store words as keys and their corresponding page numbers as a list of integers. This allows it to efficiently collect all page numbers associated with each word, adhering to the condition that a word does not appear on the same page more than once.

3. **Sorting**: The program sorts the words alphabetically when printing them. For each word, it also sorts the associated page numbers in ascending order before printing. This satisfies the output format specified in the problem description.

4. **Output Format**: Each word is printed followed by its list of corresponding page numbers. The program correctly implements the output format without any deviations.

5. **Constraints**: The program respects the constraints mentioned in the problem description (e.g., word length, page number limit, and the maximum number of pairs). It assumes valid input and handles it accordingly.

Overall, the program processes the input correctly, organizes the data as required, and produces the output in the specified format, thus fulfilling all aspects of the problem description.
