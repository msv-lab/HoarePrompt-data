To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's break down the requirements and the code.

### Problem Description:
The program needs to read pairs of words and page numbers, and then output each word in alphabetical order along with a list of corresponding page numbers in ascending order.

### Code Analysis:
The code uses `defaultdict` to map each word to a list of page numbers. It reads from standard input until EOF, splits each line into a word and a page number, and appends the page number to the list for that word. Finally, it sorts the words and prints each word followed by its sorted list of page numbers.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Empty Input**: If there's no input, the program should not crash; it should simply output nothing.
2. **Single Entry**: If only one word-page pair is provided, the output should correctly reflect that single entry.
3. **Multiple Pages for One Word**: The program must ensure that if a word appears multiple times with different page numbers, those page numbers are aggregated and sorted correctly.
4. **Words with Mixed Case**: The problem does not specify case sensitivity. If mixed-case words (e.g., "Word" and "word") are provided, the program should handle them as distinct entries.

### Output Hints:
The output hints describe the program's functionality accurately, including the points about sorting words and page numbers. They also mention the assumption of valid input constraints.

### Conclusion:
Upon reviewing the code and the problem description, the code appears to correctly implement the requirements described. It aggregates page numbers for each word, sorts them, and prints them as specified.

However, one potential edge case is handling mixed-case words. The program does not normalize the case of the words before sorting. Thus, "apple" and "Apple" would be treated as different words, which may not be the intended behavior depending on whether the problem description requires case insensitivity.

Given this, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case (specifically with respect to mixed case sensitivity).

Correctness: **False**. 

Explanation: The program does not handle mixed-case words consistently, leading to potentially incorrect output depending on the input provided.
