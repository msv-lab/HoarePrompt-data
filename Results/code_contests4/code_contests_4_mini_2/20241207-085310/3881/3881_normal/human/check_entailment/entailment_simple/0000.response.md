Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Hereâ€™s why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads pairs of a word and a page number from standard input (`stdin`). Each line is split into a word and a page number, which aligns with the problem's input format.

2. **Data Structure**: It uses a `defaultdict` of lists to store the words as keys and their corresponding page numbers as values. This ensures that multiple page numbers can be associated with the same word, which is necessary since the description allows for multiple entries of a word with different page numbers.

3. **Sorting**: After collecting the data, the program sorts the words in alphabetical order using `sorted(index)`. For each word, it then sorts the page numbers in ascending order using `sorted(index[word])`. This fulfills the requirement that both the words and their associated page numbers are printed in the specified order.

4. **Output Format**: The program prints each word followed by its list of sorted page numbers, which matches the required output format in the problem description.

5. **Constraints Compliance**: The program adheres to the constraints specified: it handles words of at most 30 characters, page numbers that are positive integers less than or equal to 1000, and a maximum of 100 word-page pairs. It also ensures that each word does not appear more than once per page by storing the page numbers in a list that only accumulates unique entries per word.

Thus, since the program correctly implements the logic required to process the input, sort it, and format the output as specified, it is deemed correct.
