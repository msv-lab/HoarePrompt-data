The variable `SCORE` is assigned the value of `int(0)`, which simply converts the integer 0 to an integer type (although it's already an integer). The values of `A`, `B`, and `testSNs` remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `A` and `B` are integers such that 1 ≤ `A`, `B` ≤ 9; `testSNs` is a list of strings from the input split by spaces; `SCORE` is 0.

Output State: **`A` and `B` are integers such that 1 ≤ `A`, `B` ≤ 9; `testSNs` is a list of strings from the input split by spaces; `SCORE` is 0**
