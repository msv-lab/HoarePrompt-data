The code `SCORE += testSNs[x]` increments the value of `SCORE` by the value located at the index `x` of the list `testSNs`. The value of `x` is incremented to `x + 1` as stated in the initial state, but since this line is executed after that increment, the current value of `x` used in the operation is `x + 1`. 

Since the loop is executing for a second time, we know that `testSNs[0]` is greater than `x + 1`. The specific values of `A`, `B`, and `testSNs` are not provided, but the impact of the code means that `SCORE` will increase by the value at `testSNs[x + 1]`.

Therefore, the output state reflects this change:

Output State: **`A` and `B` are integers between 1 and 9; `SCORE` is increased by the value of `testSNs[x + 1]`**.
