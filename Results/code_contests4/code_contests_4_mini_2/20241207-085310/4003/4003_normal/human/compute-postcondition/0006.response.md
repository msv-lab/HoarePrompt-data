The values of the variables do not change, but we continue with the execution of the loop or statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is an integer between 1 and 9, `B` is an integer between 1 and 9, `SCORE` is 0, `testSNs` is a list containing at least one element that can be converted to the integer 1 or greater, `testSNs[0]` is 1, and the last digit of `testSNs[x]` is 0, and we continue with the execution.
