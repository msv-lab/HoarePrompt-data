The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, the constraints indicate that the function might be expected to work with two integers, `A` and `B`, where both are in the range of 1 to 9. Since the output is not specified, we cannot determine the exact behavior of the function based on the provided information. Therefore, we cannot provide a clear description of its functionality without further details on the expected output or operations performed within the function.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters and the output behavior is not specified based on the given constraints.**
