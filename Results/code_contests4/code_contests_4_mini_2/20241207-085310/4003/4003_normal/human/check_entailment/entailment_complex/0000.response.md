Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements specified in the problem description. Here are the reasons why it fails:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input().split()` to read input, which suggests it is written for Python 2. Additionally, it reads the input as strings and does not convert them to integers before performing operations on them. The problem description states that the inputs A and B are integers, and the program needs to handle them as such.

2. **Logic for Summation**: The loop `for x in range(testSNs[0]):` incorrectly uses the first element of `testSNs` as the range, which does not correspond to the number of integers provided. The program should be iterating over the elements of `testSNs` directly.

3. **Condition for Error Output**: The program is supposed to check if the sum of A and B is 10 or greater and print `error` in that case. Instead, the program checks if individual elements are multiples of 10, which is not relevant to the problem statement.

4. **Output**: The output of the program (`print(SCORE)`) does not conform to the required output format. If the sum is 10 or greater, it should output the string `error`, but the program does not include this logic.

In summary, the program does not implement the necessary checks and computations as outlined in the problem description, leading to incorrect behavior.
