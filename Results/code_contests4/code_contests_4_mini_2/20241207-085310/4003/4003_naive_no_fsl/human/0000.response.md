Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic as described in the problem statement. 

Here are the issues:

1. The line `for x in range(testSNs[0]):` incorrectly uses `testSNs[0]` (which is a string) as the range limit instead of iterating over the two inputs, `A` and `B`. This will lead to a `TypeError` because `testSNs[0]` is not an integer.

2. The conditional `if not testSNs[x] % 10 is 0:` does not check for the sum of `A` and `B`. Instead, it checks if individual elements are multiples of 10, which is irrelevant to the problem.

3. There is no logic to compute the sum of `A` and `B`, nor any condition to check if this sum is 10 or greater. 

4. The output logic does not handle the requirement to print "error" when the sum is 10 or greater.

As a specific case where the program fails: 

- Input: `6 4`
  - The expected output is `error`, but the program will either raise an error or output `0` because it does not compute the sum correctly.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
