To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze both the problem requirements and the implementation.

### Problem Requirements:
The task is to count how many "beautiful" numbers Polycarp has celebrated. A "beautiful" number consists of only one digit repeated one or more times, such as 1, 22, 333, etc. 

### Beautiful Numbers:
For any given `n`, the beautiful numbers from `1` to `n` can be represented as:
- 1, 2, 3, ..., 9 (for all single-digit beautiful numbers)
- 11, 22, 33, ..., 99 (for two-digit beautiful numbers)
- 111, 222, ..., 999 (for three-digit beautiful numbers)
- 1111, 2222, ..., 9999 (for four-digit beautiful numbers)
- And so on, until we reach the maximum number of digits that can be formed with the same digit under the limit of `n`.

### Analysis of the Program:
The provided code does not correspond to the problem description. Instead, the code contains functions that seem unrelated to counting beautiful numbers and instead appears to be calculating a value based on the minimum and maximum of a list of integers. 

1. The function `func_8(X)` calculates `max(0, (maxX - minX - 2) * 2)`, which does not relate to counting beautiful numbers.
2. The loop iterates through test cases and calls this unrelated function, which produces an output that is not aligned with the requirement of counting beautiful numbers.

### Counterexample:
For the input `n = 18`, the expected output is `10` (the beautiful numbers are 1, 2, 3, ..., 9, and 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99). However, the given program will not produce this output.

### Conclusion:
The program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description, as it does not count beautiful numbers correctly.

Correctness: **False**.
