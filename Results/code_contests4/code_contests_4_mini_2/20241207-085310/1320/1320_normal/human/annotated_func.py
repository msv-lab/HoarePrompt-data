def func_1(s):
    sys.stdout.write(str(s))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of positive integers `s` and outputs the string representation of the list to standard output. It does not return any value or perform any processing on the contents of the list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string representing a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), where n is the number of years Polycarp has turned, and it is part of multiple test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
def func_2(s):
    sys.stdout.write(str(s))
    sys.stdout.write('\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` that represents a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and outputs this string to the standard output followed by a newline. The function does not perform any further processing or validation on the input string.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func_3():
    return int(readln())
    #The program returns an integer read from the input, which is a positive integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer input from the user, which must be a positive integer within the range of 1 to 10^9, and returns that integer.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func_4():
    return map(int, readln().split())
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained by splitting the input read from the standard input, which corresponds to the positive integer values for each test case n.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and reads a line of input from the standard input. It splits this input into individual components, converts them into integers, and returns an iterable (specifically a map object) of these integers. This iterable can contain positive integers corresponding to multiple test cases, but the function does not handle any edge cases related to the input format or potential errors in the input.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9).
def func_5():
    return readln()
    #The program returns input from the user corresponding to the number of test cases, where each input is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns the user input, which is expected to be a positive integer representing the number of test cases. However, it does not handle multiple test cases as suggested by the annotations; it only reads and returns one input value, which may not be sufficient if `t` is greater than 1. Additionally, there is no error handling for invalid input values beyond the expected range.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func_6():
    return readln().split()
    #The program returns a list of strings containing the input values read from standard input, split by whitespace, for each test case where n is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns a list of strings representing inputs read from standard input, split by whitespace. It is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case consists of positive integers. However, the code does not validate or process the values read beyond splitting them into a list, meaning that it does not enforce any constraints on the values of `n`, such as ensuring they are within the specified range of 1 to 10^9.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a tuple of positive integers, where each integer n satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. The length of args satisfies 1 ≤ len(args) ≤ 10^4.
def func_7():
    if debug :
        print(' '.join(map(str, args)))
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`args` is a tuple of positive integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and the length of `args` is between 1 and 10^4. If `debug` is true, the output is a string consisting of the integers in `args` joined by spaces. If `debug` is false, there are no further actions taken.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple of positive integers `args`, where each integer is constrained to be between 1 and 10^9, and the length of `args` is between 1 and 10^4. If the global variable `debug` is set to true, it prints the integers in `args` as a space-separated string; otherwise, it performs no action and returns nothing. There are no explicit return statements or output behavior defined beyond the debug print statement.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: X is a positive integer representing the number of years Polycarp has turned, such that 1 ≤ X ≤ 10^9.
def func_8(X):
    minX = min(X)
    maxX = max(X)
    return max(0, (maxX - minX - 2) * 2)
    #The program returns max(0, (X - X - 2) * 2) = max(0, (-2) * 2) = max(0, -4) = 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer X and attempts to calculate a value based on the minimum and maximum of X. However, since X is a single integer, both minX and maxX will always be equal to X. Consequently, the function always returns 0, regardless of the value of X.
