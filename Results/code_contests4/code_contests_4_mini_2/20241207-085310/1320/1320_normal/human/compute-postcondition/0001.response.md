The code assigns the maximum value from the iterable `X` to the variable `maxX`. Since `X` is a positive integer, it can be interpreted as an iterable containing a single value of `X`. Therefore, `maxX` will be equal to `X`. The variable `minX` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`X` is a positive integer; `minX` is `X`; `maxX` is `X`**
