The function `min` is called with the argument `X`, which is a positive integer representing the number of years Polycarp has turned. The `min` function will return the smallest value from the iterable provided. Since `X` is a single integer, `min(X)` will return `X` itself. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `X` is a positive integer representing the number of years Polycarp has turned; `minX` is `X`.

Output State: **`X` is a positive integer representing the number of years Polycarp has turned; `minX` is `X`**
