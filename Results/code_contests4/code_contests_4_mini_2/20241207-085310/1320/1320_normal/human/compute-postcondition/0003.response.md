The function `func_8` accepts a parameter `X`. `X` is a positive integer representing the number of years Polycarp has turned, constrained such that 1 ≤ X ≤ 10^9. After executing the function body, it returns the maximum value between 0 and the result of the expression (X - X - 2) * 2. Given that the expression simplifies to a negative value, the function ultimately returns 0 for any valid input. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_8` is to accept a positive integer `X` and return 0 regardless of the input value. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter X, which is a positive integer, and always returns 0.**
