Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the number of beautiful years Polycarp has celebrated. According to the problem description, a beautiful number consists of only one digit repeated one or more times (e.g., 1, 22, 333, etc.). 

1. The code does not contain any function that processes the input integers `n` to count how many beautiful numbers exist from 1 to `n`. 
2. The functions simply read or print the input without any computation related to counting beautiful numbers.
3. In particular, `func_8` is incorrectly structured as it takes a single integer `X` and tries to compute something using `min` and `max` functions, which makes no sense in the context of counting beautiful numbers, and it always returns 0, which is incorrect.
4. None of the functions provided implement the required logic to iterate through the integers from 1 to `n`, check if they are beautiful, and count them accordingly.

Given these issues, the code fails to meet the problem description's requirements for every potential case, as it does not perform the necessary calculations to determine the number of beautiful years.
