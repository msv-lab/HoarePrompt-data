To assess the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's first analyze the problem and the code provided.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to count how many "beautiful" years Polycarp has turned, where a beautiful number is defined as a number consisting of the same digit repeated (like 1, 22, 333, etc.). 

### Code Analysis
#### Functions Overview
1. **func_1** and **func_2**: Output functions that write to standard output. They do not process input or perform any calculations.
2. **func_3**: Reads an integer input (the number of test cases) and returns it.
3. **func_4**: Reads a line of input, splits it into integers, and returns them as a map object.
4. **func_5**: Reads and returns a single line of input; however, it does not handle multiple test cases.
5. **func_6**: Reads input and splits it into a list of strings but does not perform any validation or processing.
6. **func_7**: A debug function that prints provided integers if debug mode is on; it doesn't serve a functional purpose in the logic.
7. **func_8**: Attempts to compute a value based on the minimum and maximum of a list of integers but always returns 0, since `min(X)` and `max(X)` will always be equal when `X` is a single integer.

#### Main Logic
The for loop iterates over the number of test cases (from **func_3**), calling **func_4** to get the input values. It then calls **func_8** with these inputs, which will always return 0 because it calculates the difference between the minimum and maximum of a single integer.

### Output Hints Verification
The output hints suggest that the program should be calculating how many beautiful numbers exist from 1 to n for each test case. However, the provided functions do not process the logic to calculate beautiful numbers; they merely read input and output fixed or calculated values (which are incorrect). 

### Edge Cases
1. The expected output for inputs like `1` should yield `1` (for beautiful number `1`), and for `9`, it should yield `9` (for beautiful numbers `1` to `9`).
2. For `18`, it should yield `10` (counting `1` to `9` and `11`).
3. For `100500`, the expected output should be `45`, counting beautiful numbers like `1`, `2`, ..., `9`, `11`, ..., `99`.
4. The function **func_8** fails to count beautiful numbers correctly because it always returns `0`.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the count of beautiful numbers. It fails to process the input and compute the required values, thus not fulfilling the problem's requirements. 

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not correctly count the beautiful numbers as described in the problem statement, as evidenced by the output of `func_8`, which always returns `0` instead of the expected counts.
