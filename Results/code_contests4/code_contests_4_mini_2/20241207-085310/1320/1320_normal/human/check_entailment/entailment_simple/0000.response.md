The provided Python program does not implement the required functionality as described in the problem statement. The problem requires a function to calculate the number of "beautiful" years Polycarp has turned, which are defined as integers consisting of a single digit repeated one or more times (e.g., 1, 22, 333). 

Here's an analysis of the functions provided in the program:

1. **Function 1 - 8**: None of the functions actually perform the counting of beautiful numbers between 1 and n. They mostly handle input and output, but do not compute the result based on the definitions provided in the problem description.

2. **Function 8** attempts to use some logic with `min()` and `max()` but it does not relate to counting beautiful years. The logic presented in this function does not reflect any meaningful mathematical operation that pertains to the problem.

3. The program does not contain any logic that iterates through the range from 1 to n, checks for beautiful numbers, or counts them. 

The program, therefore, does not satisfy the requirements of the problem description. It fails to compute the count of beautiful years for each test case provided.

Since the program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description, we conclude that it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
