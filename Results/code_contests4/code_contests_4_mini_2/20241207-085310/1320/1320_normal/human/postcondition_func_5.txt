The function accepts no parameters and returns a list of strings representing inputs read from standard input, split by whitespace. It is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case consists of positive integers. However, the code does not validate or process the values read beyond splitting them into a list, meaning that it does not enforce any constraints on the values of `n`, such as ensuring they are within the specified range of 1 to 10^9.
