The function accepts no parameters and reads a line of input from the standard input. It splits this input into individual components, converts them into integers, and returns an iterable (specifically a map object) of these integers. This iterable can contain positive integers corresponding to multiple test cases, but the function does not handle any edge cases related to the input format or potential errors in the input.
