The function accepts a tuple of positive integers `args`, where each integer is constrained to be between 1 and 10^9, and the length of `args` is between 1 and 10^4. If the global variable `debug` is set to true, it prints the integers in `args` as a space-separated string; otherwise, it performs no action and returns nothing. There are no explicit return statements or output behavior defined beyond the debug print statement.
