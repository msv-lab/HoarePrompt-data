The function accepts no parameters and returns the user input, which is expected to be a positive integer representing the number of test cases. However, it does not handle multiple test cases as suggested by the annotations; it only reads and returns one input value, which may not be sufficient if `t` is greater than 1. Additionally, there is no error handling for invalid input values beyond the expected range.
