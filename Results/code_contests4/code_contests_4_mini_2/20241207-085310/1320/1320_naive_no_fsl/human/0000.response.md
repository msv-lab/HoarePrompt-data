Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. The task is to count the number of "beautiful" numbers between 1 and n, where a beautiful number is defined as a positive integer that consists of only one digit repeated one or more times (e.g., 1, 22, 333, 4444).

However, the program appears to be performing an entirely different operation. The `func_8` function calculates a value based on the minimum and maximum of the input list `X`, specifically the expression `(maxX - minX - 2) * 2`. This logic does not correspond to counting beautiful numbers as defined in the problem statement.

For instance, if `n = 18`, the beautiful numbers are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11 (total of 10). The program does not provide this correct count, indicating that it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description.

In conclusion, the output generated by the program will not match the expected counts of beautiful numbers for various inputs, making it incorrect. Therefore, there are many potential cases where the program will not produce the expected results as per the problem description.
