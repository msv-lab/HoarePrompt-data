The function accepts an even integer `n` (between 2 and 100,000) and a list `v` of `n` integers (each between 1 and 100,000). It separates the integers in `v` into even and odd indexed elements, counts the occurrences of each integer in both groups, and then calculates the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from `v` such that the most common integer in the even indexed elements is different from the most common integer in the odd indexed elements. The function finally prints this minimum value.
