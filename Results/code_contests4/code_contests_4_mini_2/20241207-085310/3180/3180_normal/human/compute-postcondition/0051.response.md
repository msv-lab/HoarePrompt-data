Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100000, `i` is less than 2, and `j` is 0. If `evenc_most_common[i][0]` is not equal to `oddc_most_common[j][0]`, then `b` is calculated as the difference between the length of `odd` and `oddc_most_common[j][1]`, and `m` is updated by appending the value of `a + b`.***
