The variable `odd` is assigned a list that contains elements from `v` at odd indices. The variable `v` is a list of `n` integers, where `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100000. The elements at odd indices of `v` will be selected, and since `n` is even, there will be `n/2` odd indices in `v`. The state of the other variables is not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `v` is a list of `n` integers; `even` is a list of integers from `v` at even indices; `odd` is a list of integers from `v` at odd indices.**
