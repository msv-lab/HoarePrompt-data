To compute the output state, we first need to analyze the given code snippet and the initial state of the variables.

1. The initial state specifies that `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100000. This means `n` is a specific even integer but we do not know its exact value. 

2. `i` is mentioned as being less than 2, which could mean it is either 0 or 1. Since `i` is used as an index in the expression `evenc_most_common[i][1]`, we need to understand that `evenc_most_common` must be a list or array where `i` can be validly used as an index.

3. For `j`, it is given as 2. 

4. The variables `a` and `b` are computed as follows:
   - `a` is computed as `len(even) - evenc_most_common[i][1]`, which means we subtract the second element of the list `evenc_most_common` indexed by `i` from the length of the list `even`.
   - `b` is computed as `len(odd) - oddc_most_common[2][1]`, which means we subtract the second element of the list `oddc_most_common` at index 2 from the length of the list `odd`.

5. The result of `a + b` is then appended to the list `m`.

Assuming that the lists `even`, `odd`, `evenc_most_common`, and `oddc_most_common` are defined and populated correctly, the values of `a` and `b` will be specific integers derived from their computations based on the lengths of the lists and the values at the specified indices.

However, since we do not know the exact values of `even`, `odd`, `evenc_most_common`, and `oddc_most_common`, we cannot precisely compute `a` and `b`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the operations performed without specific numerical results.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100000; `i` is less than 2; `j` is 2; `m` is updated by appending the sum of `a` and `b` where `a = len(even) - evenc_most_common[i][1]` and `b = len(odd) - oddc_most_common[2][1]**
