According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 2. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. Since the loop condition checks if `i` is less than 2, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be 2, and it will not execute since the range is 2 (0 and 1).

State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100000; for the loop to execute a second time, `i` is 2, the loop will not execute again because `i` is equal to the upper limit of the range.**
