According to the code, the loop iterates based on the range defined by `range(2)`, which means it will execute a total of 2 times, with `j` taking values 0 and 1. However, for the loop to execute a second time, the variable `i` must be less than 2, but currently, `i` is 2 after incrementing from 1. To allow the loop to execute a second time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than 2.

State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100000, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be adjusted to 1**
