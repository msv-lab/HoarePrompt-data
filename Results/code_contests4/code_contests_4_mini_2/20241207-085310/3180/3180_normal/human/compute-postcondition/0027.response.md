According to the code, the loop will execute a total of 2 times since the range is defined as `range(2)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has completed its last value of 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 

Since the range is from 0 to 1, the loop will not execute again after reaching `i = 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be less than 2. Since `i` is currently 1, we cannot adjust `i` to continue looping.

State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100000, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than 2, but currently `i` is 2 (after incrementing from 1)**
