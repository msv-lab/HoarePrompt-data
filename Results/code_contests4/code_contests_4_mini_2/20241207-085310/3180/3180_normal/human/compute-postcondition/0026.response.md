Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100000. If the first element of `evenc_most_common[i]` is not equal to the first element of `oddc_most_common[0]` and `oddc_most_common[1]`, then `m` contains the sums of the calculated values `a + b` for each valid comparison. If `evenc_most_common[i][0]` is equal to both `oddc_most_common[0][0]` and `oddc_most_common[1][0]`, then `m` remains unchanged from its initial state.**
