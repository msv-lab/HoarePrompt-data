Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100000. If `evenc_most_common[i][0]` is not equal to `oddc_most_common[j][0]`, then `a` is assigned the value of the length of `even` minus `evenc_most_common[i][1]`, `b` is assigned the value of the length of `odd` minus `oddc_most_common[j][1]`, and `m` is updated to the sum of `a` and `b`.***
