The variable `even` is assigned a list comprehension that filters the list `v` for elements where the index `i` is even. Given that `n` is an even integer, the even indices will include 0, 2, 4, ..., up to `n-2`. Therefore, `even` will contain the elements of `v` that are located at these even indices. The original list `v` remains unchanged. 

Since `n` is even and can range from 2 to 100000, the output state will reflect the fact that `even` is a list of integers from `v` at even indices. 

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000; `v` is a list of n integers; `even` is a list of integers from `v` at even indices.**
