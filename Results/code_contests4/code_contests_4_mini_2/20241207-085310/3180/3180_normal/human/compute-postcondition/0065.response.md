The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an even integer constrained between 2 and 100000. It also accepts a parameter `v`, which is a list containing `n` integers, where each integer in the list satisfies the condition that it is between 1 and 100000. The function processes these inputs and produces an output based on the given conditions and logic. However, the specific output based on the conditions is not provided in the input, so we cannot detail the return value. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n (an even integer between 2 and 100000) and a parameter v (a list of n integers, each between 1 and 100000).**
