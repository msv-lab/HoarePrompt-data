According to the code, the loop will execute exactly 2 times because `range(2)` generates the values 0 and 1 for the variable `i`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an even integer within the range of 2 to 100,000, which does not affect the execution of the loop itself since the loop only relies on the range specified.

At the end of the last iteration, the loop variable `i` will have taken on the values 0 and 1 sequentially. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time:

- `i` should be initialized to 0 before the first iteration.

State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 0**
