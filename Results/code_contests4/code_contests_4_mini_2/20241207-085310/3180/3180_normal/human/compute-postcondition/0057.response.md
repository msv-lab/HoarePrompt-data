According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` which is currently 1. The loop iterates over a range of 2, meaning it can execute for `j` values of 0 and 1. Since `j` is currently 1, the next value for `j` in the subsequent iteration would be 2, which is outside the range specified in the loop. Therefore, the loop cannot execute again.

State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100000, `i` is less than 2, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute again `j` must be less than 2**
