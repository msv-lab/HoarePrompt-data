According to the code, the loop iterates over `j` for a range of 2, which means it will execute for `j` values of 0 and 1. At the end of the last iteration, `j` would be 0 for the first execution. Since the loop has not completed its second iteration yet, `j` will be incremented to 1 for the next iteration. 

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `j` must be 1, and for the loop to complete its execution, it will also need to check the condition based on the first elements of `evenc_most_common` and `oddc_most_common`. 

State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100000, for the loop to execute a second time `j` is 1.**
