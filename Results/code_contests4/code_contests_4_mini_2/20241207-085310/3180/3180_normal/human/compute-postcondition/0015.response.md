Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100000. If the first element of `evenc_most_common[i]` is not equal to the first element of `oddc_most_common[j]`, then `a` is calculated as the length of `even` minus the second element of `evenc_most_common[0]`, `b` is calculated as the length of `odd` minus the second element of `oddc_most_common[j]`, and `m` is updated to include the value of `a + b`.***
