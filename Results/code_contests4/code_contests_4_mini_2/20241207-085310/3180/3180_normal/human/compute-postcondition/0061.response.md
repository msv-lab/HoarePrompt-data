Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100000, `i` is less than 2, and `j` is 2. If `evenc_most_common[i][0]` is not equal to `oddc_most_common[j][0]`, then `m` is updated by appending the sum of `a` and `b`, where `a` is the difference between the length of `even` and `evenc_most_common[i][1]`, and `b` is the difference between the length of `odd` and `oddc_most_common[2][1]`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
