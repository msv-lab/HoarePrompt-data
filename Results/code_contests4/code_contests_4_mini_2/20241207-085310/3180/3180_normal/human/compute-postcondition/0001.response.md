The variable `v` is assigned the value of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which means that `v` will contain a list of integers converted from the input string. The input string is expected to be a space-separated list of integers, and since `n` is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, the number of integers in the input will match `n`.

The values of the integers in `v` will depend on the input provided but will satisfy the condition that each integer `v_i` is between 1 and 100000. Other variables are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000; `v` is a list of n integers where each integer `v_i` satisfies 1 <= `v_i` <= 100000 from the input.**
