The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int()` converts it to an integer. However, `n` is already defined as an even integer within the specified range (2 to 100000), so `n` will retain its value after this assignment. Other variables are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000; `v` is a list of n integers where each integer v_i satisfies 1 <= v_i <= 100000**
