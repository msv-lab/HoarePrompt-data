According to the code, the loop executes a fixed number of times based on the range provided. In this case, the loop is set to execute for `j` in the range of 2, which means it will run for `j` values 0 and 1. At the end of the last iteration, `j` would have been 0 in the first execution and will be incremented to 1 for the second execution. 

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we note that `j` will be incremented to 1 for the next iteration. Since the loop is still within the defined range, it can execute again. After the second iteration, the value of `j` will be 1, and it will execute once more.

However, since the loop is set to run for `j` values of 0 and 1, and `j` will be incremented to 2 after the second iteration (which is out of bounds for the loop), the loop will not execute again after the second iteration.

Thus, for the loop to execute a second time, `j` should be 1, and we denote that the loop will not execute again since it will reach its limit.

State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100000, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be 1.**
