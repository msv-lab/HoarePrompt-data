According to the code, the loop is set to iterate over a range of 2, which means it will execute exactly 2 times regardless of the values of `n` and `i`. The variable `j` will take the values 0 and then 1 during these iterations. The initial values of `n` (an even integer between 2 and 100000) and `i` (0) do not affect the loop's ability to execute.

Thus, for the loop to execute:
- `n` can remain as it is (as it is not relevant to the loop's execution).
- `i` is initially 0, and it will not change during the execution of this loop.

State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 0, `j` is 0 for the first iteration, and `j` will be 1 for the second iteration**
