You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: A sequence a_1,a_2,... ,a_n is said to be /\/\/\/ when the following conditions are satisfied:

* For each i = 1,2,..., n-2, a_i = a_{i+2}.
* Exactly two different numbers appear in the sequence.



You are given a sequence v_1,v_2,...,v_n whose length is even. We would like to make this sequence /\/\/\/ by replacing some of its elements. Find the minimum number of elements that needs to be replaced.

Constraints

* 2 \leq n \leq 10^5
* n is even.
* 1 \leq v_i \leq 10^5
* v_i is an integer.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


n
v_1 v_2 ... v_n


Output

Print the minimum number of elements that needs to be replaced.
