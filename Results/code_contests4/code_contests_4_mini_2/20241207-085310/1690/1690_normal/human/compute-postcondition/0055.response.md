According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `j`, `be`, and `en`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `en`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `be`. Since `be` is less than `en`, the loop can execute one more time. In the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, thus `j` will be `be + 1`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `en`, so `be + 1` must be less than `en`. 

State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is 0, `be` is less than `en`, `cur` is either 0 or 3, `tem` is `a[j]`, and `j` is `be + 1`. For the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be less than `en`.**
