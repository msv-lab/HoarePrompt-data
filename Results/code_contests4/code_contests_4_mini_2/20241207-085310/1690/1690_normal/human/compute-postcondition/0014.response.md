The value of `be` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `be` is 0, so after execution, `be` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `be` is 1, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is incremented by 1 if it is not equal to `i`, and `j` is 0 if the character at index `j` of `s` is equal to the character at index `cur` of `word`. If `cur` is equal to `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `be` is 1, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is incremented by 1 if it is not equal to `i`, and `j` is 0 if the character at index `j` of `s` is equal to the character at index `cur` of `word`. If `cur` is equal to `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
