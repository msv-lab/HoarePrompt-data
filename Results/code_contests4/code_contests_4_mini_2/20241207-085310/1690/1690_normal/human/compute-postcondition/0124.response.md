The code assigns new values to the variables `be`, `en`, and `tem`. Specifically, `be` is assigned the value 0, `en` is assigned the value of `n`, and `tem` is assigned the value 0. The previous values of `be`, `en`, and `tem` are not specified, but it is noted that `en` is at least `n` and `tem` remains unchanged. The values of `n`, `i`, `cur`, `j`, and `ans` are not affected by this assignment, so their previous states remain relevant.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `i` is 2, `be` is 0, `en` is `n`, `cur` is less than or equal to `i`, `j` is equal to `en - 1`, `tem` remains unchanged, and `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem` for the loop to execute a second time.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is 2, `be` is 0, `en` is `n`, `cur` is less than or equal to `i`, `j` is equal to `en - 1`, `tem` remains unchanged, and `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem` for the loop to execute a second time.**
