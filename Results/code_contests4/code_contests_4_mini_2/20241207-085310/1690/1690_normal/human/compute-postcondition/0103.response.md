Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `be` is the number of iterations executed until the loop broke or finished, if `cur` is equal to `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` is decreased by 1, `j` is equal to `n - 2`, and if the element at index `j` of `s` is equal to the element at index `cur` of `word`, then `en` is decremented by 1.**
