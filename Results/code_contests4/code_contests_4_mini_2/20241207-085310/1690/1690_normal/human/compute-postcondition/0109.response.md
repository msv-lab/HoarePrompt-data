The line `en -= 1` decrements the value of `en` by 1. However, the initial state does not provide a value for `en`, leaving it unknown. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `be`, `cur`, and `j`) remain unaffected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, `be` is the number of iterations executed until the loop broke or finished, `cur` is equal to or has been decremented from `i`, `j` is equal to `n - 3`, and `en` has been decremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, `be` is the number of iterations executed until the loop broke or finished, `cur` is equal to or has been decremented from `i`, `j` is equal to `n - 3`, and `en` has been decremented by 1.**
