`cur` is decremented by 1, and it was previously updated to 2, so after execution, `cur` becomes 1. The values of other variables (`n`, `tem`, `j`, and `en`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `cur` is 1, `tem` remains 0, `j` is `n - 3`, `en` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `cur` is 1, `tem` remains 0, `j` is `n - 3`, `en` is decreased by 1**
