`cur` is assigned the value `0`. The variable `cur` was previously less than or equal to `i`, which is `2`, so now `cur` is `0`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `i` is 2, `be` is 0, `en` is `n`, `cur` is 0, `j` is equal to `en - 1`, `tem` remains unchanged, and `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem` for the loop to execute a second time.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is 2, `be` is 0, `en` is `n`, `cur` is 0, `j` is equal to `en - 1`, `tem` remains unchanged, and `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem` for the loop to execute a second time.**
