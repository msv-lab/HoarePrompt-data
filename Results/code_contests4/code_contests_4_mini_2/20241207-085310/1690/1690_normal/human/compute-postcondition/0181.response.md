To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the behavior of the variables based on the loop code provided.

From the initial state, we know:
- `n` is an integer.
- `j` starts at -1 and will take values from `be` to `en - 1`.
- `cur` can either equal `i` or remain unchanged.
- `en` is the final count of iterations that will be executed, which is less than or equal to `n`.

The loop iterates from `j = be` to `j = en - 1`. During each iteration, it checks if the character at index `j` of `s` matches the character at index `i` of `word`. If they match, the variable `tem` is increased by `a[j]`.

At the end of the loop:
- If `be` equals `en`, the loop does not execute, meaning `tem` remains unchanged from its initial value.
- If the loop does execute, `j` will take values from `be` to `en - 1`. Therefore, after all iterations, `j` will be equal to `en` (the loop terminates after the last valid index).

In summary:
- If the loop executes, `tem` will be the sum of `a[j]` for all indices `j` from `be` to `en - 1` where `s[j]` equals `word[i]`.
- If the loop does not execute (i.e., if `be` is equal to `en`), `tem` remains unchanged.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop will be:

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `j` is equal to `en`, `tem` is the sum of `a[j]` for all `j` in the range from `be` to `en - 1` where `s[j]` equals `word[i]`, and if the loop does not execute, `tem` remains unchanged.**
