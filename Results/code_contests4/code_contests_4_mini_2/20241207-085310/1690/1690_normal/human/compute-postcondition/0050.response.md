After analyzing the loop and considering the provided output states, we can derive the final output state after the loop has completed all iterations.

The loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0` (inclusive) as long as `cur` is not equal to `i`. If `cur` becomes equal to `i`, the loop breaks. During each iteration, if the character in `s` at index `j` matches the character in `word` at index `cur`, `cur` is decremented. The variable `en` is also decremented in each iteration.

Considering that `cur` starts at `3` and is decremented whenever there is a match, if there are no matches, `cur` will remain `3`. If a match occurs at `j`, `cur` will eventually decrement to `2`, then to `1`, and then to `0` if there are matches for each corresponding character in `word`. 

The key points are:
- If `cur` becomes equal to `i` (which is `0`), the loop will break.
- The loop will execute a number of times equal to `n` if no matches are found or until `cur` reaches `0` if matches are found.

After all iterations are executed, we can conclude:
- If the loop runs to completion without breaking, `cur` will still be `3`, `be` will be `n`, and `en` will be decremented by `n`.
- If the loop breaks before completing all iterations, `cur` will be `0`, `be` will be the number of iterations that were executed before breaking, and `en` will be decremented accordingly.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished executing is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is 0, `be` is the number of iterations executed, `cur` is either 0 (if a match was found) or remains 3, `tem` remains 0, `j` is -1 (if loop completes without matches) or the last index checked, and `en` is decremented accordingly.**
