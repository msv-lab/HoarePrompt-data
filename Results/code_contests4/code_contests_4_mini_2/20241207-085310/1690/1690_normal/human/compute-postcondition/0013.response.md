Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `be` is 0, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is incremented by 1 if it is not equal to `i` and `j` is 0 if the character at index `j` of `s` is equal to the character at index `cur` of `word`. If `cur` is equal to `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
