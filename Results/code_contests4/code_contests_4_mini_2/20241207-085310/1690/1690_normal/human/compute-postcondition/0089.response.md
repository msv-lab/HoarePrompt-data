According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop is set to iterate from `n - 1` down to `0` (inclusive), meaning that `n` must be at least `1` for the loop to execute at least once. 

Before the loop starts, `j` is equal to `min(n, n-1)`. If `n` is greater than `0`, then `j` will be set to `n - 1` at the start of the loop, which is valid for the first iteration. 

To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than `0`. The variable `i` and `be` do not affect whether the loop will execute, as they are not used within the loop.

Thus, for the loop to execute the first time, `n` needs to be greater than 0, and at the start of the loop, `j` will be equal to `n - 1`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `be` is the number of iterations executed until the loop broke or finished, `cur` is 3, `j` is equal to n - 1**
