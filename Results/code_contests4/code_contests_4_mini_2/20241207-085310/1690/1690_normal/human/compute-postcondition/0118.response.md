According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j`, `be`, and `en`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `en`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `cur` is equal to `i` if the loop broke or less than its initial value if the loop completed, `j` is equal to `be`, and `s[j]` is equal to `word[i]`, causing `tem` to be increased by the value of `a[j]`. 

To execute the loop one more time, `j` must be incremented. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `j` should be `be + 1`. Additionally, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `be + 1` must be less than `en`.

State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is 1, `cur` is equal to `i` if the loop broke or less than its initial value if the loop completed, `j` is equal to `be + 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than `en`.**
