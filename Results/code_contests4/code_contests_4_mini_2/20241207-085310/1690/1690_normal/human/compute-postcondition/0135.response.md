According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` in relation to `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is an integer greater than 0, which means the loop can execute one more time. After the last iteration, `j` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration, so `j` will be 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n`. 

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `cur` is equal to `i` (which is 2), `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`, `be` is increased by 1, `en` is `n`, `j` is 1, and `tem` remains unchanged; for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than `n` which is still greater than 1.**
