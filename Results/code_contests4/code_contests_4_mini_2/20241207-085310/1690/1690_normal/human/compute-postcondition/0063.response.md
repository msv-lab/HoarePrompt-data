According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates over the range from 0 to 3 (inclusive of 0, exclusive of 4). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop iterates up to 3, after the first iteration `i` will become 1 for the second iteration. For the loop to execute again, `i` will need to be less than 4.

Thus, the values that need to be adjusted are `i`, and we also must ensure that the condition of `n` being an integer, `be` being less than or equal to `en`, `cur` being either 0 or 3, `tem` as the sum of `a[j]` for all matched indices, and `j` being `en - 1` or -1 remains unchanged.

State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is 1, `be` is less than or equal to `en`, `cur` is either 0 or 3, `tem` is the sum of `a[j]` for all matched indices, and `j` is `en - 1` or -1; `ans` is updated to min(ans, tem)**
