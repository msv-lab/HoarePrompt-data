The value of `cur` is decremented by 1, which means it will be one less than its previous value. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `be` is the number of iterations executed until the loop broke or finished, `cur` is now one less than its previous value, `j` is equal to `n - 2`, the element at index `j` of `s` is equal to the element at index `cur` of `word`, and `en` is decremented by 2.
