According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is greater than or equal to 0. The loop starts with `j` initialized to `n - 1` and decrements `j` by 1 in each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n - 2`, which means the next value of `j` will be `n - 3`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, `n` must be at least 3 (since `n - 3` must be greater than or equal to 0).

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `n - 3`, `cur` is not equal to `i`, and `en` is decreased by 2 for the loop to execute a second time.**
