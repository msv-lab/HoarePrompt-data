The variable `en` is decremented by 1. Since we do not have the specific initial value of `en`, we cannot determine its exact new value. However, we know that it will be one less than its previous value. Other variables remain unchanged and unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `en`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `n - 1`, `cur` is not equal to `i`, and `en` is decreased by 1.**
