According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `be` and `en`. The variable `be` represents the starting point of the range, and `en` represents the endpoint. For the loop to execute at least once, `be` must be less than `en`. Additionally, `j` should be initialized to `be` since the loop iterates over the range starting from `be`.

Given that `j` is currently -1, it needs to be adjusted to match `be`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the following conditions must be met:

1. `be` must be less than `en` (i.e., `be < en`).
2. `j` must be set to `be` at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer, `j` is equal to `be`, for the loop to execute `be` must be less than `en`**
