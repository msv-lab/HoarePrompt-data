The function `func` does not explicitly take any parameters in its definition. However, it operates on three implied parameters based on the constraints provided: `n`, `s`, and `a`. 

- `n` is an integer that must satisfy the condition \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
- `a` is a list containing `n` integers, where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 998244353\).

The function's behavior and return value are not explicitly stated, but it processes these inputs based on the constraints outlined. 

Functionality: **The function operates on an integer `n`, a string `s` of length `n`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It does not return any specific output as the output behavior is not detailed in the provided information.**
