Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 2. If `cur` is equal to `i`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`, `be` is increased by 1, `en` is set to `n`, `j` is 2, and `tem` remains unchanged, with a break from the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]`, then `cur` is updated to 3, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`, `be` is increased by 1, `en` is set to `n`, and `tem` remains unchanged.***
