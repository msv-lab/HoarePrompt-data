Postcondition: ***If `cur` is equal to `i`, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop. Otherwise, if `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]`, `cur` is increased by 1 while maintaining that `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `j` is 2. If `s[j]` is not equal to `word[cur]`, `cur` remains unchanged, with `n` still greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `j` is 2.***
