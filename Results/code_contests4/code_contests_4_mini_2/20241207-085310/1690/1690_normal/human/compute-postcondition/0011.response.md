The value of `cur` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cur` is unknown, but it is guaranteed to be less than `n` since `cur` is not equal to `i` and `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, `cur` can take on a value from 0 to `n-1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `be` is 0, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is incremented by 1, `j` is 0, and the character at index `j` of `s` is equal to the character at index `cur` of `word`.**
