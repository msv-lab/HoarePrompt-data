According to the code, the loop iterates while `j` runs from `n - 1` down to `0`. The current state shows that `j` is equal to `n - 2` at the end of the last iteration (since `j` starts at `n - 1` and is decremented by 1 in each iteration). For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be decremented to `n - 3`, and there must be at least one more iteration left, which means `n` must be greater than 2 (since `n - 1` is the maximum starting point).

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `be` is the number of iterations executed until the loop broke or finished, `cur` is equal to `i` or has been decremented by 1, and `j` is `n - 2`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` will be `n - 3`.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, `be` is the number of iterations executed until the loop broke or finished, `cur` is equal to or has been decremented from `i`, `j` is equal to `n - 3`**
