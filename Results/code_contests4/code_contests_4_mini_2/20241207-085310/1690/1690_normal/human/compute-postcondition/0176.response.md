The value of `tem` is incremented by the value of `a[j]`. The variable `j` is equal to `be + 1`, which implies that `j` is greater than `be`. Since `be` is less than `en`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `en`, it can be inferred that `j` is still within the bounds of `a` and thus `a[j]` is valid. 

Since no other variables are affected by this operation, the output state is: `n` is an integer, `j` is equal to `be + 1`, `be` is less than `en`, and `tem` is incremented by `a[j]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `j` is equal to `be + 1`, `be` is less than `en`, and `tem` is incremented by `a[j]`**
