The value of `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`. The previous states of the variables are not affected, and the specific values of `ans` and `tem` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `i` is 0, `be` is less than or equal to `en`, `cur` is either 0 or 3, `tem` is the sum of `a[j]` for all matched indices, and `j` is `en - 1` or -1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is 0, `be` is less than or equal to `en`, `cur` is either 0 or 3, `tem` is the sum of `a[j]` for all matched indices, and `j` is `en - 1` or -1; `ans` is updated to min(ans, tem)**
