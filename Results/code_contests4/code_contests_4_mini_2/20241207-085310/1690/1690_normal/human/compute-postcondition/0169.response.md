The `en` variable is decreased by 1. The previous value of `en` is not given, but it is affected by the operation. The other variables (`n`, `j`, `cur`, `i`, and `word`) remain unchanged in this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `n - 3`, `cur` is not equal to `i`, and `en` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `n - 3`, `cur` is not equal to `i`, and `en` is decreased by 1.**
