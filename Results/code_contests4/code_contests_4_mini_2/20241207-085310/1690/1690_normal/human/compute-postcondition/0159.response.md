The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `n - 2`, `cur` is not equal to `i`, `en` is decreased by 1, and we break out of the loop. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `n - 2`, `cur` is not equal to `i`, `en` is decreased by 1, and we break out of the loop.**
