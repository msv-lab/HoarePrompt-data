The value of `tem` is incremented by `a[j]`. The previous value of `j` is -1 if the loop completed, which means `a[j]` refers to `a[-1]`, typically the last element of the array `a`. The variable `tem` is updated, but the previous values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `i` is 1, `be` is less than `en` for the loop to execute, `cur` is equal to `i` if the loop broke or less than its initial value if the loop completed, `j` is -1 if the loop completed, and the element `s[j]` is equal to `word[i]`, with `tem` being incremented by `a[-1]`.
