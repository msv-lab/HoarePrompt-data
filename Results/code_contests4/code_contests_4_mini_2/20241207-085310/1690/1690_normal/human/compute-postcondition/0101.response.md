Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `be` is the number of iterations executed until the loop broke or finished, `cur` is now one less than its previous value, `j` is equal to `n - 2`, the element at index `j` of `s` is equal to the element at index `cur` of `word`, and `en` is decremented by 2 if `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]`.***
