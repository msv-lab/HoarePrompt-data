According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j`. The loop continues as long as `j` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n - 1`, which means it was last set to this value. Since `en` has been decreased by 1, we need to account for that in terms of how it affects the loop's execution (if it does). 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be decremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will become `n - 2`. The loop will execute again if `j` is still greater than or equal to 0, which requires that `n` is at least 2.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `n - 2`, `cur` is not equal to `i`, and `en` is decreased by 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1.**
