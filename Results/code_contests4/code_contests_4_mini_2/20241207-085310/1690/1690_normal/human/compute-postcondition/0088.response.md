The variable `cur` is assigned the value of 3. The previous value of `cur` was `min(i, n)`, but we do not have the specific values for `n` or `i` to determine what this would have been. The other variables `n`, `i`, `be`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `cur` is now explicitly set to 3, while the other variables retain their previous states.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is 1, `be` is the number of iterations executed until the loop broke or finished, `cur` is 3, `j` is equal to min(n, n-1)**
