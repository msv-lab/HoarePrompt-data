The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `be` is 1, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is incremented by 1 if it is not equal to `i`, `j` is 1 for the loop to execute a second time, and `n` must be greater than 1.
