Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0. If `cur` is equal to `i` (which is 2), `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`, `be` is increased by 1, `en` is set to `n`, `j` is 1, and `tem` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop. Otherwise, if `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]`, then `cur` is updated to 3, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`, `be` is increased by 1, `en` remains as `n`, `j` is 1, and `tem` remains unchanged.***
