According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the integer `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is an integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `cur` is equal to `i` (which is 2), `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`, `be` is increased by 1, `en` is set to `n`, `j` is 2, `tem` remains unchanged**
