According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the range defined by `n`. The loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0`. Since `n` is greater than 0, the initial value of `j` would be `n - 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be decremented by 1. Thus, `j` will be updated to `n - 2 - 1`, which is `n - 3`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is greater than or equal to `0`.

Since `en` has already been decreased by 1, we need to note that in the state. 

Therefore, the state will be:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `cur` is updated to 2, `tem` remains 0, `j` is `n - 2 - 1` (which is `n - 3`), `en` is decreased by 1. For the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be greater than or equal to 0.**
