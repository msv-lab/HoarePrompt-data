The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `be` is 0, `en` is `n`, `cur` is 2, `j` is 0, `tem` remains unchanged, and `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
