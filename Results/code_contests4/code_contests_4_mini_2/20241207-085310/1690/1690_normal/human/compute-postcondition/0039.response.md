The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `be` is 0, `cur` is 3, `tem` remains 0, `j` is `n - 2`, and `en` is decreased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
