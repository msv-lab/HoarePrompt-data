To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we analyze the loop code and the given initial state as well as the output states after the first few iterations.

The loop iterates over the range from `be` to `en`, checking if elements in the list `s` match the character from `word` at index `i`. For each match found, it updates `tem` by adding the corresponding value from the list `a`.

1. If the loop does not execute (i.e., if `be` is not less than `en`), then `tem` remains 0, `cur` remains 3, and `j` remains -1.
  
2. If the loop executes, we denote that it runs until `j` reaches `en - 1`. After all iterations:
   - `tem` will contain the sum of all `a[j]` values where `s[j]` matched `word[i]`.
   - `j` will be equal to `en - 1` (the last index checked).
   - `cur` will be set to 0 if at least one match was found, otherwise it remains 3.

Considering these points, the final output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is 0, `be` is less than or equal to `en`, `cur` is either 0 (if matches were found) or 3 (if no matches were found), `tem` is the sum of `a[j]` for all matched indices, and `j` is `en - 1` (last index checked) or -1 if the loop did not execute.**
