According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute `n` times, starting with `j` initialized to 0. Before the loop starts, `j` is set to `en - 1` or -1. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 1, which means `j` should be initialized to 0. 

Currently, `j` does not meet this condition, so it needs to be adjusted. Additionally, since `i` is already set to 1, it does not affect the loop's execution.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
