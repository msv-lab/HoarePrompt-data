The code assigns the values 0 to `be`, `n` to `en`, and 0 to `tem`. The previous values of `be`, `en`, and `tem` are updated accordingly, but other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `i` is 1, `be` is 0, `en` is `n`, `cur` is either 0 or 3, `tem` is 0, `j` is `en - 1` or -1, `ans` is updated to min(ans, tem).

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is 1, `be` is 0, `en` is `n`, `cur` is either 0 or 3, `tem` is 0, `j` is `en - 1` or -1, `ans` is updated to min(ans, tem)**
