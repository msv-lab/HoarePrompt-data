According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends primarily on the values of `be` and `en`. The loop will execute if `be` is less than `en`. 

Given that `j` starts at `be`, for the loop to execute at least once, we need to ensure that `be` is less than `en`. Additionally, `j` will start at the value of `be` when the loop begins. The other variables `n`, `i`, `cur`, and `tem` do not affect the execution of the loop in this case.

State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is 0, `be` is less than `en`, `cur` is either 0 or 3, `tem` remains 0, `j` is `be` (starting value for the loop)**
