The value of `cur` is updated to 3, replacing its previous value of 2. The other variables (`ans`, `be`, `en`, `j`, `tem`) remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `cur` is 3, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`, `be` is the number of iterations executed before breaking, `en` is `n`, `j` is less than `n`, `tem` remains unchanged.
