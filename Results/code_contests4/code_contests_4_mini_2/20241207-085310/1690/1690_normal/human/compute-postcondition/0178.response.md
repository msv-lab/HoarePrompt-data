According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `be` and `en`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than `en`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `be + 1`. Since `be` is less than `en`, this means that `j` is currently one step after `be`, indicating that the loop has executed once with `j` equal to `be`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, which makes `j` equal to `be + 2`. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, `j` must still be less than `en`. Therefore, `en` must be greater than `be + 2`.

State: **`n` is an integer, `j` is equal to `be + 2`, for the loop to execute a second time `en` must be greater than `be + 2**.
