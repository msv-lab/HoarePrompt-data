Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `i` is 1, `be` is less than `en` for the loop to execute, `cur` is equal to `i` if the loop broke or less than its initial value if the loop completed, `j` is -1 if the loop completed, and if the element `s[j]` is equal to `word[i]`, then `tem` is incremented by `a[-1]`.***
