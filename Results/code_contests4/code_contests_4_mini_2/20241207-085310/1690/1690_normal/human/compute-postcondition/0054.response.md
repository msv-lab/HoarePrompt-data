Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `i` is 0, `be` is less than `en`, `cur` is either 0 or 3, `tem` is `a[j]`, and `j` is `be`. If the element at index `j` of `s` is equal to the character at index `i` of `word`, then the condition is satisfied. Otherwise, the condition is not met, and no further action is specified.***
