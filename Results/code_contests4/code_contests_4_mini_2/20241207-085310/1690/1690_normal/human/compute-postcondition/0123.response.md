According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `i`, which is initialized to 1 and is incremented by 1 on each iteration. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 4. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, so the loop can execute two more times (for `i` values of 2 and 3).

For the loop to execute one additional time, `i` must be increased to 2. The condition to continue executing the loop is that `i` must be less than 4, which it will be after the increment. The other states such as `be`, `en`, `cur`, `j`, `tem`, and `ans` will not be altered unless the loop body modifies them, but as per the given task, we are not considering those changes.

State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is 2, `be` is less than or equal to `en`, `cur` is less than or equal to `i`, `j` is equal to `en - 1`, and `tem` remains unchanged; `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem` for the loop to execute a second time.**
