Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0. If `cur` is equal to `i` (which is 2), then `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cur` is 3 or greater than 2, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem` if the `j`th element of `s` is equal to the `cur`th character of `word`, while `be` is 0, `en` is `n`, `j` is 0, and `tem` remains unchanged.***
