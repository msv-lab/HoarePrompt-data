The value of `be` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `be` is 1, after execution, `be` will be 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0 and greater than 1, `i` is 0, `be` is 2, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0 and greater than 1, `i` is 0, `be` is 2, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0**
