According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j`, `be`, and `en`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `en`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `be + 1`. Since `be` is less than `en`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will be `be + 2`.

For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `en`. Hence, `be + 2` must be less than `en`.

State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is 0, `be` is less than `en`, `cur` is either 0 or 3, `tem` is `a[j]` which is now updated to `a[j] + a[j]`, and `j` is `be + 2`, for the loop to execute again `be + 2` must be less than `en`.**
