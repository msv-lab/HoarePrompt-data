To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we need to analyze the loop's behavior based on the initial state and the provided iterations. 

The loop iterates through the range of `n`, checking if `cur` is equal to `i` (which is initially 0), and if not, it checks if the character at the current index `j` of the string `s` matches the character at index `cur` of the word `hard`. If there is a match, `cur` is incremented. The variable `be` keeps track of the number of iterations, and it increments by 1 in each iteration unless the loop breaks.

1. If `cur` becomes equal to `i` (which is 0) at any point during the loop execution, the loop will break immediately. 
2. If `s` does not contain any characters that match the character at index `cur` of `word`, `cur` will not increment and the loop will continue until `j` reaches `n` or the loop breaks.
3. If `s` is empty or `n` is 0, the loop will not execute at all.

Now, let's summarize the conditions for the output state after the loop completes execution:

- If the loop executes fully without breaking, `cur` will be equal to the number of occurrences of the first character of `word` in the first `n` characters of `s`. `be` will equal `n`, and `i` will remain 0.
- If the loop breaks early because `cur` equals `i`, `be` will be the count of iterations before the break (which could be between 0 and `n`), and `cur` will still be 0 since `i` starts at 0.

Considering these points, the output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is 0, `be` is the number of iterations executed before breaking or `n` if it executed fully, `cur` is the number of characters from `word` matched in `s` before breaking, and `tem` remains 0.**
