The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `n - 3`, `cur` is not equal to `i`, and `en` is decreased by 2 for the loop to execute a second time, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
