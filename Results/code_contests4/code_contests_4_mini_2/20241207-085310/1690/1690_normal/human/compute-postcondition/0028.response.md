`cur` is assigned the value 3. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `be`, and `tem`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `i` is 0, `be` is the number of iterations executed before breaking or `n` if it executed fully, `cur` is 3, and `tem` remains 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is 0, `be` is the number of iterations executed before breaking or `n` if it executed fully, `cur` is 3, and `tem` remains 0**.
