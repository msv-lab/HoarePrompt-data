According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `j`, `be`, and `en`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than `en`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, `cur` is either equal to `i` (which means the loop broke) or less than its initial value (indicating the loop completed). Since `j` is -1 when the loop completed, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to be at least equal to `be` and less than `en`. 

If the loop executes again, `j` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` should be updated to `be`, and for the loop to execute again, `be` must be less than `en`.

State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is 1, `cur` is equal to `i` if the loop broke or less than its initial value if the loop completed, `j` is equal to `be`, for the loop to execute again `be` must be less than `en`**.
