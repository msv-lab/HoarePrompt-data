Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, `be` is the number of iterations executed until the loop broke or finished, `cur` is equal to or has been decremented from `i`, and `j` is equal to `n - 3`. If `cur` is equal to `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` is decremented by 1, and `j` remains equal to `n - 3` if `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]`.***
