Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `be` is the number of iterations executed until the loop broke or finished, if `cur` is equal to `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` is less than its previous value, `j` is equal to `n - 1`, and the element at index `j` of `s` is equal to the element at index `cur` of `word`.***
