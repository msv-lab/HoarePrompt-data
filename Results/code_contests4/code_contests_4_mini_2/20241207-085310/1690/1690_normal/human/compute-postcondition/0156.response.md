Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `n - 1`. If `cur` is equal to `i`, we break out of the most internal loop. Otherwise, `cur` is not equal to `i`, and if the element at index `j` of `s` is equal to the element at index `cur` of `word`, then `cur` is decremented by 1, while `cur` remains not equal to `i`.***
