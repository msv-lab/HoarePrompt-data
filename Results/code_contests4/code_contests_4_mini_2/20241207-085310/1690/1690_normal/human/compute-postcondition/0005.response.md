The variable `cur` is assigned the value of 0. This does not affect any of the other variables already given in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is simply the addition of the new variable `cur` with its value while keeping all other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from input, `s` is a stripped string from input, `a` is a list of integers from input, `ans` is float('inf'), `word` is 'hard', `i` is 0, `be` is 0, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is 0**
