The value of `cur` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `cur` is 3, so after execution, `cur` becomes 2. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `be` is 0, `cur` is 2, `tem` remains 0, `j` is `n - 2`, and `en` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `be` is 0, `cur` is 2, `tem` remains 0, `j` is `n - 2`, and `en` is decreased by 1.**
