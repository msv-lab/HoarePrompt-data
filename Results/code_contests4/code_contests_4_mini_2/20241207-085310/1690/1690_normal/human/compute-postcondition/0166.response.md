The value of `cur` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `cur` is not specified, but it is known that `cur` is not equal to `i`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `j`, and `en`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `n - 3`, `cur` is decreased by 1, and `en` is decreased by 2 for the loop to execute a second time.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `n - 3`, `cur` is decreased by 1, `en` is decreased by 2 for the loop to execute a second time.**
