The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `be` is the number of iterations executed until the loop broke or finished, `cur` is equal to or less than its previous value, `j` is equal to `n - 2`, the element at index `j` of `s` is equal to the element at index `cur` of `word`, `en` is decremented by 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
