According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `n`. The loop is defined to iterate from `n-1` down to `0`, inclusive. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than `0`. Additionally, `j` will start at `n-1` and decrement on each iteration. 

The current state indicates:
- `cur` is 3.
- `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`.
- `be` is the number of iterations executed before breaking.
- `en` is `n`.
- `j` is less than `n`.
- `tem` remains unchanged.

To ensure the loop can execute, `n` must be at least 1, and `j` will be initialized to `n-1`. If `n` is 1, `j` would start at 0. 

Thus, the states need to be adjusted to indicate that `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and `j` is set to `n - 1`.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `n - 1` for the loop to execute the first time**
