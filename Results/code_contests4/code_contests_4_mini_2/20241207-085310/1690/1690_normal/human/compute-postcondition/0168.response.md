Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `n - 3`, `cur` is not equal to `i`. If `cur` is equal to `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]`, then `cur` is decreased by 1, and `en` is decreased by 2 for the loop to execute a second time.***
