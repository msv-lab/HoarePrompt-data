Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0. If `cur` is equal to `i`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `cur` is not equal to `i`, and the character at index `j` of `s` is equal to the character at index `cur` of `word`, then `cur` is incremented by 1.***
