According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `be` and `en`. The loop will execute as long as `be` is less than `en`. Given that `j` starts at `-1` and is decremented by the number of iterations executed, it indicates that the loop would need to adjust `be` to be less than `en` for the loop to execute.

Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer, `i` is 1, `be` is the number of iterations already executed, `cur` is equal to `i` if the loop broke (indicating that the loop may have executed at least once), `j` is -1 if the loop completed (indicating the loop did not execute), and `en` is decremented by the number of iterations executed. For the loop to execute, it must be ensured that `be` is less than `en`, which means `en` must be greater than `be`.

State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is 1, `be` is less than `en` for the loop to execute, `cur` is equal to `i` if the loop broke or less than its initial value if the loop completed, and `j` is -1 if the loop completed**
