According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1.

After the next iteration, `j` will be 1. Since `n` is greater than 0, it must also be greater than 1 for the loop to execute a second time.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `be` is 1, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is incremented by 1 if it is not equal to `i`, `j` is 1 for the loop to execute a second time, and `n` must be greater than 1.**
