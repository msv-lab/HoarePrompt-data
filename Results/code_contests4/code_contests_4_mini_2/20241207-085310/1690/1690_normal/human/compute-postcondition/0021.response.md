According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 1. The loop variable `j` starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented to 1, and for it to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is greater than 0 and greater than 1, `i` is 0, `be` is 2, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1 and `j` must be 1**
