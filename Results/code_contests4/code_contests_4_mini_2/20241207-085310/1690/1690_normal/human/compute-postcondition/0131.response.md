The value of `cur` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `cur` is not specified, but it is stated that `cur` is not equal to 2. Therefore, after the increment, `cur` will either be 3 or a value greater than 2. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `be` is 0, `en` is `n`, `cur` is either 3 or greater than 2, `j` is 0, `tem` remains unchanged, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`, the `j`th element of `s` is equal to the `cur`th character of `word`.**
