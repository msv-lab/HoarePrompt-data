The variable `cur` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `cur` is not specified, but it is established that `cur` is not equal to 1. Therefore, after execution, `cur` will now be one less than its previous value. The values of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `be`, `j`, and the elements of `s` and `word`) remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `be` is the number of iterations executed until the loop broke or finished, `cur` is now less than its previous value, `j` is equal to `n - 1`, and the element at index `j` of `s` is equal to the element at index `cur` of `word`.**
