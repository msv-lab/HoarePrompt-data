The value of `cur` is decremented by 1, but the previous value of `cur` is not specified. The states of the other variables `n`, `j`, and `en` are not directly affected by this operation, except that `en` has already been decreased by 1 prior to this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `n - 2`, `cur` is decreased by 1, `en` is decreased by 1, and `cur` is not equal to `i`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `n - 2`, `cur` is decreased by 1, `en` is decreased by 1, and `cur` is not equal to `i`.**
