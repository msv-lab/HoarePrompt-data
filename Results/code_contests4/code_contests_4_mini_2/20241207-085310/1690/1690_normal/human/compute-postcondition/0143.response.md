The value of `cur` is incremented by 1, and since `cur` was equal to `i`, which is 2, after execution, `cur` becomes 3. The states of the other variables (`n`, `ans`, `be`, `en`, `j`, `tem`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `cur` is 3, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`, `be` is increased by 1, `en` is set to `n`, `j` is 2, `tem` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `cur` is 3, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`, `be` is increased by 1, `en` is set to `n`, `j` is 2, `tem` remains unchanged**.
