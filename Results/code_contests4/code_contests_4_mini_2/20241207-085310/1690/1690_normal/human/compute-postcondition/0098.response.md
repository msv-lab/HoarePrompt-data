According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and the range specified in the for loop. The loop will execute as long as `j` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `n - 1`, which means it has already executed at least once and is decremented with each iteration. Since `j` starts from `n - 1` and goes down to 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be decremented to `n - 2`.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `n - 1`, and `en` has been decremented by 1. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `j` must be `n - 2`. 

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `be` is the number of iterations executed until the loop broke or finished, `cur` is equal to or less than its previous value, `j` is equal to `n - 2`, the element at index `j` of `s` is equal to the element at index `cur` of `word`, `en` is decremented by 2.**
