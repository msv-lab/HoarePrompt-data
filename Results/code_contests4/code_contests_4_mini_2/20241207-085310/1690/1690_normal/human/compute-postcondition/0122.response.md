Output State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is 1, `be` is less than or equal to `en`, `cur` is less than or equal to `i`, `j` is equal to `en - 1` if the loop completed, otherwise `-1`, and `tem` is the sum of `a[j]` for all indices `j` from `be` to `en - 1` where `s[j]` equals `word[i]` if loop executed, otherwise `tem` remains unchanged; `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`.**
