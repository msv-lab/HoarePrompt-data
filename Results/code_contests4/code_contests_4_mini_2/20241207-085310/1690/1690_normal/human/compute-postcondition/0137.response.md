The value of `cur` is incremented by 1, and its previous value was `i`, which is 2. Therefore, after execution, `cur` becomes 3. The states of the other variables (`n`, `ans`, `be`, `en`, `j`, and `tem`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `cur` is 3, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`, `be` is increased by 1, `en` is `n`, `j` is 1, and `tem` remains unchanged.**
