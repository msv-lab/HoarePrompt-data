According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be decremented by 1, which means `j` will be `n - 2`. Since `n` is greater than 0, `j` will be greater than or equal to 0 for the loop to execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is still greater than 0, `i` is 0, `be` is 0, `cur` is 3, `tem` remains 0, `j` is `n - 1`, and `en` has been decreased by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be `n - 2`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `be` is 0, `cur` is 3, `tem` remains 0, `j` is `n - 2`, and `en` is decreased by 1.**
