The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `cur` is equal to `i` (which is 2), `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`, `be` is increased by 1, `en` is `n`, `j` is 1, and `tem` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop.
