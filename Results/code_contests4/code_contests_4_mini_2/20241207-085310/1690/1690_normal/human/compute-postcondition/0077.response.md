The value of `cur` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `cur` is not specified. The other variables `n`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `cur` has increased by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `cur` is increased by 1**
