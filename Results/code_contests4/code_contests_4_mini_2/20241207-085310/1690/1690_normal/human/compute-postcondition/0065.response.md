`cur` is assigned the value 0. The previous value of `cur` could either be 0 or 3, but it is now set to 0. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `i` is 1, `be` is 0, `en` is `n`, `cur` is 0, `tem` is 0, `j` is `en - 1` or -1, `ans` is updated to min(ans, tem).

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is 1, `be` is 0, `en` is `n`, `cur` is 0, `tem` is 0, `j` is `en - 1` or -1, `ans` is updated to min(ans, tem)**
