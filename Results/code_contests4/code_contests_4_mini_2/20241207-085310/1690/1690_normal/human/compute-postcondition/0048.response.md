Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0. If `cur` is equal to `i`, then `cur` is updated to 2, `tem` remains 0, `j` is `n - 3`, and `en` is decreased by 1, breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]`, then `cur` is updated to 1, `tem` remains 0, `j` is `n - 3`, and `en` is decreased by 1.***
