The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0 and greater than 1, `i` is 0, `be` is 2, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop. 
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0 and greater than 1, `i` is 0, `be` is 2, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop.**
