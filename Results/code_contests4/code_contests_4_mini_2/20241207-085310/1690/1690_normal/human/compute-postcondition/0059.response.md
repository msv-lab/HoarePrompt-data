The value of `tem` is incremented by the value of `a[j]`. Since `tem` is currently assigned the value `a[j]` which has already been updated to `a[j] + a[j]`, we first need to consider this update. Now, `tem` becomes `a[j] + a[j] + a[j]`, which is `3 * a[j]`.

The values of `n`, `i`, `cur`, and `j` remain unchanged. The condition for the loop to execute again still holds, as `j` is `be + 2` and must be less than `en`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `i` is 0, `be` is less than `en`, `cur` is either 0 or 3, `tem` is now `3 * a[j]`, and `j` is `be + 2`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is 0, `be` is less than `en`, `cur` is either 0 or 3, `tem` is now `3 * a[j]`, and `j` is `be + 2`.**
