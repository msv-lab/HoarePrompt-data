The value of `tem` is incremented by `a[j]`. The previous value of `tem` is `a[j]`, and since `j` is `be + 1`, `tem` will now hold the value of `a[j] + a[j]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `i` is 0, `be` is less than `en`, `cur` is either 0 or 3, `tem` is now `a[j] + a[j]`, and `j` is `be + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is 0, `be` is less than `en`, `cur` is either 0 or 3, `tem` is now `a[j] + a[j]`, and `j` is `be + 1`.**
