The value of `cur` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `cur` is unknown. The other variables `n`, `i`, `be`, `en`, and `tem` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0 and greater than 1, `i` is 0, `be` is 2, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, and `cur` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0 and greater than 1, `i` is 0, `be` is 2, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, and `cur` is increased by 1**.
