According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. At the start, `n` is an integer from input, so it may be any integer value. 

To ensure the loop executes for the first time, we need to confirm that `n` is greater than 0. The loop variable `j` will start at 0, which is appropriate for the first iteration. 

Therefore, the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute are: `n` must be greater than 0, and `j` will be initialized to 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `be` is 0, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is 0, `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
