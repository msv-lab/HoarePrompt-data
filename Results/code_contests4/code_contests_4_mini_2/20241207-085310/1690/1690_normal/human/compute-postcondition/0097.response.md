The value of `en` is decremented by 1, while the other variables (`n`, `i`, `be`, `cur`, `j`, `s`, and `word`) remain unchanged. The previous value of `en` is unknown, but it is greater than or equal to 0 since `n` is greater than 0 and `cur` can affect the flow of the loops. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `be` is the number of iterations executed until the loop broke or finished, `cur` is equal to or less than its previous value, `j` is equal to `n - 1`, the element at index `j` of `s` is equal to the element at index `cur` of `word`, and `en` is decremented by 1.
