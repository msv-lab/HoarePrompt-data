The variables `n`, `s`, `a`, `ans`, and `word` are assigned new values based on the input and the defined functions. The value of `n` is set to an integer from user input, `s` is assigned a stripped string from user input, `a` is assigned a list of integers parsed from user input, `ans` is initialized to positive infinity (`float('inf')`), and `word` is initialized to the string 'hard'. Therefore, the output state reflects these new assignments. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer from input, `s` is a stripped string from input, `a` is a list of integers from input, `ans` is float('inf'), `word` is 'hard'**
