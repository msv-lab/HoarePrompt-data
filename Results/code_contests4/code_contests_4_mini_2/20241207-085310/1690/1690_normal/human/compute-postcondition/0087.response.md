To analyze the output state after all iterations of the loop have completed, we can look at the loop's structure and the conditions involved:

1. The loop iterates `n` times, with `j` starting from 0 and incrementing up to `n - 1`.
2. Inside the loop, if `cur` equals `i`, it breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it checks whether the element `s[j]` matches `word[cur]` and increments `cur` if there's a match.
3. The variable `be` is incremented for each iteration where the loop does not break.

Given the output states after the first three iterations, we can deduce the following:

- After executing 1 time: `cur` has been incremented by 1, meaning there was a match for the first character of `word`.
- After executing 2 times: `be` has been increased by 1, indicating that no match was found for `s[1]`.
- After executing 3 times: `cur` is equal to `i`, which means the loop broke before executing the 3rd iteration fully.

Since the loop continues until either `cur` equals `i` or all `n` iterations are completed, the final state will depend on the values of `cur` and `be` at the end of the loop execution:

- If `cur` reaches `i` before `j` reaches `n`, the loop exits early.
- If the loop executes all `n` iterations without breaking, then `cur` may not equal `i`, and `be` would be equal to `n`.

Thus, we can conclude the output state:

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is 1, `be` is the number of iterations executed until the loop broke or finished, `cur` is equal to `min(i, n)`, `j` is equal to `min(n, n-1)`.**
