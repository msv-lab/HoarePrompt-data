Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `be` is 0, `cur` is 3, `tem` remains 0, `j` is `n - 1`. If `cur` is equal to `i`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, if `cur` is 2, then the element at index `j` of `s` is equal to the element at index `cur` of `word`, and all the conditions stated above hold true.***
