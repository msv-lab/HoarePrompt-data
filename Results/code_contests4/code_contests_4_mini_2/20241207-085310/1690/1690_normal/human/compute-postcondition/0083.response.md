The variable `cur` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `cur` is not provided in the given state. The other variables (`n`, `i`, and `j`) remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `cur` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `cur` is increased by 1**
