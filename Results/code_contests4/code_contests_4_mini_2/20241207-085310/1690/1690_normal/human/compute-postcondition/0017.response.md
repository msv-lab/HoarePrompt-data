The value of `cur` is incremented by 1. The specific previous value of `cur` is not provided, but it is stated that `cur` is incremented if it is not equal to `i`. Since `i` is 0, `cur` must have been not equal to 0 prior to the increment. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `be` is 1, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is incremented by 1, `j` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `be` is 1, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is incremented by 1, `j` is 1**
