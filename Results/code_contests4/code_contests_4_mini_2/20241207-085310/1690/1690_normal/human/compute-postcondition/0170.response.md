To analyze the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we take into consideration the following:

- The loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0`, decrementing `j` each time.
- The loop continues until `cur` is equal to `i` or until all iterations are complete.
- For each iteration, if `cur` is not equal to `i`, `cur` is decremented only if `s[j]` matches `word[cur]`.
- `en` is decreased by 1 for each iteration.

Given the output states after the first few iterations, we can infer that:

1. If `cur` never equals `i`, the loop will run for all `n` iterations. 
2. At the end of all iterations, `j` will be `-1`, `cur` will either be decremented depending on the matches found or will remain unchanged if no matches occurred, and `en` will be `n` decremented by the number of iterations (which is `n`).

However, if during the iterations `cur` becomes equal to `i`, the loop breaks prematurely.

From the information provided, we can summarize the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed as follows:

- If the loop runs completely, then `j` will be `-1`, `cur` may be less than or equal to `3` (if `cur` is decremented), and `en` will be `0`.
- If the loop breaks early when `cur` equals `i`, `cur` will be equal to `i`, and `en` will be less than `n` depending on how many iterations were completed.

Thus, we can conclude the output state:

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `j` is -1, `cur` is either equal to `i` or remains unchanged, and `en` is the final count of iterations executed leading to `en` being less than or equal to `n`.**
