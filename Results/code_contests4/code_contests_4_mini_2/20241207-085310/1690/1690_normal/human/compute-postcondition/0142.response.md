The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `cur` is equal to `i` (which is 2), `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`, `be` is increased by 1, `en` is set to `n`, `j` is 2, `tem` remains unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
