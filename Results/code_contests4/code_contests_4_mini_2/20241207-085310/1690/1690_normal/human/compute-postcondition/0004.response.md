The variables `be`, `en`, and `tem` are initialized with the values 0, `n`, and 0 respectively. The variable `n` is an integer from input, which has not been specified, but it remains unchanged. The other variables `s`, `a`, `ans`, `word`, and `i` are also unaffected by this assignment.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer from input, `s` is a stripped string from input, `a` is a list of integers from input, `ans` is float('inf'), `word` is 'hard', `i` is 0, `be` is 0, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from input, `s` is a stripped string from input, `a` is a list of integers from input, `ans` is float('inf'), `word` is 'hard', `i` is 0, `be` is 0, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0**
