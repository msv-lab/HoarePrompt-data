The value of `tem` is incremented by `a[j]`. The value of `j` is currently `be`, and since `s[j]` is equal to `word[i]`, we can conclude that `a[j]` is a value that corresponds to the index `j`. The previous values indicate that `tem` was 0 before this operation, so `tem` will now equal `0 + a[j]`, which is just `a[j]`. The other variables remain unchanged, thus the output state reflects the updated value of `tem`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is 0, `be` is less than `en`, `cur` is either 0 or 3, `tem` is `a[j]`, `j` is `be`, and the element at index `j` of `s` is equal to the character at index `i` of `word`.**
