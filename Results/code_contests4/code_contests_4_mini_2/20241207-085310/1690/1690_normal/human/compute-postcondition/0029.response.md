According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `n`. The loop is set to run from `n - 1` down to `0`, which means that `n` must be at least `1` for the loop to execute at least once. Given that `i` starts at `0`, `be` should reflect the number of iterations that have been executed, which will be `0` at the start since the loop has not yet run. 

For the loop to execute, `n` needs to be greater than `0`, and `j` will start at `n - 1`. 

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `be` is 0, `cur` is 3, `tem` remains 0, `j` is `n - 1` (the starting value for the loop)**
