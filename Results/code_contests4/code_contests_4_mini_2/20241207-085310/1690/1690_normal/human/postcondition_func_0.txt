The function accepts an integer `n`, a string `s` of length `n`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It calculates the minimum sum of integers from `a` corresponding to characters in `s` that match the word "hard" when evaluated from the beginning and end of the string. The function prints the minimum sum found for the specified conditions but does not return any value.
