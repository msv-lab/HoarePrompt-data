#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, followed by t strings s of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) where each character s_i is one of {'R', 'S', 'P'}. The total length of all strings in one test case does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func():
    range = xrange
    input = raw_input
    mapper = {'R': 0, 'P': 1, 'S': 2}
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        S = [mapper[c] for c in input()]
        
        count = [0] * 3
        
        for s in S:
            count[s] += 1
        
        maxi = max(range(3), key=count.__getitem__)
        
        maxi -= 2
        
        print('RPS'[maxi]) * len(S)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an input integer greater than 0, `S` is a list containing the strings inputted during each iteration, `count` is an array reflecting the total counts of each character based on the elements in `S` for all iterations, `maxi` is the maximum index of the character that occurred the most across all inputs, adjusted by -2, and the final output is the character from 'RPS' indexed by `maxi` repeated the total length of all strings processed across iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` strings consisting of the characters 'R', 'S', and 'P'. It counts the occurrences of each character in each string, determines the character that occurs most frequently, adjusts its index, and then outputs that character repeated for the length of the string. In the case where the character 'R' is the most frequent, it outputs 'P' instead due to the index adjustment. Thus, the function produces a repeated character output based on the most common character in the input strings.
