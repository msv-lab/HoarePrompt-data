The program provided does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description. 

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Index Adjustment Error**: The line `maxi -= 2` is incorrect. The `maxi` variable is intended to select the choice that counters the most frequent choice of the bot. The proper adjustments should be:
   - If the most frequent character is 'R' (index 0), then the optimal counter is 'P' (index 1).
   - If the most frequent character is 'P' (index 1), then the optimal counter is 'S' (index 2).
   - If the most frequent character is 'S' (index 2), then the optimal counter is 'R' (index 0).
   The adjustment of `maxi` should be done with a proper mapping to ensure correct choices are selected.

2. **Output Syntax**: The program uses `print('RPS'[maxi]) * len(S)` which results in a string that is concatenated instead of outputting the repeated character the intended number of times. This is not a valid way to produce the output required.

3. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic for determining the winning choice is flawed due to the adjustment and how `maxi` is calculated. The program should directly map the most frequent choice to its counter instead of adjusting the index arbitrarily.

### Conclusion:
Due to these errors, the function does not accurately determine the optimal choices of 'Rock', 'Paper', or 'Scissors' for maximizing wins against the bot's strategy as required by the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
