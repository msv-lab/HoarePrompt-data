You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Recently, you found a bot to play "Rock paper scissors" with. Unfortunately, the bot uses quite a simple algorithm to play: he has a string s = s_1 s_2 ... s_{n} of length n where each letter is either R, S or P.

While initializing, the bot is choosing a starting index pos (1 ≤ pos ≤ n), and then it can play any number of rounds. In the first round, he chooses "Rock", "Scissors" or "Paper" based on the value of s_{pos}: 

  * if s_{pos} is equal to R the bot chooses "Rock"; 
  * if s_{pos} is equal to S the bot chooses "Scissors"; 
  * if s_{pos} is equal to P the bot chooses "Paper"; 



In the second round, the bot's choice is based on the value of s_{pos + 1}. In the third round — on s_{pos + 2} and so on. After s_n the bot returns to s_1 and continues his game.

You plan to play n rounds and you've already figured out the string s but still don't know what is the starting index pos. But since the bot's tactic is so boring, you've decided to find n choices to each round to maximize the average number of wins.

In other words, let's suggest your choices are c_1 c_2 ... c_n and if the bot starts from index pos then you'll win in win(pos) rounds. Find c_1 c_2 ... c_n such that (win(1) + win(2) + ... + win(n))/(n) is maximum possible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases.

Next t lines contain test cases — one per line. The first and only line of each test case contains string s = s_1 s_2 ... s_{n} (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; s_i ∈ \{R, S, P\}) — the string of the bot.

It's guaranteed that the total length of all strings in one test doesn't exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each test case, print n choices c_1 c_2 ... c_n to maximize the average number of wins. Print them in the same manner as the string s.

If there are multiple optimal answers, print any of them.

Example

Input


3
RRRR
RSP
S


Output


PPPP
RSP
R

Note

In the first test case, the bot (wherever it starts) will always choose "Rock", so we can always choose "Paper". So, in any case, we will win all n = 4 rounds, so the average is also equal to 4.

In the second test case: 

  * if bot will start from pos = 1, then (s_1, c_1) is draw, (s_2, c_2) is draw and (s_3, c_3) is draw, so win(1) = 0; 
  * if bot will start from pos = 2, then (s_2, c_1) is win, (s_3, c_2) is win and (s_1, c_3) is win, so win(2) = 3; 
  * if bot will start from pos = 3, then (s_3, c_1) is lose, (s_1, c_2) is lose and (s_2, c_3) is lose, so win(3) = 0; 

The average is equal to (0 + 3 + 0)/(3) = 1 and it can be proven that it's the maximum possible average.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, followed by t strings s of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) where each character s_i is one of {'R', 'S', 'P'}. The total length of all strings in one test case does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func():
    range = xrange
    input = raw_input
    mapper = {'R': 0, 'P': 1, 'S': 2}
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        S = [mapper[c] for c in input()]
        
        count = [0] * 3
        
        for s in S:
            count[s] += 1
        
        maxi = max(range(3), key=count.__getitem__)
        
        maxi -= 2
        
        print('RPS'[maxi]) * len(S)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an input integer greater than 0, `S` is a list containing the strings inputted during each iteration, `count` is an array reflecting the total counts of each character based on the elements in `S` for all iterations, `maxi` is the maximum index of the character that occurred the most across all inputs, adjusted by -2, and the final output is the character from 'RPS' indexed by `maxi` repeated the total length of all strings processed across iterations.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
