You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: Recently, you found a bot to play "Rock paper scissors" with. Unfortunately, the bot uses quite a simple algorithm to play: he has a string s = s_1 s_2 ... s_{n} of length n where each letter is either R, S or P.

While initializing, the bot is choosing a starting index pos (1 ≤ pos ≤ n), and then it can play any number of rounds. In the first round, he chooses "Rock", "Scissors" or "Paper" based on the value of s_{pos}: 

  * if s_{pos} is equal to R the bot chooses "Rock"; 
  * if s_{pos} is equal to S the bot chooses "Scissors"; 
  * if s_{pos} is equal to P the bot chooses "Paper"; 



In the second round, the bot's choice is based on the value of s_{pos + 1}. In the third round — on s_{pos + 2} and so on. After s_n the bot returns to s_1 and continues his game.

You plan to play n rounds and you've already figured out the string s but still don't know what is the starting index pos. But since the bot's tactic is so boring, you've decided to find n choices to each round to maximize the average number of wins.

In other words, let's suggest your choices are c_1 c_2 ... c_n and if the bot starts from index pos then you'll win in win(pos) rounds. Find c_1 c_2 ... c_n such that (win(1) + win(2) + ... + win(n))/(n) is maximum possible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases.

Next t lines contain test cases — one per line. The first and only line of each test case contains string s = s_1 s_2 ... s_{n} (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; s_i ∈ \{R, S, P\}) — the string of the bot.

It's guaranteed that the total length of all strings in one test doesn't exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each test case, print n choices c_1 c_2 ... c_n to maximize the average number of wins. Print them in the same manner as the string s.

If there are multiple optimal answers, print any of them.

Example

Input


3
RRRR
RSP
S


Output


PPPP
RSP
R

Note

In the first test case, the bot (wherever it starts) will always choose "Rock", so we can always choose "Paper". So, in any case, we will win all n = 4 rounds, so the average is also equal to 4.

In the second test case: 

  * if bot will start from pos = 1, then (s_1, c_1) is draw, (s_2, c_2) is draw and (s_3, c_3) is draw, so win(1) = 0; 
  * if bot will start from pos = 2, then (s_2, c_1) is win, (s_3, c_2) is win and (s_1, c_3) is win, so win(2) = 3; 
  * if bot will start from pos = 3, then (s_3, c_1) is lose, (s_1, c_2) is lose and (s_2, c_3) is lose, so win(3) = 0; 

The average is equal to (0 + 3 + 0)/(3) = 1 and it can be proven that it's the maximum possible average.
