The variable `count` is assigned a list of three zeros, created by multiplying the list `[0]` by 3. This affects only the `count` variable, while `t` and `S` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is an input integer greater than 0; `S` is a list created by mapping input characters through `mapper`; `count` is [0, 0, 0].

Output State: **`t` is an input integer greater than 0; `S` is a list created by mapping input characters through `mapper`; `count` is [0, 0, 0]**
