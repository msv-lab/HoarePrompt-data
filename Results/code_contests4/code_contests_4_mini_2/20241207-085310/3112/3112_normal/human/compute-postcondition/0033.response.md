According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `S`. If `S` has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. The variable `maxi` is updated based on the maximum occurrence count in `S` and is then decreased by 2; however, this information doesn't directly affect the execution of the loop. At the start of the loop, the variable `s` will take the value of the first element in the list `S`. 

For the loop to execute the first time, `S` must be a non-empty list. Therefore, we need to ensure that `S` contains at least 1 character.

State: **`maxi` is updated based on the maximum occurrence count in `S`, `maxi` is decreased by 2, for the loop to execute the first time `S` is a non-empty list, and `s` is the first element in the list `S`**.
