The `mapper` variable is assigned a dictionary that maps the characters 'R', 'P', and 'S' to the integers 0, 1, and 2, respectively. This does not affect the values of `t`, `s`, or `range`, but it creates a new mapping for converting the characters in the string `s` to their corresponding integer values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `s` are strings of length `n`, where each character `s_i` is one of {'R', 'S', 'P'}, `range` is assigned the value of `xrange`, and `mapper` is {'R': 0, 'P': 1, 'S': 2}.**
