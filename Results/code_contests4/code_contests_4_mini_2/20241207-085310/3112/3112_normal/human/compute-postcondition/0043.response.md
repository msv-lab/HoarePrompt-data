Output State: **`t` is an input integer greater than 0, `S` is a list containing the strings inputted during each iteration, `count` is an array reflecting the total counts of each character based on the elements in `S` for all iterations, `maxi` is the maximum index of the character that occurred the most across all inputs, adjusted by -2, and the final output is the character from 'RPS' indexed by `maxi` repeated the total length of all strings processed across iterations.**
