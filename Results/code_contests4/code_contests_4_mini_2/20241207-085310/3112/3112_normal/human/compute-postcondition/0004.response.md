According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop will execute `t` times if `t` is at least 1. The variables `s` and `mapper` do not affect the execution of the loop itself but could be relevant within the loop body.

Thus, for the loop to execute the first time, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0. Since the loop variable `_` does not require any specific initialization value, it can be considered as unused in this context.

State: **`t` is an input integer greater than 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
