According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `S`. Since `S` is a non-empty list with at least 2 elements at the end of the last iteration, the loop can execute for the third time if `S` contains at least 3 elements. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is the second element in the list `S`, and `maxi` has been decreased by 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be updated to the third element in the list `S`, and `maxi` must remain valid for that iteration. Thus, for the loop to continue, `S` must have at least 3 elements, `s` must be the third element, and `maxi` can be any valid value that was decremented previously.

State: **`maxi` is decreased by 2, `S` is a non-empty list with at least 3 elements, `s` is the third element in the list `S`.**
