The variable `t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variables `s`, `range`, and `mapper` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `t` is now an integer based on user input, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer; `s` are strings of length `n`, `range` is assigned the value of `xrange`, and `mapper` is {'R': 0, 'P': 1, 'S': 2}.**
