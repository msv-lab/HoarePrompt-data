According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `S`. If `S` is non-empty, the loop can execute again for the next element in the list. At the end of the last iteration, `S` is a non-empty list, `s` is the first element in the list, and `maxi` has been decreased by 2. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, `s` must be updated to the next element in the list `S`. Therefore, the next value of `s` will be the second element in `S`, and `S` must have at least 2 elements for the loop to execute again.

State: **`maxi` is updated based on the maximum occurrence count in `S`, `maxi` is decreased by 2, `S` is a non-empty list with at least 2 elements, `s` is the second element in the list `S`.**
