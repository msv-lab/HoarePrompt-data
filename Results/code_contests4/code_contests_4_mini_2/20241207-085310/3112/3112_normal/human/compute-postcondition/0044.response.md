The function `func` does not directly accept parameters in its signature. However, it processes input that consists of an integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases, followed by `t` strings `s`. Each string `s` is of length `n` where each character in `s` is one of {'R', 'S', 'P'}. The total length of all strings does not exceed 2 â‹… 10^5.

The function's output is not explicitly described in the prompt, but based on the context of handling multiple test cases with strings of specific characters, it likely processes these strings and returns some results based on them.

Functionality: **The function processes an integer t representing the number of test cases followed by t strings consisting of the characters 'R', 'S', 'P', and returns results based on the processing of these strings.**
