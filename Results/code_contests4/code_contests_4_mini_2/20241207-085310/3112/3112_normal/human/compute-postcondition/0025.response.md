The value of `count[s]` is incremented by 1. The variable `s` refers to the third element of the list `S`, and `count[s]` is affected by this operation. Other variables such as `t` and `maxi` are not directly impacted by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer greater than 1, `S` is a non-empty list with at least 3 elements, `count[s]` is incremented by 1, `maxi` is decreased by 2, `s` is the third element of the list `S`.**
