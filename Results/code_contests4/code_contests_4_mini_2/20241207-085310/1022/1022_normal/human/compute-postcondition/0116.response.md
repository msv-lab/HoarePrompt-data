Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` has at least `n` elements, and `la` is greater than 1. If `la - i - 1` equals 0, then `ans` is increased by 1, `cnt[i]` is decreased by 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
