The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` has at least `n + 1` elements, `bit` is the binary representation of `a[i]`, `lb` is greater than 2, `j` is `lb - 3`, and `cnt[2]` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
