Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` has at least `n` elements, and `la` is the length of `axor`. If `cnt[i]` is 0, -1 is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, `cnt[i]` is decremented by 1, `la` remains the length of `axor`, `ans` is incremented by 1, and `axor` is updated to the binary string representation of the integer `int('1' * (la - 2), 2).***
