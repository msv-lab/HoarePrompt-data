The code `cnt[lb - 1 - j] += 1` increments the value at index `lb - 1 - j` of the list `cnt` by 1. The value of `j` is determined by the condition that the j-th bit of `a[i]` in its binary representation (`bit[j]`) is equal to '1', and `lb` is greater than 0. 

Since `lb` is greater than 0, `lb - 1 - j` is a valid index for the list `cnt`. The variable `cnt` is updated based on the current value of `j`, which indicates the position of the '1' bit in the binary representation of `a[i]`.

The previous values of the affected variables were:
- `cnt` was previously defined but its values are not specified.
- `lb` is greater than 0.
- `j` is determined by the bits of `a[i]`.

Thus, after executing the code, we know that the specific index in `cnt` will be incremented by 1.

Output State: **`cnt` is updated at index `lb - 1 - j` by adding 1.**
