Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `a` has at least `n + 1` elements, `bit` is the binary representation of `a[i]` such that `lb` is greater than 0, and `cnt` is defined. If `bit[j]` is '1', then `cnt` is updated at index `lb - 1 - j` by adding 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `bit[j]` is not '1', the state of `cnt` remains unchanged.***
