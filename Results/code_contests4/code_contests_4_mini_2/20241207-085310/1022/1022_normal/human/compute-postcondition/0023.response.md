According to the code, the loop iterates from `lb - 1` down to `0`. The loop can execute again if `j` is decremented by 1 and remains greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `k`, where `k` is the value from the previous iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be `k - 1`, and it must be at least `0`.

State: **If `bit[j]` is '1', then `cnt[lb - 1 - (k - 1)]` is incremented by 1 and the loop can execute again for `j` equal to `k - 1`, so it must be that `j` is `k - 1` and `j` must be greater than or equal to 0.**
