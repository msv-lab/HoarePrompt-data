The initial state provides several variables, notably `axor`, which is involved in a binary representation conversion. The code snippet converts the value of `axor` to its binary string representation, excluding the '0b' prefix. This operation does not affect any other variables directly.

Since `axor` is updated via a XOR operation with `tmp`, we assume that it holds a valid integer value at this point, and we are converting it to a binary string. The resulting binary string will represent the value of `axor` as a sequence of '0's and '1's.

The output state will reflect the updated value of `axor` in its binary form while other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` has at least `n` elements, `cnt` contains the counts of the most significant '1' bits, `la` is the length of `axor`, `ans` is 1, the `i`-th element of `axor` is '1', `cnt[i]` is greater than 0; `axor` is the binary representation of its previous integer value.**
