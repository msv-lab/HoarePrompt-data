The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `a` has at least `n + 1` elements, `bit` is the binary representation of `a[i]`, `lb` is greater than 0, `j` is `lb - 3` and must be greater than or equal to 0; `cnt[2]` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
