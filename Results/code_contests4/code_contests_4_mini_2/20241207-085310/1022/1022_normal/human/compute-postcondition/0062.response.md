Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `a` has at least `n` elements, `cnt` contains the counts of the most significant '1' bits for the binary representations of all elements in `a[0]` to `a[n-1]`, with each index in `cnt` representing the count of the most significant '1' bit position across all processed elements; if an element has no '1' bit, the corresponding index in `cnt` remains unchanged.**
