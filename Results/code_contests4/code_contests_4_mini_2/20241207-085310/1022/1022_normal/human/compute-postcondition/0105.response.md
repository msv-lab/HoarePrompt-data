The value of `axor` is converted from a binary string to an integer and then XORed with `tmp`. The value of `tmp` is calculated as `int('1' * (la - 2), 2)`, which is a binary number consisting of `la - 2` ones. This operation will change the value of `axor` but will not affect the other variables. Therefore, the output state will include the updated value of `axor` after the XOR operation.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` has at least `n` elements, `cnt[i]` is decremented by 1, `la` is the length of `axor`, `ans` is incremented by 1, `tmp` is `int('1' * (la - 2), 2), `axor` is updated to `int(axor, 2) ^ tmp`**.
