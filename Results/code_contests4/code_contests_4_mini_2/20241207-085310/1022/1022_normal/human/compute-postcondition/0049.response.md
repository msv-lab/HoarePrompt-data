Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` has at least `n + 1` elements, `bit` is the binary representation of `a[i]`, `lb` is greater than 0 (indicating `a[i]` is a positive integer), `cnt` contains the count of the most significant '1' bit in `bit`, and the j-th element of `bit` is '1'.***
