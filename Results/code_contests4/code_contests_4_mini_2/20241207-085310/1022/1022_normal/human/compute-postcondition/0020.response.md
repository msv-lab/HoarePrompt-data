Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `mxlba` is the maximum length of the binary representation of all integers in `a` or 0 if `n` is 0, `cnt` is initialized with a size of `mxlba + 5`, `bit` is the binary representation of `a[n]`, `lb` is the length of `bit`, `cnt[lb - 1 - j]` is incremented by 1.**
