`n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous value of `N` remains unchanged, and it is still a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100000. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100000; `n` is an input integer.
Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100000; `n` is an input integer**
