Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` has at least `n` elements, `cnt` contains the counts of the most significant '1' bits, `la` is the length of `axor`, and the `i`-th element of `axor` is '1'. If `cnt[i]` is equal to 0, the program exits with output value -1. Otherwise, `ans` is set to 1, `cnt[i]` is greater than 0, and `axor` is updated to reflect the binary representation of its previous integer value.***
