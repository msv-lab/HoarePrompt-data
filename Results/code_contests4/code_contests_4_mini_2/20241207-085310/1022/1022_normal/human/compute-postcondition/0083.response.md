Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` has at least `n` elements, `cnt` contains the counts of the most significant '1' bits, `la` is the length of `axor`, `ans` is 0, the `i`-th element of `axor` is '1', and the count of the most significant '1' bits at index `i` is equal to 0 (i.e., `cnt[i] == 0`), and the output value is -1.**
