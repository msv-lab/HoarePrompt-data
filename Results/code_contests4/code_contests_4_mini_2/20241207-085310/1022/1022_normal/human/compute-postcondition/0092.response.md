The value of `axor` is updated by performing a bitwise XOR operation with `tmp`. The variable `tmp` is calculated as `int('1' * (la - i - 1), 2)`, which creates a binary number consisting of `la - i - 1` ones. The previous value of `axor` is converted from binary to an integer. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` has at least `n` elements, `cnt` contains the counts of the most significant '1' bits, `la` is the length of `axor`, `ans` is 1, the `i`-th element of `axor` is '1', `cnt[i]` is greater than 0; `axor` is updated via a XOR operation with `tmp`.
