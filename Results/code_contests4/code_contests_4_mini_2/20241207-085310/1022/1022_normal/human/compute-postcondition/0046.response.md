The variable `bit` is assigned the value of the binary representation of `a[i]`, excluding the '0b' prefix that Python's `bin()` function adds. The specific value of `a[i]` is not provided, but since `a` has at least `n + 1` elements and `n` is greater than 0, `a[i]` must be a valid integer. Therefore, `bit` will be a string representing the binary form of that integer. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` has at least `n + 1` elements, `bit` is the binary representation of `a[i]`, `lb` is greater than 0, and `cnt` contains the count of the most significant '1' bit in `bit`.**
