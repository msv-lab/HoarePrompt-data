According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop executes as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` has at least `n` elements, `cnt` contains the counts of the most significant '1' bits, `axor` is the result of `axor` XOR `a[i]`, which is currently 0 XOR `a[1]`.**
