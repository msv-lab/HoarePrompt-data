Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` has at least `n` elements, `cnt[i]` is decremented by 1, `la` is the length of `axor`, and `ans` is incremented by 1. If `la - i - 1 == 0`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
