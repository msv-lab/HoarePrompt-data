Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `a` has at least `n` elements, `cnt` contains the counts of the most significant '1' bits, and `axor` is the result of the XOR operation on all elements of `a` from `a[0]` to `a[n-1]`. If `axor` is equal to 0, the program has exited.***
