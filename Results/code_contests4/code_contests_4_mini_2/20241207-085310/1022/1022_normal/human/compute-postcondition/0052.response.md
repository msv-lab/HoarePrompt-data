Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` has at least `n + 1` elements, `bit` is the binary representation of `a[i]`, `lb` is greater than 0, and if `bit[j]` is '1', then `cnt[lb - 1 - j]` is incremented by 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
