Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `mxlba` is the maximum length of the binary representation of all integers in `a` or 0 if `n` is 0, `cnt` contains the count of the most significant '1' bit (if any) in `bit`, `bit` is the binary representation of `a[i]`, and `lb` is the length of `bit`.**
