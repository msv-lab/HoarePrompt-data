Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` has at least `n + 1` elements, `bit` is the binary representation of `a[i]`, `lb` is greater than 2, and `j` is `lb - 3`. If `bit[j]` is '1', then `cnt[2]` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
