Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` has at least `n + 1` elements, `bit` is the binary representation of `a[i]`, `lb` is greater than or equal to 0, and `cnt` contains counts of the most significant '1' bit in `bit` for each position from `0` to `lb - 1`, with the first '1' bit encountered from the right being counted and the loop terminating after that. If there are no '1' bits in `bit`, `cnt` remains unchanged.**
