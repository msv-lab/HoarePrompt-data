The variable `mxlba` is initialized to 0. The values of the other variables `N`, `n`, and `a` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers taken from user input; `mxlba` is 0. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers taken from user input; `mxlba` is 0**
