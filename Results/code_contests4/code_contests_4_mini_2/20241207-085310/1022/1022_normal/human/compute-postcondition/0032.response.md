Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `a` has at least `n + 1` elements, `bit` is the binary representation of `a[i]` such that `lb` is greater than 0, `cnt` is defined, and the j-th bit of `a[i]` in its binary representation (`bit[j]`) is equal to '1'.***
