The line of code `cnt[lb - 1 - j] += 1` increments the value at the index `lb - 1 - j` of the list `cnt` by 1. The variables `cnt`, `lb`, and `j` are affected by this operation, while other variables remain unchanged. 

Since `lb` is greater than 0 and indicates that `a[i]` is a positive integer, `lb` is at least 1. The expression `lb - 1 - j` will yield a valid index for `cnt` as long as `j` is within the bounds of `lb - 1`. 

Therefore, the output state reflects this update in `cnt` at the specified index, while all other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` has at least `n + 1` elements, `bit` is the binary representation of `a[i]`, `lb` is greater than 0, and `cnt[lb - 1 - j]` is incremented by 1.**
