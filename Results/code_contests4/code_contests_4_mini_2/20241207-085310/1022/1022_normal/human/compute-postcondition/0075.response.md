The variable `axor` is assigned the value of its binary representation as a string, excluding the '0b' prefix. The previous value of `axor` remains unchanged but is now represented in binary format. The states of other variables (`N`, `n`, `i`, `a`, `cnt`) are unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `a` has at least `n` elements, `cnt` contains the counts of the most significant '1' bits, and `axor` is now in binary format.
