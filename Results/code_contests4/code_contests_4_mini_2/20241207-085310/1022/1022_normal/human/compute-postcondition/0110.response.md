The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is 1. Therefore, after execution, `i` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` has at least `n` elements, and for the loop to execute again `la` is greater than 1**.
