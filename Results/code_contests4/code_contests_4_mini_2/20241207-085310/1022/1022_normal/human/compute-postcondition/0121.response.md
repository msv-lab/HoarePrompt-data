Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` has at least `n` elements, and `la` is greater than 1; if `axor[i]` is '1' and `cnt[i]` is 0, -1 is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, if `axor[i]` is '1', `tmp` is assigned the value of `int('1' * (la - i - 1), 2)`, and `axor` is now in binary format.***
