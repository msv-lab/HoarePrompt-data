In the given code snippet, `cnt[lb - 1 - j]` is updated. The variable `j` is defined as `lb - 3`. Therefore, we can substitute `j` in the expression:

```
cnt[lb - 1 - (lb - 3)] += 1
```

This simplifies to:
```
cnt[2] += 1
```

Assuming `cnt` is a list with at least 3 elements (since `lb` is greater than 2), the element at index 2 of the list `cnt` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`N`, `n`, `i`, `a`, `bit`, `lb`, and `j`) remain unchanged as this operation only affects the `cnt` list.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` has at least `n + 1` elements, `bit` is the binary representation of `a[i]`, `lb` is greater than 2, `j` is `lb - 3`, and `cnt[2]` is incremented by 1.**
