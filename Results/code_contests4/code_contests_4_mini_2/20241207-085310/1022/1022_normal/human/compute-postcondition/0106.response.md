The variable `axor` is updated to a binary string representation by converting the integer value of `axor` back to binary using `bin(axor)[2:]`, which returns the binary string without the '0b' prefix. The value of `axor` changes, but the states of the other variables (`N`, `n`, `i`, `cnt[i]`, `la`, `ans`, `tmp`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` has at least `n` elements, `cnt[i]` is decremented by 1, `la` is the length of `axor`, `ans` is incremented by 1, `tmp` is `int('1' * (la - 2), 2), `axor` is now a binary string representation of the previous integer value.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` has at least `n` elements, `cnt[i]` is decremented by 1, `la` is the length of `axor`, `ans` is incremented by 1, `tmp` is `int('1' * (la - 2), 2), `axor` is now a binary string representation of the previous integer value.**
