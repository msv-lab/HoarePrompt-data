Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `a` has at least `n + 1` elements, `bit` is the binary representation of `a[i]`, `lb` is greater than 0, and `cnt` contains the count of the most significant '1' bit in `bit`. If `bit` contains at least one '1', then `cnt` will have been updated at the index corresponding to the position of the most significant '1' bit in `bit`; otherwise, `cnt` remains unchanged.**
