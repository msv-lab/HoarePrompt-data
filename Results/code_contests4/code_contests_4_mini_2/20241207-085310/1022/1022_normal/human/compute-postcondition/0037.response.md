The code `cnt[lb - 1 - j] += 1` increments the value at index `lb - 1 - j` of the `cnt` array by 1. The variable `j` is previously defined as `lb - 2`. Therefore, when substituting `j` into the expression, we get:

`cnt[lb - 1 - (lb - 2)] += 1`  
`cnt[lb - 1 - lb + 2] += 1`  
`cnt[1] += 1`

This means that the second element (index 1) of the `cnt` array is incremented by 1. The other variables (`N`, `n`, `i`, `a`, `bit`, `lb`, and `j`) are not affected. 

Thus, the output state reflects that the second element of `cnt` has been incremented.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `a` has at least `n + 1` elements, `bit` is the binary representation of `a[i]`, `lb` is greater than 0, `j` is `lb - 2` and must be greater than or equal to 0, and `cnt[1]` has been incremented by 1.**
