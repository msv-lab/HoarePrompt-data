The code snippet `cnt[lb - 1 - j] += 1` modifies the `cnt` array at the index `lb - 1 - j`, incrementing its value by 1. The variable `j` is defined as `lb - 2`, which means `j` can be calculated based on the value of `lb`.

Since `lb` is greater than 0, `j` is guaranteed to be non-negative. The impact of this operation depends on the current value of `j` and `lb`. The new value at `cnt[lb - 1 - j]` will be increased by 1. Other variables (`N`, `n`, `i`, `a`, and `bit`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` has at least `n + 1` elements, `bit` is the binary representation of `a[i]`, `lb` is greater than 0, `j` is `lb - 2`, and the value at `cnt[lb - 1 - j]` has been incremented by 1.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` has at least `n + 1` elements, `bit` is the binary representation of `a[i]`, `lb` is greater than 0, `j` is `lb - 2`, and `cnt[lb - 1 - j]` is incremented by 1.**
