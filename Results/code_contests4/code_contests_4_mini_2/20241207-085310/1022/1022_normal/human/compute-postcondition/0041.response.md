The statement `cnt[lb - 1 - j] += 1` increases the value at the index `lb - 1 - j` of the array `cnt` by 1. The variables that affect this operation are `lb` and `j`. Given that `j` is `lb - 3`, we can simplify the index as follows:

1. Calculate the index: `lb - 1 - j = lb - 1 - (lb - 3) = 2`.
2. The value at index `2` of `cnt` is incremented by 1.

The states of the other variables `N`, `n`, `i`, `a`, `bit`, and `j` are not directly affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `a` has at least `n + 1` elements, `bit` is the binary representation of `a[i]`, `lb` is greater than 0, `j` is `lb - 3` and must be greater than or equal to 0; `cnt[2]` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `a` has at least `n + 1` elements, `bit` is the binary representation of `a[i]`, `lb` is greater than 0, `j` is `lb - 3` and must be greater than or equal to 0; `cnt[2]` is increased by 1.**
