To determine the necessary states for the for loop to execute, we need to analyze the loop's range and the variables involved.

1. The loop is defined as `for j in xrange(lb - 1, -1, -1)`. This means the loop variable `j` starts at `lb - 1` and decrements until it reaches `-1`. 

2. For the loop to execute at least once, the starting point, `lb - 1`, must be greater than or equal to `0`. Therefore, `lb` must be at least `1`.

3. The variable `lb` is defined as the length of `bit`, which is the binary representation of `a[i]`. For `lb` to be greater than `0`, `a[i]` must be a valid integer and its binary representation must have at least one '1' bit. 

4. The index `i` is currently `n + 1`, which needs to be within the bounds of the array `a`. Since `n` is greater than `0`, `i` will be at least `2`. Thus, `a` must have a length of at least `n + 1` to ensure that `a[i]` is valid.

5. Additionally, it is important to note that `cnt` (the count of the most significant '1' bit in `bit`) and `bit` itself must also be properly defined to ensure that `lb` can be computed correctly.

In summary, for the loop to execute:
- `lb` must be greater than `0`, which implies `a[i]` must exist and have a binary representation with at least one '1'.
- `a` must have at least `n + 1` elements.

Hence, the necessary adjusted state would be:

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `a` has at least `n + 1` elements, `bit` is the binary representation of `a[i]` such that `lb` is greater than 0, and `cnt` is defined**.
