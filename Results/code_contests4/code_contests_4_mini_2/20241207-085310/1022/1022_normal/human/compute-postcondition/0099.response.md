The `exit()` function terminates the program immediately, and no further code is executed. The values of the variables remain unchanged because the program stops running. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` has at least `n` elements, `cnt` contains the counts of the most significant '1' bits, `la` is the length of `axor`, la must be greater than 0; -1 is printed, and the program has exited.
