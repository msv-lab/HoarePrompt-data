Output State: **The values of the variables do not change but we exit the program. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` has at least `n` elements, and for the loop to execute again `la` is greater than 1; -1 is printed and we exit the program.**
