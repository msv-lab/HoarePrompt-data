Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `la`, `a` has at least `n` elements, `cnt` may have non-negative counts for each index, `la` is the length of `axor`, and `ans` is the total number of '1's processed from `axor`. If any `cnt[i]` was 0 during the iterations for the corresponding '1's in `axor`, the program would have exited with output value -1 before reaching this state. If all conditions were met, `axor` would have been fully processed.**
