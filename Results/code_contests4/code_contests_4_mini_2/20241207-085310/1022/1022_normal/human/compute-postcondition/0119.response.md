The value of `axor` is converted to its binary representation using `bin(axor)[2:]`, which removes the '0b' prefix from the binary string. The previous value of `axor` remains unchanged, but it is now represented as a string in binary format. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 2; `a` has at least `n` elements; `la` is greater than 1; `tmp` is assigned the value of `int('1' * (la - i - 1), 2); `axor` is now in binary format.
