The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` has at least `n` elements, `cnt[i]` is decremented by 1, `la` is the length of `axor`, `ans` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
