The function accepts no parameters and reads a positive integer N followed by N integers from input. It computes the maximum length of the binary representation of these integers, counts the occurrences of the most significant '1' bits, and performs an XOR operation on all integers. If the result of the XOR operation is zero, it returns 0. If the XOR result is non-zero, it processes each bit of the XOR result, checking against the counts of '1's. If a required count is zero, it returns -1. Otherwise, it returns the total number of '1's processed from the XOR result. The function can exit early based on certain conditions, such as returning -1 or 0, which may not be explicitly stated in the annotations.
