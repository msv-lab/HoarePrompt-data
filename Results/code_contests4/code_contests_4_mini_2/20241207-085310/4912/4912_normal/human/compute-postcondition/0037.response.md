Postcondition: ***`S` is a string that consists of uppercase English letters, has a length between 9 and 50, and ends with the substring 'FESTIVAL'; `n` is greater than 2; `i` is 2. If `S[i]` is '0' and `tar` is 1, `temp` is an empty list, `res` is updated to include a copy of `temp`, and `tar` is set to 0. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
