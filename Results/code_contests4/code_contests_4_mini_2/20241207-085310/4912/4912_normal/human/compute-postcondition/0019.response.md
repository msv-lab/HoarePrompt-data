The code `res.append(temp.copy())` appends a copy of the list `temp` to the list `res`. The values of `S`, `n`, `i`, `tar`, and `one` do not change as a result of this operation. The previous state of `temp` is included in the output state since it is being copied and added to `res`. 

Output State: **`S` is a string that consists of uppercase English letters, has a length between 9 and 50, ends with the substring 'FESTIVAL'; `n` is greater than 1; `i` is 1; the substring of `S` from index `i - 1` to `i + 2` is not equal to '101'; the character at index `i` of `S` is '0'; `tar` is equal to 1; `one` is appended to `temp`; `res` now contains a copy of `temp`.**
