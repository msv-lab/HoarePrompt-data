Postcondition: ***`S` is a string that consists of uppercase English letters, has a length between 9 and 50, ends with the substring 'FESTIVAL'; `n` is greater than 1; `i` is 1; the substring of `S` from index `i - 1` to `i + 2` is not equal to '101'. If the character at index `i` of `S` is '1', then `one` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if the character at index `i` of `S` is '0' and `tar` is 1, then `tar` is updated to 0, the string 'one' is appended to `temp`, `res` is updated to contain a copy of `temp`, and `temp` is reset to an empty list; if the character at index `i` is neither '1' nor '0', then `one` is assigned the value 0.***
