The value of `one` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `one` is unknown, so the output state is: variable `one` is increased by 1. The states of the other variables (`S`, `n`, `i`, `tar`, `temp`, `res`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **variable `one` is increased by 1; `S` is a string that consists of uppercase English letters, has a length between 9 and 50, and ends with the substring 'FESTIVAL'; `n` is greater than 2; `i` is 2; `tar` is 1; `temp` is an empty list; `res` is updated to include a copy of `temp`.**
