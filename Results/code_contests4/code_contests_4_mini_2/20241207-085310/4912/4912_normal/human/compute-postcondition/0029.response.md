According to the code, the loop iterates with `i` starting from 1 and going up to `n - 2`. Since `n` is greater than 1, this means the loop can execute multiple times as long as `i` remains less than `n - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 2. 

Since the loop condition is `for i in range(1, n - 1)`, we need to ensure that `i` is still less than `n - 1` for the loop to continue executing. Given that `n` is greater than 1, it follows that for the next iteration to occur, `n` must be at least 3 (so that `n - 1` is at least 2).

Thus, the updated conditions at the start of the next iteration will reflect:
- `i` is now 2.
- For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`S` is a string that consists of uppercase English letters, has a length between 9 and 50, and ends with the substring 'FESTIVAL'; `n` must be greater than 2; `i` is 2.**
