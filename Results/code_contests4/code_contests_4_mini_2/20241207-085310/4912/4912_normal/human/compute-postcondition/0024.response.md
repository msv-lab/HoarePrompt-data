The value of `one` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `one` is unknown. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a string that consists of uppercase English letters, has a length between 9 and 50, ends with the substring 'FESTIVAL'; `n` is greater than 1; `i` is 1; the substring of `S` from index `i - 1` to `i + 2` is not equal to '101'; the character at index `i` of `S` is '1'; `one` is increased by 1.
