The variable `temp` is initialized as an empty list. The previous values of the other variables are not affected by this operation, and the output state will reflect that `temp` is now an empty list. 

Output State: **`S` is a string that consists of uppercase English letters, has a length between 9 and 50, ends with the substring 'FESTIVAL'; `n` is greater than 1; `i` is 1; the substring of `S` from index `i - 1` to `i + 2` is not equal to '101'; the character at index `i` of `S` is '0'; `tar` is equal to 1; `one` is appended to `temp`; `res` now contains a copy of `temp`; `temp` is now an empty list.**
