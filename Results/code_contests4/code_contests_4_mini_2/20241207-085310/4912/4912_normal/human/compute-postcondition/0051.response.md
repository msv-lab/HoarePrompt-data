The variable `one` is incremented by 1. The initial state does not provide the previous value of `one`, but it indicates that `one` is updated based on `S[i]`, which is not specified here. Thus, we can only determine that `one` is increased by 1 from its previous value. The states of the other variables, including `S`, `n`, `i`, `tar`, `temp`, and `res`, remain unaffected.

Output State: **`S` is a string that consists of uppercase English letters with a length between 9 and 50, ending with the substring 'FESTIVAL'; `n` is greater than 3; `i` is 3; `one` is increased by 1; `tar` is 1; `temp` is an empty list; `res` is an empty list.**
