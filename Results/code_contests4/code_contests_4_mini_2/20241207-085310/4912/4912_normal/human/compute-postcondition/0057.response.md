The value of `one` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `one` is not specified, but it will increase by 1 regardless of its initial value. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a string that consists of uppercase English letters, has a length between 9 and 50, and ends with the substring 'FESTIVAL'; `n` is greater than 1; `res` is a list of lists containing values of `one` that were recorded when the conditions were met; `temp` is an empty list if the last condition was met or the last recorded state before it was reset; `tar` is either 0 or 1 indicating whether the last processed substring matched '101'; `one` is increased by 1; the last character of `S` is '1'.
