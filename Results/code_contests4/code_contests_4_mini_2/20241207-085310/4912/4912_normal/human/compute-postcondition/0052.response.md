`one` is assigned the value `0`. The previous values of `tar`, `one`, `temp`, and `res` are not affected by this assignment, but we know that `tar` is 1 and `one` is updated to `0`. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a string that consists of uppercase English letters with a length between 9 and 50, ending with the substring 'FESTIVAL'; `n` is greater than 3; `i` is 3; `tar` is 1; `one` is 0; `temp` is an empty list; `res` is an empty list.
