Postcondition: ***`S` is a string that consists of uppercase English letters with a length between 9 and 50, ending with the substring 'FESTIVAL'; `n` is greater than 2; `i` is 2. If the substring `S[1:3]` equals '101', then `tar` is set to 1 and `one` is set to 0. Otherwise, if `S[i]` is '1', `one` is increased by 1 and `res` is updated to include a copy of `temp`. If `S[i]` is '0', `tar` is set to 0; if `S[i]` is not '0', `tar` remains 1, and `res` is updated to include a copy of `temp`, while the state of `one` remains unchanged.***
