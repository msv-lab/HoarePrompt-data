Postcondition: ***`S` is a string that consists of uppercase English letters with a length between 9 and 50, ending with the substring 'FESTIVAL'; `n` is greater than 3; `i` is 3. If the substring from `S` at indices 2 to 4 (inclusive) is '101', then `tar` is set to 1, `one` is set to 0, and `temp` includes 0. Otherwise, if `S[i]` is '1', `one` is increased by 1 and `tar` is 1, while `temp` and `res` remain as empty lists. If `S[i]` is not '1', then `tar` is 1, `one` is set to 0, and `temp` and `res` remain as empty lists.***
