The variable `temp` is assigned an empty list `[]`. Previous states indicate that `temp` currently has `one` appended to it, which suggests that it was not empty before this assignment. However, after executing the code, `temp` will now be an empty list, effectively overriding any previous value. The other variables (`S`, `n`, `i`, `res`) remain unaffected.

Output State: **`S` is a string that consists of uppercase English letters, has a length between 9 and 50, and ends with the substring 'FESTIVAL'; `n` must be greater than 2; `i` is 2; `temp` is an empty list; `res` now has a copy of `temp` appended to it.**
