The code appends a copy of the `temp` list to the `res` list. The previous values of the affected variables are `temp`, which includes `one`, and `res`, which is a list. The other variables (`S`, `n`, `i`, `tar`, and `one`) are not directly affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a string that consists of uppercase English letters with a length between 9 and 50, ending with the substring 'FESTIVAL'; `n` is greater than 3; `i` is 3; `tar` is determined by `S[i]`; `one` is updated based on `S[i]`; `temp` now includes `one`; `res` is updated with a copy of `temp`.
