The variable `temp` is updated by appending the current value of `one` to it. The values of the other variables (`S`, `n`, `res`, `temp`, `tar`) are not affected. Since `temp` is an empty list if the last condition was met or holds the last recorded state otherwise, it will now contain the value of `one`. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated `temp`.

Output State: **`S` is a string that consists of uppercase English letters, has a length between 9 and 50, and ends with the substring 'FESTIVAL'; `n` is greater than 1; `res` is a list of lists containing values of `one` that were recorded when the conditions were met; `temp` now contains the value of `one`; `tar` is 1 indicating that the last processed substring matched '101'; if the last character of `S` is '1', then `one` is increased by 1.**
