The code `temp.append(one)` appends the value of `one` to the list `temp`. The value of `one` has already been updated based on `S[i]`, and `temp` is assumed to be a list that can accept new elements. The other variables (`S`, `n`, `i`, `tar`, and `res`) remain unaffected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a string that consists of uppercase English letters with a length between 9 and 50, ending with the substring 'FESTIVAL'; `n` is greater than 3; `i` is 3; `tar` is 1; `one` is updated based on `S[i]`; `res` includes a copy of `temp` if applicable; `temp` now includes `one`.
