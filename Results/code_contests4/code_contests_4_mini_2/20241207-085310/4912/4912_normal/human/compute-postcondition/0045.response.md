The variable `one` is assigned the value `0`, which does not depend on any previous state of `one`. The variable `temp` is updated to include `one`, meaning `temp` will also reflect this new value of `one`. The other variables (`S`, `n`, `i`, `tar`, `res`) are not affected by this assignment.

Thus, the output state reflects the updated value of `one` and the inclusion of that value in `temp`. 

Output State: **`S` is a string that consists of uppercase English letters with a length between 9 and 50, ending with the substring 'FESTIVAL'; `n` is greater than 3; `i` is 3; `tar` is 1; `one` is 0; `temp` now includes 0.**
