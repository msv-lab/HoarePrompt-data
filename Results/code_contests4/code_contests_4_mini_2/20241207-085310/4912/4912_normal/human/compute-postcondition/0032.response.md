The variable `one` is assigned the value `0`. This does not affect any other variables since `one` was previously appended to `temp`, but `temp` is not mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects the new assignment of `one`.

Output State: **`S` is a string that consists of uppercase English letters, has a length between 9 and 50, and ends with the substring 'FESTIVAL'; `n` must be greater than 2; `i` is 2; `tar` is 1; `one` is 0.**
