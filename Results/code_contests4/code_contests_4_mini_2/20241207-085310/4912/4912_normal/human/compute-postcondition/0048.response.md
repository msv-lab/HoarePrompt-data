The variable `temp` is assigned an empty list. This action does not affect any of the other variables, which retain their previous values. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a string that consists of uppercase English letters with a length between 9 and 50, ending with the substring 'FESTIVAL'; `n` is greater than 3; `i` is 3; `tar` is determined by `S[i]`; `one` is updated based on `S[i]`; `temp` is now an empty list; `res` is updated with a copy of `temp` (which is also an empty list at this point).
