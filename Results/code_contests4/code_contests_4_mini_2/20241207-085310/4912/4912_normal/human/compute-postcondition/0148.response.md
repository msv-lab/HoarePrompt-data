Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer input `n` and a string `s` that consists of uppercase English letters, has a length between 9 and 50, and ends with the substring 'FESTIVAL'. It processes the string to count certain sequences of '1's and '0's, specifically looking for patterns of '101' and tracking consecutive '1's. Finally, it calculates a total based on the maximum values derived from these sequences and prints this count. The function does not return any value but outputs the calculated count directly. **
