The line of code initializes an empty list `temp`, which does not affect any of the other variables (`S`, `n`, `s`, `one`, `res`, `count`). Therefore, the output state remains unchanged aside from the new variable `temp`.

Output State: **`S` is a string that consists of uppercase English letters, has a length between 9 and 50, and ends with the substring 'FESTIVAL'; `n` is an input integer; `s` is a new input string; `one` is either 0 or 1; `res` is an empty list; `count` is 0; `temp` is an empty list.**
