The value of `temp` is assigned 0. The previous value of `temp` was determined by the maximum of `f[-1][0]`, `f[-1][1]`, and `f[-2][0]`, but after this assignment, `temp` is now explicitly 0. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters ending with 'FESTIVAL'; `n` is greater than 1; `tar` is 1; `res` contains at least 3 entries; `m` is greater than 5; `temp` is 0; `i` is at least 4; `count` is increased by `temp`.
