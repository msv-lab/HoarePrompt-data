The code `temp.append(one)` adds the variable `one` to the list `temp`. However, the initial state does not provide information about `temp` or `one`. Since the values of `temp` and `one` remain unaffected and are not defined in the initial state, the output state will reflect that the operation of appending to the list `temp` is executed, but we cannot determine the specific contents of `temp` or the value of `one`.

Output State: **`S` is a string that consists of uppercase English letters, has a length between 9 and 50, ends with the substring 'FESTIVAL', `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, the substring of `S` from index `i - 1` to `i + 2` is not equal to '101', the character at index `i` of `S` is '0', `tar` is equal to 1, and `one` is appended to `temp`.**
