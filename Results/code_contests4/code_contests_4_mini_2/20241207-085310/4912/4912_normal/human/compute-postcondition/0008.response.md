Postcondition: ***`S` is a string that consists of uppercase English letters, has a length between 9 and 50, and ends with the substring 'FESTIVAL'; `n` is an input integer; `s` is a new input string. If the first character of `s` is '1', then `one` is set to 1. Otherwise, `one` is set to 0. The list `res` remains empty, and `count` is 0 in both cases.***
