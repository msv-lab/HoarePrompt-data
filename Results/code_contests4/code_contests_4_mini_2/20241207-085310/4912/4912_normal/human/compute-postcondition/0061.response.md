The code `res.append(temp.copy())` appends a copy of the list `temp` to the list `res`. The previous state of `res` is a list of lists containing values of `one` that were recorded when certain conditions were met. The variable `temp` contains the value of `one`. The other variables are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the updated `res`.

Output State: **`S` is a string that consists of uppercase English letters, has a length between 9 and 50, and ends with the substring 'FESTIVAL'; `n` is greater than 1; `res` is updated with a new entry; `temp` now contains the value of `one`; `tar` is 1 indicating that the last processed substring matched '101'.**
