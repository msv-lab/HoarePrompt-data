The code `temp.append(one)` appends the value of `one` to the list `temp`. The previous values of the affected variables are not specified, but we know that `one` has been updated based on the value of `S[i]`, where `i` is 3. The value of `one` will be the character from the string `S` at index 3. Since `temp` is being modified by appending `one`, the state of `temp` will change, but the states of other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`S` is a string that consists of uppercase English letters with a length between 9 and 50, ending with the substring 'FESTIVAL'; `n` is greater than 3; `i` is 3; `tar` is determined by `S[i]`; `one` is updated based on `S[i]`; `temp` now includes `one`.**
