The value of `m` is assigned the length of `x`. However, `x` is not defined in the initial state, so its value is unknown. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `S` is a string that consists of uppercase English letters, has a length between 9 and 50, and ends with the substring 'FESTIVAL'; `n` is greater than 1; `tar` is 1; `res` contains at least 1 entry; `temp` is now 0; `m` is the length of an undefined variable `x`.
