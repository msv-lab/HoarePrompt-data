The code `one = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `one`. The other variables (`S`, `n`, `i`, `tar`, `temp`, `res`) remain unchanged as this assignment does not affect them. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a string that consists of uppercase English letters, has a length between 9 and 50, and ends with the substring 'FESTIVAL'; `n` is greater than 2; `i` is 2; `tar` is 1; `temp` is an empty list; and `res` is updated to include a copy of `temp`.
