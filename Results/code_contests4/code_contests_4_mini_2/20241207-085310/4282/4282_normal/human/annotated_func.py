#State of the program right berfore the function call: c is a list of strings representing the #define constructions and an expression to check, where the first string is a non-negative integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 100) indicating the number of #define constructions, followed by n strings of the format "#define name expression", and a final string representing the expression to evaluate; each expression must be a valid arithmetic expression consisting of digits, variable names, previously declared macro names, round brackets, and operators (+, -, *, /).
def func_1(c):

    #The program returns the string 'macro("' followed by the list of strings c representing the #define constructions and the expression to evaluate, enclosed in parentheses.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of strings `c`, which includes a non-negative integer indicating the number of #define constructions, followed by the #define strings and a final expression to evaluate. It returns a string formatted as 'macro("' followed by the entire list `c` enclosed in parentheses. The function does not validate the contents of `c` or check for correctness of the expressions, and simply returns the input as part of the output string.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string representing a sequence of #define constructions followed by an expression, where the number of constructions n is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ n ≤ 100), and each construction adheres to the format "#define name expression", with the name being a case-sensitive string and expression being a valid arithmetic expression containing digits, variable names, previously declared macros, round brackets, and operational signs (+, -, *, /).

    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`f` is a list containing the results of processed characters as strings. If `n` is not an empty string, then `f[0]` is updated by appending the result of `func_1(v.get(n, '1'))` to it.
    return eval(f[0]).level
    #The program returns the 'level' attribute of the evaluated result contained in f[0] after processing the characters.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` representing a sequence of `#define` constructions followed by an arithmetic expression. It processes this string to evaluate the expression while considering previously defined macros. Finally, it returns the 'level' attribute of the evaluated result from the expression. If the input does not contain valid macros or expressions, it may return unexpected results or errors, depending on the implementation of `func_1` and the evaluation of the constructed expression.
