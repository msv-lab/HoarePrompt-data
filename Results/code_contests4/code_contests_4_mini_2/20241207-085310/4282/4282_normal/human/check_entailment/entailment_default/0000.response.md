To assess the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we will analyze the main functions and their output descriptions while looking for any potential edge cases that might not be handled properly.

### Problem Description:
The task is to identify if a given expression, after macro substitution, is "suspicious" or "OK". The substitution can change the order of operations if not handled properly, particularly when macros are defined without surrounding brackets.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(c)`**:
   - This function takes a list of strings and simply formats it into a string with the prefix `macro("`.
   - It doesnâ€™t validate the contents or check for correctness, thus not contributing to the logic of the macro evaluation.

2. **Function `func_2(s)`**:
   - This function processes the input strings to evaluate expressions considering previously defined macros.
   - The logic attempts to build a new expression based on the macros and checks their "level" which seems to indicate the safety of the expression.

3. **Class `macro`**:
   - This class appears to implement operations that dictate how levels of expressions change during arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
   - The `level` attribute plays a crucial role in determining whether the expression is correctly handled or not.

### Output Descriptions Analysis:
- **Output for `func_1`**: The output description states that it does not validate the input; it simply returns formatted strings.
- **Output for `func_2`**: The function evaluates the constructed expression but does not explicitly handle all potential edge cases that could lead to a "suspicious" result.

### Edge Cases and Issues:
1. The function does not seem to handle cases where macros are defined in a way that their usage can lead to ambiguity or incorrect order of operations. For example:
   - If a macro is defined without parentheses, such as `#define sum x + y` and used in a multiplication context like `2 * sum`, it could lead to confusion on operation precedence.
   
2. The output hints do not address how nested or complex macro definitions are resolved. If a macro has another macro as part of its definition but lacks proper brackets, such cases may result in unexpected behavior.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the program does not cover all potential cases as required by the problem description. There are scenarios where the order of operations can change in confusing ways due to the lack of proper handling for nested or complex macro definitions. 

Thus, based on the analysis, I conclude that the program does not meet the specifications for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**. 

### Explanation of Incorrectness:
The program fails to handle cases where the macros can lead to ambiguous or suspicious expressions, particularly when macros are defined without surrounding brackets. For example, a definition like `#define sum x + y` used in `2 * sum` results in `2 * x + y`, which changes the intended order of operations.
