Correctness: **False**

The provided annotated program does not adhere to the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Functionality Mismatch**: The `func_1` function is intended to return a string representation of the macro constructions, but it does not perform any actual macro substitution. The problem description requires the program to execute substitutions of macros in an arithmetic expression, which is not fulfilled by `func_1`.

2. **Inadequate Processing**: The `func_2` function attempts to process the input expression but does so incorrectly. It concatenates characters and uses `eval` on a string that is not constructed properly for arithmetic evaluation. The handling of macro names and their corresponding expressions is flawed and does not ensure safe or ordinary substitution as required.

3. **Evaluation Logic**: The use of `eval` is risky and does not guarantee that the order of operations is retained correctly after substitution. The problem description emphasizes the need to maintain the correct order of operations and check for "suspicious" expressions, which this program does not adequately address.

4. **Missing Output Conditions**: The expected output should be "OK" or "Suspicious" based on the evaluation of the final expression. The program does not implement this logic; instead, it tries to return an undefined 'level' attribute, which does not correspond to any expected output stated in the problem description.

5. **Variable Handling**: The program does not define or use a proper mechanism to track previously defined macros and their values correctly. The current implementation lacks a clear mapping of macro names to their respective expressions and does not account for nested macros effectively.

In summary, the program fails to perform the necessary macro substitutions correctly, does not maintain the correct arithmetic expression structure, and lacks the required output format, rendering it incorrect according to the problem description.
