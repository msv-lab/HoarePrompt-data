Postcondition: ***`f` is a list that contains either two empty strings if `c` is '(', and `n` is not an empty string, or the result of `func_1('10')` if `c` is equal to ')' when `n` is an empty string. If `c` is one of the characters '+', '-', '*', or '/' (and not equal to ')'), then `f` retains the character `c` as its last element, while `s` contains at least one non-empty string, and if `n` is not an empty string, no changes are made to `f` in the first case.***
