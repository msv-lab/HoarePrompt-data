Postcondition: ***`f` is a list containing an empty string, `s` is a list containing at least one non-empty string, `c` is one of the characters '+', '-', '*', '/', or '(', and `c` is equal to ')'. If `n` is not an empty string, `f[-1]` is updated by adding the result of `func_1(v.get('', '1'))` to the last element of `f`. If `n` is an empty string, no changes are made to `f`.***
