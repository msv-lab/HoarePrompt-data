According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `s`, which contains at least one non-empty string. The loop iterates over each character `c` in the joined string of `s`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `f` is either a list containing two empty strings (if `c` was '(') or the result of `func_1('10')` (if `c` was ')'), or `f` is [''] with `s` containing at least one non-empty string and `c` is not one of the characters '+', '-', '*', '/', '('. The variable `n` was incremented by `c`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must still contain at least one non-empty string, and `c` must be the next character in the joined string. The next character `c` will be chosen from the remaining characters in the joined string of `s`.

State: **`f` is [''], `s` contains at least one non-empty string, `c` is the next character of the joined string, and `n` is incremented by `c`.**
