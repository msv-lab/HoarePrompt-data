The value of `n` is incremented by `c`. The value of `c` is the next character of the joined string, which is not specified but assumed to be a character that can be converted to an integer (e.g., if `c` is '1', it would be incremented by 1). The previous value of `n` is unknown, but it is stated that it has been incremented by `c`. The states of `f` and `s` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `f` is [''], `s` contains at least one non-empty string, `c` is the next character of the joined string, and `n` is incremented by `c`.

Output State: **`f` is [''], `s` contains at least one non-empty string, `c` is the next character of the joined string, and `n` is incremented by `c.**
