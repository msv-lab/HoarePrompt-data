To analyze the given code snippet, let's break it down step by step:

1. The variable `f` is a list containing an empty string, so initially, `f` is `['']`.
2. The variable `m` is the result of calling `func_1('10')`. Since we don't have the definition of `func_1`, we cannot determine the exact value of `m`, but we will refer to it as its result.
3. The code `f[-1] += m` appends the value of `m` to the last element of the list `f`. Given that the last element of `f` is an empty string (as it contains only an empty string initially), this operation will effectively set `f[-1]` to `m`.

Thus, after executing the code, the value of `f[-1]` will be `m`, while the rest of the list and variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `f` now contains the string `m` as its last element.

Output State: **`f` is a list containing `m`; `s` is a list containing at least one non-empty string; `c` is equal to ')'; `m` is the result of `func_1('10')**.
