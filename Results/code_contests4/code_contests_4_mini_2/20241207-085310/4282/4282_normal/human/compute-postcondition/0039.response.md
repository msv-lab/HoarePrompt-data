Given the initial state, let's analyze the provided code snippet:

1. The list `f` is already defined and has at least one element.
2. The variable `n` is checked to determine if it is an empty string or not. 
   - If `n` is not an empty string, `f` remains unchanged.
   - If `n` is an empty string, `c` is set to the next character of the joined string derived from `s`, and the last element of `f` is updated by adding the result of `func_1(v.get('', '1'))`.
3. The code `f[-1] += c` indicates that the last element of `f` is modified by appending the character `c` to it.

Since the specific conditions for the values of `n`, `c`, and the result of the function `func_1(v.get('', '1'))` are not provided in the initial state, we cannot state specific outputs for those variables. However, we note that `f[-1]` is updated regardless of the state of `n` if it is empty.

Thus the output state can be summarized as follows, considering the last element of `f` is updated:

Output State: **`f` is updated; last element of `f` is modified by adding `c`.**
