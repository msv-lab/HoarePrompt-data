The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a string representing a sequence of `#define` constructions followed by an expression, where the number of constructions `n` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ n ≤ 100). Each construction adheres to the format `#define name expression`, with `name` being a case-sensitive string and `expression` being a valid arithmetic expression. After processing the characters in `s`, the function returns the 'level' attribute of the evaluated result contained in `f[0]`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a string `s` that contains `#define` constructions and an expression, and return the 'level' attribute of the evaluated result. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a string s representing #define constructions and an expression, and returns the 'level' attribute of the evaluated result contained in f[0].**
