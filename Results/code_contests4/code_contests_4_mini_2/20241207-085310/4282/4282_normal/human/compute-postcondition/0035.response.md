Postcondition: ***`f` is an updated list based on the value of `c` and `s` contains at least one non-empty string. If `n` is not an empty string, then `f` remains unchanged. If `n` is an empty string, `c` is the next character of the joined string, and the last element of `f` is updated by adding the result of `func_1(v.get('', '1'))`.***
