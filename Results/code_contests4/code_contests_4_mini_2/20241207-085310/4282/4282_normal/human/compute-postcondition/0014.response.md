The variable `f` is a list containing an empty string, which means `f[-1]` is currently an empty string. The variable `c` is one of the characters '+', '-', '*', '/', or '(', meaning it has a specific value that will be added to `f[-1]`. The variable `n` is not an empty string, indicating that the condition for updating `f[-1]` is satisfied.

Since the code `f[-1] += c` is executed, the last element of `f`, which is currently an empty string, will have the character `c` appended to it. Therefore, `f[-1]` will now contain the value of `c`.

The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Thus, the output state will reflect the updated value of `f[-1]`.

Output State: **`f` is a list containing the character `c`, `s` is a list containing at least one non-empty string, `c` is one of the characters '+', '-', '*', '/', or '(', and `n` is not an empty string.**
