Postcondition: ***`f` is an updated list based on the value of `c`. If `c` is '(', `n` is incremented and an empty string is appended to `f`. If `c` is ')', `n` is incremented, and `m` is assigned a value based on the evaluated last element of `f`, which is then updated. If `c` is neither '(' nor ')', `c` is appended to `f`, `s` contains at least one non-empty string, and if `n` is not an empty string, `n` is incremented and then assigned an empty string. In the else case, `f` remains as [''], `s` contains at least one non-empty string, `c` is the next character of the joined string, and `n` is incremented by `c`.***
