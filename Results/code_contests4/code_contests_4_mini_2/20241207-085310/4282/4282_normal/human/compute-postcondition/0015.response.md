Postcondition: ***`f` is a list that contains either the result of `func_1('10')` if `c` is equal to ')' or the character `c` if `c` is one of the characters '+', '-', '*', '/', or '('. The list `s` contains at least one non-empty string, and if `n` is not an empty string, it implies that no changes are made to `f` in the first case, while in the second case `f` retains the character `c` as its last element.***
