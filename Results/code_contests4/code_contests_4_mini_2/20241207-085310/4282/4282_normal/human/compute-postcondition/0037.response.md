To analyze the given code snippet, we need to determine the effects of the code on the variables based on the initial state.

1. The initial state indicates that `f` is an updated list and that `n` is either an empty string or not. The behavior of the code snippet will depend on the value of `n`:
   - If `n` is not an empty string, `f` remains unchanged, and we cannot determine the value of `m`.
   - If `n` is an empty string, it implies that `c` will be assigned the next character of the joined string, and the last element of `f` will be updated by adding the result of `func_1(v.get('', '1'))`.

2. The code snippet `m = func_1('10'[eval(f.pop()).level == '0'])` suggests that:
   - `f.pop()` will remove and return the last element of `f`.
   - The expression `eval(f.pop()).level == '0'` will evaluate to either `True` or `False`.
   - If it evaluates to `True`, `m` will be assigned `func_1('10')`, and if `False`, `m` will be assigned `func_1('')`.

3. The impact on the output state will depend on the value of `eval(f.pop()).level`:
   - If `level` is `'0'`, then `m` will be the result of `func_1('10')`.
   - If `level` is not `'0'`, then `m` will be the result of `func_1('')`.

Since we do not have specific values for `f`, `n`, or the behavior of `func_1`, we cannot provide exact values for the output state. We can only determine the behavior based on the conditions.

Thus, the output state will reflect that `m` is assigned based on the evaluation of `f` and the result of `func_1`:

Output State: **`f` is an updated list based on the value of `c`, `n` is an empty string; `m` is assigned based on the evaluation of the last element of `f` and the result of `func_1` according to the level condition.**
