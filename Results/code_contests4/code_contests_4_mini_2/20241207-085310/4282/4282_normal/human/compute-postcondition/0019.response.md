Postcondition: ***`f` is a list containing either two empty strings if `c` is '(', or the result of `func_1('10')` if `c` is ')', when `n` is an empty string. If `c` is one of the characters '+', '-', '*', or '/', then `f` retains the character `c` as its last element while `s` contains at least one non-empty string, and if `n` is not an empty string, no changes are made to `f`. Otherwise, `f` is [''], `s` is a list containing at least one non-empty string, `c` is the first character of the joined string, and `c` is not one of the characters '+', '-', '*', '/', '('. The variable `n` is incremented by `c`.***
