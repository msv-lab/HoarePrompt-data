Postcondition: ***`f` is an updated list with the last element modified. If `c` is equal to '(', `n` is incremented by `c`, which is then assigned an empty string, and an empty string is appended to the list `f`. Otherwise, if `c` is equal to ')', then `n` is incremented by `c`, `m` is assigned the result of `func_1('10'[eval(f.pop()).level == '0'])`, and the last element of `f` is updated by appending `m`. If `c` is neither '(' nor ')', `f` is modified by appending `c`, `s` contains at least one non-empty string, and if `n` is not an empty string, then `n` is incremented by `c` and subsequently assigned an empty string.***
