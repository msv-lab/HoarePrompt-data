Postcondition: ***`f` is an updated list based on the value of `c` and `s` contains at least one non-empty string. If `c` is equal to '(', an empty string is appended to `f`, and if `n` is an empty string, the last element of `f` is updated by adding the result of `func_1(v.get('', '1'))`. If `c` is equal to ')', and `n` is an empty string, the last element of `f` is increased by `m`, where `m` is assigned based on the evaluation of the last element of `f` and the result of `func_1`. If `n` is not an empty string, `f` remains unchanged. If `c` is not equal to ')', the last element of `f` is modified by adding `c`. If `c` is not one of the specified operators, `f` is updated based on the value of `c`, `n` is incremented by the value of `c`, and `c` is the next character of the joined string; `s` contains at least one non-empty string.***
