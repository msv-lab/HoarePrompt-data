Postcondition: ***`f` is an updated list based on the value of `c` and `s` contains at least one non-empty string. If `c` is equal to `')'`, and `n` is an empty string, the last element of `f` is increased by `m`, where `m` is assigned based on the evaluation of the last element of `f` and the result of `func_1`. If `n` is not an empty string, `f` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `c` is not equal to `')'`, the last element of `f` is modified by adding `c`.***
