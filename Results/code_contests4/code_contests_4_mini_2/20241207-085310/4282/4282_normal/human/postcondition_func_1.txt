The function accepts a string `s` representing a sequence of `#define` constructions followed by an arithmetic expression. It processes this string to evaluate the expression while considering previously defined macros. Finally, it returns the 'level' attribute of the evaluated result from the expression. If the input does not contain valid macros or expressions, it may return unexpected results or errors, depending on the implementation of `func_1` and the evaluation of the constructed expression.
