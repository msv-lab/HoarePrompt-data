c is a list of strings representing the #define constructions and an expression to check, where the first string is a non-negative integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 100) indicating the number of #define constructions, followed by n strings of the format "#define name expression", and a final string representing the expression to evaluate; each expression must be a valid arithmetic expression consisting of digits, variable names, previously declared macro names, round brackets, and operators (+, -, *, /).
