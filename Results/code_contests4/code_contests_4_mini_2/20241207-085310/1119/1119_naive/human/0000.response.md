To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the potential edge cases.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input Parameters**:
   - `n`: Size of the field (n x n).
   - `m`: Number of banned cells.
   - Next `m` lines provide the coordinates of banned cells.

2. **Rules**:
   - Chips can only be placed on border cells (but not corners).
   - Gerald loses if:
     - A chip lands on a banned cell.
     - Two chips land on the same cell.
     - Two chips swap positions.

3. **Output**:
   - The maximum points Gerald can earn, which is the number of chips successfully placed without violating any rules.

### Code Analysis:
- The program initializes:
  - `ban`: List of banned cells.
  - `r`, `c`: Arrays to keep track of row and column availability for placing chips.
  - `ans`: Counter for the maximum points.

- For each banned cell `(x, y)`, it marks the corresponding row `r[x]` and column `c[y]` as unavailable.

- The program then iterates through potential placements on the border cells:
  - It checks the sum of available rows and columns to determine possible placements without conflicts.
  
- Finally, it checks if the center cell (in case of odd `n`) is available and increments the score if it is.

### Edge Cases:
1. **No Banned Cells** (`n=3`, `m=0`): The program should allow placing one chip in any of the available edge cells, which it does correctly.
2. **All Edge Cells Banned**: If every border cell except corners is banned, the output should be `0`.
3. **Single Banding on Edges**: If only one edge cell is banned, the program should correctly identify the maximum placement in the remaining border cells.

### Potential Issue:
- The code does not seem to correctly handle the case when `n` is even, particularly in counting available cells. The logic for incrementing `ans` based on the banned cells may lead to incorrect counts, especially if banned cells are positioned in crucial locations that affect both rows and columns.

### Example Case:
Consider the case when:
```
Input:
4 2
1 2
2 2
```
In this case,:
- The banned cells are on the edge, which will impact the possible placements.
- The program may incorrectly count the available moves due to overlapping logic when counting rows and columns.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the code and potential edge cases, it appears that the current implementation may not handle all edge cases accurately, particularly when multiple banned cells are on or near the border affecting both rows and columns.

Correctness: **False**.
