The function accepts an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) and a non-negative integer `m` (0 ≤ m ≤ 100) representing the number of banned cells in a grid. It reads the coordinates of these banned cells and calculates a value `ans` based on the number of unbanned rows and columns. The function returns the computed value `ans`, which counts how many valid cells remain unblocked by the banned cells, with an additional count if `n` is odd and the middle cell is unbanned.
