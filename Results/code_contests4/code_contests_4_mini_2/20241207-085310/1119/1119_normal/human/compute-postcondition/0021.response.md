The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it operates under the constraints that `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, and `m` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ 100. Additionally, for each of the `m` banned cells, the coordinates (xi, yi) are integers satisfying 1 ≤ xi, yi ≤ n, with all banned cells being distinct. 

The output of the function is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine the exact return value. 

Therefore, based on the information given, the functionality of the function is to accept the constraints related to `n`, `m`, and the banned cell coordinates, but without knowing the output, we cannot provide a definitive functionality statement.

Functionality: **The function accepts constraints on n and m and their related values, but the return value is not specified.**
