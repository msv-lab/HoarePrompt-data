According to the code, the for loop iterates over a range starting from 2 up to `2 + (n - 2) // 2`. For the loop to execute at least once, the ending value of the range must be greater than the starting value (2). 

The condition for the loop to execute at least once can be derived from:

1. The range starts at 2.
2. The expression `2 + (n - 2) // 2` must be greater than 2, which implies that `(n - 2) // 2` must be at least 1. 

Thus, we derive that:
- `n - 2` must be at least 2, leading to `n` being at least 4. 

Since `n` is already constrained to be between 2 and 1000, for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be adjusted to be at least 4.

Additionally, the loop variable `i` will be initialized to 2 at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` is at least 4, `ans` is 0, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute the first time.**
