The values of `n` and `m` are assigned from the output of the `rints()` lambda function, which reads and returns a list of integers from input. The previous values of `n` and `m` are not specified, but they will now hold the values read from the input, which must satisfy the conditions 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000 and 0 ≤ m ≤ 100. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `m` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ 100.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `m` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ 100**
