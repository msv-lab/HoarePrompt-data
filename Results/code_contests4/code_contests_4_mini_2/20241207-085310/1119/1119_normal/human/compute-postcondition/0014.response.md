According to the code, the loop executes based on the range defined by `range(2, 2 + (n - 2) // 2)`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `2 + (n - 2) // 2`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `n` is at least 4, so we can calculate the upper limit for `i`. 

1. If `n` is 4, then `(n - 2) // 2` equals 1, making the range `range(2, 3)`, which means `i` could be 2.
2. If `n` is greater than 4, `(n - 2) // 2` increases accordingly, allowing `i` to take on more values.

Now, we need to find the current value of `i`. Let's denote the last value of `i` as `i_last`. For the loop to execute again, `i_last` must be less than `2 + (n - 2) // 2`.

Assuming the previous value of `i` was `i_last`, the next value for `i` will be `i_last + 1`.

So for the loop to execute one more time:
- If `i_last` is currently 2, the next value will be 3, and for the loop to execute again, we need `n` to be at least 6 (because `(n - 2) // 2` would then be 2, making the range `range(2, 4)`).
- If `i_last` is currently 3, then `i` would be 4, and the condition for executing again would require `n` to be at least 6.

Thus, we conclude that `n` must be at least 6 for `i` to be 4, which is the next integer.

State: **`n` is at least 4; `ans` is updated to `ans + sum([r[3], r[n - 3 + 1], c[3], c[n - 3 + 1]]) for the loop to execute a second time, `i` is 3, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 6.**
