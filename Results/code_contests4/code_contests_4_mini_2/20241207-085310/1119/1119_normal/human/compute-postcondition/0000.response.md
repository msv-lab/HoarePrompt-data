The code snippet defines a lambda function `rints`, which reads a line from standard input (stdin), splits it into components, and converts each component into an integer, returning a list of those integers. The state of the variables `n` and `m` is not changed by this line, as it only defines a function but does not execute it. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the newly defined function.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `m` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ 100, and `rints` is a lambda function that reads and returns a list of integers from input.**
