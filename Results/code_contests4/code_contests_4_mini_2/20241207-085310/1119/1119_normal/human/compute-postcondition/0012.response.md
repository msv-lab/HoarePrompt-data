According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the calculation of the range. The loop starts at `i = 2` and goes until `i < 2 + (n - 2) // 2`. Given that `n` is at least 4, we can calculate the upper limit of the range:

- When `n = 4`, the upper limit is `2 + (4 - 2) // 2 = 3`.
- When `n = 5`, the upper limit is `2 + (5 - 2) // 2 = 3.5`, meaning it will still be 3 for integer values.
- When `n = 6`, the upper limit is `2 + (6 - 2) // 2 = 4`.
  
Thus, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `2 + (n - 2) // 2`. Currently, `i` is 2, and in the next iteration, `i` will be increased by 1.

So, for the loop to execute a third time, `i` will be 3, and since `n` is at least 4, `(n - 2) // 2` is at least 1, meaning the upper limit remains valid.

State: **`n` is at least 4, `ans` is updated to `0 + sum([r[2], r[n - 1], c[2], c[n - 1]])`, `i` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be at least 4**
