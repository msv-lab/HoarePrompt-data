The code writes the value of `li[i]` to the standard output. The variable `i` is 1, so we access the second element of the list `li`. The output state does not modify any variables, but it will produce output based on the value of `li[1]`.

Given that `li` has at least 3 elements, we can confidently say that the output will consist of the second element of `li`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6; `x` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `xi` satisfies 2 ≤ `xi` ≤ 10^7; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 50000; `li` is a list with at least 3 elements; `i` is 1; and the output is `li[1]`.**
