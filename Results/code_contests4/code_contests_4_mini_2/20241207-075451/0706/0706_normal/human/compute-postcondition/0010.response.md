The code writes the last element of `li` to standard output. The previous values of the variables do not change as the `stdout.write` function is used only for output purposes. The variable `li` contains at least 2 elements, and since the code accesses `li[-1]`, it retrieves the last element of the list `li`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6; `x` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `xi` satisfies 2 ≤ `xi` ≤ 10^7; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 50000; `li` is a list with at least 2 elements; `i` is equal to `len(li) - 2`; the output consists of all elements of `li` except the last one, and the last element of `li` has been written to standard output.**
