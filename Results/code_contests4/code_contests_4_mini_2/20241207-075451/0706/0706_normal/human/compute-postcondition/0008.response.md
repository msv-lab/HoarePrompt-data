The code writes the value of `li[i]` to the standard output. The variable `i` has a value of 2, and since `li` is a list with at least 3 elements, `li[2]` can be accessed safely. The output state does not change the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6; `x` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `xi` satisfies 2 ≤ `xi` ≤ 10^7; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 50000; `li` is a list with at least 3 elements; `i` is 2; and the output is `li[2]`.**
