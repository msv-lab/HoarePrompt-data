The function accepts no parameters and returns a map object containing long integers read from the standard input, split by spaces. The integers are intended to represent a series of queries characterized by two integers, but the function does not enforce or validate the bounds of these integers (li and ri) or the conditions set in the initial state, as it solely relies on the input format. Therefore, the function's behavior depends entirely on the input provided.
