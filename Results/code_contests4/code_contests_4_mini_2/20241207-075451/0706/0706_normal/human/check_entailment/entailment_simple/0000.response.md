Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not implement the functionality required by the problem description. Here are the main reasons why it fails to meet the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program does not establish a clear method for reading and processing the input of the sequence of integers and the queries. While `func_1()` intends to read integers, it lacks the context to handle both the sequence of numbers and the queries properly.

2. **Query Processing**: There is no implementation that addresses the processing of the queries as specified in the problem description. The program lacks the logic to calculate the number of integers in the sequence that are divisible by each prime number within the specified range `[li, ri]` for each query.

3. **Prime Number Generation**: The problem description requires identifying prime numbers in the range `[li, ri]`. However, the provided functions do not contain any logic for generating or checking prime numbers.

4. **Output Generation**: The program does not provide a mechanism to generate the output for the calculated sums for each query, which is essential according to the problem description.

Overall, since the program does not implement any of the core functionalities needed to solve the problem (input processing, prime number identification, and query response calculation), it does not fulfill the requirements laid out in the problem description. Thus, the correctness evaluation is **False**.
