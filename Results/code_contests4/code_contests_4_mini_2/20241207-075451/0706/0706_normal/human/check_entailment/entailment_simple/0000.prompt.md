You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Recently, the bear started studying data structures and faced the following problem.

You are given a sequence of integers x1, x2, ..., xn of length n and m queries, each of them is characterized by two integers li, ri. Let's introduce f(p) to represent the number of such indexes k, that xk is divisible by p. The answer to the query li, ri is the sum: <image>, where S(li, ri) is a set of prime numbers from segment [li, ri] (both borders are included in the segment).

Help the bear cope with the problem.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 106). The second line contains n integers x1, x2, ..., xn (2 ≤ xi ≤ 107). The numbers are not necessarily distinct.

The third line contains integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 50000). Each of the following m lines contains a pair of space-separated integers, li and ri (2 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·109) — the numbers that characterize the current query.

Output

Print m integers — the answers to the queries on the order the queries appear in the input.

Note

Consider the first sample. Overall, the first sample has 3 queries.

  1. The first query l = 2, r = 11 comes. You need to count f(2) + f(3) + f(5) + f(7) + f(11) = 2 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 0 = 9. 
  2. The second query comes l = 3, r = 12. You need to count f(3) + f(5) + f(7) + f(11) = 1 + 4 + 2 + 0 = 7. 
  3. The third query comes l = 4, r = 4. As this interval has no prime numbers, then the sum equals 0. 
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6), x is a list of n integers (2 ≤ xi ≤ 10^7), m is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 50000), and each query is characterized by two integers li and ri (2 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·10^9).
def func_1():
    return map(long, stdin.readline().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing long integers read from the standard input, split by spaces. The integers represent a series of queries characterized by two integers li and ri, which are bounded by the conditions given in the initial state.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6; the sequence of integers x is a list of n integers where each integer xi satisfies 2 ≤ xi ≤ 10^7; m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50000; each query is characterized by two integers li and ri such that 2 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·10^9.
def func_2(li):
    if (not li) :
        return
        #The program returns nothing, as no value or variable is specified in the return statement.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6; the sequence of integers `x` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `xi` satisfies 2 ≤ `xi` ≤ 10^7; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 50000; each query is characterized by two integers `li` and `ri` such that 2 ≤ `li` ≤ `ri` ≤ 2·10^9, and `li` is a truthy value (not zero or false)
    for i in xrange(len(li) - 1):
        stdout.write('%d ' % li[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6; `x` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `xi` satisfies 2 ≤ `xi` ≤ 10^7; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 50000; `li` is a list with at least 2 elements; `i` is equal to `len(li) - 2`; the output consists of all elements of `li` except the last one.
    stdout.write('%d\n' % li[-1])

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6; the sequence of integers x is a list of integers where each integer xi satisfies 2 ≤ xi ≤ 10^7; m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 50000; each query is represented by a pair of integers (li, ri) such that 2 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·10^9.
def func_3():
    return stdin.readline().rstrip()
    #The program returns a line of input read from standard input, stripped of any trailing whitespace


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
