To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the program and its logic in relation to the requirements outlined.

### Problem Breakdown:

1. **Inputs**: 
   - A positive integer `n` (â‰¤ 4000).
   - The program must handle multiple datasets (up to 50).

2. **Outputs**:
   - The number of combinations of non-negative integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` such that `a + b + c + d = n` and each of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` is in the range [0, 1000].

### Program Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes an array `ans` to store the number of combinations for each value of `n` from 0 to 4000.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - It reads lines from standard input until the end of the input, converting each line to an integer `n`.

3. **Combination Calculation**:
   - If `ans[n]` has not been computed yet, it initializes a count variable to zero.
   - The program then iterates over possible values of `a`, bounded by either `n` or 1000, whichever is smaller.
   - For each `a`, it determines the range of values for `b` and subsequently counts valid combinations.

4. **Output**:
   - After calculating the combinations for a given `n`, it prints the result.

### Correctness Check:

- **Range of Values**: The program ensures that all integers `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are within the range of 0 to 1000 by properly limiting the loop iterations.
  
- **Sum Calculation**: The logic ensures that the sum of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` equals `n` through the nested loops.

- **Handling of Multiple Datasets**: The program is designed to handle multiple datasets correctly and outputs the result for each dataset.

### However:

- The program contains potential issues with the logic used to count the combinations. Specifically:
  - The use of `xrange` suggests that this is a Python 2 program, which may not work in Python 3 without modification.
  - The inner loop conditions and the way `ran` is calculated may not correctly account for all combinations of `b`, `c`, and `d` that satisfy the constraints, particularly due to the checks involving `1001`.

### Conclusion:

Given the above analysis, there are logical flaws in how combinations are counted, particularly related to how ranges are defined and iterated over. This may lead to incorrect results for certain inputs, especially for values of `n` that approach the upper limits of the constraints.

Therefore, the program does not fully satisfy the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
