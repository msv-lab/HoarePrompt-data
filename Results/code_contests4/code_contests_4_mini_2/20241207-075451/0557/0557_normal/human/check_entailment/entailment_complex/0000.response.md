Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description for all cases. 

Here are the issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads from `stdin` but does not specify how to handle the end of input properly. It assumes that the input will continue until an EOF (end-of-file) without any explicit termination criteria. This can lead to issues when running in environments where input does not terminate as expected.

2. **Range of Values**: The problem specifies that `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` should be in the range of 0-1000. The nested loops in the code attempt to limit `a` to 1000 but do not correctly handle the ranges for `b`, `c`, and `d`. The logic for calculating the counts may not correctly consider the bounds for these integers, especially when `n` approaches the upper limit of 4000.

3. **Counting Combinations**: The counting logic using `xrange` and the calculation of `ran` seems overly complex and potentially incorrect. The logic for `ran` does not ensure that all combinations of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are counted correctly.

4. **Output Specification**: The specification asks for outputting the number of combinations for each dataset. However, the program does not provide a clear indication of how many combinations are possible when any of the values exceed their defined limits.

Due to these issues, the program may not yield the correct number of combinations for all valid input scenarios, particularly for values of `n` near the limits or for those that would require values of `b`, `c`, or `d` exceeding 1000. Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description comprehensively.
