The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(line)`, where `line` is read from standard input (stdin). Given that `n` is originally a positive integer less than or equal to 4000 and is reassigned to the integer value of `line`, the previous value of `n` will now be replaced by the new integer value from `line`. The states of the other variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are not affected as they remain within their original constraints. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the integer value from stdin; `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` remain non-negative integers such that `a + b + c + d = n`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value from stdin; `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` remain non-negative integers such that `a + b + c + d = n`**.
