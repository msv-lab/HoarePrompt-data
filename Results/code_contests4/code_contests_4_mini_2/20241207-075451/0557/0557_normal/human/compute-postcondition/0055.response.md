Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are non-negative integers with `a + b + c + d = n`. If `ans[n]` is not already set, then `count` is calculated based on the values of `ran` from `nab`, with `a` ranging from 0 to the minimum of `n` or 1000, and `e1` being either `n - 1001` or -1. After this, `ans[n]` is assigned the value of `count`.***
