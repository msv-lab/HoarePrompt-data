The function `func_1` accepts no parameters directly, but it operates on a set of constraints defined for the input variables `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer that must be less than or equal to 4000. The parameters `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are non-negative integers that must satisfy the condition that their sum equals `n`, with each of them constrained to the range of 0 to 1000. The function is designed to handle up to 50 datasets based on these parameters. 

The output of the function is not explicitly detailed in the provided information, but it is inferred that the function processes the datasets that adhere to the aforementioned constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts up to 50 datasets where each dataset contains a positive integer `n` (â‰¤ 4000) and four non-negative integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` such that `a + b + c + d = n` with each of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` in the range 0 to 1000. The function processes these datasets based on specified constraints.**
