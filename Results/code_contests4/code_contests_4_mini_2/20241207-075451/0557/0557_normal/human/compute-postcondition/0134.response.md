To analyze the execution of the provided code snippet, we start with the initial state:

Initial State: `e1` is either `n - a - 1001 >= 0`, so `n - a` is greater than or equal to 0, `nab` starts at `n - a`, `e1` is `n - a - 1001`.

1. The variable `nab` is assigned the value `n - a`.
2. The expression for `ran` is evaluated as follows:
   - If `nab < 1000`, then `ran` is assigned the value of `nab`.
   - If `nab >= 1000`, then `ran` is assigned `1000 - (nab - 1001)`, which simplifies to `1001 - nab` since we subtract `nab - 1001` from `1000`.
   - If `nab > 1000`, the else part of the conditional assigns `-1` to `ran`.

Since `e1` indicates that `n - a - 1001 >= 0`, this implies that `nab` (which is `n - a`) is at least `1001`. Therefore, in this case, `nab` must be greater than `1000`, and we are in the second condition of the ternary operator.

3. Thus, we calculate `ran` as:
   - `ran = (1001 - nab)`.

Now, `ran` is determined based on the value of `nab`, which is `n - a`.

The final output state reflects the relationships and values derived from the initial conditions and the evaluation of the expression.

Output State: **`e1` is either `n - a - 1001 >= 0`; `nab` is `n - a`; `ran` is `1001 - nab` (where `nab > 1000`)**.
