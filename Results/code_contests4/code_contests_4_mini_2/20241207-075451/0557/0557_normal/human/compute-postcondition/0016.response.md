According to the code, the loop iterates over a range defined by `n - a` to `e1`, decrementing `nab` each time. For the loop to execute one more time, `nab` must still be greater than `e1`. At the end of the last iteration, `nab` is at some value between `n - a` and `e1`. 

If `nab` is currently equal to `e1 + 1`, then in the next iteration, `nab` will be decremented to `e1`. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `n - a` must be greater than `e1`, indicating that `nab` is at least `e1 + 1` to allow the loop to proceed one more time.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, for the loop to execute one more time `n - a` must be greater than `e1`, and `nab` will be `e1 + 1`**
