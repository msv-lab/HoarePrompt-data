To analyze the impact of the code on the program:

1. The variable `ran` is assigned a new value based on the value of `nab`.
2. If `nab < 1000`, then `ran` is assigned the value of `nab - (-1)`, which simplifies to `nab + 1`.
3. If `nab >= 1000`, then `ran` is assigned the value of `nab - (nab - 1001)`, which simplifies to `1001`.
4. In both cases, `ran` is ensured to be greater than or equal to 0, following the constraints provided in the initial state.

Given that `ran` is calculated based on the conditions related to `nab`, the possible values of `ran` are:
- If `nab < 1000`, then `ran` is `nab + 1`.
- If `nab >= 1000`, then `ran` is `1001`.

The output state will reflect the calculated value of `ran` based on the conditions mentioned.

Output State: **`ran` is either `nab + 1` (if `nab < 1000`) or `1001` (if `nab >= 1000)`**
