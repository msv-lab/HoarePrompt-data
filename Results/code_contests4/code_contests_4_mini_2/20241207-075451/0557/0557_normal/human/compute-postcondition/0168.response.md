The execution of the code `exit()` does not change the values of any variables, but it terminates the program. Therefore, the output state is: `ans[n]` is equal to the total number of ways to partition `n` into four non-negative integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, with each in the range [0, 1000], and the program is terminated.
