The expression for `ran` is updated based on the value of `nab`. The previous states are:

1. `e1` (which is either `n - a - 1001 >= 0`) is not directly affected by this calculation.
2. `nab` is `n - a - 1`, and we know that `nab > 1001` for the loop to execute a second time, meaning `nab` is at least `1002` or greater.
3. The calculation for `ran` will depend on the value of `nab`.

Given that `nab > 1001`, we can determine the following:

- Since `nab` is clearly greater than `1000`, the expression `nab < 1000` evaluates to `False`.
- Therefore, we use the second part of the expression, which simplifies `ran` to:
  ```
  ran = 1000 - (nab - 1001)
  ```
- This can be further simplified to:
  ```
  ran = 1001 - nab + 1000 = 2001 - nab
  ```

Thus, `ran` is assigned the value `2001 - nab`, and since `nab` is greater than `1001`, `ran` will be less than `1000`.

The Output State is: `e1` is either `n - a - 1001 >= 0`; `nab` is `n - a - 1`; `ran` is `2001 - nab`, where `ran < 1000`.

Output State: **`e1` is either `n - a - 1001 >= 0`; `nab` is `n - a - 1`; `ran` is `2001 - nab`, where `ran < 1000.**
