The variable `e1` is assigned the value based on the expression `n - a - 1001`. Given that `a` is 1, this simplifies to `n - 1 - 1001`, which is `n - 1002`. If this value is greater than or equal to 0, `e1` will take on that value; otherwise, `e1` will be -1. Since `n` is at least 1, `n - 1002` will be less than 0, which means `e1` will be assigned -1. 

The states of other variables are not affected by this assignment.

Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is the accumulated sum based on the values of `ran` for all iterations of `nab` from `n - a` to 0, `n` is at least 1, `e1` is -1, `a` is 1.

Output State: **`count` is the accumulated sum based on the values of `ran` for all iterations of `nab` from `n - a` to 0, `n` is at least 1, `e1` is -1, `a` is 1**
