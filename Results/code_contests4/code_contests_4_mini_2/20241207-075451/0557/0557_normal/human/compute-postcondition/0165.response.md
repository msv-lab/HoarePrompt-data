Postcondition: ***`ans[n]` is printed. If `ans[n]` is False, then `ans[n]` is assigned the value of `count`, which is the sum of `ran` for each valid `nab` from `n - a` to `n - a - 1001` for all valid `a`, with `e1` set to either `n - a - 1001` if `n - a - 1001 >= 0` or `-1` otherwise, and `nab` takes its final value after iterating through all valid `nab` values for each `a`, while `ran` is defined based on the last computed value of `nab`.***
