Output State: **`count` is the total accumulated from the loop, `n` is at least 2002, `a` is 1002, `e1` is `n - 2002`, `nab` is between `e1 + 1` and `n - 1002`, and `ran` is either 1000 or greater for all iterations where `ran >= 0`. If `ran` is less than 0, those iterations do not contribute to `count`.**
