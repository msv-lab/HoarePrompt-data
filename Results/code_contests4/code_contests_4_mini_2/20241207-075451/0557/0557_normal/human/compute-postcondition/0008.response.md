To evaluate the code snippet, we need to analyze the variables involved in the expression and their conditions:

1. Given that `n` is a non-negative integer, we have two cases to consider based on the value of `n`:
   - If `n >= 1001`, then `a < 1001` for the loop to execute.
   - If `n < 1001`, then `a <= n` for the loop to execute.
   
2. The variable `nab` is defined as `n - a`, but we do not have a specific value for `a` in the initial state, which means `nab` is dependent on `a`.

3. The expression for `ran` is defined as follows:
   ```
   ran = (nab if nab < 1000 else 1000) - (nab - 1001 if nab > 1000 else -1)
   ```

4. We will analyze the two cases:
   - If `nab < 1000`: 
     - `ran` becomes `nab - (-1)` which simplifies to `ran = nab + 1`.
   - If `nab >= 1000`:
     - `ran` becomes `1000 - (nab - 1001)` which simplifies to `ran = 1001 - nab`.

5. We also know that for `nab`:
   - If `nab > 1000`, the output would be calculated using the second part of the expression.
   - If `nab <= 1000`, the output would be calculated using the first part of the expression.

Since we don't have a specific value for `a`, we cannot determine the exact value of `nab`. Therefore, we can only describe the potential values of `ran` based on the conditions for `nab`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `ran` can be either `nab + 1` if `nab < 1000` or `1001 - nab` if `nab >= 1000`.**
