The expression for `ran` is evaluated based on the value of `nab`. If `nab` is less than 1000, `ran` is assigned the value of `nab`. If `nab` is greater than or equal to 1000, the expression `1000 - (nab - 1001)` simplifies to `1001 - nab`. Therefore, the output state depends on the comparison of `nab` with 1000.

- If `nab < 1000`: Then `ran` is equal to `nab`.
- If `nab >= 1000`: Then `ran` is equal to `1001 - nab`.

Other variables are not affected, so the output state reflects the possible values of `ran` based on the conditions.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `ran` is either `nab` if `nab < 1000` or `1001 - nab` if `nab >= 1000**.
