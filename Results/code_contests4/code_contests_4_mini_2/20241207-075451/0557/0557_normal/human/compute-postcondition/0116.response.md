The variable `e1` is assigned the value of the expression `n - a - 1001`, but only if the result is greater than or equal to 0. If it's less than 0, `e1` will be assigned the value of -1. The output state depends on the values of `n` and `a`, which are currently unknown. Therefore, we denote that `e1` can be either the result of the calculation or -1. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`count` is 0; `e1` is either `n - a - 1001` if `n - a - 1001 >= 0` or `-1` otherwise.**
