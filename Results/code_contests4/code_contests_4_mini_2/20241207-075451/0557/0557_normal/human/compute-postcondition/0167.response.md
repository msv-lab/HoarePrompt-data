The loop calculates a value for `ans[n]` based on the number of ways to partition `n` into four non-negative integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, such that each of these integers is constrained by the range [0, 1000]. The variable `count` accumulates the number of valid combinations of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` for each processed `n`.

If `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 4000, the loop will execute for each line of input, leading to the computation of `ans[n]`. The value of `ans[n]` will be updated to reflect the total count of valid combinations of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` after all iterations for that specific `n`.

Output State: **`ans[n]` is equal to the total number of ways to partition `n` into four non-negative integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, with each in the range [0, 1000].**
