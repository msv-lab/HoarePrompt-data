To analyze the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider the behavior of the loop and how the variables are affected by it.

The loop is defined as:
```
for nab in xrange(n - a, e1, -1):
    ran = (nab if nab < 1000 else 1000) - (nab - 1001 if nab > 1000 else -1)
    if ran >= 0:
        count += ran
```

1. The range of the loop starts from `n - a` and goes down to `e1`. 
2. The variable `e1` will be `n - 1001` if `n >= 1001` and `-1` if `n < 1001`. 
3. Hence, if `n < 1001`, the loop will not execute (because `n - a` will be greater than `-1`), and `count` will remain unchanged.
4. If `n >= 1001`, the loop will execute with values of `nab` decreasing from `n - a` to `n - 1001`.

In both cases, `ran` is calculated based on the value of `nab`:
- If `nab < 1000`, then `ran` is equal to `nab + 1`.
- If `nab >= 1000`, then `ran` is equal to `1001 - nab`.

Now, let's summarize the final state based on the above conditions:

- If `n < 1001`:
  - The loop does not execute.
  - `count` remains unchanged from its initial value.

- If `n >= 1001`:
  - The loop executes as many times as needed to reach from `n - a` to `n - 1001` (inclusive).
  - `count` will accumulate values of `ran` based on the calculation.

Thus, the output state can be structured as follows:

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; if `n < 1001`, `count` remains unchanged; if `n >= 1001`, `count` is the accumulated sum based on the values of `ran` calculated from `nab` in the loop; `e1` is either `n - 1001` or -1.**
