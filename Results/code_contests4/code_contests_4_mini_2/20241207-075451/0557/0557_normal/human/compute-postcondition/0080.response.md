Postcondition: ***`count` is equal to the accumulated sum based on `ran`, `ans[n]` is printed, `n` is at least 1, `a` is such that `n >= a - 1`, `nab` is initialized to `n - a`, `ran` is a non-negative value (i.e., `ran >= 0`) which depends on the value of `nab`: if `nab < 0`, then `ran` is -1; if `0 <= nab <= 1000`, then `ran` is `nab`; if `nab = 1000`, then `ran` is 1000; if `nab > 1000`, then `ran` is `nab - 1001.`***
