The expression `e1` is assigned the value of `n - a - 1001` if `n - a - 1001` is greater than or equal to 0; otherwise, `e1` is assigned -1. Given that `a` is 0, the expression simplifies to `n - 1001`. Therefore, `e1` will be either `n - 1001` if that value is non-negative, or -1 if `n` is less than 1001. 

The output state reflects these calculations based on the value of `n`. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `e1` is either `n - 1001` (if `n >= 1001`) or -1 (if `n < 1001)`**
