Functionality: ** The function processes multiple datasets, each containing a positive integer `n` (â‰¤ 4000), and calculates the total number of ways to partition `n` into four non-negative integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` such that each integer is in the range [0, 1000] and their sum equals `n`. The results for each dataset are printed. The function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 0 or greater than 4000, nor does it validate the input format or the number of datasets provided. **
