Postcondition: ***`count` is increased by `ran`, which is either `nab` or `2001 - nab`. The value of `nab` is `n - a - 1`, and the conditions for the loop remain unchanged, meaning `n - a` must be greater than 1002 and `nab` must be greater than or equal to `e1`. If `ran` is non-negative, the program proceeds with these updates.***
