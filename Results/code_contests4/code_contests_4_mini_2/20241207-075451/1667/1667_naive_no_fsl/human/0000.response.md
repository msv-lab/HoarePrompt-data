Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, it fails to handle cases where the sequence contains elements that are not contiguous integers. 

For example, consider the input:
```
5
1 1 3 3 5
```
According to the problem description, if Alex chooses the element `3`, he can only earn points from `3` and must remove all `2`s (which are non-existent) and all `4`s (also non-existent) from the sequence. After choosing `3`, the sequence would still contain `1`s and `5`s. 

The correct approach should allow for maximizing points based on the counts of each number while considering the removals that occur due to the deletion of adjacent numbers. The current implementation's dynamic programming logic is incorrect because it assumes a contiguous range and does not account for gaps between numbers.

Thus, the program does not cover all potential cases as required and leads to incorrect outputs in some scenarios, showing that it is not following the problem description correctly.
