According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `n`. The loop starts at `i = 2` and continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, the loop executed a third time with `i` being 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, which makes `i` equal to 4. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.

State: **`dp` is updated with a new maximum value, `freq` is a list where `freq[i]` is the count of occurrences of integer `i` in `a`, for the loop to execute a fourth time `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, and `i` is 4.**
