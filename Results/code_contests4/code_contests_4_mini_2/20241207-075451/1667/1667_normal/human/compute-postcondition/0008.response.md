According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. The state `ti`, `ma`, `ol`, `os`, and `olws` do not directly affect the execution of the loop, but the variable `i` needs to be initialized properly for the first iteration. 

Thus, for the loop to execute the first time:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` should be initialized to 0, which is its starting value in the `range(n)` loop.

State: **`ti` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and strips it of whitespace; `ma` is a lambda function that maps `fxn` over the result of splitting `ti`; `ol` is a lambda function that joins elements of an array into a string and writes it to standard output followed by a newline; `os` is a lambda function that writes a string representation of `i` to standard output followed by a newline; `olws` is a lambda function that joins string representations of elements in an array into a string followed by a newline; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0**
