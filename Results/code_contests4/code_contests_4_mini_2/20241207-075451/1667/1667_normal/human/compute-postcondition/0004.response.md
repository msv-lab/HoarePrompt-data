The lambda function `olws` is assigned a new lambda function that takes an array `arr` as input. This function generates a string by joining the string representations of each element `i` in `arr`, followed by a newline. The previous values of `ti`, `ma`, `ol`, and `os` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Thus, the output state reflects the new definition of `olws`.

Output State: **`ti` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and strips it of whitespace; `ma` is a lambda function that maps `fxn` over the result of splitting `ti`; `ol` is a lambda function that joins elements of an array into a string and writes it to standard output followed by a newline; `os` is a lambda function that writes a string representation of `i` to standard output followed by a newline; `olws` is a lambda function that joins string representations of elements in an array into a string followed by a newline.**
