`freq[a[i]]` is assigned the value of `freq[a[i]] + 1`. The previous state indicates that `freq[a[0]]` has already been increased by 1, but the value of `freq[a[i]]` before this operation is unknown. The variable `i` is currently 1, meaning we are accessing the second element of the `a` array. The value of `n` being greater than 1 indicates that there are indeed at least two elements in `a`, allowing the index `i` to be valid. Therefore, the output state is: `freq[a[0]]` is increased by 1; `n` is greater than 1; `i` is 1; `freq[a[i]]` is now increased by 1.

Output State: **`freq[a[0]]` is increased by 1; `n` is greater than 1; `i` is 1; `freq[a[i]]` is now increased by 1.**
