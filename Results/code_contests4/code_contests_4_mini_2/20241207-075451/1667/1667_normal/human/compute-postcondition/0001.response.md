The value of `ma` is assigned a lambda function that takes two arguments: `fxn` and `ti`. The function applies `map` to `fxn` and the result of calling `ti.split()`. The variable `ti` itself remains unchanged as it is still a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and strips it of whitespace. Therefore, the Output State is: `ti` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and strips it of whitespace; `ma` is a lambda function that maps `fxn` over the result of splitting `ti`.

Output State: **`ti` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and strips it of whitespace; `ma` is a lambda function that maps `fxn` over the result of splitting `ti`.**
