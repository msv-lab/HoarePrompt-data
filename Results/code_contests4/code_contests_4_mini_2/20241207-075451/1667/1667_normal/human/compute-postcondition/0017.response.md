The code appends a new value to the `dp` list by calculating the maximum of two values: `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2] + freq[i] * i`. Given that `i` is 2, the relevant calculations are as follows:

1. `dp[i - 1]` is `dp[1]`, which is the count of occurrences of integer 1 in `a`.
2. `dp[i - 2]` is `dp[0]`, which is 0.
3. `freq[i]` is the count of occurrences of integer 2 in `a`.

Thus, the value being appended to `dp` is calculated as:
- `max(dp[1], dp[0] + freq[2] * 2)`
- This simplifies to `max(dp[1], 0 + freq[2] * 2)`.

The values of `dp` after the execution will be affected by this new appended value, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[1]` is the count of occurrences of integer 1 in `a`, and a new value is appended based on the calculation `max(dp[1], freq[2] * 2)`. `freq` is a list where `freq[i]` is the count of occurrences of integer `i` in `a`, `i` is 2.**
