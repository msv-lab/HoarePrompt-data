The variable `n` is assigned the value obtained from `int(ti())`, where `ti()` reads a line from standard input and strips it of whitespace. The value read is then converted to an integer. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `ti` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and strips it of whitespace; `ma` is a lambda function that maps `fxn` over the result of splitting `ti`; `ol` is a lambda function that joins elements of an array into a string and writes it to standard output followed by a newline; `os` is a lambda function that writes a string representation of `i` to standard output followed by a newline; `olws` is a lambda function that joins string representations of elements in an array into a string followed by a newline; `n` is an input integer.
