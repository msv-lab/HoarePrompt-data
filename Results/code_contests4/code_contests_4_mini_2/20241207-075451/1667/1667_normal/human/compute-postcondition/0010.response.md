According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 1, and `i` will be updated to 1.

State: **`freq[a[0]]` is increased by 1; `n` is greater than 1; `i` is 1**
