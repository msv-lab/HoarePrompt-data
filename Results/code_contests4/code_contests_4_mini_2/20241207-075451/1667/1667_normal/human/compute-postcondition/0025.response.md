Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` followed by `n` integers, counts the occurrences of each integer from 1 to 100,000, and computes the maximum sum of non-adjacent integers using a dynamic programming approach, returning this maximum sum. It correctly handles cases where the input integers and their counts are within the specified range. **
