According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` in relation to `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute a second time, `i` will be increased by 1, making it 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`freq[a[0]]` is increased by 1; `n` is greater than 1; `i` is 2; for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
