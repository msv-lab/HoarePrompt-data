The program provided implements a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem of maximizing points based on the rules described in the problem statement. Let's analyze it step-by-step to confirm its correctness.

1. **Input Handling**: 
    - The program reads an integer `n` and then a sequence of `n` integers. This matches the requirement of the problem description.

2. **Frequency Count**:
    - The program constructs a frequency list `freq` where `freq[i]` holds the count of occurrences of integer `i` in the input sequence. This is crucial because the player's score depends on how many times each integer can be selected.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
    - The program initializes a dynamic programming list `dp` where:
        - `dp[0]` is initialized to `0`, representing no points earned when there are no integers.
        - `dp[1]` is initialized to `freq[1]`, which corresponds to earning points based on the integer `1`.
    - The loop iterates from `2` to `n`, and for each integer `i`, it calculates the maximum points that can be earned either by:
        - Not taking `i` (and thus using the points from `dp[i-1]`).
        - Taking `i` (which earns `freq[i] * i` points, while also ensuring that `i-1` is not taken, hence using `dp[i-2]`).
    - This logic correctly implements the rule where selecting an integer `ak` also removes `ak - 1` and `ak + 1` from consideration for future selections.

4. **Final Output**:
    - The program prints out `dp[n]`, which will contain the maximum points that can be achieved based on the described rules.

Given all of these points, the program indeed follows the problem description accurately and effectively maximizes Alex's points based on the rules provided.

Correctness: **True**
