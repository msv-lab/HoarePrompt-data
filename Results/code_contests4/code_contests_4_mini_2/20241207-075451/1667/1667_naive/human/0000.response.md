To assess the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to carefully analyze how the program processes the input and whether it fulfills the requirements as described.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input**: 
   - The first line contains an integer `n` (number of elements in the sequence).
   - The second line contains `n` integers representing the sequence.
   
2. **Game Logic**:
   - In a single step, Alex can choose an element `ak` and delete it along with all elements equal to `ak + 1` and `ak - 1`.
   - The points earned for selecting `ak` are equal to `ak` multiplied by the number of occurrences of `ak`.

3. **Objective**:
   - Maximize the total points earned.

### Program Analysis:
The program uses a frequency array to count occurrences of each number in the sequence. It then uses dynamic programming to calculate the maximum points possible by either:
- Not taking the current number and using the best result from the previous number (`dp[i - 1]`).
- Taking the current number, which means adding its points (frequency times the value) to the best result from two numbers back (`dp[i - 2]`).

### Potential Issues:
1. **Dynamic Programming Array Size**:
   - The program initializes `dp` for the range `0` to `n`. However, the relevant indices should be from `0` to `100,000` (the maximum possible value of elements in the input) since the values in the sequence can be as large as `100,000`. This is a critical logical error because it can lead to out-of-bounds errors or incorrect calculations when `n` is significantly smaller than `100,000`.

2. **Handling of Frequencies**:
   - The program does not account for the scenario where elements are not present in the sequence. If `n` is smaller than the maximum value in the frequency array, the program could potentially miscalculate maximum points by referencing uninitialized values in `dp`.

### Conclusion:
Given that the program can fail to properly calculate the maximum points due to the reasons outlined above, we can conclude that there are potential cases where the program may not work as expected (e.g., when `n` is less than `100,000` but there are high values in the sequence).

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**. 

### Example of Failure:
For an input like:
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
The program might not handle the frequency correctly if it accesses indices beyond those defined by `n`, leading to potentially incorrect output.
