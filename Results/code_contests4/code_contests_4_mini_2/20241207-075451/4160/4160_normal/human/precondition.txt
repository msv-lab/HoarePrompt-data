n is a positive integer representing the number of programmers, m is a positive integer representing the number of lines of code to write, b is a non-negative integer representing the maximum total number of bugs allowed, mod is a positive integer for modulo operation, and a is a list of n non-negative integers where each element represents the number of bugs per line for each programmer. The constraints are 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500, 0 ≤ b ≤ 500, and 1 ≤ mod ≤ 10^9 + 7.
