The statement assigns a new value to `mem[ix][j][k]` based on the addition of `mem[ix][j][k]` and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`. The variable `ix` is currently 0, `j` is 1, and `i` is 2, which means `a[i - 1]` refers to `a[1]`. The values of `mem[ix][j][k]` and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` depend on the previous state of the `mem` array, which is not provided. Therefore, we cannot determine specific values for `mem[ix][j][k]` or `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`.

However, we know that the operation is performed, and we can infer that `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the addition. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 0, `j` is 1; `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the addition of `mem[ix][j][k]` and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`.**
