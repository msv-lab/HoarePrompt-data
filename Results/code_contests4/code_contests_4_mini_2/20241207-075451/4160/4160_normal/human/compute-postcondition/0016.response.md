The statement `mem[ix][j][k] = mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` assigns a value from the `mem` array at a specific index to another index based on the current state of `ix`. The value `ix` is currently 1, so `ix ^ 1` will give us 0. 

Thus, the code retrieves the value from `mem[0][j][k]` and assigns it to `mem[1][j][k]`. The values of `n`, `i`, `ans`, and `ix` remain unchanged. 

Since this operation only modifies the `mem` array and does not change the other variables, the output state will reflect the unchanged states of those variables alongside the action taken on the `mem` array.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 1; `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value from `mem[0][j][k]`**.
