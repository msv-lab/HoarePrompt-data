Functionality: ** The function accepts integers `n`, `m`, `b`, and a positive integer `mod`, along with a list `a` of non-negative integers. It computes a cumulative count based on the values in list `a`, where the count of ways to obtain sums from `0` to `b` using exactly `m` elements is stored in `mem`. The final result, which is the total number of ways to achieve these sums modulo `mod`, is printed.**
