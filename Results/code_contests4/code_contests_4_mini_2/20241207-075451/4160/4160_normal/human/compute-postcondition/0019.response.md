According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `m + 1`, which means it can execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 2. 

Since `n` is greater than 0, there are no additional constraints on `n` for the loop to execute again. The values of `ans` and `ix` remain unchanged, as they are not directly impacted by the loop's execution.

Thus, for the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be 2, and the state of `mem` remains relevant but unchanged in this context. 

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 1; for the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be 2 (1 < j <= m)**
