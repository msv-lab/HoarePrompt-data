According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the range of the loop defined by `b`. The loop iterates from `0` to `b` inclusive, which means it can execute `b + 1` times. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its maximum for the current loop iteration, which is `b`. For the loop to execute again, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be `b + 1`, and `b` should remain the same.

State: **`ans` is updated based on `add(0, mem[n & 1][m][1])`, where `ans` is now `mem[n & 1][m][1]`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is `b + 1`**
