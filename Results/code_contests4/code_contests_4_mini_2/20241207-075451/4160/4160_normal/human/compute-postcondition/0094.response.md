The operation `mem[ix][j][k] = add(mem[ix][j][k], mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]])` involves the addition of two elements from the `mem` array. The variable `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the result of the `add` function, which takes the current value of `mem[ix][j][k]` and adds it to the value of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`. 

The previous state indicates:
- `ix` is 1
- `j` is 2
- `k` is `b`
- `mem[ix][j][k]` is currently assigned the value of `mem[0][2][b]`

Assuming the `add` function simply sums its parameters, we consider:
- `mem[ix][j][k]` will now hold a new value based on the addition of `mem[1][2][b]` (which is `mem[ix][j][k]` before the operation) and `mem[1][1][k - a[i - 1]]`.

We do not know the specific values of `mem[1][2][b]`, `mem[1][1][k - a[i - 1]]`, or the value of `a[i - 1]` as they were not provided in the initial state. Thus, we cannot compute exact values, but we note that the operation modifies `mem[ix][j][k]` based on the values of the `mem` array.

Therefore, the Output State reflects the changes made to `mem[ix][j][k]`:

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is `b`, `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the addition operation involving `mem[ix][j][k]` and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`.**
