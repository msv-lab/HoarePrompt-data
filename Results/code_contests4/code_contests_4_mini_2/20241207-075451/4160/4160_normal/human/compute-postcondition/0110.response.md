The code assigns the value from `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` to `mem[ix][j][k]`. The value of `ix` is 1, so `ix ^ 1` becomes 0. Therefore, the assignment is taking the value from `mem[0][j][k]` and placing it into `mem[1][j][k]`. The variables `n`, `i`, `ans`, `ix`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 1, `j` is 3, `k` is `a[2] + 1`, and `mem[1][j][k]` is assigned the value from `mem[0][j][k]`.**
