To analyze the impact of the code snippet, let's break it down step by step. 

1. The provided initial state indicates that `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 1, `j` is 1, and `k` is `a[2] + 1`. 
2. The line of code `mem[ix][j][k] = add(mem[ix][j][k], mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]])` affects the `mem` array.
3. The operation uses the function `add`, which takes two arguments: `mem[ix][j][k]` and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`.
4. The value `j - 1` will be `1 - 1 = 0`, and `k - a[i - 1]` will depend on the specific value of `a[i - 1]`. Since `i` is 3, we look at `a[2]` for `k`, thus we need the value of `a[2]` to calculate `k - a[i - 1]`.
5. The function `add` updates `mem[ix][j][k]` based on the value from `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`, which is `mem[ix][0][k - a[i - 1]]`.

Since we do not have the specific values for `a` or `mem` to make exact calculations, we cannot determine the specific values after the operation. However, we can state that the value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is being updated based on the results of the `add` function.

Therefore, the output state will summarize the changes without exact numeric results, as those depend on external values not provided:

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is `a[2] + 1`, and `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the add operation with `mem[ix][0][k - a[i - 1]]`.**
