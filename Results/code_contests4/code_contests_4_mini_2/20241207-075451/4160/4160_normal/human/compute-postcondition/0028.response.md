The code assigns a value to `mem[ix][j][k]` by adding the result of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` to it. The values of `mem[ix][j][k]` and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` depend on the specific values stored in the `mem` array, as well as the value of `a[i - 1]`, which is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, without knowing the exact values of `mem` and `a`, the output state will reflect the intention of the operation rather than specific results.

The previous values of the affected variables are:
- `ix` is 1
- `j` is not specified but is assumed to be valid within the bounds of `mem`
- `k` is 4
- `a[i - 1]` is also not specified.

The operation will update `mem[ix][j][k]`, but the exact value after the operation cannot be determined because `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` is unknown.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 1, `k` is 4; `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated by adding `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` to it.**
