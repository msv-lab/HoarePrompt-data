The code assigns a value to `mem[ix][j][k]` using a function `add` that takes two arguments: `mem[ix][j][k]` and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`. The values of `ix`, `j`, and `i` are known, while `k` and `a[i - 1]` depend on their respective initial states or previous assignments, which are not provided.

Given that `ix` is 0, `j` is 1, and `i` is 2, we can substitute these values in the code. The variable `mem[0][1][k]` is updated based on the value of `mem[0][0][k - a[1]]`. However, since the specific values of `k` and `a[i - 1]` are not defined, we cannot calculate exact numeric values.

Therefore, the output state is that `mem[0][1][k]` is updated with the result of the `add` function, which cannot be fully determined due to the unknown variables.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 0, `j` is 1; `mem[0][1][k]` is updated with the result of add(mem[0][1][k], mem[0][0][k - a[1]])**
