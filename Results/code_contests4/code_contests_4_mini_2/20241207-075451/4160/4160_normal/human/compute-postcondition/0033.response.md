The variable `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated by adding the value of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` to it. The previous value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is unknown, but we know that `ix` is 1, `j` is 2, and `k` is within the bounds specified (`k` is greater than or equal to `a[i - 1]` and less than or equal to `b`). The value `a[i - 1]` must also be taken into account, but since we do not have its specific value, we cannot determine the exact numerical outcome of the addition.

Thus, the output state reflects the updated nature of `mem`, along with the conditions of the other variables that remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 1, `k` is within the specified bounds, `j` is 2, and `mem[ix][j][k]` has been updated by adding `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 1, `k` is within the specified bounds, `j` is 2, and `mem[ix][j][k]` has been updated by adding `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`.**
