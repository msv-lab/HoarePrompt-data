The code assigns the value from `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` to `mem[ix][j][k]`. Here, `ix` is 1, `j` is 3, and `k` is `b + 1`. The previous state of `mem` at the position `[ix ^ 1][j][k]` will impact the new value assigned to `mem[ix][j][k]`. 

The value of `ix ^ 1` computes to 0 since `ix` is 1. Therefore, we are accessing `mem[0][3][k]`, where `k` is `b + 1`. Since the exact values of `mem` and `b` are not provided, we cannot determine the specific value that is being assigned.

The output state reflects that `mem[ix][j][k]` is now equal to `mem[0][3][k]`, but we cannot specify exact values due to the lack of information on `mem` and `b`. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 1, `j` is 3, `k` is `b + 1`, and `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[0][3][k]`.**
