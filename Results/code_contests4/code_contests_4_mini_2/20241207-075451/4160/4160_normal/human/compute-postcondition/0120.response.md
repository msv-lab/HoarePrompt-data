The value of `ans` is updated based on the function `add` applied to `ans` and `mem[n & 1][m][i]`. The previous value of `ans` was `mem[n & 1][m][1]`, and now `i` is `b + 1`. Therefore, `ans` will now be calculated as `add(mem[n & 1][m][1], mem[n & 1][m][b + 1])`. The states of the other variables are not affected directly by this line. 

Output State: **`ans` is updated based on `add(mem[n & 1][m][1], mem[n & 1][m][b + 1])`, `i` is `b + 1`**
