The code snippet assigns the value of `add(mem[ix][j][k], mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]])` to `mem[ix][j][k]`. Here, `ix`, `j`, and `k` are used to index into the `mem` array. 

1. The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` will be updated based on the result of the `add` function, which takes two arguments: `mem[ix][j][k]` and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`.
2. The variable `ix` is 1, `k` is 2, and `i` is 1. The value of `a[i - 1]` refers to `a[0]`, so we need the value of `a[0]` to determine the specific value used in the indexing.
3. `j` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine its specific value. The output state will therefore reflect that the value of `j` is unknown.
4. The value of `ans` and `n` are not directly affected by this assignment.

Since the exact values of `mem`, `a`, and `j` are not provided, the output state will focus on the changes made by the code.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 1, `k` is 2; `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated with the result of `add(mem[ix][j][k], mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]])` (specific values of `j`, `a`, and `mem` are unknown)**.
