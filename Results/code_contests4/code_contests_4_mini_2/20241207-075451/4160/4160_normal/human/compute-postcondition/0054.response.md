The loop iterates over the range from `a[i - 1]` to `b + 1`, updating the `mem` array based on the values from the previous iteration (indicated by `ix ^ 1`). After all iterations of the loop have completed, `mem[ix][j][k]` will have been updated for each `k` in the specified range, incorporating contributions from both `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`. 

Since the loop will execute for each value of `k` from `a[i - 1]` to `b`, and `j` is fixed at 1, the final state will reflect all these updates.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 0, `j` is 1; `mem[ix][j][k]` contains the result of cumulative updates for all `k` from `a[i - 1]` to `b`.**
