The function `func` accepts the following parameters: `n`, `m`, `b`, `mod`, and `a`. 

- `n` is an integer with a constraint of 1 ≤ n ≤ 500.
- `m` is an integer with a constraint of 1 ≤ m ≤ 500.
- `b` is an integer with a constraint of 0 ≤ b ≤ 500.
- `mod` is a positive integer with a constraint of 1 ≤ mod ≤ 10^9 + 7.
- `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, where each element `ai` satisfies 0 ≤ ai ≤ 500.

The function returns a value based on the parameters but specific details about the output are not provided in the description. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept the parameters `n`, `m`, `b`, `mod`, and `a`, which are integers and a list of integers, respectively, and produce a corresponding output based on those inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (integer), m (integer), b (integer), mod (positive integer), and a (list of n non-negative integers), and returns a value based on these inputs.**
