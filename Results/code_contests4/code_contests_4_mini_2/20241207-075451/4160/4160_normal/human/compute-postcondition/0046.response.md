`mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`. The variables `ix`, `j`, and `k` are defined, and since `ix` is 0, `ix ^ 1` results in 1. Therefore, `mem[0][j][k]` is set to the value of `mem[1][j][k]`. Other variables such as `n`, `i`, `ans`, and `j` remain unchanged. Consequently, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 0, `j` is 1, and `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated to `mem[1][j][k]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 0, `j` is 1, `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated to `mem[1][j][k]`**
