The line of code `mem[ix][j][k] = mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` assigns the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` to `mem[ix][j][k]`. The variable `ix` is currently 1, so `ix ^ 1` will evaluate to 0. Therefore, we are assigning the value from `mem[0][j][k]` to `mem[1][j][k]`. 

The variables `n`, `i`, `ans`, and `j` are not affected by this line of code, and we don't have specific values for `mem[0][j][k]` or `mem[1][j][k]`. As such, we can only describe the change in terms of the indices being used.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 1, `j` is 3, `k` is `a[i - 1]`, `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated to the value of `mem[0][j][k]`**.
