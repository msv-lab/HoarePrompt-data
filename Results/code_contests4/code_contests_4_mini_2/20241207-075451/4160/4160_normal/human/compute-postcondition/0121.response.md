To determine the output state after the completion of the loop, let's analyze the loop code and the initial state provided, along with the output states from the iterations.

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `ans` is 0, `ix` is equal to `n % 2`, `mem` contains the final cumulative updates for all `j` from 1 to `m` and for all `k` from `a[i - 1]` to `b`.

The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = b`, inclusive, which means it will execute `b + 1` times. In each iteration, `ans` is updated by adding the value `mem[n & 1][m][i]` to the current value of `ans`.

After all iterations of the loop have executed, `ans` will contain the cumulative sum of all values from `mem[n & 1][m][0]` to `mem[n & 1][m][b]`. The final value of `ans` can be represented as:

`ans = mem[n & 1][m][0] + mem[n & 1][m][1] + ... + mem[n & 1][m][b]`

The variable `ix` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop, and it will still be equal to `n % 2`. The variable `n` remains a positive integer, and `mem` continues to contain the values as defined in the initial state.

Therefore, the output state after the loop has executed all iterations is:

Output State: **`ans` is the sum of `mem[n & 1][m][0]` to `mem[n & 1][m][b]`, `ix` is equal to `n % 2`, `n` is a positive integer, `mem` contains values.**
