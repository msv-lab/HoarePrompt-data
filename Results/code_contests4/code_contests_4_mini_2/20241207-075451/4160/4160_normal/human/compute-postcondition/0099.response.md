The code assigns the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` to `mem[ix][j][k]`. Since `ix` is initially 1, `ix ^ 1` equals 0. Therefore, `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` refers to `mem[0][j][k]`. The variables `j` and `k` retain their previous values, which are 2 and `a[2]`, respectively. Other variables remain unchanged. 

Thus, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is `a[2]`, and `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[0][j][k]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is `a[2]`, and `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[0][j][k]`.**
