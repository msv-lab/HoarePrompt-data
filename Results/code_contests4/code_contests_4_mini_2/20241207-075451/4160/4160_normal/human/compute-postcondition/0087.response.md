According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `k`, `a[i - 1]`, and `b`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `b`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, which means `a[i - 1]` is `a[2]`, and `k` is currently `a[2] + 1`. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is one more than `a[2]`, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to `a[2] + 2`, and it needs to remain less than or equal to `b`.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is `a[2] + 2`, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be less than or equal to `b`.**
