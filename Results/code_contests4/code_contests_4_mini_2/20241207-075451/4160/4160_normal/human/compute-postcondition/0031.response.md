According to the code, the loop iterates over the range defined by `a[i - 1]` to `b + 1`. Since `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 1, we can assume that `a[0]` is defined and that `k` must stay within the bounds defined by `a[i - 1]` and `b`. 

For the loop to execute a second time, the variable `j` must be adjusted to 2 to correspond with the current state before the loop starts. Additionally, `m` must be at least 2 to allow for a second iteration of the outer loop, and since `ix` is already 1, it indicates the current index for `mem`.

Thus, the state needs to account for the conditions that will allow the loop to execute again. 

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 1, `k` is greater than or equal to `a[i - 1]` and less than or equal to `b`, `mem[ix][j][k]` contains the results of the updates performed during the loop iterations, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2**
