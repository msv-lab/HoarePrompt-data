To analyze the code step by step, let's break it down:

1. The line of code affects the `mem` variable, specifically modifying the value at `mem[ix][j][k]`.
2. The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated to be the result of the `add` function, which takes two parameters:
   - The current value of `mem[ix][j][k]`
   - The value of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`
3. The variables `ix`, `j`, and `k` are already defined in the initial state. Specifically:
   - `ix` is 1
   - `j` is 2
   - `k` is `b + 1` (where `b` is not defined in the initial state)
4. The term `a[i - 1]` refers to the value in array `a` at index `i - 1`. Since `i` is 3, it refers to `a[2]`.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the change in `mem[ix][j][k]` based on the values retrieved from the `mem` array and the computation involving `add`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is `b + 1`, `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated to add(mem[ix][j][k], mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[2]])**
