Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 1, `j` is 3, `k` is `b + 1`, and `mem[ix][j][k]` has been updated based on the results of the additions performed in each iteration of the loop, including all relevant updates from `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` and the subsequent updates involving `k` values from `a[i - 1]` to `b`.**
