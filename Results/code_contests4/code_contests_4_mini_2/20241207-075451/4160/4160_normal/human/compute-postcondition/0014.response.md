The code assigns to `mem[ix][j][k]` the result of the function `add` applied to `mem[ix][j][k]` and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`. The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` will be updated based on the previous value of `mem[ix][j][k]` and the value `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`, where the state of `a` is not specified. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact outcome without knowing the values in `mem`, `a`, `j`, and `k`. 

Since `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 1, it implies that `a[i - 1]` is defined. However, without further information on the values of `j`, `k`, and the contents of `mem`, we can only state that `mem[ix][j][k]` is modified. 

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 1; `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the values of `mem[ix][j][k]` and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 1; `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the values of `mem[ix][j][k]` and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]**
