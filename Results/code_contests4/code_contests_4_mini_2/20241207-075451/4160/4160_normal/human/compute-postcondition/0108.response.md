To analyze the given code, we need to understand the impact of the operation on the `mem` array and the variables involved.

1. We have the initial state where `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 1, `j` is 3, and `k` is `a[i - 1]`. The value of `k` is dependent on the array `a` and the specific value at index `i - 1`, which is `a[2]`.

2. The code updates `mem[ix][j][k]` by adding the value from `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` to it. Since `i` is 3, `a[i - 1]` refers to `a[2]`, and thus `k` will be equal to `a[2]`.

3. The expression `add(mem[ix][j][k], mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]])` indicates that the value located at `mem[ix][j][k]` is being updated. The `add` function presumably takes two arguments, where the second argument is the value at `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`.

4. Since the exact values of `mem` and `a` are not provided, we can only express the output state in terms of the variables and the operation performed.

The output state then reflects that the `mem[ix][j][k]` has been updated based on its previous value and the value from another index in the array. The specific values of `mem` cannot be determined without knowing the values of `a` and the current state of `mem`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 1, `j` is 3, `k` is `a[2]`, `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated by adding `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[2]]` to it.**
