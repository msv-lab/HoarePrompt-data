The code assigns a value to `mem[ix][j][k]` by adding the result of `add(mem[ix][j][k], mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]])`. This means that `mem[ix][j][k]` will now hold a new value based on the addition of its current value and another value from the `mem` array. The variables `ix`, `j`, and `k` are involved in indexing the `mem` array, and the previous values of `mem[ix][j][k]` and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` will determine the new value assigned.

Since `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, and the other variables have specific values, we can say that the computation occurs without affecting `n`, `i`, `ans`, or `j`. The variable `k` is not defined in the initial state, but it will be part of the indexing in the `mem` array.

The output state will reflect that the value of `mem[ix][j][k]` has been updated, but we will not know the specific value since `mem[ix][j][k]` and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` have not been provided.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 0, `j` is 3; `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on `add(mem[ix][j][k], mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]])`.**
