According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the range defined by `n`. The loop is set to iterate over the range from 1 to `n + 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to `n`, while `n` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, which means `i` will become 3 if it was 2 at the end of the last iteration. 

To execute the loop again, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`. Hence, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than or equal to `3`.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 0, `j` is `m`, `mem[ix][j][k]` contains the final cumulative updates for all `k` from `a[i - 1]` to `b`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.**
