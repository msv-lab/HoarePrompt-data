To determine the output state after executing the given code, we analyze the statement: 

`ans = add(ans, mem[n & 1][m][i])`

1. `ans` starts at 0.
2. `n & 1` will evaluate to either 0 or 1 based on the value of `n`. Since `ix` is equal to `n % 2`, `n & 1` will yield the same result.
3. `mem` is a multi-dimensional array, and `mem[n & 1][m][i]` will access the element based on the current values of `n & 1`, `m`, and `i`.
4. `i` is given as 1.
5. Assuming `mem[n & 1][m][i]` returns a certain value (let's denote it as `value`), `ans` will be updated to `add(0, value)`, which is simply `value`.

The output state will thus reflect that `ans` has been updated based on the value retrieved from `mem`.

Output State: **`ans` is updated based on `add(0, mem[n & 1][m][1])`, where `ans` is now `mem[n & 1][m][1]`**.
