The statement `mem[ix][j][k] = add(mem[ix][j][k], mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]])` assigns the result of the `add` function to `mem[ix][j][k]`. The function `add` takes two arguments: `mem[ix][j][k]` and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`. 

In the initial state, we have:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is 1
- `ix` is 1
- `k` is 3
- `mem[ix][j][k]` is currently assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` which means `mem[1][j][3]` has been assigned the value of `mem[0][j][3]`.

The value of `a[i - 1]` translates to `a[0]` since `i` is 1. However, the value of `a[0]` is not provided in the initial state. 

The impact of the code on the program is that `mem[ix][j][k]` (which is `mem[1][j][3]`) will be updated with the result of `add`. Since the specific values of `mem[ix][j][k]`, `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`, and `a[0]` are unknown, we cannot determine exact numerical values.

Therefore, the output state reflects the operation performed without specifying the exact outcome due to the unknowns.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 1, `k` is 3; `mem[ix][j][k]` updated with the result of `add(mem[ix][j][k], mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]])` where `a[i - 1]` is `a[0]`.**
