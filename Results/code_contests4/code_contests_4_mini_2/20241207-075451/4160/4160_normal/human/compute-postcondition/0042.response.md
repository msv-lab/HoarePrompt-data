According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `n`. The loop is designed to execute for values of `i` ranging from 1 to `n`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Since the current value of `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be 2. Thus, we also need to ensure that `n` is still greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to continue iterating.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 1; `mem[ix][j][k]` contains the results of updates for all `j` from 1 to `m` and for all `k` from `a[i - 1]` to `b`**
