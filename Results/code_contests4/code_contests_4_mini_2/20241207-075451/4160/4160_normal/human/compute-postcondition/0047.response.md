The code updates `mem[ix][j][k]` by adding the value of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` to it. The variable `ix` is 0, `j` is 1, and `k` is not defined in the initial state but is likely to be defined elsewhere in the program. The values of `mem[ix][j][k]` and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` depend on the current context of the program and the values in the `mem` structure.

Since `a[i - 1]` requires the value of `a`, which is not provided in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact values. However, the operation indicates that we are accessing elements of a multi-dimensional list or array.

Thus, the output state reflects the fact that `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the addition operation. The states of `n`, `i`, `ans`, and `ix` remain unaffected, but the operation impacts `mem[ix][j][k]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 0, `j` is 1; `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated by adding `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` to it.**
