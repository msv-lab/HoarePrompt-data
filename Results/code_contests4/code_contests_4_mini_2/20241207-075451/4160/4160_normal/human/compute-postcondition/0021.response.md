The code assigns the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` to `mem[ix][j][k]`. The variable `ix` is 1, so `ix ^ 1` results in `0`. Therefore, `mem[ix][j][k]` will be assigned the value from `mem[0][j][k]`. The states of the other variables, including `n`, `i`, `ans`, and `k`, remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 1, `k` is 2; `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[0][j][k]`.**
