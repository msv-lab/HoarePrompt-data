The assignment updates the `mem[ix][j][k]` variable using the `add` function, which combines the current value of `mem[ix][j][k]` with `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`. The values of `ix`, `j`, and `i` are known, but `k` and `a[i - 1]` are not defined in the initial state. The initial state indicates that `mem[ix][j][k]` has been updated to `mem[1][j][k]`, but without knowing the values of `k` or `a[i - 1]`, we cannot determine the exact result of the addition or the new state of `mem[ix][j][k]`. Thus, the output state reflects the known variables and the operation being performed.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 0, `j` is 3, and `mem[ix][j][k]` is being updated to `add(mem[ix][j][k], mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]])`**
