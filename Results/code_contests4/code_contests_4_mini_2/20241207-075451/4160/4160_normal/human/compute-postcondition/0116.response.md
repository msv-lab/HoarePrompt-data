The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `add(ans, mem[n & 1][m][i])`. The `n & 1` operation checks the least significant bit of `n`, determining if `n` is odd or even. Since `n` is a positive integer, `n & 1` will yield either 0 (if `n` is even) or 1 (if `n` is odd). The values of `mem`, `m`, and `i` are used to access a specific element in the 3D structure `mem`.

The output state will depend on the values of `mem[n & 1][m][i]`. However, without specific values for `mem`, `m`, and `i`, we cannot determine the exact value being added to `ans`. Thus, we only know that `ans` is updated based on the current value of `ans` and the value from `mem`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is updated based on `add(ans, mem[n & 1][m][i])`, where `n` is a positive integer, `ans` is 0, `ix` is equal to `n % 2`, `mem` contains values, `m` is defined, and `i` is 0.

Output State: **`ans` is updated based on `add(ans, mem[n & 1][m][i])`, where `n` is a positive integer, `ans` is 0, `ix` is equal to `n % 2`, `mem` contains values, `m` is defined, and `i` is 0.**
