The line of code updates the value of `mem[ix][j][k]` by adding the value of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` to it. The previous state indicates that `ix` is 1, `j` is 3, and `k` is `b + 1`. The exact value of `a[i - 1]` is not provided, and `b` is also unknown, making it impossible to determine the exact numeric values being used in the operation.

However, we know that `mem[ix][j][k]` is affected by the values from `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the change in `mem[ix][j][k]` due to this addition operation.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 1, `j` is 3, `k` is `b + 1`, `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated by adding `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` to it.**
