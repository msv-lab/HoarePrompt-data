To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we analyze the loop's operations and the relationships among the variables. The loop iterates over the range from `a[i - 1]` to `b + 1`, updating the `mem` array each time.

Given the constraints and the nature of the loop, after all iterations complete:

- `n` remains greater than 0 as it is not modified in the loop.
- `i` remains 1 as it is also not modified.
- `ans` remains 0 as it is not modified.
- `ix` remains 1 as it is not modified.
- `j` remains 2 as it is also not modified.
- The variable `k` will have taken on all values from `a[i - 1]` to `b`, inclusive.
- The contents of `mem[ix][j][k]` will be updated for each value of `k` based on the addition of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` to `mem[ix][j][k]`.

After the loop has executed completely, `mem[ix][j][k]` will have been updated for each `k` within the specified range. 

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop are completed is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` has taken all values from `a[i - 1]` to `b`, and `mem[ix][j][k]` contains the updated results for each `k`.**
