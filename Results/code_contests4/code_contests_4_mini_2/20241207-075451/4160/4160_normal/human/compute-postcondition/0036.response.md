The code updates the value of `mem[ix][j][k]` by adding the value of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` to it. The previous state indicates that `ix` is 1, `j` is 2, and `k` is not specified but is part of the `mem` structure. The initial value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the value of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`. 

Since `a[i - 1]` is not defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be a variable that will affect the final value of `k`, but without specific knowledge of its value, we cannot determine the exact result.

Therefore, the output state reflects the change without exact numerical values for `k` or `a[i - 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 1, `j` is 2, `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated by adding `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`**
