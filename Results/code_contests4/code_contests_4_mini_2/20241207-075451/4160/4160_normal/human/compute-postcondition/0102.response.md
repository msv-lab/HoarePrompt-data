According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `m` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented to 3.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 1, `j` is 3, `k` is `b + 1`, for the loop to execute a third time `m` must be greater than or equal to 3.**
