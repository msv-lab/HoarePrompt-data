According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `m` is at least 2 (since `n` is greater than or equal to 2). For the loop to execute a second time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `m` must be at least 2.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is `b`, `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on all cumulative operations from `a[i - 1]` to `b`, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be greater than or equal to 2.**
