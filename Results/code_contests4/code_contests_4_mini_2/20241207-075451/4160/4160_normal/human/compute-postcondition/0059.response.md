According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k`, which iterates from `a[i - 1]` to `b`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, so `a[i - 1]` is `a[1]`, and since `n` is greater than or equal to 2, we know that the loop has already executed for `k` starting from `a[1]` up to some value less than or equal to `b`.

Since `i` is 2, the next value of `i` for the subsequent iteration would be 3 (as `i` typically increments in a loop context). For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1 to be one more than the current value, and we must ensure that `k` does not exceed `b`.

If `k` was previously at the lower bound (`a[i - 1]`), and we want to execute the loop again, then `k` should be equal to `a[i - 1] + 1` (which is one more than the previous value of `k`). 

Thus, we can summarize the state adjustments:
- Since `i` is increased by 1 for the next iteration, `i` becomes 3.
- The next value of `k` will be `a[i - 1] + 1` which is `a[2]`, assuming `a[1]` was `k` in the previous iteration.
- The condition for the loop to execute again is that `k` must be less than or equal to `b`.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 0, `j` is 2; `mem[0][2][k]` will be updated based on `mem[0][1][k - a[1]]` using the add operation, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be greater than or equal to `a[2]` and less than or equal to `b`.**
