The variable `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the result of the `add` function, which takes two arguments: `mem[ix][j][k]` and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`. The initial values of `mem[ix][j][k]` and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` depend on their previous state, which is not provided here.

Since `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, and `j` is 3, we can infer that `a[i - 1]` is referencing the third element in `a`, but its value is not provided. This means we cannot determine the exact value of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`. 

Therefore, the output state must reflect the fact that `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated but remains dependent on previously unknown values. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 0, `j` is 3; `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the add function with previously unknown values.**
