According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the range defined by `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `j` is currently 1, and `m` is such that the loop can execute at least once more. 

To prepare for the next iteration of the loop, `j` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will be 2 for the next iteration. For the loop to execute again, `m` must be at least 2, since `j` is now 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 1, `k` is greater than or equal to `a[i - 1]` and less than or equal to `b`, `mem[ix][j][k]` contains the results of the updates performed during the loop iterations, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2**
