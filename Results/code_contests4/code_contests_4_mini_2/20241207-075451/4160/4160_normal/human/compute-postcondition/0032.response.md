The code assigns the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` to `mem[ix][j][k]`. The variable `ix` is currently 1, so `ix ^ 1` evaluates to 0. Therefore, `mem[0][j][k]` is being assigned to `mem[1][j][k]`. The values of `n`, `i`, `ans`, `ix`, `k`, and `j` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. The previous value of `mem[1][j][k]` is updated based on the value of `mem[0][j][k]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 1, `k` is greater than or equal to `a[i - 1]` and less than or equal to `b`, `j` is 2, and `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated to `mem[0][j][k]`.**
