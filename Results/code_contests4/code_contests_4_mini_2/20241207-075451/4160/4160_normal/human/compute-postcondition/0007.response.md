The variable `ix` is assigned the value of `i & 1`, which is the bitwise AND operation between `i` and `1`. Given that `i` is `1`, the operation evaluates to `1 & 1`, resulting in `ix` being `1`. The values of the other variables (`n` and `ans`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 1**
