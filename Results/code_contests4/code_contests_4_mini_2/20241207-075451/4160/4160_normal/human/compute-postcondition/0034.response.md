According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `k` starting from `a[i - 1]` up to `b`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, which means `a[i - 1]` refers to `a[0]`. The variable `k` is currently within the specified bounds, and `j` is 2. Since `mem[ix][j][k]` has already been updated, we need to determine the next state for the loop to execute one more time.

1. The current value of `k` is within the range `[a[i - 1], b + 1)`, and the next value of `k` will be `k + 1`.
2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must still be less than or equal to `b`.

Since `k` is currently less than or equal to `b`, we can increment `k` and still satisfy the loop condition.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 1, `k` is updated to be within the specified bounds for the loop to execute a second time, `j` is 2, and `mem[ix][j][k]` has been updated by adding `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`.**
