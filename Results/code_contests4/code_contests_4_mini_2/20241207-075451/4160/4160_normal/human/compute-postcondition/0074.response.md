The assignment updates the value of the 3D list `mem` at the position `[ix][j][k]` with the value from the position `[ix ^ 1][j][k]`. Here, `ix` is 0, `j` is 3, and `k` is in the range `[a[i - 1], b]`. The variable `ix ^ 1` evaluates to 1 since `ix` is 0. 

Thus, the value at `mem[0][3][k]` is copied to `mem[1][3][k]`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `ans`, `ix`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 0, `j` is 3, and mem[ix][j][k] is updated to mem[1][j][k]**.
