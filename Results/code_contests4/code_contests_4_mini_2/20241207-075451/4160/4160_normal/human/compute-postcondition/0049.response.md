The code assigns the value from `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` to `mem[ix][j][k]`. Since `ix` is 0, `ix ^ 1` evaluates to 1, meaning it retrieves the value from `mem[1][j][k]` and assigns it to `mem[0][j][k]`. The values of `n`, `i`, `ans`, and `j` remain unchanged. The state of `k` is not specified, nor is the structure of `mem`, so we cannot determine its specific values. Therefore, the output state is based on the execution of the assignment.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 0, `j` is 1; `mem[0][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[1][j][k]`.**
