The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`. The variable `ix` is currently 0, which means `ix ^ 1` will result in 1. The values of `j` and `k` are 2 and remain unchanged, and since `n` is greater than or equal to 2, it does not affect the assignment directly. The output state does not include changes to `n`, `i`, `ans`, or `k` as they remain unchanged and `mem` is updated based on the previous state of itself.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 0, `j` is 2, `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[1][j][k]`.**
