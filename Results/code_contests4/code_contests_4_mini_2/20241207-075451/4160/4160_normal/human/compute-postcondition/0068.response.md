The code assigns the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` to `mem[ix][j][k]`. The initial values of the affected variables are:
- `ix` is 0, so `ix ^ 1` is 1.
- `j` is 3.
- `k` is `a[2]` (which is not specified but is assumed to be less than or equal to `b` for the loop to execute).

The values of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value being assigned to `mem[ix][j][k]`. However, the states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Thus, the output state will reflect the unchanged values and the assignment of `mem[ix][j][k]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 0, `j` is 3, `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[1][3][k]`.**
