To determine the output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we can analyze the provided information and the loop's behavior.

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is 1
- `ans` is 0
- `ix` is 1
- For the loop to execute the first time, `m` is greater than or equal to 1
- `j` is 1

### Code of the Loop: 
```
for k in range(a[i - 1], b + 1):
    mem[ix][j][k] = mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]
    mem[ix][j][k] = add(mem[ix][j][k], mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]])
```

Given that the loop iterates from `a[i - 1]` to `b`, we can infer:
- If `a[i - 1]` is less than or equal to `b`, the loop will execute for all `k` in that range.
- The specific value of `k` will take on values from `a[i - 1]` to `b`.

### Output State after Loop Execution:
- After all iterations, `n` remains greater than 0, `i` remains 1, `ans` remains 0, and `ix` remains 1.
- The `mem[ix][j][k]` will have been updated for each `k` in the specified range, where each value will be the result of the computations performed in the loop.

Therefore, the final output state after all iterations of the loop will be:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 1; `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated for all `k` from `a[i - 1]` to `b` based on the values from `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`.**
