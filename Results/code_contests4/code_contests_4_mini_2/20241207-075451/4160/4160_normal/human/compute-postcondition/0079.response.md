`ix` is assigned the value of `i & 1`, which computes the bitwise AND of `i` (which is 3) and 1. The binary representation of 3 is `11`, and the binary representation of 1 is `01`. The result of `3 & 1` is `1`. The other variables (`n`, `ans`, `j`, and `mem`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 1, `j` is `m`, and `mem[ix][j][k]` contains the final cumulative updates for all `k` from `a[i - 1]` to `b`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 1, `j` is `m`, `mem[ix][j][k]` contains the final cumulative updates for all `k` from `a[i - 1]` to `b`.**
