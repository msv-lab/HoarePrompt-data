The code assigns the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` to `mem[ix][j][k]`. Since `ix` is 1, `ix ^ 1` will result in 0. Therefore, the expression simplifies to `mem[0][j][k]`. The values of `n`, `i`, `ans`, and `ix` do not change as the assignment only affects the `mem` array.

The output state remains unchanged for the variables `n`, `i`, `ans`, and `ix`, but the reference in the `mem` array is updated.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 1; mem[ix][j][k] is now assigned the value of mem[0][j][k].**
