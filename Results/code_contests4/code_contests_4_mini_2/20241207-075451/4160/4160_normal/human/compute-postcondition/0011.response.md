The variable `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value resulting from the addition of `mem[ix][j][k]` and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`. The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the values from the previous state of `mem` and the current index of `a`. Since the values of `mem`, `a`, and `j` are not defined in the initial state, we cannot specify exact values. However, we can state the operation that has taken place.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 1; `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on `add(mem[ix][j][k], mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]])`.**
