The code assigns the value from the previous state of the memory array `mem` to the current state based on the index `ix`, which is currently `0`. The expression `ix ^ 1` evaluates to `1`, meaning we are accessing `mem[1][j][k]`. The values of `j` and `k` are both `2` because `j` is `2` and `k` is `a[1]`, which is also `2` (as per the given conditions). Therefore, the value from `mem[1][2][2]` is assigned to `mem[0][2][2]`. 

The values of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `ans`, `ix`, `j`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 0, `j` is 2, `mem[0][2][2]` is set to `mem[1][2][2]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 0, `j` is 2, `mem[0][2][2]` is set to `mem[1][2][2]**
