The variable `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`. The value of `ix` is 1, so `ix ^ 1` will result in 0. Therefore, `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated to the value of `mem[0][2][k]`, where `k` is within specified bounds. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `ans`, `ix`, `j`, and `mem`) remain unchanged during this operation.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 1, `j` is 2, `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated to `mem[0][2][k]`**.
