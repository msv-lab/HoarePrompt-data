The code assigns a new value to `mem[ix][j][k]`, which involves adding the current value of `mem[ix][j][k]` to the value of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`. 

The variables that are directly affected are `mem[ix][j][k]` and potentially `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`, depending on the value of `a[i - 1]`. However, without the specific structure of the `mem` array and the value of `a[i - 1]`, we cannot determine the exact outcome.

Since the initial state indicates that `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, and `j` is 2, we can infer that:
- `ix` is 0, so we are referencing `mem[0][2][k]`.
- `j - 1` results in 1, so we are referencing `mem[0][1][k - a[2]]`.

The exact value of `k` and the content of the array `a` are unknown, but the operation is clear. The output state will indicate that `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the addition operation.

Output State: **`mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the addition of `mem[ix][j][k]` and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`, where `ix` is 0, `j` is 2, and `i` is 3.**
