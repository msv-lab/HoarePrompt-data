According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute for each value of `j` from 1 to `m`, inclusive. Given that `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and that `i` is already set to 3, these states are not directly related to the execution of the loop. The crucial factor is the value of `m`. 

Since the loop starts at 1 and continues to `m`, for the loop to execute at least once, `m` must be at least 1. The value of `j` will start at 1 when the loop begins.

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `m` is greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 1, `j` is 1 (the first iteration), `mem[ix][j][k]` contains the final cumulative updates for all `k` from `a[i - 1]` to `b`, for the loop to execute `m` is greater than or equal to 1**
