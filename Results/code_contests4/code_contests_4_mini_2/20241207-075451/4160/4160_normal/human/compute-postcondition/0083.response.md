The code updates the value of `mem[ix][j][k]` by adding to it the value of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`. 

We know:
- `ix` is 1
- `j` is 1
- `k` is `a[2]`
- `i` is 3, which means `a[i - 1]` is `a[2]`

Since `a[2]` is used to calculate the index for `mem`, it means we are adding the value of `mem[1][0][k]` to `mem[1][1][k]`. 

The previous values of `mem[ix][j][k]` and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` affect the result, but since the specific values of `mem` and `a` are not given, we will represent the result in terms of the variables.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is `a[2]`, `mem[1][1][k]` is updated to `add(mem[1][1][k], mem[1][0][k - a[2]])`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is `a[2]`, `mem[1][1][k]` is updated to `add(mem[1][1][k], mem[1][0][k - a[2]])`.**
