The code `mem[ix][j][k] = mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` assigns the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` to `mem[ix][j][k]`. The variable `ix` is currently 0, and `ix ^ 1` evaluates to 1 (XOR operation). Therefore, the code is accessing the value of `mem[1][j][k]` and assigning it to `mem[0][j][k]`. 

The values of `n`, `i`, `ans`, and `j` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. We don't have specific values for `mem` or the indices `j` and `k`, but we do have the information that the state of `mem` will change at the specified indices.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 0, `j` is 1; `mem[0][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[1][j][k]`**.
