According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit defined by `m`. Since `j` is currently 2 and the loop runs for `j` in the range from 1 to `m + 1`, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Thus, `j` will be 3 for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 0, `j` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `m` must be greater than or equal to 3.**
