In this code snippet, a lambda function named `add` is defined, which takes two arguments `a` and `b`. The function computes the sum of `a` and `b`, and takes the result modulo `mod`. The initial state specifies that `n`, `m`, `b` are integers within certain ranges, `mod` is a positive integer, and `a` is a list of non-negative integers. 

However, since the lambda function is defined but not called, the values of the variables `n`, `m`, `b`, `mod`, and the list `a` remain unchanged. Thus, the output state reflects that the lambda function `add` has been created, but no calculations have been made yet.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 500, 0 ≤ `b` ≤ 500; `mod` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `mod` ≤ 10^9 + 7; `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers where each element `a[i]` satisfies 0 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 500; `add` is a lambda function defined as `lambda a, b: (a + b) % mod`**.
