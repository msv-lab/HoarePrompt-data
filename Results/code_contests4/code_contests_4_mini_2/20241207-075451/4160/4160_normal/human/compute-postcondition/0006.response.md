According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Additionally, the variable `i` will start at 1 for the first iteration of the loop. The state of `ans` does not affect the execution condition of the loop, but it will be initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to confirm that `n` is greater than 0, and for the first iteration, `i` should be 1.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `ans` is 0**
