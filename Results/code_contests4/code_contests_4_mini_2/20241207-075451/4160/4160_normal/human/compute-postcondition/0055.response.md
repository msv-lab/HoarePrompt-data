To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the current state and the implications of the loop.

1. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. The loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `m`, inclusive.
2. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to increment by 1.
3. Therefore, the next value of `j` will be 2.
4. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. Given that `n` is greater than or equal to 2, we can assume `m` is at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time.

Now we need to adjust the state accordingly:

- `ans` remains unchanged as the loop body has been omitted.
- `ix` and `k` remain unchanged as there is no indication they are modified in the loop.
- The value of `j` increments from 1 to 2.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 0, `j` is 2; `mem[ix][j][k]` contains the result of cumulative updates for all `k` from `a[i - 1]` to `b`.**
