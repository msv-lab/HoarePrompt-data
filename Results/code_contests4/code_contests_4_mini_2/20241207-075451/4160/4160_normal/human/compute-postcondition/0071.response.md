The code assigns the value from `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` to `mem[ix][j][k]`. The value of `ix ^ 1` depends on the value of `ix`, and since `ix` is 0, `ix ^ 1` evaluates to 1. Therefore, the code accesses `mem[1][j][k]` and assigns its value to `mem[0][j][k]` (since `ix` is 0).

The variables `n`, `i`, `ans`, `ix`, `j`, and any other variables like `k` are not changed by this assignment, and we do not know the specific values of `mem[1][j][k]` or `mem[0][j][k]` as they depend on the state of the `mem` array.

Thus, the output state reflects that `mem[0][j][k]` is updated based on the value of `mem[1][j][k]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 0, `j` is 3; `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`.**
