The value of `ix` is assigned the result of `i & 1`, which performs a bitwise AND operation between `i` and `1`. The current value of `i` is `2`. In binary, `2` is represented as `10` and `1` is represented as `01`. The bitwise AND operation results in `0`, so `ix` will be updated to `0`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 0; `mem[ix][j][k]` contains the results of updates for all `j` from 1 to `m` and for all `k` from `a[i - 1]` to `b`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 0; `mem[ix][j][k]` contains the results of updates for all `j` from 1 to `m` and for all `k` from `a[i - 1]` to `b`**.
