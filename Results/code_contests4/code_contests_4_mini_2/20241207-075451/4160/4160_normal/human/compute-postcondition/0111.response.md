To analyze the provided code snippet, let's break down the state of the variables and the effect of the code.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 2
   - `i` is 3
   - `ans` is 0
   - `ix` is 1
   - `j` is 3
   - `k` is `a[2] + 1` (the value of `a[2]` is not given, so `k` will be dependent on that)
   - `mem[1][j][k]` is assigned the value from `mem[0][j][k]` (this operation does not change any variable values, just sets `mem[1][j][k]` to whatever `mem[0][j][k]` is)

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The code executes the line:
     ```
     mem[ix][j][k] = add(mem[ix][j][k], mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]])
     ```
   - Here, `ix` is 1, `j` is 3, and `k` is `a[2] + 1`.
   - The function `add` is called with two parameters:
     - `mem[ix][j][k]` which is `mem[1][3][k]`
     - `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` which translates to `mem[1][2][k - a[2]]` (since `i` is 3, `i - 1` is 2).

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - The value of `mem[1][3][k]` will change based on the result of the `add` function, which combines the current value of `mem[1][3][k]` with the value from `mem[1][2][k - a[2]]`.
   - It is important to note that without knowing the specific values in the `mem` array or the output of the `add` function, we cannot determine an exact numerical result for `mem[1][3][k]`.

4. **Output State**:
   - Since we don't know the values contained in `mem` or the return value of `add`, we can summarize the operation as affecting `mem[1][3][k]` but cannot give specific numerical results.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 1, `j` is 3, `k` is `a[2] + 1`, and `mem[1][3][k]` is updated based on the result of `add(mem[1][3][k], mem[1][2][k - a[2]])`.**
