According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k`, `a[i - 1]`, and `b`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `b`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 0, so `a[i - 1]` corresponds to `a[0]`. The value of `k` for the last iteration is currently equal to `a[i - 1]`, which means that in the next iteration, `k` will be incremented by 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be less than or equal to `b`. Therefore, we need to set `k` to `a[i - 1] + 1`, and `mem[ix][j][k]` will be updated based on the new value of `k`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 1; for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be greater than or equal to `a[i - 1] + 1` and less than or equal to `b.**
