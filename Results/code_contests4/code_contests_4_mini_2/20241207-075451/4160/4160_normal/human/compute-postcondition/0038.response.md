The line of code `mem[ix][j][k] = mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` assigns the value from `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` to `mem[ix][j][k]`. The variable `ix` is currently 1, so `ix ^ 1` will result in 0. The indices `j` and `k` have the values 2 and `a[i - 1] + 1`, respectively. 

Since the values of `mem` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact value being assigned to `mem[ix][j][k]`. However, we know that `mem[ix][j][k]` will now hold the same value as `mem[0][2][k]`.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `ans`, `ix`, `j`, `k`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is `a[i - 1] + 1`, and `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[0][j][k]`.**
