To analyze the execution of the provided code snippet, we first break down the components involved:

- The initial state indicates that `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 1, `j` is 2, and `k` is `a[2]`. 
- The expression `mem[ix][j][k] = add(mem[ix][j][k], mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]])` will modify the value at `mem[ix][j][k]`.

Now we need to determine the values utilized in the computation:

1. `mem[ix][j][k]` refers to the current value at index `[1][2][k]` in the `mem` array.
2. `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` translates to `mem[1][1][k - a[2]]` since `i` is 3, and `i - 1` results in 2.
3. The function `add` takes the current value of `mem[ix][j][k]` and adds it to the value at `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`.

The new value of `mem[ix][j][k]` will be computed based on these references, but since we do not have specific values for `mem` or `a`, we can't provide the exact numeric result. However, the operation is defined and will alter `mem[ix][j][k]` based on the addition of two values.

Since the variables `n`, `i`, `ans`, `ix`, `j`, and `k` are not directly modified by this operation, they will retain their previous values.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is `a[2]`, and `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated by adding `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` to it.**
