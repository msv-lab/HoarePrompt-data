The variable `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`. The value of `ix` is 0, so `ix ^ 1` will yield 1. The variable `j` is 2, and the value of `k` is not specified in the initial state but must be within the bounds defined by `a[2]` and `b` for the loop's execution. Therefore, the value assigned to `mem[0][2][k]` will depend on the value in `mem[1][2][k]`.

Since the values of `mem` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `mem[ix][j][k]`. However, the state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the assignment operation.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 0, `j` is 2; `mem[0][2][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[1][2][k]`.**
