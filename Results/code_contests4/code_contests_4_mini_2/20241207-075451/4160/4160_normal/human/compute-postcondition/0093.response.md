The statement assigns the value from `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` to `mem[ix][j][k]`. The variables `ix`, `j`, and `k` have the following values: `ix` is 1, `j` is 2, and `k` is `b`. The value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` translates to `mem[0][2][b]`. The state of `mem[ix][j][k]` will change based on this assignment, but the other variables remain unaffected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is `b`, and `mem[ix][j][k]` is now assigned the value of `mem[0][2][b]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, `ans` is 0, `ix` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is `b`, and `mem[ix][j][k]` is now assigned the value of `mem[0][2][b]`.**
