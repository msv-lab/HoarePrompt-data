Output State: **`n`, `m`, `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 500, 0 ≤ `b` ≤ 500; `mod` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `mod` ≤ 10^9 + 7; `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers where each element `a[i]` satisfies 0 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 500; `add` is a lambda function defined as `lambda a, b: (a + b) % mod`; `mult` is a lambda function defined as `lambda a, b: a % mod * (b % mod) % mod`.**
