To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the implementation against the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. We have `n` colliders, each represented by a natural number from 1 to `n`.
2. We must handle activation and deactivation requests for these colliders.
3. The activation of a collider should succeed only if it is not in conflict with any currently activated colliders (i.e., they must be pairwise relatively prime).
4. Responses must vary based on whether the collider was already on, already off, or if there is a conflict.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Initialization**: The program initializes an array `prim` for storing prime factors and `mem` for tracking activated colliders based on their prime factors.
2. **Request Processing**: The program reads requests and processes activation or deactivation:
   - For activation (`+ i`), it checks if the collider is already on and if not, whether it conflicts with any already activated collider.
   - For deactivation (`- i`), it checks if the collider is already off and updates the state accordingly.

### Potential Issues:
1. The program uses a prime factorization approach to determine conflicts, but it doesn't seem to properly handle the case where multiple colliders activated could potentially conflict. For example, if colliders 4 and 6 are activated, the program may not correctly identify that activating 4 after 6 (or vice versa) should fail due to their shared factor of 2.

2. The handling of the `mem` structure (which is a set) might lead to incorrect behavior when discarding colliders, especially if multiple conflicting colliders are present.

### Example Case:
Consider the following scenario:
- **Input**:
```
3 4
+ 2
+ 4
+ 3
+ 6
```
- **Expected Behavior**:
  - Activate 2: Success
  - Activate 4: Conflict with 2 (since both share 2 as a factor)
  - Activate 3: Success
  - Activate 6: Conflict with 2 (since both share 2 as a factor)

- **Actual Behavior**: The program may not correctly identify the conflict between 6 and 2 or 4 since it does not adequately track the relationships between activated colliders.

### Conclusion:
Considering the potential cases and the failure to handle conflicts accurately between activated colliders, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description consistently.

Correctness: **False**.
