Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the case where an activation request for a collider might conflict with multiple active colliders. Specifically, the logic only checks for conflicts with the last collider that is active. According to the problem description, if there is a conflict with multiple colliders, it should print the number of any of them. However, the code attempts to add the new collider to the set of active colliders even if a conflict is found, which is incorrect.

For example, consider the following scenario:

Input:
```
3 3
+ 2
+ 4
+ 6
```

Expected Output:
```
Success
Success
Conflict with 2
```

In this case, activating collider 6 should cause a conflict with both colliders 2 and 4 (since they are not relatively prime to 6), but the program may not correctly identify that and could potentially just return "Conflict with 4" or "Conflict with 2", which does not satisfy the requirement of indicating a conflict with any of the colliders. 

This indicates that the program does not handle the edge case where multiple collisions could occur, leading to an incorrect implementation. Therefore, the correctness of the program is false.
