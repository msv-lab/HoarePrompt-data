You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those output hints describes certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: By 2312 there were n Large Hadron Colliders in the inhabited part of the universe. Each of them corresponded to a single natural number from 1 to n. However, scientists did not know what activating several colliders simultaneously could cause, so the colliders were deactivated.

In 2312 there was a startling discovery: a collider's activity is safe if and only if all numbers of activated colliders are pairwise relatively prime to each other (two numbers are relatively prime if their greatest common divisor equals 1)! If two colliders with relatively nonprime numbers are activated, it will cause a global collapse.

Upon learning this, physicists rushed to turn the colliders on and off and carry out all sorts of experiments. To make sure than the scientists' quickness doesn't end with big trouble, the Large Hadron Colliders' Large Remote Control was created. You are commissioned to write the software for the remote (well, you do not expect anybody to operate it manually, do you?).

Initially, all colliders are deactivated. Your program receives multiple requests of the form "activate/deactivate the i-th collider". The program should handle requests in the order of receiving them. The program should print the processed results in the format described below.

To the request of "+ i" (that is, to activate the i-th collider), the program should print exactly one of the following responses: 

  * "Success" if the activation was successful. 
  * "Already on", if the i-th collider was already activated before the request. 
  * "Conflict with j", if there is a conflict with the j-th collider (that is, the j-th collider is on, and numbers i and j are not relatively prime). In this case, the i-th collider shouldn't be activated. If a conflict occurs with several colliders simultaneously, you should print the number of any of them. 



The request of "- i" (that is, to deactivate the i-th collider), should receive one of the following responses from the program: 

  * "Success", if the deactivation was successful. 
  * "Already off", if the i-th collider was already deactivated before the request. 



You don't need to print quotes in the output of the responses to the requests.

Input

The first line contains two space-separated integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105) — the number of colliders and the number of requests, correspondingly.

Next m lines contain numbers of requests, one per line, in the form of either "+ i" (without the quotes) — activate the i-th collider, or "- i" (without the quotes) — deactivate the i-th collider (1 ≤ i ≤ n).

Output

Print m lines — the results of executing requests in the above given format. The requests should be processed in the order, in which they are given in the input. Don't forget that the responses to the requests should be printed without quotes.

Examples

Input

10 10
+ 6
+ 10
+ 5
- 10
- 5
- 6
+ 10
+ 3
+ 6
+ 3


Output

Success
Conflict with 6
Success
Already off
Success
Success
Success
Success
Conflict with 10
Already on

Note

Note that in the sample the colliders don't turn on after the second and ninth requests. The ninth request could also receive response "Conflict with 3".
Functions with output description for each function:
Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(n):
    prim[1] = 1

 Output decription for function1:  The function accepts a natural number `n`, identifies the smallest prime factors for all numbers less than `n`, and marks them in an array `prim`, but it does not process any requests to activate or deactivate colliders and does not return a value.

''' 

 Output decription for function2:  The function accepts a list of tuples `x`, where each tuple contains a request and an integer. It computes and returns the list of prime factors of the first integer found in the first tuple of the list. However, the function does not handle cases where `x` is an empty list or if the integer in the first tuple is less than 2, which could lead to incorrect behavior or errors. Additionally, the function relies on an external variable `prim` that is not defined within the provided code context, which may cause a runtime error. Therefore, the functionality is limited to returning prime factors of the first integer in the first tuple, given that integer is 2 or greater.



First I want you to try to see if the program (including all the functions) does what the description says. Look at only the code and the description and make an initial assesment.Try to think of any edge cases that the code might not be handling.

Then I want you to see if the output hints agree with the code. Sometimes the output hints hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the output hints says are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to make a more informed decision and detrmine if the code is correct or not.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code.
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
