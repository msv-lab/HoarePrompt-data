To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description and the output hints, let's analyze the functions and their functionalities step by step.

### Problem Description Recap
The program is required to manage activations and deactivations of colliders while ensuring that activated colliders' numbers are pairwise relatively prime. The program needs to handle requests to activate ("+ i") and deactivate ("- i") colliders, responding appropriately based on their state and conflicts.

### Function Analysis
#### Function 1
```python
def func_1(n):
    prim[1] = 1
    for i in range(2, n):
        if not prim[i]:
            for j in range(i, n, i):
                prim[j] = i
```
- **Purpose**: This function initializes an array `prim` that tracks the smallest prime factor for numbers from `1` to `n`.
- **Limitation**: It does not handle any requests related to the activation or deactivation of colliders. It also does not return a value, which means it only sets up the environment but does not fulfill the task.

#### Function 2
```python
def func_2(x):
    fac = []
    while x > 1:
        div = prim[x]
        fac.append(div)
        while x % div == 0:
            x //= div
    return fac
```
- **Purpose**: This function returns the prime factors of the number `x`.
- **Limitation**: It does not handle cases where `x` is less than `2` or if `x` is `1`, which can lead to incorrect behavior or errors. There is also reliance on the external variable `prim`, which could be undefined if `func_1` didn't execute properly.

### Main Processing Logic
The main part of the code processes the requests:
1. If the request is to deactivate, it checks if the collider is already off.
2. If the request is to activate, it checks for conflicts with already active colliders based on their prime factors.

### Edge Cases and Potential Issues
- When trying to activate a collider `1`, the logic for conflicts does not account for prime factors, as `1` is not considered a prime and does not contribute to conflicts in the expected way.
- If a request is made to activate or deactivate a collider that does not exist (greater than `n`), the program does not seem to handle such out-of-bound requests.
- The function `func_2` does not account for `x < 2`, which can lead to incorrect behavior.

### Output Hints Analysis
The output hints suggest that:
- The program must manage successful activations, conflicts, and checks for already activated or deactivated states.
- The hints mention that if a conflict occurs with several colliders, only one needs to be reported, which aligns with the code's intent.

### Conclusion
While the program attempts to follow the problem description, it fails in handling certain edge cases, particularly the activation of collider `1` and managing requests for numbers outside the valid range of colliders. Additionally, the lack of checks in `func_2` for numbers less than `2` can lead to runtime errors. Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements in every potential case.

Correctness: **False**. 

### Example of Incorrect Behavior
For instance, if a request "+ 1" is made, the program does not handle it properly since `1` is not relatively prime with any other number (in terms of its contribution to the activation logic), and there is no specific handling for this case in the provided code.
