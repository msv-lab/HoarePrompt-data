To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the given functions and their annotations against the requirements stated.

### Problem Description Summary
The program is required to handle activation and deactivation requests for colliders, ensuring that:
1. An activation is successful only if all activated colliders are pairwise relatively prime.
2. If a collider is already activated or deactivated, it should return the appropriate message.
3. If there's a conflict with another activated collider, it should indicate that.

### Analysis of Provided Functions
1. **Function 1**: 
   - This function computes the smallest prime factors for numbers from 2 to n and stores them in an array `prim`.
   - However, this function does not process any requests nor does it return any results related to the activation/deactivation of colliders. It essentially prepares the `prim` array but does not fulfill any part of the requirement to handle requests.

2. **Function 2**: 
   - This function is designed to compute the prime factors of the first integer in the first tuple of a list of requests.
   - It does not check or handle the activation/deactivation logic or any potential conflicts as described. It only returns the prime factors of the first number in a request tuple and relies on an external variable `prim`, which is not guaranteed to be defined in the context where this function is called.

### Issues Identified
- Neither function implements the logic needed to handle activation (`+ i`) and deactivation (`- i`) requests properly.
- The logic to check for conflicts (i.e., whether two colliders are relatively prime) is not present.
- There are no checks for the state of colliders (whether they are "on" or "off") and no mechanisms for handling multiple requests in the described format.
- The annotations for the functions suggest they do not adequately cover the problem requirements, particularly with respect to managing the state of colliders and responding correctly to requests.

### Conclusion
Given that the functions do not process requests or handle the necessary logic for activation/deactivation and conflict checking, the program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. 

Therefore, there are significant gaps in the implementation that would lead to incorrect behavior for many input scenarios.

Correctness: **False**
