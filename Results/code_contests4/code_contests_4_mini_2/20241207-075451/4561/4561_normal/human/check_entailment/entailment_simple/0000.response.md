Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here are the reasons why:

1. **Incomplete Implementation**: The program consists of two functions (`func_1` and `func_2`), but it does not include the main logic to process the requests for activating and deactivating colliders. The problem description specifies that the program needs to handle requests in a specific format and produce specific outputs based on the state of the colliders, but this functionality is not present in the provided code.

2. **Lack of State Management**: There is no mechanism in place to track the activation state of the colliders (which colliders are currently activated or deactivated). The problem description requires managing the state of each collider to determine if an activation request is successful, if a collider is already activated, or if there is a conflict with another collider. The provided code does not maintain this state.

3. **Prime Factorization Logic**: The `func_2` function appears to be designed to factor a number into its prime components, but it does not relate to the core requirement of checking pairwise relative primality among activated colliders. The logic that would determine if two numbers are relatively prime is not implemented.

4. **Output Handling**: The program does not produce any output as required by the problem description. The response strings ("Success", "Already on", "Conflict with j", etc.) are not generated or printed in response to the requests.

In summary, the program lacks the necessary logic to handle activations and deactivations of the colliders according to the rules defined in the problem description. It does not maintain state, does not check for conflicts, and does not produce the required output. Therefore, it does not fulfill the requirements, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
