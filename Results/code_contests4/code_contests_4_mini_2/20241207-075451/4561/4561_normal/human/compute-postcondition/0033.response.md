The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `x`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains a string representing a request ("+" or "-") and an integer `i` such that `1 <= i <= n`, where `n` is a natural number representing the number of colliders. After executing the function body, the program returns the list of prime factors contained in 'fac' of the first element of the first tuple. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a list of tuples and return the list of prime factors based on the specified criteria from the first tuple. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of tuples `x`, where each tuple contains a request and an integer. It returns the list of prime factors of 'fac' based on the first element of the first tuple.**
