In the provided code, the condition for the `while` loop is `x > 1`. The variable `x` is stated to be a list of tuples. In Python, a list is considered greater than another list if it has more elements (i.e., its length is greater than that of the other list). Therefore, for the loop to execute, the length of the list `x` must be greater than 1.

Right before the loop, we need to ensure that the list `x` contains more than one tuple. If `x` is an empty list or a list with only one tuple, the loop will not execute.

To ensure the loop can execute at least once, `x` must be modified to contain at least two tuples. The variable `fac` being an empty list does not affect the execution of the loop in this case.

State: **`x` is a list of tuples with at least 2 elements, `fac` is an empty list**
