The code attempts to access an element in the list `prim` using `x` as the index. Since `x` is a list of tuples, the value of `x` cannot be directly used as an index unless it is an integer. This will likely raise an error due to the incorrect type being used as an index. The values of `fac` and other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is a list of tuples with at least 2 elements, `fac` is an empty list, and an error occurs due to using a list as an index.**
