#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a natural number representing the number of colliders, and the requests to activate or deactivate colliders are formatted as "+ i" or "- i", where 1 <= i <= n.
def func_1(n):
    prim[1] = 1
    for i in range(2, n):
        if not prim[i]:
            for j in range(i, n, i):
                prim[j] = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `prim[1]` is 1, `prim[2]` is 2, `prim[3]` is 3, ..., `prim[n-1]` is either 0 or a prime number less than `n`, depending on whether `prim[i]` was false for the respective indices, and `n` is a positive integer greater than 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a natural number `n`, identifies the smallest prime factors for all numbers less than `n`, and marks them in an array `prim`, but it does not process any requests to activate or deactivate colliders and does not return a value.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a string representing a request ("+" or "-") and an integer i such that 1 <= i <= n, where n is a natural number representing the number of colliders.
def func_2(x):
    fac = []
    while x > 1:
        div = prim[x]
        
        fac.append(div)
        
        while x % div == 0:
            x //= div
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is 1, `fac` contains all the prime factors of the first element of the first tuple, and `div` is the last prime factor used to divide `x`.
    return fac
    #The program returns the list of prime factors contained in 'fac' of the first element of the first tuple.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of tuples `x`, where each tuple contains a request and an integer. It computes and returns the list of prime factors of the first integer found in the first tuple of the list. However, the function does not handle cases where `x` is an empty list or if the integer in the first tuple is less than 2, which could lead to incorrect behavior or errors. Additionally, the function relies on an external variable `prim` that is not defined within the provided code context, which may cause a runtime error. Therefore, the functionality is limited to returning prime factors of the first integer in the first tuple, given that integer is 2 or greater.
