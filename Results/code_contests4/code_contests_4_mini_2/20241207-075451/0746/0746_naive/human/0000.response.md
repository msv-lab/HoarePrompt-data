To analyze the given program based on the problem description, we need to ensure that the program correctly counts the occurrences of a compressed string `s` in another compressed string `t`.

Let's break down the provided code and see if it meets the requirements thoroughly, especially for edge cases.

1. **Function `func_1(ar)`**: This function takes a list of compressed string parts and converts them into a list of pairs representing the length and character. It seems correct as it aggregates the lengths of consecutive equal characters.

2. **Function `func_2(t, s, c)`**: This function is supposed to count occurrences of `s` in `t`. It handles cases based on the length of `s`:
   - For a single block in `s`, it checks each block in `t` for match criteria.
   - For two blocks, it checks adjacent blocks in `t` for matches.
   - For longer strings, it implements a pattern matching approach using a prefix array to find occurrences.

3. **Edge Cases**: 
   - The program primarily focuses on matching blocks based on their characters and their lengths.
   - However, it does not seem to explicitly handle the case where `s` might not fit into `t` due to length mismatches in its blocks. For instance, if `s` has a block of length greater than what exists in `t` for the same character, it should not count as a valid occurrence.
   - The logic for counting occurrences may not properly account for non-contiguous blocks of characters in `t` that could lead to false positives.

### Example Case:
- Let's consider an input case where `t` has blocks that do not allow for a complete match with `s`:
   ```
   t = "1-a 1-b 1-c" (which represents "abc")
   s = "2-a 1-b" (which represents "aab")
   ```
   In this case, `s` cannot occur in `t`, but the way the program is structured might lead to incorrect counting, especially if it does not correctly enforce that the lengths of the blocks in `s` are fully matched by those in `t`.

### Conclusion:
Given the potential issues with edge cases, especially with how the lengths and characters are matched, the program may not always behave correctly. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
