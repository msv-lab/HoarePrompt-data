To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze it against the problem description and consider various scenarios.

The problem requires us to count the occurrences of a compressed string `s` within another compressed string `t`. The compressed strings consist of blocks of characters, each described by their length and the character itself. The program consists of multiple functions to handle this logic, primarily `func_1` for decompression and `func_2` for counting occurrences.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Decompression Logic (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list of strings representing the compressed format (e.g., "3-a").
   - It correctly constructs a list of [length, character] pairs, merging consecutive identical characters.
   - This part of the program seems correct.

2. **Counting Occurrences (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` handles the logic for counting how many times `s` appears in `t`.
   - It has special cases for when the length of `s` is 1 or 2, which are straightforward checks.
   - For longer strings, it constructs a combined list `v` and uses a prefix function (similar to KMP algorithm) to find matches.
   - The final matching logic checks if the prefix function indicates an occurrence and verifies the character conditions.

### Potential Problem Cases:
To assess the correctness of the program, we need to consider edge cases or scenarios where it might fail:

- **Different Lengths with Non-matching Characters**:
  Consider the compressed strings:
  ```
  t = "1-a 1-b"
  s = "1-a 1-c"
  ```
  In this case, even though `s` is of the same length as some segments in `t`, it should not count as an occurrence because 'c' does not match 'b'. We need to see if the program correctly identifies that no occurrences should be counted.

- **Overlapping Blocks**:
  Suppose we have:
  ```
  t = "3-a 3-b"
  s = "3-a 1-b"
  ```
  The expected output should be `1`, as `s` can occur in the segment of `t` starting from the first block of 'a' followed by 'b'. The program must ensure it counts this correctly.

- **Large Inputs**:
  Given the constraints, if we have maximum limits:
  ```
  t = "1000000-a" * 200000 (which is impractical but hypothetically)
  s = "1000000-a" 
  ```
  The output should be `200000`. We need to verify if the program can handle such inputs without performance issues or errors.

### Conclusion:
After considering the potential edge cases, we can conclude that while the program seems to handle many cases correctly, the logic for counting occurrences in `func_2` may not accurately handle cases where the character blocks overlap or mismatch, potentially leading to incorrect counts.

Thus, I can find cases where the program will not work as expected.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to correctly count occurrences in certain scenarios, especially with overlapping character blocks or mismatched characters in the context of the problem's requirements.
