#State of the program right berfore the function call: ar is a list of strings where each string is in the format "li-ci" representing the lengths of character blocks and their corresponding lowercase English letters, and the list contains two sets of such strings: the first set describes the string t and the second set describes the string s.
def func_1(ar):
    p = []
    for i in ar:
        x = int(i.split('-')[0])

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `p` is a list of pairs where each pair contains the total length of character blocks and the corresponding lowercase English letter, and `ar` remains a list of strings in the format "li-ci".
    return p
    #The program returns the list of pairs 'p' containing the total length of character blocks and the corresponding lowercase English letters.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of strings `ar`, where each string is formatted as "li-ci" (representing the length of a character block and its corresponding lowercase English letter). It processes the list to return a new list of pairs, where each pair contains the total length of contiguous character blocks and the corresponding letter. If multiple blocks of the same letter are adjacent, their lengths are summed together. The function does not handle cases where the input list is empty, but it will return an empty list in such scenarios without error.

        return ans

    return ans
    #The program returns the total count of conditions met stored in 'ans'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two lists of tuples `t` and `s`, and a function `c`. It returns the sum of values calculated from the first element of tuples in `t` for each element when `s` has length 1. If `s` has length 2, it returns the count of adjacent pairs in `t` that satisfy specific conditions. If `s` has a length of at least 4, it processes a modified list and returns the total count of conditions met based on comparisons using `c`. Edge cases include ensuring that the lengths of `s` are properly handled, and the code does not account for cases where `s` has a length less than 1 or more than 2 without returning a specific output.
