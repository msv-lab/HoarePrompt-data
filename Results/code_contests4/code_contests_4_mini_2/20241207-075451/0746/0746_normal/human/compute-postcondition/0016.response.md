According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `t`. The loop will execute if `len(t) - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, which means `len(t)` must be at least 1. 

Given that the length of `s` is not equal to 1 and is equal to 2, we do not have any information about `t`. However, we need to ensure that `len(t)` is at least 1 for the loop to execute. 

Thus, we need to adjust the states as follows: `len(t)` must be at least 1, and `i` starts from 0 for the first iteration of the loop.

State: **`ans` is 0, the length of `s` is not equal to 1, the length of `s` is equal to 2, for the loop to execute the first time `len(t)` must be at least 1, and `i` is 0**
