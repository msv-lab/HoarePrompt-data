Postcondition: ***`ans` is 1, the length of `s` is not equal to 1, the length of `s` is equal to 2, for the loop to execute the first time `len(t)` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, and the values of `t[i]` and `t[i + 1]` are equal to `s[0]` and `s[1]` respectively, if the condition `c(t[i], s[0]) and c(t[i + 1], s[1])` holds true.***
