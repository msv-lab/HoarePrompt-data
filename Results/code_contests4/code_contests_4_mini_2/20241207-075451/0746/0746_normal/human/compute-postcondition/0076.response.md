The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `ans` is 1, after execution, `ans` becomes 2. The values of the other variables `i` and `v` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is 2, `i` is 1, `v` is a list with at least 2 elements.

Output State: **`ans` is 2, `i` is 1, `v` is a list with at least 2 elements**
