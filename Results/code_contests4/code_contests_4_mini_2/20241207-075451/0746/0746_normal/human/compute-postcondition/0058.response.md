The variable `j` is assigned the value of `p[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 3, we can calculate `i - 1` which equals 2. Therefore, `j` is assigned the value of `p[2]`. The other variables (`ans`, `s`, `v`, and `i`) remain unaffected. 

Since `p` is a list with at least 4 elements, `p[2]` is a valid access. 

Output State: **`ans` is 0, `s` has a length of at least 4, `v` is a list with at least 4 elements, `i` is 3, `j` is assigned the value of `p[2]**.
