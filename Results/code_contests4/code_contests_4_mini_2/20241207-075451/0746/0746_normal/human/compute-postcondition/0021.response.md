`ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` is 1, so after execution, the value of `ans` becomes 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is 2, the length of `s` is not equal to 1, the length of `s` is equal to 2, for the loop to execute a second time `len(t)` must be at least 2, `i` is 1, and the values of `t[i]` and `t[i + 1]` are equal to `s[0]` and `s[1]` respectively.
