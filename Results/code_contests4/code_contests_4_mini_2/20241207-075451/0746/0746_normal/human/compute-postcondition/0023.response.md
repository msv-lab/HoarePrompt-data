According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the length of `t`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `len(t) - 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, the length of `s` is equal to 2, and `t[i]` is equal to `s[0]`, while `t[i + 1]` is equal to `s[1]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1, making `i` equal to 2. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, the length of `t` must be at least 3 (since `len(t) - 1` must be greater than `i`).

State: **`ans` is 1, the length of `s` is not equal to 1, the length of `s` is equal to 2, for the loop to execute a third time `len(t)` must be at least 3, `i` is 2, and the values of `t[i]` and `t[i + 1]` must be equal to `s[0]` and `s[1]` respectively.**
