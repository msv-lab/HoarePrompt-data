The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `t`, `s`, and `c`. The parameters `t` and `s` are lists of tuples where each tuple contains a positive integer and a lowercase English letter. The parameter `c` is a positive integer representing the number of blocks in the string `t`. 

After executing the function body, the function has three cases for its return values:
- Case 1: It returns the sum of all values `i[0] - s[0][0] + 1` for each element `i` in `t` where the condition `c(i, s[0])` is true.
- Case 2: It returns the count of pairs in `t` that satisfy the condition `c(t[i], s[0]) and c(t[i + 1], s[1])`.
- Case 3: It returns the total count of conditions met stored in 'ans'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept lists of tuples `t` and `s`, along with a positive integer `c`, and return different values based on the conditions specified in the three cases. 

Functionality: **The function accepts lists of tuples `t` and `s`, and a positive integer `c`. It returns the sum based on a condition in Case 1, the count of pairs in Case 2, or the total count of conditions met in Case 3.**
