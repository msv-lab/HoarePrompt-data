`ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` is 2, so after execution, `ans` becomes 3. The values of `i` and `v` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is 3, `i` is 2, `v` is a list containing at least 3 elements.

Output State: **`ans` is 3, `i` is 2, `v` is a list containing at least 3 elements**
