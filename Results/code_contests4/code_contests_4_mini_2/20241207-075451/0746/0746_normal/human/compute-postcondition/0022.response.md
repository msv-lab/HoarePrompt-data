Postcondition: ***`ans` is 1, the length of `s` is not equal to 1, the length of `s` is equal to 2, for the loop to execute a second time `len(t)` must be at least 2, `i` is 1, and the values of `t[i]` and `t[i + 1]` are equal to `s[0]` and `s[1]` respectively. If `c(t[i], s[0])` and `c(t[i + 1], s[1])` are true, then `ans` is updated to 2.***
