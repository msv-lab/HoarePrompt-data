`ans` is incremented by 1, so it changes from 1 to 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is 2, the length of `s` is not equal to 1, the length of `s` is equal to 2, for the loop to execute a third time `len(t)` must be at least 3, `i` is 2, and the values of `t[i]` and `t[i + 1]` must be equal to `s[0]` and `s[1]` respectively.
