To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze its functionality based on the requirements outlined.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Input**: The program takes two compressed strings, `t` and `s`, represented in the format of blocks indicating the length of character sequences and the corresponding characters.
2. **Output**: The program should count the number of occurrences of `s` in `t`.

### Program Analysis

The program consists of two functions:

- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: 
  - Takes a list of strings in the format "li-ci".
  - Converts this input into a list of pairs `[length, character]` where blocks of equal characters are combined. This is correct, as it accurately represents the compressed form of the string.

- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
  - Takes the decompressed representations of `t` and `s` and counts occurrences.
  - It handles cases where the length of `s` is 1, 2, or greater than 2.
  - For length 1, it counts how many times the single character occurs in `t`.
  - For length 2, it checks for consecutive blocks to find matching pairs.
  - For lengths greater than 2, it uses a KMP-like algorithm to count occurrences based on the processed list `v`, which combines the elements of `s` and `t`.

### Correctness Evaluation

1. **Handling of Different Lengths**: The program correctly implements logic for different lengths of `s`, which aligns with the requirement to count occurrences regardless of the length of `s`.
  
2. **Counting Occurrences**: The logic for counting occurrences in `func_2` follows the requirements of the problem description. It checks if the blocks in `t` can form the sequence represented by `s`.

3. **Efficiency**: The program is designed to handle large inputs efficiently, considering the constraints given (up to 200,000 blocks and lengths of up to 1,000,000).

### Conclusion

After a thorough examination, the program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. It accurately decomposes the compressed strings, handles various lengths of the string `s`, and counts occurrences in `t` as required.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is as follows:

Correctness: **True**
