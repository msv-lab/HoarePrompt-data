You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Each employee of the "Blake Techologies" company uses a special messaging app "Blake Messenger". All the stuff likes this app and uses it constantly. However, some important futures are missing. For example, many users want to be able to search through the message history. It was already announced that the new feature will appear in the nearest update, when developers faced some troubles that only you may help them to solve.

All the messages are represented as a strings consisting of only lowercase English letters. In order to reduce the network load strings are represented in the special compressed form. Compression algorithm works as follows: string is represented as a concatenation of n blocks, each block containing only equal characters. One block may be described as a pair (li, ci), where li is the length of the i-th block and ci is the corresponding letter. Thus, the string s may be written as the sequence of pairs <image>.

Your task is to write the program, that given two compressed string t and s finds all occurrences of s in t. Developers know that there may be many such occurrences, so they only ask you to find the number of them. Note that p is the starting position of some occurrence of s in t if and only if tptp + 1...tp + |s| - 1 = s, where ti is the i-th character of string t.

Note that the way to represent the string in compressed form may not be unique. For example string "aaaa" may be given as <image>, <image>, <image>...

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 200 000) — the number of blocks in the strings t and s, respectively.

The second line contains the descriptions of n parts of string t in the format "li-ci" (1 ≤ li ≤ 1 000 000) — the length of the i-th part and the corresponding lowercase English letter.

The second line contains the descriptions of m parts of string s in the format "li-ci" (1 ≤ li ≤ 1 000 000) — the length of the i-th part and the corresponding lowercase English letter.

Output

Print a single integer — the number of occurrences of s in t.

Note

In the first sample, t = "aaabbccccaaacc", and string s = "aabbc". The only occurrence of string s in string t starts at position p = 2.

In the second sample, t = "aaabbbbbbaaaaaaacccceeeeeeeeaa", and s = "aaa". The occurrences of s in t start at positions p = 1, p = 10, p = 11, p = 12, p = 13 and p = 14.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: ar is a list of strings where each string is in the format "li-ci" representing the lengths of character blocks and their corresponding lowercase English letters, and the list contains two sets of such strings: the first set describes the string t and the second set describes the string s.
def func_1(ar):
    p = []
    for i in ar:
        x = int(i.split('-')[0])
        
        c = i.split('-')[1]
        
        if len(p) > 0 and p[-1][1] == c:
            p[-1][0] += x
        else:
            p.append([x, c])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `p` is a list of pairs where each pair contains the total length of character blocks and the corresponding lowercase English letter, and `ar` remains a list of strings in the format "li-ci".
    return p
    #The program returns the list of pairs 'p' containing the total length of character blocks and the corresponding lowercase English letters.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t and s are lists of tuples where each tuple contains a positive integer and a lowercase English letter, and c is a positive integer representing the number of blocks in the string t.
def func_2(t, s, c):
    ans = 0
    if (len(s) == 1) :
        for i in t:
            if c(i, s[0]):
                ans += i[0] - s[0][0] + 1
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `ans` is the sum of all values `i[0] - s[0][0] + 1` for each element `i` in `t` where the condition `c(i, s[0])` is true; `t` is an iterable containing elements, and `s` is a list with length 1.
        return ans
        #The program returns the sum of all values `i[0] - s[0][0] + 1` for each element `i` in `t` where the condition `c(i, s[0])` is true.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`ans` is 0; the length of `s` is not equal to 1.

        for i in range(len(t) - 1):
            if c(t[i], s[0]) and c(t[i + 1], s[1]):
                ans += 1
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `ans` is the count of pairs in `t` that satisfy the condition `c(t[i], s[0]) and c(t[i + 1], s[1])`, `i` is equal to `len(t) - 2`, the length of `s` is 2, and the length of `t` is at least 2.
        return ans
        #The program returns the count of pairs in `t` that satisfy the condition `c(t[i], s[0]) and c(t[i + 1], s[1])`
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`ans` is 0; the length of `s` is not equal to 1 and the length of `s` is not equal to 2.
    v = s[1:-1] + [[100500, '#']] + t
    p = [0] * len(v)
    for i in range(1, len(v)):
        j = p[i - 1]
        
        while j > 0 and v[j] != v[i]:
            j = p[j]
        
        if v[j] == v[i]:
            j += 1
        
        p[i] = j
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `ans` is 0, `s` has a length of at least 4, `v` is a list with at least 2 elements, and `p` is a list of integers based on the processing of `v`.
    for i in range(len(v)):
        if p[i] == len(s) - 2 and c(v[i - p[i]], s[0]) and c(v[i + 1], s[-1]):
            ans += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `ans` is the total count of conditions met, `i` is the final index of the loop (which would be the length of `v` minus 1), `v` is a list with at least 2 elements, `s` has a length of at least 4.
    return ans
    #The program returns the total count of conditions met stored in 'ans'


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
