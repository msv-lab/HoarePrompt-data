To evaluate the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the problem description, the provided functions, and the output descriptions.

### Problem Description
The problem requires us to find occurrences of a compressed string `s` within another compressed string `t`. The compressed strings are represented as a list of blocks, each defined by a length and a character. The task is to count how many times `s` appears in `t`.

### Functions Analysis
1. **Function `func_1(ar)`**: This function processes the input list of strings formatted as "li-ci" and produces a list of pairs where each pair contains the total length of contiguous character blocks and the corresponding letter.
   - The function seems to handle cases where multiple contiguous blocks of the same letter are summed correctly.
   - It does not handle an empty input list specifically, but returns an empty list as expected. 

2. **Function `func_2(t, s, c)`**: This function counts the occurrences of `s` in `t` based on specific conditions.
   - It handles cases where `s` has a length of 1 or 2 separately, which is reasonable.
   - For lengths greater than 2, it utilizes a modified list and a pattern matching approach but lacks clarity on handling edge cases effectively.
   - The function's logic for counting occurrences seems complex, but it does not directly address scenarios where `s` could partially match or overlap with segments of `t`.

### Edge Cases Consideration
- The function `func_2` does not have clear handling for cases where:
  - `s` or `t` are empty or malformed inputs (though the problem states `1 â‰¤ n, m`).
  - If `s` has characters that do not appear in `t` at all, the output should be `0`, but the logic needs to ensure that this is captured correctly.
- The logic could potentially miss cases where `s` is a contiguous segment at the boundaries of blocks in `t`.

### Output Descriptions and Hints
The output hints describe how each function operates and provide insights into their behavior:
- The hints for `func_1` seem accurate, confirming that it correctly sums lengths of contiguous blocks.
- The hints for `func_2` describe its handling of different lengths of `s` but do not adequately address how the matching process may fail in certain edge cases, particularly with varying lengths and character distributions.

### Conclusion
Upon reviewing the functions and their descriptions, the program does not adequately guarantee accurate results for all potential cases outlined in the problem description. Specifically, it may fail to count occurrences correctly when blocks of characters are adjacent or partially overlap, as well as not handling some edge conditions explicitly.

Thus, we conclude that the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to handle cases where `s` might be partially contained within blocks of `t` that are adjacent, leading to incorrect counts of occurrences.
