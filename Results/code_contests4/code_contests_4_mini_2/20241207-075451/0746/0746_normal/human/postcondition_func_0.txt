The function accepts a list of strings `ar`, where each string is formatted as "li-ci" (representing the length of a character block and its corresponding lowercase English letter). It processes the list to return a new list of pairs, where each pair contains the total length of contiguous character blocks and the corresponding letter. If multiple blocks of the same letter are adjacent, their lengths are summed together. The function does not handle cases where the input list is empty, but it will return an empty list in such scenarios without error.
