Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly fulfilling the requirements of the problem description. Let's analyze its behavior with respect to the problem:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `input()` to read the number of arare (N) but then mistakenly attempts to use `raw_input.split()`, which is incorrect in Python 3 (it should be `input().split()`). This would lead to a runtime error.

2. **Logic Error**: The program checks for the presence of the color 'Y' (yellow) to determine if there are four colors. If 'Y' is found, it prints 'Four' and sets `N` to -1, which is not a valid approach. If 'Y' is not found, it proceeds to print 'Three' without checking if there are indeed three colors present. This logic does not properly account for cases where there are three colors but not all possible colors.

3. **Missing Logic for Color Count**: The program does not actually count the unique colors in the array. Instead, it only checks for 'Y' and does not confirm if there are exactly three colors available if 'Y' is absent.

### Example of Failure:
Consider the input:
```
5
P W G G W
```
Expected output: `Three` (because it has three unique colors: P, W, G).
Actual output: The program will print `Three` because it does not find 'Y', but since it does not check for the actual unique colors, it could fail in other edge cases where colors are not fully represented.

Thus, the program does not correctly adhere to the problem requirements in all cases. Since there are scenarios where it will not function correctly, we conclude that the correctness is **False**.
