The function reads an integer `N` and a list `S` of `N` characters. If any character in `S` is 'Y', it prints 'Four' and sets `N` to -1. If 'Y' was found, it subsequently prints 'Three'. If 'Y' is not found, the function does not print anything. The function assumes that `S` contains at least one 'P', one 'W', and one 'G', but it does not check for them explicitly. Thus, it may not handle cases where `S` does not meet this condition, leading to potential unexpected behavior.
