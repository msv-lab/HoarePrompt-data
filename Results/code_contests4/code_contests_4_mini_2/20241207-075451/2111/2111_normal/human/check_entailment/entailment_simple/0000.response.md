Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input.split()` which is incorrect syntax in Python 3. It should be `input().split()`.

2. **Logic for Determining Colors**: The logic used in the for loop is flawed. The program is designed to check if 'Y' (yellow) is present in the list of colors and prints 'Four' if it finds it. If 'Y' is not found, it incorrectly prints 'Three' because it checks if `N` is equal to -1. This is a misunderstanding of the requirement. The program should instead check the unique colors in the list and count them.

3. **Incorrect Output Logic**: The program does not properly account for the scenario in which there are only three colors (P, W, G). If there are no 'Y' characters, the program will print 'Three' based on the incorrect condition, which does not match the problem requirements.

To summarize, the program fails to correctly count the distinct colors present in the input and does not follow the requirements of the problem description. It incorrectly assumes that the presence of 'Y' alone determines the output without properly checking the number of unique colors. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the expected behavior for all potential cases.
