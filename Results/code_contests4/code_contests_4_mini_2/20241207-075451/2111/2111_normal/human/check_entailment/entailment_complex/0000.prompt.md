You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: In Japan, people make offerings called hina arare, colorful crackers, on March 3.

We have a bag that contains N hina arare. (From here, we call them arare.)

It is known that the bag either contains arare in three colors: pink, white and green, or contains arare in four colors: pink, white, green and yellow.

We have taken out the arare in the bag one by one, and the color of the i-th arare was S_i, where colors are represented as follows - pink: `P`, white: `W`, green: `G`, yellow: `Y`.

If the number of colors of the arare in the bag was three, print `Three`; if the number of colors was four, print `Four`.

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 100
* S_i is `P`, `W`, `G` or `Y`.
* There always exist i, j and k such that S_i=`P`, S_j=`W` and S_k=`G`.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
S_1 S_2 ... S_N


Output

If the number of colors of the arare in the bag was three, print `Three`; if the number of colors was four, print `Four`.

Examples

Input

6
G W Y P Y W


Output

Four


Input

9
G W W G P W P G G


Output

Three


Input

8
P Y W G Y W Y Y


Output

Four
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 100, and S is a list of N characters where each character is one of 'P', 'W', 'G', or 'Y'. There are at least one 'P', one 'W', and one 'G' in the list.
def func():
    N = input()
    S = raw_input.split()
    for i in range(N):
        if S[i] == 'Y':
            print('Four')
            N = -1
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 100; `S` is a list of `N` characters; if any character in `S` is 'Y', then 'Four' has been printed and the loop has exited early; otherwise, the loop has completed without printing anything.
    if (N == -1) :
        print('Three')
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 100. If `N` is equal to -1, 'Three' has been printed. Otherwise, if any character in `S` is 'Y', then 'Four' has been printed and the loop has exited early; otherwise, the loop has completed without printing anything.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `N` and a list `S` of `N` characters. If any character in `S` is 'Y', it prints 'Four' and sets `N` to -1. If 'Y' was found, it subsequently prints 'Three'. If 'Y' is not found, the function does not print anything. The function assumes that `S` contains at least one 'P', one 'W', and one 'G', but it does not check for them explicitly. Thus, it may not handle cases where `S` does not meet this condition, leading to potential unexpected behavior.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
