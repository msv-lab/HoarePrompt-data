The function `func` accepts a parameter `N`, which is a positive integer constrained by 1 <= N <= 100, and a parameter `S`, which is a list of `N` characters where each character is one of 'P', 'W', 'G', or 'Y'. The list `S` is guaranteed to contain at least one 'P', one 'W', and one 'G'. 

The output of the function is determined by the content of the list `S`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a positive integer `N` and a list `S` of characters, ensuring that `S` contains specific characters, and return a value based on the combination of those characters in `S`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer N and a list S of characters and returns a value based on the characters in S, which must include at least one 'P', one 'W', and one 'G'.**
