According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `N`. The loop iterates as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 2. Since `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 100, `N` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 100, `S` is a list of `N` characters, `i` is 2.**
