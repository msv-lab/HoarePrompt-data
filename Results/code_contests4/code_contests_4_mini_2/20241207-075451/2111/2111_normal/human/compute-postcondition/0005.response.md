The assignment `N = -1` changes the value of `N` from a positive integer (between 1 and 100) to -1. This violates the initial condition of `N` being a positive integer. The states of the other variables (`S`, `i`, and the character at index `i` of `S`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is -1; `S` is a list of `N` characters; `i` is 0; the character at index `i` of `S` is 'Y'; the output is 'Four'.

Output State: **`N` is -1; `S` is a list of `N` characters; `i` is 0; the character at index `i` of `S` is 'Y'; the output is 'Four'**.
