The value of `N` is assigned as -1, which is outside the specified range (2 <= N <= 100). The previous states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is -1; `S` is a list of `N` characters; `i` is 2; and 'Four' is printed.

Output State: **`N` is -1; `S` is a list of `N` characters; `i` is 2; and 'Four' is printed.**
