The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is -1; `S` is a list of `N` characters; `i` is 0; the character at index `i` of `S` is 'Y'; the output is 'Four' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
