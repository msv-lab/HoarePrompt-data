To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the program and identify any potential cases where it may fail to meet the specifications.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Input Structure**: 
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - Each test case specifies the number of fridges (n) and the number of chains (m).
   - It also provides the weights of the fridges.

2. **Output Requirements**:
   - If a solution exists, print the minimum total cost of the chains and the pairs of fridges connected by the chains.
   - If no solution exists, print -1.

3. **Private Fridge Condition**:
   - A fridge is private if only the owner can open it. This means that there cannot be a chain configuration that allows another person (not the owner) to open it.

### Program Logic
- The program checks if `m < n` or if `n == 2`. If either condition is true, it appends -1 to the results, which means it can't create private fridges with the given chains.
- If the conditions are not met, it calculates the total cost as `2 * sum(a)` and creates pairs of fridges in a circular manner.

### Potential Issues
1. **Case of `m < n`**: 
   - If `m` is less than `n`, the program correctly identifies that it cannot create private fridges and outputs -1. This is correct.

2. **Case of `n == 2`**:
   - The program also correctly appends -1 when `n == 2` since with only two fridges, even with multiple chains, both owners can access each other's fridges.

3. **General Case**:
   - For cases where `m >= n`, the program calculates `2 * sum(a)`, which is the cost for connecting each fridge to another in a circular manner. 
   - It outputs the pairs `(k + 1, (k + 1) % n + 1)`, which connects each fridge to the next, wrapping around to the first fridge.

### Test Case Analysis
- **Valid Chains**:
  - If `m = n`, the program creates a circular connection. This setup keeps fridges private as each fridge is only opened by its owner.
  - If `m > n`, the program still keeps the circular connections and can add additional chains without violating the privacy rule.

### Conclusion
The program does seem to handle the cases specified in the problem statement correctly. However, there is one potential oversight:

- **Multiple Chains**: The program does not explicitly handle the case where `m > n` correctly in terms of ensuring fridges remain private. Although the circular connection seems to work, it does not guarantee that simply adding more chains will always maintain the privacy condition, especially if no additional unique chains are added.

Given these considerations, the program does not guarantee correct behavior for all input scenarios, particularly when `m` is greater than `n` without additional validation.

Thus, the final assessment is:

Correctness: **False**
