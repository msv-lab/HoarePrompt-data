`af` is a list that is being appended with a new string. The string is formed by concatenating the result of `k + 1` (which is `3` since `k` is `2`) with the result of `((k + 1) % n + 1)`. Since `k + 1` is `3`, we need to calculate `3 % n + 1`. Given that `n` is greater than `0`, the specific value of `n` is not known but will affect the output of the modulus operation. 

For `n > 2`, `3 % n` will be `3` if `n` is `3`, `1` if `n` is `4`, and so on. Thus, the output of `((k + 1) % n + 1)` will depend on the specific value of `n`. However, we can represent it generally.

The output state reflecting the current values of the variables will be: `k` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, and `af` will receive a new entry based on these calculations.

Output State: **`k` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `af` will have an entry of '3 ' concatenated with the result of ((3 % n) + 1)**.
