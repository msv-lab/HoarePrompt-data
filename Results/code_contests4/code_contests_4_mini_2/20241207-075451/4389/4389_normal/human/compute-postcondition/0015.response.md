Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and processes input to handle test cases involving two integers, `n` and `m`, followed by a list of weights. If `m` is less than `n` or `n` equals 2, it appends -1 to a list and returns None. Otherwise, it appends twice the sum of the weights to the list and generates `n` strings formatted as `'i (i % n + 1)'`, where `i` ranges from 1 to `n`. The function does not return any value, and its primary output is through the `af` list. **
