`af` is a list that is being appended with a string that consists of two parts: `str(k + 1)` and `str((k + 1) % n + 1)`. Here, `k` is 1, so `k + 1` equals 2. The first part becomes `str(2)` which is '2'. The second part involves calculating `(k + 1) % n + 1`, which simplifies to `2 % n + 1`. Since `n` is greater than 0, `2 % n` will yield a value between 0 and 1, and adding 1 gives either 1 or 2. This means the second part could be either '1' or '2' depending on the value of `n`. Therefore, `af` will have a new string appended to it that is either '2 1' or '2 2', depending on the specific value of `n`.

The output state will reflect that `af` has been updated with this new string while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is 1, `af` is updated with '2 1' or '2 2'**
