The code `af.append(2 * sum(a))` impacts the program by calculating the sum of the list `a` and then multiplying that sum by 2 before appending it to the list `af`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `a` are not directly modified by this line of code, but the output state will reflect the new state of `af`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the first integer from the last element of `le`
- `m` is the second integer from the last element of `le`
- `a` is a list of integers created from this last element of `le` after splitting it
- The value of `m` is greater than or equal to `n`
- `n` is not equal to 2

The output state will indicate that `af` has a new element, which is `2 * sum(a)`. 

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the last element of `le`, `m` is the second integer from the last element of `le`, `a` is a list of integers created from this last element of `le` after splitting it, and `af` now has a new element `2 * sum(a)` appended to it.**
