In the given code snippet, the expression `af.append(str(k + 1) + ' ' + str((k + 1) % n + 1))` will be executed. 

1. The current value of `k` is 0, so `k + 1` equals 1.
2. The expression `(k + 1) % n` evaluates to `1 % n`, which is 1 because `n` is greater than 0. 
3. Adding 1 to this result gives us `1 + 1`, which equals 2.
4. The `append` method will concatenate these results into a string: `'1' + ' ' + '2'`, resulting in the string `'1 2'`.
5. The variable `af` will now include this new string element. The other variables `n` and `k` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 0, and `af` now contains the string `'1 2'`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is 0, and `af` now contains the string `'1 2'`**.
