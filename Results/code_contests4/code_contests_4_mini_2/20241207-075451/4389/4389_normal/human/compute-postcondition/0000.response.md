The values of `n` and `m` are assigned from the last element of the list `le`, where it is split into two parts and converted to integers. The input assumptions indicate that `n` is between 2 and 1000 and `m` is between 1 and `n`. Therefore, the values of `n` and `m` will directly reflect the input provided. The other variables and states are not affected by this line of code. Thus, the Output State will reflect the new values of `n` and `m`.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the last element of `le`, `m` is the second integer from the last element of `le`**.
