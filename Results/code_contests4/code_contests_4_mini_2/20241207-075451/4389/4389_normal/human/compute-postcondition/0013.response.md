To analyze the output state after the loop has completed, we note that the loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is a positive integer. 

During each iteration, the variable `k` takes on values from `0` to `n-1`. For each `k`, a string is appended to the list `af` in the format `'k+1'` followed by `((k+1) % n) + 1`.

After all iterations of the loop:

- `k` will have taken on the value of `n-1` in the last iteration.
- The list `af` will contain `n` strings, each formatted based on the value of `k` and its modulo with `n`.

The specific entries in `af` would be:
- For `k = 0`: `'1 ' + str((0 + 1) % n + 1)` which is `'1 ' + str(2)` leading to `'1 2'`.
- For `k = 1`: `'2 ' + str((1 + 1) % n + 1)` which leads to `'2 1'` or `'2 2'` depending on the value of `n`.
- For `k = 2`: `'3 ' + str((2 + 1) % n + 1)` and so on, until `k = n - 1`.

Thus, after the loop executes:
- `af` will contain `n` entries.
- `k` will equal `n - 1`.
- `n` will remain unchanged.

If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute `n` times and populate `af` accordingly.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is `n - 1`, `af` contains `n` strings in the format of `'i (i % n + 1)'` for `i` from `1` to `n`.**
