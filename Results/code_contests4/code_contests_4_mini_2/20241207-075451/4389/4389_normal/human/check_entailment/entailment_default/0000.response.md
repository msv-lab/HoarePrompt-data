To evaluate the correctness of the given program based on the problem description and the output hints, let's analyze both:

### Problem Description:
The goal is to determine if it’s possible to create exactly `m` chains connecting `n` fridges such that:
1. Each fridge can only be opened by its owner.
2. The cost of creating the chains should be minimized.

### Code Analysis:
The program first checks if `m < n` or `n == 2`, in which case it appends `-1` to the output (indicating no solution). This is a logical step because:
- If there are fewer chains than fridges (`m < n`), it’s impossible to ensure each fridge is private.
- If there are only two fridges (`n == 2`), both fridges would be able to open each other regardless of the number of chains created.

If those conditions are not met, the program calculates the total cost as `2 * sum(weights)`, which is correct since each fridge will be connected to another with the weight of both involved.

Then, it generates `n` chains using the format `i (i % n + 1)` which connects fridge `i` to fridge `(i % n + 1)`. This effectively creates a cycle in the connections.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Case where `m < n`**: The program correctly identifies that this is invalid by returning `-1`.
2. **Case where `n == 2`**: The program correctly identifies that both fridges cannot be private because they would always be able to open each other's fridges, returning `-1`.
3. **Valid chains**: The program creates chains that connect all fridges in a cycle which does ensure that each fridge can only be opened by its owner.

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints indicate that:
- The program handles chains correctly for cases where `m` is valid.
- The hint about appending `-1` for cases where `m < n` or `n == 2` aligns with the code's logic.
- The hint specifies a total cost calculated as `2 * sum(a)` which matches the code's logic.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all described cases in the problem statement, including edge cases, and the output hints confirm that the logic is consistent with the problem requirements. There are no potential cases where the program fails to meet the specifications for valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**.
