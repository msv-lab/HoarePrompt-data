The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description. Let's break down the reasons for this conclusion:

1. **Condition Check for `m`**: The program checks if `m < n` or `n == 2`. If either condition is true, it appends `-1` to the results and returns `None`. This is incorrect because:
   - The requirement states that `m` can be less than `n`, but it doesn't necessarily mean that a solution is impossible; it depends on the weights and the configuration of the chains created.
   - The specific case of `n == 2` does not automatically imply that privacy cannot be established; it depends on the weights involved and the number of chains requested.

2. **Cost Calculation**: The line `af.append(2 * sum(a))` calculates the total cost as twice the sum of the weights. This is incorrect as the problem requires a specific way to determine the cost based on the connections made, rather than a simple multiplication of the total weight.

3. **Chain Connections**: The program connects fridges in a circular manner using the for loop: `af.append(str(k + 1) + ' ' + str((k + 1) % n + 1))`. While this will create chains, it does not ensure that the fridges are private as defined in the problem. The example provided in the problem description shows that the privacy of a fridge depends on the specific connections and the weights of the fridges involved, which is not considered in this implementation.

4. **Output Format**: The program does not correctly handle multiple test cases because it does not reset or manage the state of `af` between different test cases, which may lead to incorrect output.

In summary, the program fails to accurately assess the conditions for privacy among fridges and does not calculate costs or chain configurations correctly based on the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
