Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Condition for -1 Output**: The program appends `-1` to the output list if `m < n` or `n == 2`. According to the problem description, `m` can be less than `n` or equal to `n`, but `n` should not be equal to 2 when `m` is 1. This means that if `n` is 2 and `m` is 1, the program would incorrectly output `-1` even though it is possible to create a chain between the two fridges that makes both private.

2. **Total Cost Calculation**: The program appends `2 * sum(a)` as the total cost. This is incorrect because the total cost should be the minimum cost required to form `m` chains that ensure the privacy of all fridges. The actual computation for the cost of the chains needs to be based on the specific connections between fridges, not just the sum of the weights multiplied by two.

3. **Chain Generation**: The way the program generates chains is flawed. The program generates `n` chains between fridge `i` and `(i % n + 1)`, which does not guarantee the privacy of the fridges. The problem demands that the chains should be constructed in such a way that no other person can open a fridge except its owner, which is not ensured by this method. 

4. **Handling of Multiple Chains**: The program does not account for the possibility of needing to create multiple chains between the same pairs of fridges, which is allowed in the problem description. The logic fails to consider how to effectively distribute the chains across fridges to maintain privacy.

Due to these issues, the program fails to meet the requirements set forth in the problem description, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
