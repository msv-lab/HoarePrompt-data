To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the requirements and the code.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input Structure**: We have multiple test cases. Each test case has:
   - Two integers `n` (number of fridges) and `m` (number of chains).
   - A list of weights for the fridges.

2. **Output Requirements**:
   - If it's impossible to make the fridges private with exactly `m` chains, output `-1`.
   - If it's possible, output the minimum total cost of the chains and their connections.

3. **Conditions for Privacy**:
   - A fridge is private if only its owner can open it. This condition is violated if there exists another person who can open the fridge.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Initial Check**:
   - The program checks if `m < n` or `n == 2`, in which case it immediately appends `-1` to results. This is problematic:
     - If `m < n`, it might be possible to create a configuration of chains that ensures privacy despite having fewer chains than fridges.
     - If `n == 2`, it's impossible to make both fridges private with just one chain.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total cost as `2 * sum(a)`, which represents connecting each fridge to every other fridge with one chain.

3. **Chain Connections**:
   - It generates `n` connections, where each fridge `k` is connected to `(k + 1) % n + 1`. This effectively creates a circular connection pattern which may not ensure privacy in all configurations.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Test Case with m = n**:
   - Consider a case where `n = 3` and `m = 3` with weights `[1, 1, 1]`. The program will output a total cost of `6` and connections `1-2, 2-3, 3-1`. However, this configuration doesn't guarantee privacy for any fridge since all fridges are interconnected.

2. **Test Case with m < n**:
   - If `n = 4` and `m = 3` with weights `[1, 1, 1, 1]`, the output will be `-1`. However, it is indeed possible to create 3 chains that could maintain privacy but the current logic prematurely rejects this case.

### Conclusion:
The code does not handle all edge cases correctly, especially in determining if the fridges can be private with the exact number of chains `m`. 

Thus, the program does not meet the problem's requirements for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
