#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four integer parameters: `line` (the number of vertical lines), `end` (the selected vertical line number), `pos` (the hit position), and `left` (the number of stages). It checks various conditions based on these parameters to determine if the hit position is valid. If the position is not valid due to the presence of vertical lines or other conditions, it returns False. If the hit position is valid, it marks it as hit and returns either `pos` or `pos + 1` based on whether the `left` parameter is greater than 0. The function does not handle cases where `pos` exceeds the bounds of the `line` array correctly, which could lead to an IndexError if not properly managed.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: start is a positive integer representing the selected vertical line number (1 ≤ start ≤ n), side is a positive integer representing the hit position (1 ≤ side ≤ n), add is a positive integer representing the stage count (1 ≤ add ≤ 30), and left is a list of integers of length n-1 where each integer is either 0 or 1 indicating the presence or absence of horizontal lines. n is a positive integer (1 < n ≤ 10).
def func_2(start, side, add, left):
    end = len(side[0])
    pos = start - 1
    add -= 1
    cross = 0
    for (step, line) in enumerate(side):
        line = line[:]
        
        if add == step:
            cross = func_1(line, end, pos, left)
            if not cross:
                return False, False
        
        if pos > 0 and line[pos - 1]:
            pos -= 1
        elif pos < end and line[pos]:
            pos += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `start` is a positive integer, `side` is a list with at least 1 element, `add` is a positive integer, `left` is a list of integers of length n-1, `cross` is the result of the last execution of `func_1(line, end, pos, left)`, `pos` is adjusted based on the conditions in the loop, and `step` is equal to the length of `side`.
    return cross, pos + 1
    #The program returns the value of 'cross' from the last execution of 'func_1(line, end, pos, left)' and 'pos' incremented by 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four parameters: a positive integer `start` representing the initial vertical line number, a list of lists `side` representing horizontal line presence or absence, a positive integer `add` indicating the stage count, and a list `left` that provides additional context for horizontal lines. It returns a tuple containing the result of the last call to `func_1` and the adjusted position `pos` (incremented by 1). If the `add` is equal to the current loop step, it calls `func_1`; otherwise, it adjusts `pos` based on the presence of horizontal lines. If a certain condition is met, it returns False for both values. The function does not handle cases where `add` exceeds the length of `side`, which may lead to unexpected behavior.
