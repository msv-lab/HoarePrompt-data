line is an integer representing the number of vertical lines (1 < line ≤ 10), end is an integer representing the selected vertical line number (1 ≤ end ≤ line), pos is an integer representing the hit position (1 ≤ pos ≤ line), left is an integer representing the number of stages (1 ≤ left ≤ 30), and the subsequent input consists of n-1 integers (0 or 1) for each stage, where 1 indicates the presence of a horizontal line and 0 indicates its absence.
