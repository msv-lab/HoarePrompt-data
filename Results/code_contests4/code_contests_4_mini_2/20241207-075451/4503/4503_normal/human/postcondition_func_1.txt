The function accepts four parameters: a positive integer `start` representing the initial vertical line number, a list of lists `side` representing horizontal line presence or absence, a positive integer `add` indicating the stage count, and a list `left` that provides additional context for horizontal lines. It returns a tuple containing the result of the last call to `func_1` and the adjusted position `pos` (incremented by 1). If the `add` is equal to the current loop step, it calls `func_1`; otherwise, it adjusts `pos` based on the presence of horizontal lines. If a certain condition is met, it returns False for both values. The function does not handle cases where `add` exceeds the length of `side`, which may lead to unexpected behavior.
