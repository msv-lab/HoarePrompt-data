Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement for all potential cases. Here are the reasons why:

1. **Function Logic Issues**: 
   - In `func_1`, the checks for whether a hit can be reached without drawing a horizontal line and the conditions for adding a horizontal line are not properly aligned with the problem description. The checks do not account for all scenarios where horizontal lines can be present or absent, leading to incorrect return values.
   - The conditions for returning `False` in `func_1` do not adequately check whether the horizontal lines connect the vertical lines as required by the problem statement. 

2. **Incorrect Return Values**:
   - The program only returns the hit position or `False` for various checks but does not account for the specific output requirements of the problem description. For example, if a hit can be reached by drawing a horizontal line, the program needs to specify the position and step count, but it does not handle this correctly.

3. **State Management**: 
   - The programâ€™s state management through the use of `cross` and `pos` is not clear or robust. The way these variables are used does not guarantee that all valid states are reached or that the conditions of the Amidakuji are maintained correctly. 

4. **Lack of Comprehensive Testing**:
   - The program does not seem to consider all edge cases, such as scenarios where vertical lines could be adjacent or when there are no horizontal lines at all. This could lead to misjudgments about whether a hit is reachable or not.

In summary, the program does not correctly implement the full set of requirements outlined in the problem description, particularly regarding the conditions for drawing horizontal lines and the proper output format. Therefore, it does not meet the correctness criteria specified in the problem statement.
