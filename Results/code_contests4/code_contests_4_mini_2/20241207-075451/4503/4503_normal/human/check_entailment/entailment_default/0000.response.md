To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and the output hints, let's break down the code and the requirements:

### Problem Description
The problem requires us to determine if a hit can be reached from a selected vertical line in a structure called Amidakuji, given certain conditions and the possibility of adding one horizontal line. The output should indicate whether the hit is reachable without adding a line, if it can be reached by adding a line, or if it's unreachable even with one addition.

### Function Analysis

#### Function 1 (`func_1`)
- This function checks whether a horizontal line can be added at a specific position based on the conditions provided.
- It considers the bounds of the vertical lines and the presence of existing horizontal lines.
- The edge cases where `pos` exceeds the bounds of the `line` array could potentially lead to an IndexError, indicating it might not handle all cases correctly.

#### Function 2 (`func_2`)
- This function simulates the movement through the Amidakuji structure, adjusting the current vertical line position based on existing horizontal lines.
- It calls `func_1` to check if adding a horizontal line at a certain step is valid.
- There are checks for conditions where the `add` variable exceeds the length of `side`, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

### Output Hints Analysis
The output hints for both functions provide a summary of their behavior:
- `func_1` hints at various conditions for the validity of the hit position and mentions the potential for IndexError.
- `func_2` describes how the position adjusts based on horizontal lines and the conditions under which it returns values.

### Edge Cases and Potential Issues
1. **IndexError**: The handling of `pos` in `func_1` could lead to an IndexError if boundaries are not respected.
2. **Invalid Addition**: If the horizontal line addition is attempted at an invalid position (e.g., where it would cross existing vertical lines), it may not be handled correctly.
3. **Correctness of Return Values**: There could be situations where the vertical line count and the horizontal line presence don't align correctly with the expected outputs.

### Conclusion
Upon reviewing the program alongside the problem description and output hints, it appears there are possible edge cases that are not handled correctly, particularly concerning boundary checks and the conditions for valid horizontal line additions. Since the program might not follow the problem description for every potential case due to these issues, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not correctly handle certain edge cases, such as out-of-bounds accesses and validation of horizontal line placements, which could lead to incorrect outcomes based on the problem's requirements.
