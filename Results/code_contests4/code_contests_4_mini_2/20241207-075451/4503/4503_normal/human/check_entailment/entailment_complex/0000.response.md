Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as specified in the problem description. Specifically, there are issues regarding how it checks for horizontal lines and the conditions under which a hit can be reached.

1. The annotations indicate that the function `func_1` checks for the presence of horizontal lines before determining if a hit can be reached, but it does not sufficiently account for the case where a horizontal line can be added. The logic in the annotations suggests that it only checks if the current setup allows reaching the hit, without properly simulating the addition of a horizontal line when needed.

2. The logic flow in `func_2` does not ensure that all possible placements of the horizontal line are evaluated. The current implementation only checks the crossing at one specific point (`add == step`), which may not cover all scenarios where adding a horizontal line could allow reaching the hit.

3. The boundary checks and validations for vertical lines are not comprehensive. For instance, it does not seem to handle cases where the vertical line number exceeds the bounds of the list, which could lead to unexpected errors.

4. The example given in the problem description, specifically the output "6 4", indicates that there are cases where a specific horizontal line must be added in order to reach the hit position. The current implementation might not yield this output correctly due to the aforementioned issues.

Therefore, since there are clear scenarios where the implementation does not meet the requirements laid out in the problem description, the correctness of the code is determined to be false.
