Postcondition: ***`start` is a positive integer, `side` is a list with at least 1 element, `add` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `left` is a list of integers of length n-1, `cross` is the result of func_1(line, end, pos, left), `step` is equal to the length of `side`, and a shallow copy of `line` has been created. If `pos` is greater than 0 and `line[pos - 1]` is true, `pos` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, if `pos` is less than `end` and `line[pos]` is true, `pos` is increased by 1; if not, the value of `pos` remains unchanged.***
