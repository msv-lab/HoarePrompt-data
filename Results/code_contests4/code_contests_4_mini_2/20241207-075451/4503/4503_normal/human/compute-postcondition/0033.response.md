Postcondition: ***`start` is a positive integer, `side` is a list with at least 1 element, `add` is a positive integer, `left` is a list of integers of length n-1, `cross` is the result of `func_1(line, end, pos, left)`, `step` is equal to the length of `side` + 1, `line` is a copy of itself (unchanged). If `cross` is empty (not cross), the program returns two Boolean values: False and False.***
