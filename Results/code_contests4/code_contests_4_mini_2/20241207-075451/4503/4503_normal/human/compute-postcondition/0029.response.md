According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `side` list and the current `step` variable. The loop will execute as long as `step` is less than the length of `side`. At the end of the last iteration, `step` is equal to the length of `side`, which means the loop has completed its iterations. 

To execute the loop one more time, `step` needs to be incremented by 1, making it equal to the new length of `side` (which remains the same since we assume `side` is unchanged). Since `line` is being updated in each iteration of the loop, for the next iteration, the `line` would need to refer to the next element in `side`, which would be the `step`-th element.

However, since `step` is currently equal to the length of `side`, it means there is no next element to access. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure `step` is less than the length of `side`, and `line` should point to the next element.

To adjust the state for a hypothetical next iteration:
- `step` should be incremented by 1 to reference the next element in `side`.
- `line` would then be the next element in `side`, which doesn't exist since `step` is currently at the limit.

Therefore, the necessary state for the loop to execute one more time would be:
State: **`start` is a positive integer, `side` is a list with at least 1 element, `add` is a positive integer, `left` is a list of integers of length n-1, `cross` is the result of func_1(line, end, pos, left), `step` is equal to the length of `side` + 1, and `line` is the next element in `side` (hypothetically referring to an element that doesn't exist).**
