Postcondition: ***`start` is a positive integer, `side` is a list with at least 1 element, `add` is a positive integer, `left` is a list of integers of length n-1, `cross` is the result of `func_1(line, end, pos, left)`, `step` is equal to the length of `side` + 1, `line` is unchanged. If `add` is equal to `step` and `cross` is empty, the program returns two Boolean values: False and False.***
