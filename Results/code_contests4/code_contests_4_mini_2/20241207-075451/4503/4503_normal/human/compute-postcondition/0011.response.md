Postcondition: ***`start` is a positive integer, `side` is a list with at least 1 element, `add` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `left` is a list of integers of length n-1, `pos` is assigned the value of `start - 1`, `cross` is not equal to zero, `step` is 0, and `line` is a new copy of the first element of `side`. If `add` is equal to `step`, then the conditions mentioned above hold true.***
