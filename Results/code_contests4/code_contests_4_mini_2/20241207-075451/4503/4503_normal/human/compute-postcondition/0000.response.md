The code `end = len(side[0])` attempts to determine the length of the first element of the list `side`. However, the initial state describes `side` as a positive integer representing the hit position, not a list. Therefore, attempting to access `side[0]` will lead to an error since `side` is not a list.

Given that the code does not execute successfully, the values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`start` is a positive integer, `side` is a positive integer, `add` is a positive integer, `left` is a list of integers of length n-1, and an error occurs due to `side` being treated as a list instead of a single integer.**
