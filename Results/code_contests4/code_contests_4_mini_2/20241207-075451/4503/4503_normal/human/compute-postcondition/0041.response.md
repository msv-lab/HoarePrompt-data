The function `func_2` accepts the following parameters: `start`, `side`, `add`, and `left`. 

- `start` is a positive integer representing the selected vertical line number, constrained by the condition (1 ≤ start ≤ n).
- `side` is a positive integer representing the hit position, constrained by the condition (1 ≤ side ≤ n).
- `add` is a positive integer representing the stage count, constrained by the condition (1 ≤ add ≤ 30).
- `left` is a list of integers of length n-1, where each integer is either 0 or 1, indicating the presence or absence of horizontal lines.

Based on these inputs, the function can return different outputs:

- Case 1: The function returns two boolean values, both are False.
- Case 2: The function returns a tuple containing two False values, indicating a specific state or condition that is not met.
- Case 3: The function returns two Boolean values: False and False.
- Case 4: The function returns the value of 'cross' from the last execution of 'func_1(line, end, pos, left)' and 'pos' incremented by 1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept parameters representing a vertical line number, hit position, stage count, and the presence of horizontal lines, and to return specific boolean values or a tuple based on various conditions evaluated within the function. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters start, side, add, and left, returning either two boolean values (both False), a tuple of two False values, two Boolean values (False and False), or the value of 'cross' from a previous function call along with an incremented position.**
