According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `side` list. The loop will execute for each element in `side`, so the loop can execute again if `step` is less than the length of `side` minus one. At the end of the last iteration, `step` has been incremented by 1, and since `side` has at least 1 element, it means that the loop has executed at least once and `step` is now equal to the index of the last processed element.

Given that `side` contains at least 1 element, after the current iteration, `step` will be equal to the length of `side` minus 1 for the last element. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `step` must be incremented by 1 and equal to the next index, which will be equal to the length of `side`. 

Thus, `step` will be equal to the length of `side` and the loop can no longer execute again for the next iteration since it would exceed the bounds of the list.

State: **`start` is a positive integer, `side` is a list with at least 1 element, `add` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `left` is a list of integers of length n-1, `cross` is not equal to zero, `step` is equal to the length of `side` (indicating no more elements to process).**
