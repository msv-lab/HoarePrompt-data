Postcondition: ***`start` is a positive integer, `side` is a list with at least 1 element, `add` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `left` is a list of integers of length n-1, `cross` is the result of func_1(line, end, pos, left), `step` is equal to the length of `side`, and a shallow copy of `line` has been created. If `cross` is false, the program returns a tuple containing two False values, indicating a specific state or condition that is not met.***
