Postcondition: ***`start` is a positive integer, `side` is a list with at least 1 element, `add` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `left` is a list of integers of length n-1, `pos` is now equal to `start`, `cross` is not equal to zero, `step` is 0, `line` is a new copy of the first element of `side`, and if `pos` is less than `end`, the element at `line[pos]` remains not equal to 0.***
