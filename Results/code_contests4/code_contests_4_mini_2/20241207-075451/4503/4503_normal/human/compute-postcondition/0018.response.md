Postcondition: ***`start` is a positive integer, `side` is a list with at least 1 element, `add` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `left` is a list of integers of length n-1, and `cross` is not equal to zero. After the execution, if `pos` was greater than 0 and the element at index `pos - 1` in `line` was truthy, then `pos` is decreased by 1 and remains greater than -1. Otherwise, `pos` is now equal to `start`, and if `pos` is less than `end`, the element at `line[pos]` remains not equal to 0.***
