The statement `line = line[:]` creates a shallow copy of the list `line`. Since we have no information about the previous value of `line`, we cannot determine its specific contents. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that a copy of `line` has been created but does not change the overall state of the other variables.

Output State: **`start` is a positive integer, `side` is a list with at least 1 element, `add` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `left` is a list of integers of length n-1, `cross` is not equal to zero, `step` is equal to the length of `side`, and a shallow copy of `line` has been created.**
