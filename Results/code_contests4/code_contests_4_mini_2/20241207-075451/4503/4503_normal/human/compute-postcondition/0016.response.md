The value of `pos` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `pos` is `start - 1`, which is positive. Therefore, the new value of `pos` will be `start`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `start` is a positive integer, `side` is a list with at least 1 element, `add` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `left` is a list of integers of length n-1, `pos` is now equal to `start`, `cross` is not equal to zero, `step` is 0, `line` is a new copy of the first element of `side`, and the element at `line[pos]` is still not equal to 0.

Output State: **`start` is a positive integer, `side` is a list with at least 1 element, `add` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `left` is a list of integers of length n-1, `pos` is now equal to `start`, `cross` is not equal to zero, `step` is 0, `line` is a new copy of the first element of `side`, and the element at `line[pos]` is still not equal to 0.**
