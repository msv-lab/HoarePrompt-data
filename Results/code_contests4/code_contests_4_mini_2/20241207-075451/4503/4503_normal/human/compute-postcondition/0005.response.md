The code `line = line[:]` creates a shallow copy of the list `line`. This means that `line` is reassigned to a new list that contains the same elements as the original `line`, but it is a different object in memory. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `line` remains unchanged in terms of its content, but is now a distinct copy.

Output State: **`start` is a positive integer, `side` is a list with at least 1 element, `add` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `left` is a list of integers of length n-1, `pos` is assigned the value of `start - 1`, `cross` is 0, `step` is 0, `line` is a new copy of the first element of `side`**.
