Postcondition: ***`start` is a positive integer, `side` is a list with at least 1 element, `add` is a positive integer, `left` is a list of integers of length n-1, `cross` is the result of `func_1(line, end, pos, left)`, `step` is equal to the length of `side` + 1, `line` is unchanged. If `pos` is greater than 0 and `line[pos - 1]` is true, then `pos` is decreased by 1. If `pos` is less than `end` and `line[pos]` is true, then `pos` is increased by 1. If `pos` is not less than `end` or `line[pos]` is false, then `pos` remains unchanged, and all other variables remain unchanged.***
