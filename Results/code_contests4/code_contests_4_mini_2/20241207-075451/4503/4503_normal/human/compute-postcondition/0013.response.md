Output State: **`start` is a positive integer, `side` is a list with at least 1 element, `add` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `left` is a list of integers of length n-1, `pos` is assigned the value of `start - 1` and now `pos` is decreased by 1, `cross` is not equal to zero, `step` is 0, `line` is a new copy of the first element of `side`, `pos` is now greater than -1, and the element at index `pos - 1` in `line` is still truthy (non-zero or non-null).**
