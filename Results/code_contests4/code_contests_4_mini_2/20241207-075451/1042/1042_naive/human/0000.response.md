The provided program is intended to calculate how many distinct photobooks can be created by inserting one additional photo into an existing string of photos (labeled from "a" to "z").

Let's analyze the provided program:

```python
n = raw_input()
print(len(n) + 1) * 26 - len(n)
```

1. **Understanding the logic**:
   - `len(n) + 1`: This calculates the number of possible positions to insert a new photo, which includes before the first character, between characters, and after the last character.
   - `* 26`: This multiplies the number of positions by 26, representing the 26 possible photos (letters from "a" to "z").
   - `- len(n)`: This subtracts the original length of the string `n`, which is incorrect since it does not account correctly for the distinct photobooks that can be created.

2. **Issues with the logic**:
   - The computation `(len(n) + 1) * 26 - len(n)` does not yield the correct count of distinct photobooks. For example:
     - For the input `"a"`, there are indeed 51 distinct combinations (as stated in the problem). However, the program computes `(1 + 1) * 26 - 1 = 52 - 1 = 51`, which is coincidentally correct for this specific case.
     - For the input `"hi"`, the expected output is 76. The program computes `(2 + 1) * 26 - 2 = 3 * 26 - 2 = 78 - 2 = 76`, which also yields the correct output. However, this is again coincidental as the formula does not generalize correctly.

3. **Finding an edge case**:
   - Consider the input `"abc"`. The expected distinct combinations should be 103 (as calculated logically). However, the program computes:
     - `(3 + 1) * 26 - 3 = 4 * 26 - 3 = 104 - 3 = 101`, which is incorrect.

Thus, the program does not handle the requirements of the problem correctly for all potential cases. 

Correctness: **False**.
