Upon reviewing the problem description and the provided code, the goal is to determine how many distinct photobooks can be created by inserting one extra photo into the existing string of lowercase letters.

The code provided is as follows:
```python
n = raw_input()
print(len(n) + 1) * 26 - len(n)
```

### Initial Assessment:
1. The code first reads an input string `n` which represents the current photobook.
2. It calculates the number of distinct photobooks that can be created by inserting an additional photo. The formula used is `(length of string + 1) * 26 - length of string`.
3. This formula suggests that for each position in the string (which has `len(n) + 1` possible insertion points), there are 26 possible letters (from 'a' to 'z') that can be inserted.

### Edge Cases:
To verify the correctness, we need to check if the formula correctly calculates the number of distinct photobooks for various lengths of input strings:
- For a single character string like "a", the valid distinct photobooks include: 'aa', 'ab', 'ac', ..., 'az', 'ba', ..., 'za', which results in 51 distinct possibilities.
- For a two-character string like "hi", valid distinct photobooks would include combinations such as: 'ahi', 'bhi', 'chi', ..., 'zhi', 'hai', 'hbi', ..., 'hzi', 'hia', ..., 'hiz', leading to a total of 76 distinct possibilities.

### Checking Output Hints:
The output hints suggest that the function calculates a specific value based on the length of the string. However, the formula used is `(length of string + 1) * 26 - length of string`. This can be broken down to:
- The total number of positions to insert a new character is `len(n) + 1`.
- Each position allows for the insertion of any of the 26 characters, leading to a total of `(len(n) + 1) * 26`.
- The term `- len(n)` seems to be incorrect as it does not account for duplicates correctly and could lead to an incorrect final count.

### Conclusion:
The hints and the code do not align perfectly with the problem description in terms of accounting for distinct photobooks correctly. The formula does not correctly handle the case of duplicates and does not ensure that the calculations accurately reflect the number of unique photobooks that can be generated.

Thus, after evaluating the code against the problem description and considering potential edge cases, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to correctly compute the number of distinct photobooks for various input cases, especially when considering the need to account for unique combinations rather than simply using the given formula. For example, it does not handle the situation where certain characters are duplicated in the input string.
