To determine the correctness of the provided program with respect to the problem description, we need to analyze both the problem requirements and the logic implemented in the program.

### Problem Requirements:
1. Given a string `s` of lowercase letters, we want to find out how many distinct photobooks can be created by inserting one additional photo (one additional lowercase letter from 'a' to 'z') at any position in the original string.
2. The output should be the total number of distinct photobooks possible.

### Analysis of the Program:
The program defines a function that reads a string from user input and computes a value based on the formula `(length of string + 1) * 26 - length of string`.

Breaking down this formula:
- `length of string + 1`: This represents the possible positions to insert a new character (one position before each character and one at the end).
- `* 26`: This indicates that for each of these positions, there are 26 possible characters to insert (from 'a' to 'z').
- `- length of string`: This part seems to account for the fact that inserting a character that already exists in the string shouldn't create a new unique photobook if it is inserted in a way that doesn't change the overall set of distinct characters.

### Evaluation of the Formula:
Let's consider how the formula behaves:
1. If the string `s` has no duplicate characters, inserting any of the 26 letters at any of the possible positions will create a distinct photobook.
2. If the string contains duplicates, the program does not properly account for the distinctiveness of the resulting photobooks since it subtracts the length of the string, which does not accurately reflect the number of distinct photobooks that can be formed.

### Test Cases:
1. For the input `a`, the valid distinct photobooks created are:
   - Insert 'a' (to get 'aa')
   - Insert 'b', 'c', ..., 'z' (resulting in 'ba', 'ca', ..., 'za')
   - Insert at the beginning and end of the string
   - Total: 51 distinct photobooks (correct).
   
   The program calculates: 
   - `len("a") = 1`
   - `(1 + 1) * 26 - 1 = 2 * 26 - 1 = 52 - 1 = 51` (correct).

2. For the input `hi`, the valid distinct photobooks created are:
   - Insert 'h', 'i', 'a', 'b', ..., 'g', 'j', ..., 'z' at each position.
   - Total: 76 distinct photobooks (correct).
   
   The program calculates:
   - `len("hi") = 2`
   - `(2 + 1) * 26 - 2 = 3 * 26 - 2 = 78 - 2 = 76` (correct).

### Conclusion:
The formula used in the program does yield correct results for the provided examples. However, the logic behind the formula does not take into account the duplication of characters in a general case, which may lead to incorrect results for strings with duplicates.

Thus, while the program produces correct outputs for the given examples, it does not guarantee correctness for all possible inputs, especially those with duplicates.

Correctness: **False**
