To verify the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze if it accurately counts the distinct photobooks that can be created by inserting one extra photo into the given string.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a string `s` of length `n` containing lowercase letters (representing photos).
   - We can insert one extra photo (one of 'a' to 'z') at any position in the string `s`.
   - We need to calculate the number of distinct photobooks that can be formed by this insertion.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   The program reads an input string `n` and calculates the number of distinct photobooks using the formula:
   ```python
   print(len(n) + 1) * 26 - len(n)
   ```
   - `len(n)` gives the length of the string.
   - `len(n) + 1` represents the number of positions to insert a new photo (before the first character, between characters, and after the last character).
   - Multiplying by 26 accounts for the 26 possible photos (from 'a' to 'z').
   - However, it subtracts `len(n)`, which seems to be an attempt to adjust for duplicates.

3. **Identifying the Error:**
   The formula does not accurately account for distinctness. If the original string `s` contains repeated characters, inserting duplicates of those characters would not generate new distinct photobooks. 

   For example, consider the input:
   ```
   aa
   ```
   - The possible distinct photobooks by inserting one character are:
     - Insert 'a' resulting in: `aaa`, `aaa` (duplicate)
     - Insert 'b' resulting in: `baa`, `aba`, `aab`
     - Insert 'c' resulting in: `caa`, `aca`, `aac`
     - ...
   - There are many more combinations, but not all will be distinct due to the repetition of 'a'.

4. **Counterexample:**
   For the input `aa`, the program would calculate:
   ```
   (2 + 1) * 26 - 2 = 3 * 26 - 2 = 78 - 2 = 76
   ```
   This suggests there are 76 distinct photobooks, but in reality, the distinct ones will be fewer than that due to the duplicates created by inserting 'a'.

5. **Conclusion:**
   The program does not correctly handle cases where there are duplicate characters in the input string. It fails to account for the fact that inserting the same character multiple times does not increase the number of distinct photobooks.

Correctness: **False**
