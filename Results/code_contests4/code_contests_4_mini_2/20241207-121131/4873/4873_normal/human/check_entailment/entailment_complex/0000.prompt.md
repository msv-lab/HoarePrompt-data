You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given three strings A, B and C. Each of these is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters.

Our objective is to make all these three strings equal. For that, you can repeatedly perform the following operation:

* Operation: Choose one of the strings A, B and C, and specify an integer i between 1 and N (inclusive). Change the i-th character from the beginning of the chosen string to some other lowercase English letter.



What is the minimum number of operations required to achieve the objective?

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 100
* Each of the strings A, B and C is a string of length N.
* Each character in each of the strings A, B and C is a lowercase English letter.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: A, B, and C are strings of length N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100) consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func_1():
    n = int(raw_input().strip())
    a = [raw_input().strip() for i in xrange(3)]
    foo = 0
    for i in xrange(n):
        bucket = {}
        
        for s in a:
            bucket[s[i]] = True
        
        foo += len(bucket) - 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `A`, `B`, and `C` are strings of length `N`; `a` is a collection with at least `n` elements; `bucket` contains entries for each unique character at each index from 0 to `n-1` of the first `n` elements of `a`; `foo` is increased by the total count of unique characters across all indices from 0 to `n-1` minus `n`.
    print(foo)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and reads an integer `n` followed by three strings `A`, `B`, and `C`, each of length `N` (1 ≤ N ≤ 100). It counts the total number of unique characters across all three strings at each index from 0 to `n-1`, subtracting `n` from this total, and prints the result. The function does not handle cases where the input strings may not match the expected length of `n`, leading to potential index errors if `n` is greater than the actual length of the strings.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
