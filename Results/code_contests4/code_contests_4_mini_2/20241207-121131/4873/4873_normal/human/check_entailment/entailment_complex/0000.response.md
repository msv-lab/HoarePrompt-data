The provided annotated program does not correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement.

### Explanation of the Issues:

1. **Understanding of Problem Requirements**: The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of operations needed to make all three strings equal. This means we need to count how many characters differ across the three strings at each position and sum those differences.

2. **Implementation Logic**: 
   - The program initializes a variable `foo` to accumulate the number of required changes.
   - It iterates through each character position (from 0 to N-1) and uses a dictionary `bucket` to collect unique characters from the three strings at the current index.
   - The program increases `foo` by the number of unique characters minus one. This logic does not correctly calculate the number of changes needed to make the strings equal. For example, if there are two unique characters at a position, one change is required to make them the same, but if there are three, two changes might be required depending on the values.

3. **Incorrect Calculation**: The calculation of `foo += len(bucket) - 1` does not accurately reflect the number of changes needed. The intended logic would have to consider the specific characters present and how many need to be changed to match a chosen character.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where strings might already be equal (in which case, the output should be zero) adequately because the logic does not account for the specific characters at each index beyond counting their uniqueness.

5. **Output**: The function simply prints the accumulated count of changes without validating if the result is the minimum needed to make all three strings equal.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not follow the requirements set forth in the problem description and fails to implement the correct logic for calculating the minimum number of operations needed to make the strings equal, we conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
