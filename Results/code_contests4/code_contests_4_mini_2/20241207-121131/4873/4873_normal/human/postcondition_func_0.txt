The function accepts no parameters and reads an integer `n` followed by three strings `A`, `B`, and `C`, each of length `N` (1 ≤ N ≤ 100). It counts the total number of unique characters across all three strings at each index from 0 to `n-1`, subtracting `n` from this total, and prints the result. The function does not handle cases where the input strings may not match the expected length of `n`, leading to potential index errors if `n` is greater than the actual length of the strings.
