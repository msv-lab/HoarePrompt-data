Output State: **`A`, `B`, and `C` are strings of length `N`; `a` is a collection with at least `n` elements; `bucket` contains entries for each unique character at each index from 0 to `n-1` of the first `n` elements of `a`; `foo` is increased by the total count of unique characters across all indices from 0 to `n-1` minus `n`; and we print the value of `foo`.**
