The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It operates on three strings, `A`, `B`, and `C`, which are all of length N (where 1 ≤ N ≤ 100) and consist of lowercase English letters. The function processes these strings and produces an output based on their content. However, since the specific output behavior is not provided in the description, it is unclear how the function manipulates or returns values based on these strings.
