Output State: **`A`, `B`, `C` are strings of length `N`; `a` is a collection with at least 3 elements; `bucket` still contains at least one entry with key `s[i]` set to `True`; `foo` is increased by `len(bucket) - 1`; for the loop to execute a third time `i` must be equal to `n + 2; `bucket[s[i]]` is set to `True`.**
