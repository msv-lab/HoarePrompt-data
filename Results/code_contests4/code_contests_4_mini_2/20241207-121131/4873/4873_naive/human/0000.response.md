To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the code and see if it meets the requirements.

### Problem Description Recap:
We need to make three strings equal using the minimum number of operations, where an operation consists of changing one character of one of the strings to any other lowercase letter.

### Program Analysis:
```python
def func_1():
    n = int(raw_input().strip())
    a = [raw_input().strip() for i in xrange(3)]
    foo = 0
    for i in xrange(n):
        bucket = {}
        for s in a:
            bucket[s[i]] = True
        foo += len(bucket) - 1
    print(foo)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()
```

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer followed by three strings. This matches the input format.
  
2. **Logic**:
   - The program initializes `foo` to 0, which will count the number of operations.
   - For each character position `i` from 0 to N-1, it creates a `bucket` dictionary that stores the unique characters found at that position across the three strings.
   - The number of operations needed to make the characters at this position equal is determined by `len(bucket) - 1`. This is because, if there are `k` unique characters, we need `k-1` changes to make them all the same.

3. **Correctness**:
   - The logic correctly accounts for the number of unique characters at each position and calculates the minimum number of changes required.
   - However, the program does not handle cases where two or more strings are already equal in part. The code might overcount operations, particularly when all three strings are already equal at certain positions.

### Potential Edge Case:
Consider the following input:
```
3
abc
abc
abc
```
The expected output is `0` since all strings are already equal. The program would count the characters at each position and find that there are no unique differences, thus correctly returning `0`.

However, for input:
```
3
abc
abc
abd
```
The expected output is `1`, as only the last character of the third string needs to be changed. The program would count the unique characters at the last position and would incorrectly suggest that two changes are needed (changing from 'c' to 'd' and 'd' to 'c') instead of recognizing that only one change is needed to make all characters equal.

### Conclusion:
The logic does not correctly handle the case where two strings can be identical in certain positions and does not account for optimizing the number of changes. Therefore, the program does not adhere to the problem description correctly for all cases.

Correctness: **False**.
