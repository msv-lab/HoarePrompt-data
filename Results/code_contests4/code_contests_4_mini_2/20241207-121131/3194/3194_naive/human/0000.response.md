To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it in the context of the problem description.

The goal is to check if a 3x3 matrix is symmetric with respect to the central button, which is the middle cell of the matrix (at position (1,1)). This symmetry means that for any pressed key (denoted by 'X'), there should be a corresponding 'X' in the symmetric position relative to the center.

The symmetric pairs for the 3x3 matrix are:
- (0,0) <-> (2,2)
- (0,1) <-> (2,1)
- (0,2) <-> (2,0)
- (1,0) <-> (1,2)
- (2,0) <-> (0,2)
- (2,1) <-> (0,1)
- (2,2) <-> (0,0)
- (1,1) is the center and does not need to be checked for symmetry.

The provided program checks a limited number of these conditions but fails to consider all necessary symmetric pairs. Specifically, it does not check:
- The pairs (1,0) and (1,2) as required for symmetry.
- The pairs (0,0) and (2,2) are only partially checked, and the conditions are not comprehensive enough.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
X..
X.X
...
```
In this case, the expected output should be "NO" since the 'X' at (0,0) does not have a corresponding 'X' at (2,2) and (1,0) does not equal (1,2). However, the given program would not correctly identify this situation as it only checks a few specific conditions.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not accurately verify symmetry for all relevant pairs, it fails for certain inputs.

Correctness: **False**.
