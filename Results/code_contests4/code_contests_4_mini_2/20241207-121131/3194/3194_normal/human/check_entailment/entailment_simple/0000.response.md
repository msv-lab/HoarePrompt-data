Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly validate the symmetry of the input 3x3 matrix according to the problem description. The conditions used in the if statement to determine symmetry are incorrect and do not cover all necessary pairs of coordinates for central symmetry.

For a matrix to be symmetric with respect to the central button (which is at position `(1, 1)`), the following pairs of coordinates must match:
- `(0, 0)` with `(2, 2)`
- `(0, 1)` with `(2, 1)`
- `(0, 2)` with `(2, 0)`
- `(1, 0)` with `(1, 2)`
- `(2, 0)` with `(0, 2)`
- `(2, 1)` with `(0, 1)`
- `(2, 2)` with `(0, 0)`

However, the conditions in the provided program only check a limited number of these pairs and do not account for all necessary checks. Specifically, the checks do not include symmetry for the second row or the second column correctly, and thus the function could return incorrect results for valid symmetric inputs.

For example, the input:
```
X.X
X..
...
```
would incorrectly yield "NO" from the provided program, although it should return "YES" since it is symmetric.

Therefore, since the program does not accurately implement the required checks for symmetry, it fails the correctness criteria set forth in the problem description.
