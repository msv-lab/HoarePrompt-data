The code `lines.append(sys.stdin.readline())` appends a new line from input to the `lines` list. The variable `i` is currently 2, which is less than 3, allowing the loop to execute a third time. The state of `lines` will change as it receives a new line from input. The exact content of the new line is unknown since it depends on user input, but it will be added to the `lines` list. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `lines` contains two input lines from `sys.stdin`, `i` is 2, and we append a new line to `lines`.
Output State: **`lines` contains two input lines from `sys.stdin`, `i` is 2, and we append a new line to `lines`.**
