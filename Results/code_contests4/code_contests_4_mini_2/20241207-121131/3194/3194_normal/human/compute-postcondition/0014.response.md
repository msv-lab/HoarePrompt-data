Functionality: ** The function reads three lines of input from standard input, each containing a string of characters 'X' or '.'. It then checks specific conditions involving the presence of 'X' in certain positions of the first and last lines, as well as the second line. If any of the conditions are met, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any value but prints the result directly. It does not validate the input format or size beyond reading three lines. **
