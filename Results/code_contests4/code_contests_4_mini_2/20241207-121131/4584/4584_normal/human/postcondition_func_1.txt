The function accepts two parameters: `bottle`, which represents the number of ordered bottles, and `cup`, which represents the number of friends. It returns False if the bottle is empty or the cup is full. If both conditions are satisfied (i.e., the bottle has milk and the cup has space), it transfers milk from the bottle to the cup, updating their respective states accordingly, and returns True. Additionally, if the amount of milk in the bottle exceeds the available space in the cup, it reduces the milk in the bottle by the space available in the cup and fills the cup to its capacity.
