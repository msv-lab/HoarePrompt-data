You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Students love to celebrate their holidays. Especially if the holiday is the day of the end of exams!

Despite the fact that Igor K., unlike his groupmates, failed to pass a programming test, he decided to invite them to go to a cafe so that each of them could drink a bottle of... fresh cow milk. Having entered the cafe, the m friends found n different kinds of milk on the menu, that's why they ordered n bottles — one bottle of each kind. We know that the volume of milk in each bottle equals w.

When the bottles were brought in, they decided to pour all the milk evenly among the m cups, so that each got a cup. As a punishment for not passing the test Igor was appointed the person to pour the milk. He protested that he was afraid to mix something up and suggested to distribute the drink so that the milk from each bottle was in no more than two different cups. His friends agreed but they suddenly faced the following problem — and what is actually the way to do it?

Help them and write the program that will help to distribute the milk among the cups and drink it as quickly as possible!

Note that due to Igor K.'s perfectly accurate eye and unswerving hands, he can pour any fractional amount of milk from any bottle to any cup.

Input

The only input data file contains three integers n, w and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 100 ≤ w ≤ 1000, 2 ≤ m ≤ 50), where n stands for the number of ordered bottles, w stands for the volume of each of them and m stands for the number of friends in the company.

Output

Print on the first line "YES" if it is possible to pour the milk so that the milk from each bottle was in no more than two different cups. If there's no solution, print "NO".

If there is a solution, then print m more lines, where the i-th of them describes the content of the i-th student's cup. The line should consist of one or more pairs that would look like "b v". Each such pair means that v (v > 0) units of milk were poured into the i-th cup from bottle b (1 ≤ b ≤ n). All numbers b on each line should be different.

If there are several variants to solve the problem, print any of them. Print the real numbers with no less than 6 digits after the decimal point.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of ordered bottles (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), w is an integer representing the volume of each bottle (100 ≤ w ≤ 1000), and m is an integer representing the number of friends (2 ≤ m ≤ 50).
def func_1(x):
    if (x < 0) :
        return -x < eps
        #The program returns True if -x is less than eps, where x is an integer that is less than 0.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer representing the number of ordered bottles (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), `w` is an integer representing the volume of each bottle (100 ≤ w ≤ 1000), `m` is an integer representing the number of friends (2 ≤ m ≤ 50), and `x` is greater than or equal to 0.
    return x < eps
    #The program returns whether x is less than eps, where eps is a small positive value that is not specified in the initial state.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: bottle is a positive integer representing the number of ordered bottles (1 ≤ bottle ≤ 50), cup is a positive integer representing the number of friends (2 ≤ cup ≤ 50). Each bottle has a volume w (100 ≤ w ≤ 1000) that is a positive integer.
def func_2(bottle, cup):
    if (bottle.is_empty() or cup.is_full()) :
        return False
        #The program returns False, indicating that either the 'bottle' is empty or the 'cup' is full.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`bottle` is a positive integer representing the number of ordered bottles (1 ≤ bottle ≤ 50), `cup` is a positive integer representing the number of friends (2 ≤ cup ≤ 50), each bottle has a volume `w` (100 ≤ w ≤ 1000) that is a positive integer. The bottle is not empty, and the cup is not full.
    space_in_cup = cup.space_left()
    if (bottle.milk <= space_in_cup) :
        cup.milk += bottle.milk
        cup.ingridients.append((bottle.no, bottle.milk))
        bottle.milk = 0.0
    else :
        bottle.milk -= space_in_cup
        cup.milk = cup.capacity
        cup.ingridients.append((bottle.no, space_in_cup))
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`bottle` is a positive integer representing the number of ordered bottles, `cup` is a positive integer representing the number of friends, and `w` is a volume between 100 and 1000. If `bottle.milk` is less than or equal to the available `space_in_cup`, then `bottle.milk` is 0.0. Otherwise, `bottle.milk` is reduced by `space_in_cup`, `cup.milk` is now equal to `cup.capacity`, and `cup.ingridients` now includes `(bottle.no, space_in_cup)`
    return True
    #The program returns True

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), w is an integer between 100 and 1000 (inclusive), and m is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive).
def func_3(n, w, m):
    bottles = [Bottle(i + 1, w) for i in range(n)]
    Cup.capacity = float(n * w) / float(m)
    cups = [Cup() for i in range(m)]
    ci = 0
    for bi in range(n):
        bottle = bottles[bi]
        
        func_2(bottle, cups[ci])
        
        if not bottle.is_empty():
            if ci + 1 > m:
                return []
            func_2(bottle, cups[ci + 1])
            if not bottle.is_empty():
                return []
        
        while ci + 1 < m and cups[ci].is_full():
            ci += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is between 1 and 50, `w` is between 100 and 1000, `m` is the number of cups that have been filled, `Cup.capacity` is calculated as `float(n * w) / float(m)`, `cups` is a list of `m` instances of `Cup`, `ci` is equal to `m` (the index of the first cup that is not full, which is at least `m` if all cups are full), `bi` is equal to `n` (the total number of bottles), and `bottle` is assigned the last bottle in the `bottles` list. All cups from index 0 to `m - 1` are full.
    return [cup.ingridients for cup in cups]
    #The program returns a list of ingredients for each cup in the list 'cups', which consists of 'm' instances of Cup that are all full.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
