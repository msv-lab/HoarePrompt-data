Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description for a few reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: The program does not seem to handle the input parameters properly. The `func_3` function initializes `Cup.capacity` without properly defining what a `Cup` is or how many total cups to create based on the input parameters. It does not follow the function signature or the expectations laid out in the problem statement.

2. **Distribution Logic**: While the program attempts to pour milk from each bottle into the cups, it does not ensure that the milk from each bottle is poured into no more than two different cups as explicitly required by the problem description. The logic used in `func_2` does not enforce this constraint, which is a crucial part of the problem.

3. **Output Format**: The output format specified in the problem description indicates that the program must print "YES" or "NO" followed by the distribution of milk if applicable. The program does not provide this output format and instead returns a list of ingredients for each cup, which is not aligned with the expected output structure.

4. **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not clearly handle edge cases, such as when `m` is greater than `n`, which can result in an immediate "NO". The constraints must be checked before attempting the distribution.

Overall, the program fails to follow the problem description correctly, particularly in ensuring the correct distribution of milk from each bottle and adhering to the specified output format. This indicates a fundamental flaw in the approach to solving the problem as described.
