#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of ordered bottles (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), w is an integer representing the volume of each bottle (100 ≤ w ≤ 1000), and m is an integer representing the number of friends (2 ≤ m ≤ 50).
def func_1(x):
    if (x < 0) :
        return -x < eps
        #The program returns True if -x is less than eps, where x is an integer that is less than 0.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer representing the number of ordered bottles (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), `w` is an integer representing the volume of each bottle (100 ≤ w ≤ 1000), `m` is an integer representing the number of friends (2 ≤ m ≤ 50), and `x` is greater than or equal to 0.
    return x < eps
    #The program returns whether x is less than eps, where eps is a small positive value that is not specified in the initial state.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `x` and returns `True` if `x` is negative and its absolute value is less than `eps`. If `x` is non-negative, it returns whether `x` is less than `eps`. The behavior relies on the value of `eps`, which is not defined in the code.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: bottle is a positive integer representing the number of ordered bottles (1 ≤ bottle ≤ 50), cup is a positive integer representing the number of friends (2 ≤ cup ≤ 50). Each bottle has a volume w (100 ≤ w ≤ 1000) that is a positive integer.

    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`bottle` is a positive integer representing the number of ordered bottles (1 ≤ bottle ≤ 50), `cup` is a positive integer representing the number of friends (2 ≤ cup ≤ 50), each bottle has a volume `w` (100 ≤ w ≤ 1000) that is a positive integer. The bottle is not empty, and the cup is not full.

    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`bottle` is a positive integer representing the number of ordered bottles, `cup` is a positive integer representing the number of friends, and `w` is a volume between 100 and 1000. If `bottle.milk` is less than or equal to the available `space_in_cup`, then `bottle.milk` is 0.0. Otherwise, `bottle.milk` is reduced by `space_in_cup`, `cup.milk` is now equal to `cup.capacity`, and `cup.ingridients` now includes `(bottle.no, space_in_cup)`
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters: `bottle`, which represents the number of ordered bottles, and `cup`, which represents the number of friends. It returns False if the bottle is empty or the cup is full. If both conditions are satisfied (i.e., the bottle has milk and the cup has space), it transfers milk from the bottle to the cup, updating their respective states accordingly, and returns True. Additionally, if the amount of milk in the bottle exceeds the available space in the cup, it reduces the milk in the bottle by the space available in the cup and fills the cup to its capacity.

All cups from index 0 to `m - 1` are full.
    return [cup.ingridients for cup in cups]
    #The program returns a list of ingredients for each cup in the list 'cups', which consists of 'm' instances of Cup that are all full.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer between 1 and 50), `w` (an integer between 100 and 1000), and `m` (an integer between 2 and 50). It creates `n` bottles and `m` cups, and attempts to fill the cups with the contents of the bottles. The function returns a list of ingredients for each cup if all cups are full; otherwise, it returns an empty list. If there are not enough bottles to fill all cups, or if the bottles are empty before filling all cups, it will return an empty list.
