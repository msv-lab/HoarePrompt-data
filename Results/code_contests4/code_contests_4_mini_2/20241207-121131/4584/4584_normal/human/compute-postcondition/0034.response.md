To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we analyze the `while` loop condition: `ci + 1 < m and cups[ci].is_full()`.

1. **Condition Breakdown**:
   - The loop will execute if `ci + 1 < m` is true.
   - The loop will also execute if `cups[ci].is_full()` is true.
   
2. **Current State**:
   - We know that `ci` is `m - 1`. Therefore, `ci + 1` equals `m`.
   - This means the condition `ci + 1 < m` is currently false since `m` cannot be less than itself.

3. **Adjustment Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `ci + 1 < m` is true. This can be achieved by adjusting `m` to be greater than `ci + 1`, which is `m - 1 + 1 = m`. So we need `m` to be at least `m + 1`, which means `m` must be increased.
   - The condition `cups[ci].is_full()` is currently true as stated in the previous iteration's state, so no adjustment is needed for that.

Thus, the only adjustment needed is to increase `m` by at least 1.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 50, `w` is between 100 and 1000, `m` is at least 1 greater than its previous value, `Cup.capacity` is calculated as `float(n * w) / float(m)`, `cups` is a list of `m` instances of `Cup`, `ci` is `m - 1`, `bi` is 1, `bottle` is assigned the value of `bottles[1]`, and `cups[ci]` is full**.
