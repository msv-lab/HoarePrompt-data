Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 50, `w` is between 100 and 1000, `m` is at least equal to the number of cups that are full, `Cup.capacity` is calculated as `float(n * w) / float(m)`, `cups` is a list of `m` instances of `Cup`, `ci` is equal to the index of the first cup that is not full (which is at least `m` if all cups are full), `bi` is 2, `bottle` is assigned the value of `bottles[2]`, and `cups[ci].is_full()` is False.**
