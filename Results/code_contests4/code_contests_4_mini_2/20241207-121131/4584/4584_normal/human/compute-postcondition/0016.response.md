According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `ci` and `m`, as well as the condition `cups[ci].is_full()`. The loop will execute if `ci + 1` is less than `m` and the current cup `cups[ci]` is full.

Right before the loop, `ci` is 0 and `m` is between 2 and 50, which means `ci + 1` is 1, and it is less than `m`. This condition is satisfied. However, we need to ensure that `cups[ci]` (which is `cups[0]`) is full for the loop to execute. 

Since the statement mentions that `cups` is a list of `m` instances of `Cup`, we currently do not have information about whether `cups[0]` is full or not. Thus, to guarantee the loop executes, we need to adjust the state such that `cups[0]` is indeed full.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 50, `w` is between 100 and 1000, `m` is between 2 and 50, `Cup.capacity` is calculated as `float(n * w) / float(m)`, `cups` is a list of `m` instances of `Cup`, `ci` is 0, `bi` is 0, `bottle` is assigned the value of `bottles[0]`, if `bottle` is not empty, `func_2(bottle, cups[1])` is called, and for the loop to execute the first time, `cups[0].is_full()` must be true.**
