The value of `Cup.capacity` is assigned the result of the expression `float(n * w) / float(m)`. Given that `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `w` is an integer between 100 and 1000 (inclusive), and `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), the value of `Cup.capacity` will be a float calculated from these variables. The states of the other variables are not affected by this assignment.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 50; `w` is an integer between 100 and 1000; `m` is an integer between 2 and 50; `Cup.capacity` is calculated as `float(n * w) / float(m)`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50; `w` is an integer between 100 and 1000; `m` is an integer between 2 and 50; `Cup.capacity` is calculated as `float(n * w) / float(m)`**
