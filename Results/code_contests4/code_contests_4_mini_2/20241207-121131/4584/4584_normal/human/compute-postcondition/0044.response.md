Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 50; `w` is between 100 and 1000; `m` is at least equal to the number of cups that are full; `Cup.capacity` is calculated as `float(n * w) / float(m)`; `cups` is a list of `m` instances of `Cup`; `ci` is equal to `m`; `bi` is 2; `bottle` is assigned the value of `bottles[2]`; `cups[ci]` is full; the function call `func_2(bottle, cups[ci + 1])` is made; if `ci + 1` is greater than `m`, it would return an empty list []; otherwise, no return value is specified.**
