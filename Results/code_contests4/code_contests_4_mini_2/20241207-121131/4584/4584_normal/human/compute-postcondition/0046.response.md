Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 50, `w` is between 100 and 1000, `m` is at least equal to the number of cups that are full, `Cup.capacity` is calculated as `float(n * w) / float(m)`, `cups` is a list of `m` instances of `Cup`, `ci` is equal to `m`, `bi` is 2, and `bottle` is assigned the value of `bottles[2]`. If `bottle` is not empty, the program returns an empty list []; otherwise, no return value is specified.***
