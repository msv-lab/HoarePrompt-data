The value of `ci` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ci` is `m - 2`. Therefore, after execution, `ci` will be `m - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 50, `w` is between 100 and 1000, `m` is between 2 and 50, `Cup.capacity` is calculated as `float(n * w) / float(m)`, `cups` is a list of `m` instances of `Cup`, `ci` is `m - 1`, `bi` is 1, `bottle` is assigned the value of `bottles[1]`, and `cups[ci]` is full.**
