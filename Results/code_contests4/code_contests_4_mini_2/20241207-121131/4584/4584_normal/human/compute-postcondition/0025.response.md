The function `func_2` is called with two arguments: `bottle` and `cups[ci]`. The variable `bottle` has been assigned the value of `bottles[1]`, and `ci` is equal to `m - 1`, which means we are accessing the last element of the `cups` list (since indexing starts at 0). The state of `cups` contains `m` instances of `Cup`, and we do not know the specific values of `bottle` or the properties of the `Cup` instances.

Since the `func_2` function's implementation is not provided, we cannot determine the specific operations or changes that occur within it, but we can state that the function is executed with the current values of `bottle` and the last `Cup` instance.

Therefore, the output state reflects the parameters passed into the function call, along with the current state of the surrounding variables.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 50, `w` is between 100 and 1000, `m` is between 2 and 50, `Cup.capacity` is calculated as `float(n * w) / float(m)`, `cups` is a list of `m` instances of `Cup`, `ci` is equal to `m - 1`, `bi` is 1, `bottle` is assigned the value of `bottles[1]`, and `func_2` is called with arguments `bottle` and `cups[ci]`.**
