The value of `ci` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `ci` is unknown. Therefore, the output state reflects that `ci` has increased by 1, while the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 50, `w` is between 100 and 1000, `m` is between 2 and 50, `Cup.capacity` is calculated as `float(n * w) / float(m)`, `cups` is a list of `m` instances of `Cup`, `ci` is increased by 1, `bi` is 0, `bottle` is assigned the value of `bottles[0]` (if not empty, `func_2(bottle, cups[1])` is called), and `cups[0].is_full()` must be true for the loop to execute the first time.**
