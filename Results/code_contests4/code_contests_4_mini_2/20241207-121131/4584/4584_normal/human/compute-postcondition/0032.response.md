According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `ci`, `m`, and the state of the `cups` list. The loop will execute if both conditions `ci + 1 < m` and `cups[ci].is_full()` are true.

1. **Condition 1: `ci + 1 < m`**  
   Currently, `ci` is equal to `m - 1`, therefore `ci + 1` equals `m`. This means that `ci + 1 < m` is currently false. To enable the loop to execute, `ci` needs to be adjusted to be less than `m - 1`. Thus, `ci` could be set to `m - 2` or lower.

2. **Condition 2: `cups[ci].is_full()`**  
   This condition checks if the cup at index `ci` is full. We need to ensure that `cups[ci]` is full for the loop to execute. If it is not full, then we need to ensure it is modified so it reflects a full state.

Given these adjustments, the necessary changes to the state include modifying `ci` and ensuring the cup at index `ci` is full.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 50, `w` is between 100 and 1000, `m` is between 2 and 50, `Cup.capacity` is calculated as `float(n * w) / float(m)`, `cups` is a list of `m` instances of `Cup`, ci is adjusted to be `m - 2`, `bi` is 1, and `bottle` is assigned the value of `bottles[1]`, and `cups[ci]` is full.**
