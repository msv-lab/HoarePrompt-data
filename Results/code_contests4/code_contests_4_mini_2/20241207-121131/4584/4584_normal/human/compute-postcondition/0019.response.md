The value of `ci` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `ci` is 1. Therefore, after execution, `ci` becomes 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 50, `w` is between 100 and 1000, `m` is between 2 and 50, `Cup.capacity` is calculated as `float(n * w) / float(m)`, `cups` is a list of `m` instances of `Cup`, `ci` is 2, `bi` is 0, `bottle` is assigned the value of `bottles[0]`, and for the loop to execute again, `cups[1].is_full()` must be true.
