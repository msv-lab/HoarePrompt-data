The value of `ci` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value of `m - 1` to `m`. The other variables remain unchanged, so the output state is: `n` is between 1 and 50, `w` is between 100 and 1000, `m` is at least 1 greater than its previous value, `Cup.capacity` is calculated as `float(n * w) / float(m)`, `cups` is a list of `m` instances of `Cup`, `ci` is now `m`, `bi` is 1, `bottle` is assigned the value of `bottles[1]`, and `cups[ci]` is full.
