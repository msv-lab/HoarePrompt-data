Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 50, `w` is between 100 and 1000, `m` is between 2 and 50, `Cup.capacity` is calculated as `float(n * w) / float(m)`, `cups` is a list of `m` instances of `Cup`, `ci` is equal to `m - 1` (the index of the last cup), `bi` is 0, `bottle` is assigned the value of `bottles[0]`, and for the loop to finish executing, all cups from index 0 to `m - 1` must be full (`cups[0].is_full()`, `cups[1].is_full()`, ..., `cups[m-1].is_full()` must all be true).**
