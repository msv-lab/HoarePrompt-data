Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 50, `w` is between 100 and 1000, `m` is between 2 and 50, `Cup.capacity` is calculated as `float(n * w) / float(m)`, `cups` is a list of `m` instances of `Cup`, `ci` is equal to `m - 1`, `bi` is 1, and `bottle` is assigned the value of `bottles[1]`. If `ci + 1` is greater than `m`, the program returns an empty list.***
