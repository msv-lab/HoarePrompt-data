The function `func_2` is called with parameters `bottle` and `cups[ci + 1]`. Given that `ci` is currently 0, `ci + 1` equals 1, which is within the range of `m` (between 2 and 50). Thus, the call to `func_2` is valid and will execute with the next cup in the list, `cups[1]`.

The values of `n`, `w`, `m`, `Cup.capacity`, `cups`, `ci`, and `bi` remain unchanged, as this operation does not alter these variables. The state of `bottle` is also unchanged, but it is being passed to the function.

Therefore, the output state reflects that we are making a function call with the current parameters, while the other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 50, `w` is between 100 and 1000, `m` is between 2 and 50, `Cup.capacity` is calculated as `float(n * w) / float(m)`, `cups` is a list of `m` instances of `Cup`, `ci` is 0, `bi` is 0, `bottle` is assigned the value of `bottles[0]`, and `func_2(bottle, cups[1])` is called.**
