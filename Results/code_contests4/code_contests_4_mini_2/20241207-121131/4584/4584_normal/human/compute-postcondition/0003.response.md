The value of `ci` is initialized to 0. No other variables are affected, and the previous values of `n`, `w`, `m`, and `Cup.capacity` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 50; `w` is an integer between 100 and 1000; `m` is an integer between 2 and 50; `Cup.capacity` is calculated as `float(n * w) / float(m); cups` is a list of `m` instances of `Cup`; `ci` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50; `w` is an integer between 100 and 1000; `m` is an integer between 2 and 50; `Cup.capacity` is calculated as `float(n * w) / float(m); cups` is a list of `m` instances of `Cup`; `ci` is 0.**
