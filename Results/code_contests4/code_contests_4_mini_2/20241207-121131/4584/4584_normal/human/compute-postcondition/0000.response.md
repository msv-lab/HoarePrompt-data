The code creates a list of `Bottle` objects. The value of `n` determines how many `Bottle` instances are created, each initialized with a unique identifier (from 1 to `n`) and the weight `w`. The range function generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n-1`, and each number is incremented by 1 to set the identifier for each `Bottle`. The values of `w` and `m` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State reflects the creation of `n` `Bottle` instances with their respective identifiers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive); `w` is an integer between 100 and 1000 (inclusive); `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive); `bottles` is a list of `Bottle` objects with identifiers from 1 to `n` and weight `w`.**
