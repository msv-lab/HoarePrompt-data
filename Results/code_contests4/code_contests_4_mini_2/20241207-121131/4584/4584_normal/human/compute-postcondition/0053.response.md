The value of `ci` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ci` was `m - 1`, so after execution, the new value of `ci` will be `m`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 50, `w` is between 100 and 1000, `m` is at least equal to the number of cups that are full, `Cup.capacity` is calculated as `float(n * w) / float(m)`, `cups` is a list of `m` instances of `Cup`, `ci` is `m`, `bi` is 2, `bottle` is assigned the value of `bottles[2]`, and `cups[ci].is_full()` is True.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 50, `w` is between 100 and 1000, `m` is at least equal to the number of cups that are full, `Cup.capacity` is calculated as `float(n * w) / float(m)`, `cups` is a list of `m` instances of `Cup`, `ci` is `m`, `bi` is 2, `bottle` is assigned the value of `bottles[2]`, and `cups[ci].is_full()` is True.**
