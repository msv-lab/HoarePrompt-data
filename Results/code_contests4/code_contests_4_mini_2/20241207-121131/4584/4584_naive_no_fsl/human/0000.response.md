To determine the correctness of the provided program according to the problem description, let's analyze the requirements and the code.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Input**: 
   - `n`: Number of different kinds of milk (bottles).
   - `w`: Volume of each milk bottle.
   - `m`: Number of friends (cups).

2. **Output**:
   - "YES" or "NO" depending on whether it's possible to distribute the milk such that each bottle's contents are poured into no more than two different cups.
   - If "YES", also print how much milk each cup receives from which bottle.

3. **Constraints**:
   - Each cup should ideally receive milk such that the total milk in each cup does not exceed the calculated capacity, which is `Cup.capacity = (n * w) / m`.

### Code Functionality:
- The program defines two classes, `Bottle` and `Cup`, to manage the state of the bottles and cups.
- The function `func_3` implements the logic to distribute the milk:
  - It attempts to fill each cup sequentially with milk from the bottles.
  - It ensures that no bottle contributes to more than two cups.
  
### Edge Cases Considered:
1. **When `n` bottles are less than `m` cups**: If there are more cups than bottles, it's impossible to fill each cup with milk from two bottles while adhering to the rule (since every bottle can only fill two cups). This should return "NO".
  
2. **When `m` is too small**: If `m` is less than the number of bottles divided by two (for even distribution), it should also return "NO".

### Testing the Program:
1. **Case 1**: `n = 4`, `w = 100`, `m = 7` should return `NO` as there are not enough cups to allow each bottle to fill two cups.
  
2. **Case 2**: `n = 5`, `w = 500`, `m = 2` should return `YES` with the respective distribution of milk.

3. **Case 3**: `n = 1`, `w = 100`, `m = 2` should return `NO`, as the single bottle cannot fill both cups while following the rule.

### Evaluation of the Code:
- The code correctly implements the logic to check if a distribution is possible according to the rules laid out.
- It manages the state of bottles and cups accurately, attempting to pour milk from each bottle into available cups without exceeding the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The code seems to handle various cases correctly according to the problem description. It checks for impossible scenarios and returns "NO" as expected. The distribution logic appears effective, ensuring that each bottle's contents go into no more than two cups.

Therefore, after analyzing the provided code against the requirements and potential edge cases, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**
