The function processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string of length `n` containing characters '.' (representing empty space) and '*' (representing sheep). For each test case, it calculates the sum of the absolute differences from the median position of the indices of the '*' characters in the string. If no '*' characters are present in the string, it records a sum of 0. After processing all test cases, it prints the results.
