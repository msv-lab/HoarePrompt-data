The code `af.append(0)` adds the integer 0 to the list `af`. The previous state of `af` is unknown, but it will now include an additional element, which is 0. The values of other variables (`t`, `n`, and `l`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is assigned the integer value obtained from `le.pop(); `l` is an empty list; `l` is assigned the value of the list comprehension resulting in an empty list; `af` now includes an additional element 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is assigned the integer value obtained from `le.pop(); `l` is an empty list; `l` is assigned the value of the list comprehension resulting in an empty list; `af` now includes an additional element 0.**
