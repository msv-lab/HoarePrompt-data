The list `l` is updated based on the indices of elements where `'*'` occurs among the first `n` elements. The new list comprehension creates a new list where each element is the difference between the current index `b` and the index `a` from `enumerate(l)`. The previous values of `l` are necessary to determine the specific result of this operation. However, since the exact values in `l` are not provided, we only know that `l` is modified based on the computation.

Output State: **`l` is updated based on the indices of '*' elements from the first `n` elements, resulting in a new list where each element is the difference between indices from the original list.**
