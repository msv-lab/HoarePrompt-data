Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `le` has one less element; `n` is the value of the popped element; `zorg` is still the next integer after the previous value; `l` is updated to a list of indices where elements are equal to '*'. If `l` is not empty, `med` is the middle index value from list `l`, and an element has been appended to `af`, which is the sum of absolute differences from `med` for each element in `l`. Otherwise, `af` is updated to include an additional element with value 0.***
