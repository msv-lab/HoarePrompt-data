The variable `l` is assigned the value obtained from `le.pop()`, which removes and returns the last element of the list `le`. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. The previous values of `le` are not specified, but it is guaranteed to have at least 1 element. Therefore, after execution, `l` will hold the value of the last element that was in `le`, and `n` retains its previously assigned value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is assigned the integer value obtained from `le.pop()`; `l` is the last element of `le` before the pop operation.**
