Postcondition: ***If `l` is not empty, `af` is updated by appending the sum of absolute differences between each element `k` in `l` and `med`. Otherwise, `l` is updated based on the indices of '*' elements from the first `n` elements, resulting in a new list where each element is the difference between indices from the original list, and a new element `0` is appended to `af.***
