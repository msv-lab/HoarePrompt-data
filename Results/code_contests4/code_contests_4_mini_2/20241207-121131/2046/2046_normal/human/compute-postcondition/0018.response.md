`med` is assigned the value of the element at the index `len(l) // 2` in the list `l`. The value of `l` is a list of indices where elements are equal to '*', and its length can be any integer based on the previous state. Since `len(l)` is guaranteed to be an integer and is at least 1 (because `l` has at least one element), `med` will be the middle index of the list `l`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the assignment of `med` and the current state of `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `le` has one less element; `n` is the value of the popped element; `zorg` is still the next integer after the previous value; `l` is updated to a list of indices where elements are equal to '*'; `med` is the middle index value from list `l`.**
