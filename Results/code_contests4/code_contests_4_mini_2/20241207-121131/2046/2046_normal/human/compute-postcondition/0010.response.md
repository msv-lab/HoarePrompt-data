Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is assigned the integer value obtained from `le.pop(); `l` is now an empty list; `l` is assigned the value of the list comprehension [(b - a) for a, b in enumerate(l)], but since `l` is empty, the list comprehension results in an empty list.***
