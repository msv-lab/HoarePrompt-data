The value of `l` is assigned the last element of the list `le` by using the `pop()` method, which removes that last element from `le`. This means that `n` is now the element that has been removed from `le`. The value of `zorg` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `le` has one less element; `n` is the value of the popped element; `zorg` is still the next integer after the previous value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `le` has one less element; `n` is the value of the popped element; `zorg` is still the next integer after the previous value.**
