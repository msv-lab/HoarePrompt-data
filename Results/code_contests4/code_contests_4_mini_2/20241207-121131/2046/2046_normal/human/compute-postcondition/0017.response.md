The list `l` is updated by replacing its current values with the differences between the indices of elements in `l`, which are denoted by `a` and `b`. The `enumerate(l)` function will provide pairs of indices and values from the list `l`. The new list will contain the differences between these indices. The values of `t`, `le`, `n`, and `zorg` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `le` has one less element; `n` is the value of the popped element; `zorg` is still the next integer after the previous value; `l` is updated to a list of indices where elements are equal to '*'.
