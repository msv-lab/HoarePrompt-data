The code assigns a new value to `l` using a list comprehension. It creates a new list containing indices `k` for which the condition `l[k] == '*'` holds true. The previous value of `l` is the last element of the list before the pop operation, but its exact contents are not specified. Since `n` is defined as the integer value obtained from `le.pop()`, it determines the range for the list comprehension.

Therefore, the output state indicates that `l` is being redefined based on the contents of the previous `l`, which we do not know. The output state reflects that `l` is now a list of indices based on a condition involving the previous `l`, with the range determined by `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is assigned the integer value obtained from `le.pop(); `l` is now a list of indices k such that 0 ≤ k < n and l[k] == '*'**.
