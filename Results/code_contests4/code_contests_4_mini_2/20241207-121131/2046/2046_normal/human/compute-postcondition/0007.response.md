Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer obtained from `le.pop();` `l` is a non-empty list of indices k such that 0 ≤ k < n and l[k] == '*'; `l` is assigned the value of the list comprehension [(b - a) for a, b in enumerate(l)] which calculates the difference between indices of elements in the modified list.***
