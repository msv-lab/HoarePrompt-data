`af` is updated by appending the sum of absolute differences between each element `k` in `l` and the middle element `med`. The values of `l` and `med` influence the calculation, but since their specific values are not provided, we cannot determine a numeric result. Therefore, the output state describes the relationship of the variables involved.

Output State: **`af` is updated by appending the sum of absolute differences between each element `k` in `l` and `med`.**
