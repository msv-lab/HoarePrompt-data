The value of `med` is the middle element of the list `l`, and `af` is being modified by appending the result of the expression `sum(abs(k - med) for k in l)`. This expression calculates the sum of the absolute differences between each element `k` in the list `l` and the middle element `med`. 

Assuming `l` contains integers and `med` is correctly defined as the middle element, the output state reflects the updated contents of the list `af` after this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer obtained from `le.pop();`; `l` is a modified list of integers; `med` is the middle element of the list `l`; `af` has been updated to include the sum of absolute differences from `med`.**
