The variable `l` is being reassigned to a new list that includes elements from the original list `l`, specifically the indices of elements that are equal to the string `'*'`. The value of `n` determines the range for `k`, which runs from 0 to `n-1`. Since `l` has one less element and `n` is the value of the popped element, the new list comprehension will filter `l` based on the condition provided. 

The previous state of `l` is not fully known, but it will have elements in the original list. The output state will reflect that `l` has been updated to include only the indices where the elements are equal to `'*'`. Other variables like `t`, `zorg`, and `n` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `le` has one less element; `n` is the value of the popped element; `zorg` is still the next integer after the previous value; `l` is updated to a list of indices where elements are equal to '*'**.
