Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is assigned the integer value obtained from `le.pop(); `l` is now a list of indices k such that 0 ≤ k < n and l[k] == '*'; `l` is assigned the value of the list comprehension [(b - a) for a, b in enumerate(l)] which calculates the difference between indices of elements in the modified list.**
