The function `func` does not accept any parameters explicitly. However, it is understood that it processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a corresponding string of length `n`. The constraints specify that `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n` is an integer that indicates the length of the string, which consists of characters '.' (representing empty space) and '*' (representing sheep). 

The function processes these test cases and returns results based on the contents of the strings. Since the specific outputs for these test cases are not provided, we can summarize the functionality generically.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer `n` and a string of length `n` made up of '.' and '*'. It returns results based on the analysis of these strings for the given test cases.**
