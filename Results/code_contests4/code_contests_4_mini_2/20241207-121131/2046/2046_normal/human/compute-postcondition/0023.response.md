Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `le` has at least one element remaining; `n` is the new value of the popped element from `le`; `zorg` is the next integer after the previous value plus 1; `l` is updated to a list of indices where elements are equal to '*'; if `l` is not empty, `med` is the middle index value from list `l`, and an element has been appended to `af`, which is the sum of absolute differences from `med` for each element in `l`.**
