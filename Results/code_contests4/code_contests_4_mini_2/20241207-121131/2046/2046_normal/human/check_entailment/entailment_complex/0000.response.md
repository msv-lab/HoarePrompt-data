Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Here are the key points of failure:

1. **Median Calculation**: The program attempts to calculate the position where the sheep should ideally be lined up by using the median of their current positions. While this approach minimizes the sum of absolute differences, it does not ensure that the sheep will line up without gaps. The problem requires that sheep be moved to be contiguous without any empty spaces between them, and simply calculating the median does not guarantee this.

2. **Movement Calculation**: The program computes the sum of absolute differences from the median position, which does not correspond to the actual minimum number of moves needed to line up the sheep. The actual number of moves should be based on the direct movement of sheep to fill in the gaps between them, ensuring that they are contiguous.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where there is only one sheep or when there are no sheep correctly. The output should reflect the specific moves needed to line up the sheep, not just a sum of distances from a central point.

For example, consider the input case with the string "*.*...*.**":
- The correct output should calculate how many individual moves are needed to rearrange the sheep into a contiguous block, which is not what the program computes.

In summary, the approach taken by the program does not align with the requirements of the problem description, leading to incorrect results.
