#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 150000) followed by n integers a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing prices for n days. The number of tuples in arr is t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10000), and the sum of n over all tuples does not exceed 150000.
def func_1(arr):
    days = 0
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        for j in range(1, len(arr)):
            if arr[i] > arr[j]:
                days += 1
                break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `days` is equal to the count of tuples in `arr` that have at least one other tuple less than themselves, `arr` is a list of tuples with at least 2 tuples, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, and `j` is `len(arr)`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of tuples `arr`, counts how many tuples have at least one other tuple with a lower price, but currently does not return any result and has a logical flaw in the nested loop that may prevent it from working as intended.
