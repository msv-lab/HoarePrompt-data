According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j`. The loop runs as long as `j` is less than `len(arr)`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1. Therefore, `j` will be 3 for the next iteration. 

Also, since `j` must be less than `len(arr)` for the loop to execute again, `len(arr)` must be greater than 3. 

State: **`days` is equal to the count of tuples in `arr` that are greater than `arr[i]`, `j` is 3, `i` is `len(arr) - 2`, for the loop to execute one more time `len(arr)` must be greater than 3.**
