According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `arr`. If `arr` has at least 2 tuples, the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `days` is 1, `arr` is a list of tuples with at least 2 tuples, and `j` is 1. For the loop to be executed one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 2. The loop can only execute again if `len(arr)` is at least 3, since `j` must be less than the length of `arr`.

State: **`days` is 1, `arr` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, and `j` is 2**
