The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`. `arr` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 150000) followed by `n` integers `a_i` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing prices for `n` days. The number of tuples in `arr` is `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10000), and the sum of `n` over all tuples does not exceed 150000. After executing the function body, it processes the input `arr` and returns a result based on the prices contained in the tuples. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of tuples `arr`, where each tuple consists of an integer followed by a list of prices for several days, and it returns a processed result based on these prices.**
