The value of `days` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `days` is equal to the count of tuples in `arr` that are greater than `arr[i]`. Since `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[j]`, it implies there are some tuples in `arr` greater than `arr[i]`. Therefore, the output state reflects the increment in `days`. 

Output State: **`days` is equal to the count of tuples in `arr` that are greater than `arr[i]` + 1, `arr` is a list of at least 2 tuples, `j` is 1, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, and `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[j]`.**
