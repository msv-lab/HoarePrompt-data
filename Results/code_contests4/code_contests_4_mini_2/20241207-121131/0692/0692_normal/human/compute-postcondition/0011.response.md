According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `arr`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `len(arr)`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `arr` has at least 3 tuples, indicating that the loop has executed for `j` values 1 and 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 3. Additionally, for the loop to execute a fourth time, `arr` must have at least 4 tuples.

State: **`days` is 2, `arr` is a list of tuples with at least 4 tuples, `j` is 3**
