Postcondition: ***`days` is equal to the count of tuples in `arr` that are greater than `arr[i]`, `arr` is a list of tuples with at least 2 tuples, `j` is 1, and `i` is `len(arr) - 2`. If `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[j]`, then `days` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
