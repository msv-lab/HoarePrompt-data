The value of `days` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `days` is the count of tuples in `arr` that are greater than `arr[i]` plus 1. Since `days` is updated by adding 1, the new value of `days` is the previous value plus 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `days` is the count of tuples in `arr` that are greater than `arr[i]` plus 1; `j` is 2.

Output State: **`days` is the count of tuples in `arr` that are greater than `arr[i]` plus 1; `j` is 2**
