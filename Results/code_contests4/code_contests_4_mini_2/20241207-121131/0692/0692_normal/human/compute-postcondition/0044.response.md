Postcondition: ***`days` is equal to the count of tuples in `arr` that are greater than `arr[i]` plus 1, and if `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[j]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `arr[i]` is not greater than `arr[j]`, the program continues execution without breaking.***
