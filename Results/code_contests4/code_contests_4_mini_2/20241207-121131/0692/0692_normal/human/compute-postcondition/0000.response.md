The variable `days` is initialized to 0, and its value will remain unchanged as no operations are performed on it in the given code snippet. The other variables, including those in the list of tuples `arr`, are also unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of tuples, and `days` is 0.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of tuples, `days` is 0**
