According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `arr`. For the loop to execute, `arr` must contain at least 2 tuples, which means `len(arr)` must be at least 2. The loop starts with `j` initialized to 1. Since `days` is 0, it does not affect the loop's execution. Thus, for the loop to execute the first time, `arr` must be a list of tuples with at least 2 tuples, `j` is 1.

State: **`days` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `arr` is a list of tuples with at least 2 tuples, `j` is 1**
