The value of `days` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `days` is 0, so after execution, `days` will be 1. The states of the other variables (`arr`, `j`, and the condition comparing tuples at indices `i` and `j` in `arr`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `days` is 1, `arr` is a list of tuples, `j` is 1, and the tuple at index `i` in `arr` is greater than the tuple at index `j` in `arr`.

Output State: **`days` is 1, `arr` is a list of tuples, `j` is 1, and the tuple at index `i` in `arr` is greater than the tuple at index `j` in `arr`.**
