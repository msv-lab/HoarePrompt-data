The function `func_1` accepts a list of tuples `arr`, where each tuple contains an integer followed by a list of prices for multiple days. The function processes this list to count how many tuples in `arr` have at least one other tuple with a lower price. The logic iterates through each tuple and compares it against all others, incrementing a counter `days` whenever a lower-priced tuple is found. However, the current implementation of the nested loop is flawed as it does not correctly iterate over the tuples; it checks the same tuple against itself due to the incorrect loop range for `j`. 

As a result, the function will likely not count correctly in some cases. It also lacks a return statement, meaning the function does not return any value despite the annotations suggesting it does some processing based on the prices. Thus, it does not fulfill the implied expectation of providing a meaningful result. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of tuples `arr`, counts how many tuples have at least one other tuple with a lower price, but currently does not return any result and has a logical flaw in the nested loop that may prevent it from working as intended. **
