The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `days` is equal to the count of tuples in `arr` that are greater than `arr[i]` + 1, `arr` is a list of at least 2 tuples, `j` is 1, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, and `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[j]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
