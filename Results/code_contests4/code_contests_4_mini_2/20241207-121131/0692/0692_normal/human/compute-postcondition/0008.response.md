The value of `days` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `days` is 1, so after execution, `days` becomes 2. The states of the other variables (`arr` and `j`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `days` is 2, `arr` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `j` is 2.

Output State: **`days` is 2, `arr` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `j` is 2**
