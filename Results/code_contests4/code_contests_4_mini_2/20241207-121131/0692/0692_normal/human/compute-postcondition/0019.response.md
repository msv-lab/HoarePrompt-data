Output State: **`days` is incremented by 1, resulting in a new value of `days` equal to the previous count of tuples in `arr` that are greater than `arr[i]` plus 1; `arr` is a list of tuples with at least 2 tuples, `j` is 1, `i` is `len(arr) - 2`, and the tuple at index `arr[i]` is greater than the tuple at index `arr[j]`.**
