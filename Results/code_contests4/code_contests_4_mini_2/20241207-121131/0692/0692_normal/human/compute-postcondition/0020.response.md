The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `days` is incremented by 1, `arr` is a list of tuples with at least 2 tuples, `j` is 1, `i` is `len(arr) - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
