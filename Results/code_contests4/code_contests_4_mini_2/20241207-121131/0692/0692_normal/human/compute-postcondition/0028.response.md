The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `days` is equal to the count of tuples in `arr` that are greater than `arr[i]`; `j` is 3; `i` is `len(arr) - 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
