According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `arr`. The loop iterates over the range starting from 1 up to the length of `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `days` is equal to the count of tuples in `arr` that are greater than `arr[i]` plus 1, and `arr` is a list of at least 2 tuples. Since `j` is iterating from 1, it means that the last value of `j` was `len(arr) - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it equal to `len(arr)`. 

However, since `j` will then be out of the range defined by `range(1, len(arr))`, the loop cannot execute again. Therefore, we should note that the loop cannot run again.

State: **`days` is equal to the count of tuples in `arr` that are greater than `arr[i]` plus 1, and `arr` is a list of at least 2 tuples where `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[j]`, leading to the termination of the most internal loop or if statement. `j` is equal to `len(arr)` (which is outside the range for the loop to execute again).**
