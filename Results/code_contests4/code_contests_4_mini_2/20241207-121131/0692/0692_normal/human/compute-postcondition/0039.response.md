The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `days` is equal to the count of tuples in `arr` that are greater than `arr[i]` plus 1; `j` is equal to `len(arr)` (which is outside the range for the loop to execute again); `days` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop.
