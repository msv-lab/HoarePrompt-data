According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the length of `arr`. The loop starts at `j = 1` and goes up to `len(arr) - 1`. Since `arr` is specified to have at least 2 tuples, `len(arr)` is at least 2, which means `j` can take on the values from 1 to at least 1 (inclusive). 

Before the loop starts, `days` represents the count of tuples in `arr` that are greater than `arr[i]`, `arr` is a list of at least 2 tuples, `j` is equal to the length of `arr`, and `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, which means `i` points to the last tuple. 

For the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `j` starts at 1, and since `j` is initialized to `len(arr)` before the loop starts, it needs to be adjusted to `1` for the loop to execute the first time. 

State: **`days` is equal to the count of tuples in `arr` that are greater than `arr[i]`, `arr` is a list of at least 2 tuples, `j` is 1, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`**
