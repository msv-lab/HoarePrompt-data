The value of `days` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `days` is equal to the count of tuples in `arr` that are greater than `arr[i]`. The variables `arr`, `j`, and `i` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `days` is equal to the count of tuples in `arr` that are greater than `arr[i]`, `j` is 2, and `i` is `len(arr) - 2`, and `days` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`days` is equal to the count of tuples in `arr` that are greater than `arr[i]`, `j` is 2, `i` is `len(arr) - 2`, and `days` is incremented by 1.**
