To understand the state before the loop starts, we need to analyze the variables involved in the for loop and their current values.

1. **Loop Definition**: The loop iterates over a range starting from 1 to `len(arr) - 1`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `len(arr)` is greater than 1.

2. **Current States**:
   - `days` is defined as the count of tuples in `arr` that are greater than `arr[i]`.
   - `arr` is a list of tuples with at least 2 tuples.
   - `j` is equal to the length of `arr`.
   - `i` is `len(arr) - 2`, which means it is pointing to the second-to-last tuple in the list.

3. **Loop Execution**: The loop starts from 1 and goes up to `len(arr) - 1`. For the loop to execute at least a second time, it must have at least two iterations. Given the current state, `len(arr)` must be greater than 1.

4. **Specifics for Second Execution**: 
   - For the loop to execute a second time, `j` must initially be set to the length of `arr`, and for the first iteration, `j` starts at `1`.
   - After the first iteration, `j` would increment to `2`, allowing the second iteration to occur.

Thus, the required states for the loop to execute a second time should ensure that `arr` has at least 2 tuples, and at the start of the loop, `j` should be set to 1 (the starting value for the loop), while `i` should be `len(arr) - 2`.

Taking all this into account, the adjusted state is:

State: **`days` is equal to the count of tuples in `arr` that are greater than `arr[i]`, `arr` is a list of tuples with at least 2 tuples, `j` is 1, `i` is `len(arr) - 2` for the loop to execute the second time**.
