According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `N`. Since `j` is currently 0 and the loop is set to iterate from 0 to `N - 1`, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1, making it 1. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` remains less than `N`.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
