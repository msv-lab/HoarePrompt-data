The value of `y` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `y` is unknown as it was not provided in the initial state. The states of the other variables (`N` and `j`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000, `j` is 2, and `y` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000, `j` is 2, and `y` is increased by 1.**
