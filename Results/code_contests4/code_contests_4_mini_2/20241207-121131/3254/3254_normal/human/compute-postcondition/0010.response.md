Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, and `j` is 0. If `a[j]` is less than `a[i]`, and `j` is less than `i`, then `x` is set to 1 and `y` remains 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `i`, then `x` is set to 0 and `y` is incremented by 1, while ensuring that `a[j]` is less than `a[i]`. Otherwise, if the condition does not hold, the program state remains unchanged.***
