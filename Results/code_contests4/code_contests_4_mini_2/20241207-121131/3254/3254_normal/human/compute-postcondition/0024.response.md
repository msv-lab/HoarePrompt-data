The code initializes the variables `x` and `y` to 0. The values of `N`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are unaffected by the current operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000, `ans` is `min(x, y)`, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000, `ans` is `min(x, y)`, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0**
