The value of `x` is incremented by 1, but the value of `x` is not provided in the initial state. The other variables `N` and `j` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000; `j` is 1; `x` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000; `j` is 1; `x` is increased by 1**
