The first line assigns `N` the value of `input()`, which is an integer that satisfies 1 ≤ N ≤ 2000. The second line uses `map` to apply the `abs` function to each integer in the sequence provided via `raw_input().split()`, converting each of these integers into its absolute value. Since the sequence `p` is not explicitly mentioned, it is now assigned to the iterable produced by `map`. The variable `ans` is initialized to 0 and remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2000; `p` consists of `N` absolute integers; `ans` is 0.**
