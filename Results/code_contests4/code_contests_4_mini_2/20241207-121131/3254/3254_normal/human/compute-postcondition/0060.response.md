According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `j` and the value of `N`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `N` must be at least 2, and `j` will be incremented by 1, which means `j` will be 2 for the next iteration.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than 2**
