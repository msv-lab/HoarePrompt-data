The value of `x` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `x` is 0, so after the execution, `x` becomes 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2000, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `j` is 0, and the value of `a[j]` is less than the value of `a[i]`, and `j` is less than `i`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2000, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `j` is 0, and the value of `a[j]` is less than the value of `a[i]`, and `j` is less than `i`**.
