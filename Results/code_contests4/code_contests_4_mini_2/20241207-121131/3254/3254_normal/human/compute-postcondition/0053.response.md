Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000, `j` is 0, `ans` is updated by adding min(x, y). If `j` is less than `i`, then `x` is 1, `y` is 0, and the element at index `j` of array `a` is less than the element at index `i` of array `a`. Otherwise, if `j` is not less than `i`, then `x` is 0, `y` is 1, and the element at index `j` of array `a` is less than the element at index `i` of array `a`.***
