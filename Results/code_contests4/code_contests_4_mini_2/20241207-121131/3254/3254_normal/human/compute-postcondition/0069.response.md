The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer constrained by the condition that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000. Additionally, the function accepts a sequence `p`, which consists of `n` integers, where each integer `pi` in the sequence satisfies the condition |pi| ≤ 10^5. 

The function does not return any specific output based on the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `n` and a sequence of `n` integers `p` that meet the specified constraints. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000) and a sequence p of n integers (|pi| ≤ 10^5 for each integer pi).**
