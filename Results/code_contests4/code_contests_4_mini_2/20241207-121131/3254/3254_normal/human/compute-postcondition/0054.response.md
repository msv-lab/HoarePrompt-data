Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000, `j` is 0, and `ans` is updated by adding min(x, y). If the element at index `j` of array `a` is less than the element at index `i` of array `a`, then if `j` is less than `i`, `x` is set to 1 and `y` is set to 0; otherwise, `x` is set to 0 and `y` is set to 1.***
