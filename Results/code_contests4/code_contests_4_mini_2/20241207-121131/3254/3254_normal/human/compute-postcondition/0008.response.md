In this case, the code increments the value of `y` by 1. The initial value of `y` is 0, so after executing `y += 1`, the new value of `y` will be 1. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `y`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2000, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `j` is 0, and the value of `a[j]` is less than the value of `a[i]`. The value of `j` is greater than or equal to `i`.**
