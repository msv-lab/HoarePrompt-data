The value of `x` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `x` is unknown, so the output state reflects that `x` is increased by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `x` is increased by 1**.
