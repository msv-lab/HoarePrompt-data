Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, and `j` is 0. If `j` is less than `i`, then `x` is set to 1 and `y` remains 0. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than or equal to `i`, then `x` is set to 0 and `y` is incremented by 1, while maintaining the condition that the value of `a[j]` is less than the value of `a[i]`.***
