According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `N`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, resulting in `j` being 2. Since `N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 2000\), for the loop to execute again, `N` must be greater than 2.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than 2**
