The value of `y` is incremented by 1, but since the initial value of `y` is unknown, we cannot determine its new value. The states of the other variables (`ans`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is 1, and `y` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`ans` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is 1, and `y` is incremented by 1.**
