The value of `x` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `x` is unknown. The other variables (`N`, `ans`, `i`, `j`, and `a`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000, `ans` is 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is 0, the value of `a[j]` is less than the value of `a[i]`, and `j` is less than `i`; `x` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000, `ans` is 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is 0, the value of `a[j]` is less than the value of `a[i]`, and `j` is less than `i`; `x` is increased by 1.**
