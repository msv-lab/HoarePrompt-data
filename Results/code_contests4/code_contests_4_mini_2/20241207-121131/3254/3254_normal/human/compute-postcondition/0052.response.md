The value of `y` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `y` is 0, so after execution, `y` will be 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000, `j` is 0, `ans` is updated by adding min(x, y), `x` is 0, `y` is 1, the element at index `j` of array `a` is less than the element at index `i` of array `a`, and `j` is not less than `i`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000, `j` is 0, `ans` is updated by adding min(x, y), `x` is 0, `y` is 1, the element at index `j` of array `a` is less than the element at index `i` of array `a`, and `j` is not less than `i`.**
