Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000; `ans` is the total sum of `min(x, y)` for each index `i` from 0 to N-1, where `x` is the count of elements in array `a` less than `a[i]` before index `i`, and `y` is the count of elements in array `a` less than `a[i]` from index `i` onwards.**
