According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000. Since `j` is currently 0, for the loop to execute again, `j` will be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 1.

For the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be less than `N`, which means `N` must be at least 2. 

State: **`ans` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than 1.**
