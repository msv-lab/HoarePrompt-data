The value of `y` is incremented by 1. However, the previous value of `y` is unknown, so we cannot specify the new value of `y`. The variables `ans`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is 2, and `y` is increased by 1 (previous value unknown).

Output State: **`ans` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is 2, and `y` is increased by 1 (previous value unknown)**.
