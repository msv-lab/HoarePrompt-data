According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop will iterate as long as `j` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and it will execute as long as `N` is greater than 2.

State: **`ans` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than 2**
