Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `N` (1 ≤ N ≤ 2000) and a sequence of `N` integers, where each integer's absolute value is less than or equal to 100,000. It calculates the total sum of the minimum counts of integers less than each element in the sequence, divided into those that appear before and after the current element, and then prints this total sum. **
