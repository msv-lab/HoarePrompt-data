The value of `x` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `x` is unknown as it has not been defined in the initial state. The values of `N`, `ans`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `x` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `x` is increased by 1.**
