Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000, `ans` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, and `j` is 0 with the condition that the value of `a[j]` is less than the value of `a[i]`. If `j` is less than `i`, then `x` is increased by 1; otherwise, if `j` is greater than or equal to `i`, then `y` is increased by 1.***
