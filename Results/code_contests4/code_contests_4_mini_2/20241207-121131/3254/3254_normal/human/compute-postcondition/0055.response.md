According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `N`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000. To execute the loop one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will become 1. For the loop to execute a second time, `N` must be greater than 1.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than 1**
