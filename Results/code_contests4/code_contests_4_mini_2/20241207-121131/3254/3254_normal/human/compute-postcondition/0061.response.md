The value of `x` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `x` is unknown. The variable `j` remains unchanged at 2, and since `N` is an integer within the range of 1 to 2000, the condition for the loop to execute a second time is dependent on `N`. However, this code snippet does not affect `N` or `j`. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000, `j` is 2, and `x` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2000, `j` is 2, and `x` is increased by 1**
