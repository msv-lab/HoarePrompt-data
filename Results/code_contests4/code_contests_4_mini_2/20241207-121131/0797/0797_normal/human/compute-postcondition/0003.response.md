Functionality: ** The function reads two integers, N and K, from input, where N is a non-negative integer and K is a positive integer. It then calculates and prints the minimum of two values: the remainder of N when divided by K (N % K) and the difference between K and that remainder (K - N % K). This effectively finds the minimum distance to the nearest multiple of K from N. **
