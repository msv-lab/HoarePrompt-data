The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Based on the output constraints provided, it is implied that it produces a result based on internal logic related to the constraints of non-negative integer `N` and positive integer `K`. However, without explicit return cases or logic defined in the output, we cannot determine specific return values or cases. Thus, the functionality cannot be clearly defined. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is not specified based on the provided information.**
