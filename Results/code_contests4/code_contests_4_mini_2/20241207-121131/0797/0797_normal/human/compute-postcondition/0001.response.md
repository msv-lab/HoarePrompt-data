To determine the output state, let's analyze the provided code snippet.

1. The code calculates `N % K` which gives the remainder of `N` when divided by `K`.
2. It also calculates `K - N % K`, which represents the amount needed to reach the next multiple of `K` from `N`.
3. The `min()` function is then used to find the smaller of the two values calculated above: `N % K` and `K - N % K`.
4. The result of the `min()` function is printed, but since we are focusing on the output state rather than the printed output, we will describe the state of the variables.

Given that `N` is a non-negative integer and `K` is a positive integer, the output state will reflect these values as they are affected by the calculations:

Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer, `K` is a positive integer, and the result of `min(N % K, K - N % K)` is computed but not stored.**
