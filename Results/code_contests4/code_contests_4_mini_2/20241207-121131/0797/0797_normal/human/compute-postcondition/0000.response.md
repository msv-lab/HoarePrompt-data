The variables `N` and `K` are both assigned new values based on the input received. Specifically, the input is split into two parts and converted to integers. The previous values of `N` and `K` are replaced with the new input values. Therefore, the output state reflects that `N` and `K` now hold the values provided by the user input. 

Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer as provided by input, `K` is a positive integer as provided by input**.
