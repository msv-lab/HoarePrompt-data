The value of `tmp` is multiplied by `i`, where `i` is 3. Therefore, `tmp` is now `tmp * 3`. The states of the other variables `n` and `pow[i]` are not affected by this operation. Thus, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 3, `tmp` is now `tmp * 3`, `pow[i]` is assigned the value of `tmp`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 3, `tmp` is now `tmp * 3`, `pow[i]` is assigned the value of `tmp`.**
