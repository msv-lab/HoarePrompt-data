The value of `pow[i]` is assigned the value of `tmp`. Since `i` is 3, `pow[3]` will now hold the value of `tmp * 3`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 3, `tmp` is now `tmp * 3`, and `pow[3]` is assigned the value of `tmp * 3`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 3, `tmp` is now `tmp * 3`, `pow[3]` is assigned the value of `tmp * 3**
