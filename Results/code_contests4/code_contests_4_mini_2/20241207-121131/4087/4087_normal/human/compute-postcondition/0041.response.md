According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop is set to iterate from 1 to `n + 1` inclusive, which means it will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n + 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 2. 

Since `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 100000 \), for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be at least 1 (which it is, as per the stated constraints).

Thus, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be 2,
- `n` can remain as it is since it satisfies the conditions for the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be at least 1**
