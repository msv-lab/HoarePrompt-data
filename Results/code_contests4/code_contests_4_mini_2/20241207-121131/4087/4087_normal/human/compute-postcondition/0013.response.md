According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit defined by `n`. The loop is designed to run for `i` from 1 to `n + 1` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1, making it 3. 

Since `n` is between 1 and 100000, for the loop to continue executing, `n` must be at least 2 (so that `n + 1` is at least 3). Therefore, when `i` is 3, the loop can execute again if `n` is greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 3, `tmp` is now `tmp * 2`, `pow[i]` is assigned the value of `tmp`, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**
