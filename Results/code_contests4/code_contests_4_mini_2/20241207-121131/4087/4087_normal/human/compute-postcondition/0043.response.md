To compute the output state, we first analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet.

Initial State: 
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100000
- `i` is 2
- `ans` is calculated as `pow[n + 1] / (pow[2] * pow[n - 1])`

The code snippet provided is:
```
x = pow[left + n - right] / (pow[i - 1] * pow[left + n - right - i + 1])
```

In this snippet:
1. `left`, `right`, and `pow` are not defined in the initial state, which means we do not have values for `left` and `right`. Therefore, we cannot compute the expression completely as it depends on those variables.
2. The variable `x` is assigned a value based on the computation involving `left`, `n`, `right`, and `i`.

Since we don't have specific values for `left` and `right`, we cannot determine the exact value of `x`. Hence, the output state will reflect that the computation cannot be completed due to the lack of information about `left` and `right`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100000; `i` is 2; `ans` is calculated as `pow[n + 1] / (pow[2] * pow[n - 1]); `x` cannot be calculated due to undefined `left` and `right` values.**
