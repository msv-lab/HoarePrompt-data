The code assigns the value of `tmp` to the `i`-th index of the array `pow`. Since `i` is 1, `pow[1]` is set to the value of `tmp`. Other variables such as `n` and `i` remain unchanged by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 1, `tmp` remains unchanged, and `pow[1]` is now equal to `tmp`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 1, `tmp` remains unchanged, and `pow[1]` is now equal to `tmp.**
