Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100000; `tmp` is the factorial of `n + 1`; `pow` is defined for all indices from 0 to `n + 1`; `left` is the index of the first occurrence of a repeated element in the list `a` if such an element exists, otherwise `left` remains undefined; `right` is the index of the second occurrence of that repeated element if it exists, otherwise `right` remains undefined.**
