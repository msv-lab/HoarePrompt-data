The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100000; `tmp` is the factorial of `n + 1`; `pow` is defined for all indices from 0 to `n + 1`; `i` is 0; `x` is the index of the element `a[i]` in the list `a`; `left` is 0; `right` is `a[x + 1:].index(a[i]) + x + 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
