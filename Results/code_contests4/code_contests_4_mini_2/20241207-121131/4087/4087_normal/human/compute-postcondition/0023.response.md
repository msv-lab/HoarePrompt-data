Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100000; `tmp` is the factorial of `n + 1`; `pow` is defined for all indices from 0 to `n + 1`; `i` is 0; `x` is the index of the element `a[i]` in the list `a`. If `a[i]` is found in the sublist `a[x + 1:]`, then `left` is 0 and `right` is set to `a[x + 1:].index(a[i]) + x + 1`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, there is no action taken.***
