The code assigns a list of zeros to the variable `pow` with a size of `n + 2`. The initial value of `n` is such that it is between 1 and 100000, which means `pow` will be a list with `n + 2` elements, all initialized to 0. The other variables `a`, `left`, `right`, and `mask` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of the `pow` list with its new size.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100000; `a` is a map object containing integers parsed from the input string; `left` is 0; `right` is 0; `mask` is 1000000007; `pow` is a list of size `n + 2` initialized to 0**
