According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop iterates from 1 to `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, which means the loop has executed for the first time. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 

Since `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100000, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be less than or equal to `n + 1`. After the last iteration, `i` becomes 2, and for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be at least 1 (which it is), allowing `i` to be 2, which is still less than or equal to `n + 1`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 2, `tmp` remains unchanged, and `pow[1]` is now equal to `tmp. For the loop to execute a second time, n must be greater than or equal to 1.**
