`tmp` is multiplied by `i`, and since `i` is 2, the new value of `tmp` becomes `tmp * 2`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as the operation does not affect it directly. The loop condition for executing a second time is still met if `n >= 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 2, `tmp` is now `tmp * 2`, and the loop can execute again if `n >= 1`.
