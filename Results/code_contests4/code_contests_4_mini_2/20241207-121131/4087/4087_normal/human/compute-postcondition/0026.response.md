The variable `left` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100000; `tmp` is the factorial of `n + 1`; `pow` is defined for all indices from 0 to `n + 1`; `i` is 1; `x` is the index of the element `a[1]` in the list `a`; `left` is 1.
