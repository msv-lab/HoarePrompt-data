The variable `ans` is defined as `pow[n + 1] / (pow[2] * pow[n - 1])`, but since `x` cannot be calculated due to undefined `left` and `right` values, the expression `ans - x` cannot be computed. The `print` statement attempts to output the result of `(ans - x) % mask`, but without a valid numerical value for `x`, this operation cannot be completed.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `ans` can be calculated, but `x` is undefined. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100000; `i` is 2; `ans` is calculated as `pow[n + 1] / (pow[2] * pow[n - 1]); `x` cannot be calculated due to undefined `left` and `right` values.**
