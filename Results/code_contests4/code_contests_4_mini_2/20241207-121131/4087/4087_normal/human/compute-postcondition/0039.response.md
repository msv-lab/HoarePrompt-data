To determine the output state after executing the given code snippet, let's analyze the provided initial state and the code.

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100000; `i` is 1; `ans` is computed as `pow[n + 1] / (pow[1] * pow[n])`.

The line of code to analyze is:
```
x = pow[left + n - right] / (pow[i - 1] * pow[left + n - right - i + 1])
```

1. **Impact of the code on the program**: 
   - A new variable `x` is being assigned a value based on the expression provided.
   - The expression involves several components: `pow[left + n - right]`, `pow[i - 1]`, and `pow[left + n - right - i + 1]`.
   - The values of `left`, `right`, and their relationship with `n` and `i` are not specified in the initial state.
   - The term `pow[i - 1]` will be evaluated as `pow[0]`, which is known to be 1 (assuming a base for the power function).

2. **Previous values of the affected variables**:
   - `n` is within the range of 1 to 100000.
   - `i` is 1, thus `i - 1` equals 0, leading to `pow[i - 1]` being 1.
   - The values of `left` and `right` are unknown and will affect the calculation of `x`.

3. **Calculating the result**:
   - Since `i - 1` evaluates to 0, the denominator simplifies to `1 * pow[left + n - right - 0 + 1]`, which can be rewritten as `pow[left + n - right + 1]`.
   - Therefore, the expression for `x` becomes `pow[left + n - right] / pow[left + n - right + 1]`.

The output state cannot provide a specific numerical value for `x` due to the unknown values of `left` and `right`. Rather, we can describe the relationship expressed in the code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100000; `i` is 1; `x` is computed as `pow[left + n - right] / pow[left + n - right + 1]**.
