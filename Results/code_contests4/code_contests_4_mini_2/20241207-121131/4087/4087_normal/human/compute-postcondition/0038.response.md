The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `pow[n + 1]` divided by the product of `pow[i]` and `pow[n + 1 - i]`. The value of `pow` is defined for all indices from `0` to `n + 1`, and since `i` is `1`, the calculation involves `pow[n + 1]`, `pow[1]`, and `pow[n]`. 

The output state reflects the values of `n`, `i`, and how `ans` is computed based on the factorial values stored in `pow`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100000; `i` is 1; `ans` is computed as `pow[n + 1] / (pow[1] * pow[n])**.
