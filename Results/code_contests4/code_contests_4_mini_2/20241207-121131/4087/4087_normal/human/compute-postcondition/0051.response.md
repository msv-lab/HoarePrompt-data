Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of integers containing values from 1 to `n` (inclusive), where every integer appears at least once. It calculates the factorial of numbers from 1 to `n + 1` and identifies the first and second occurrences of any repeated element in the list. Then, it computes a specific mathematical expression based on the factorial values and the indices of the repeated element, printing the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The function does not explicitly return a missing integer, but rather prints computed values based on the factorials and the indices of repetitions. **
