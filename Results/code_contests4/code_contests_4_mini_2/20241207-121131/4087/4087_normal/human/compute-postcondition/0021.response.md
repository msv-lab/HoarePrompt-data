To determine the output state after executing the given code, we analyze the impact of the statement on the affected variables while considering the initial state.

- The variable `right` is assigned the value of the expression `a[x + 1:].index(a[i]) + x + 1`.
- The `index` method finds the position of the element `a[i]` in the sublist `a[x + 1:]`. Let's denote this position as `pos`. Thus, `right` becomes `pos + x + 1`.
- Since `x` is the index of `a[i]`, `a[i]` exists in the list `a`, and `pos` is the index of `a[i]` relative to the sublist `a[x + 1:]`.

The other variables (`n`, `tmp`, `i`, `left`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state describes the values of the variables with the computed value of `right`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100000; `tmp` is the factorial of `n + 1`; `pow` is defined for all indices from 0 to `n + 1`; `i` is 0; `x` is the index of the element `a[i]` in the list `a`; `left` is 0; `right` is `a[x + 1:].index(a[i]) + x + 1`**.
