The expression `ans = pow[n + 1] / (pow[i] * pow[n + 1 - i])` uses the pow function which typically calculates exponentiation. However, it appears that it is being used in a way that resembles indexing or subscript notation, which may imply that `pow` is being treated as an array or a list of powers.

- The term `pow[n + 1]` calculates the power of 2 to the `n + 1`.
- The term `pow[i]` calculates the power of 2 to the `i`, which is 2.
- The term `pow[n + 1 - i]` calculates the power of 2 to the `n + 1 - 2`, or `n - 1`.

Given that `n` is an integer such that `1 <= n <= 100000` and `i` is 2, we can summarize the impact:

1. Calculate `n + 1` which will be in the range of `2` to `100001`.
2. Calculate `pow[n + 1]`, `pow[2]`, and `pow[n - 1]` based on their definitions.
3. The result for `ans` will be computed as `pow[n + 1] / (pow[2] * pow[n - 1])`.

Nevertheless, without specific values for `n`, we can't compute exact values, but we can describe the relationships.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100000; `i` is 2; `ans` is calculated as pow[n + 1] / (pow[2] * pow[n - 1])**.
