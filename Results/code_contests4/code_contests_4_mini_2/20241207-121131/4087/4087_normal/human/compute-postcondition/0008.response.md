The value of `tmp` is multiplied by `i`. Since `i` is 1, the value of `tmp` remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 1, and `tmp` remains unchanged after multiplication by `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 1, and `tmp` remains unchanged.**
