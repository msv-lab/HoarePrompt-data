The value of `left` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100000, `tmp` is the factorial of `n + 1`, `pow` is defined for all indices from 0 to `n + 1`, `i` is 2, `x` is the index of the element `a[2]` in the list `a`, and `left` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100000, `tmp` is the factorial of `n + 1`, `pow` is defined for all indices from 0 to `n + 1`, `i` is 2, `x` is the index of the element `a[2]` in the list `a`, `left` is 2**
