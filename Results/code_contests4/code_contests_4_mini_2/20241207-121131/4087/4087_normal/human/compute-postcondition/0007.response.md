According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n + 2`, which implies that `i` will take on values starting from 1 up to `n + 1`. The variables `n`, `left`, `right`, `mask`, `pow`, and `tmp` do not directly affect the execution of the loop itself. 

However, for the loop to execute correctly, `i` must start at 1 on the first iteration. Since `n` is guaranteed to be between 1 and 100000, the first execution of the loop will have `i` set to 1. 

Thus, before the loop starts, the states should reflect that `i` is initialized to 1 for the first iteration, and `n` is within its valid range. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time**
