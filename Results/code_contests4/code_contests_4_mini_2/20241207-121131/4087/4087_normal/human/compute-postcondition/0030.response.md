According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop is set to iterate from 0 to `n`, inclusively. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`. Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute a second time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 2.

Therefore, the next state must reflect that `i` has increased to 2. The value of `n` remains unchanged (still an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100000), and there are no other changes required for the other variables.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100000, `tmp` is the factorial of `n + 1`, `pow` is defined for all indices from 0 to `n + 1`, `i` is 2, `x` is the index of the element `a[1]` in the list `a`**
