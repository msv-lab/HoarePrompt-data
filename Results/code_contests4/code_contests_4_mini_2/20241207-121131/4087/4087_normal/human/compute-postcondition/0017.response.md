According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = n`, inclusive, which means it will execute `n + 1` times. Given that `n` is an integer such that `1 <= n <= 100000`, this ensures that the loop will execute at least once, starting with `i = 0`.

The variable `tmp` being the factorial of `n + 1` does not affect the execution of the loop, as it is only required for computations within the loop body. Additionally, `pow[i]` represents the factorial of `i` for all `1 <= i <= n + 1`, which implies that `pow[0]` should be defined as well (assuming it is calculated beforehand).

Therefore, for the loop to execute properly, we need to ensure that `i` starts at 0, and `pow` is defined for all indices from 0 to `n + 1`. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100000, `tmp` is the factorial of `n + 1`, `pow` is defined for all indices from 0 to `n + 1`, `i` is 0**
