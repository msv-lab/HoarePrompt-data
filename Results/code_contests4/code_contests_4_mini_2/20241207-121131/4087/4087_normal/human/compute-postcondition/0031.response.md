The variable `x` is assigned the index of the element `a[i]` in the list `a`. The value of `i` is 2, so `x` will be the index of the element at the 2nd position in the list `a`. The other variables (`n`, `tmp`, `pow`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100000, `tmp` is the factorial of `n + 1`, `pow` is defined for all indices from 0 to `n + 1`, `i` is 2, `x` is the index of the element `a[2]` in the list `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100000, `tmp` is the factorial of `n + 1`, `pow` is defined for all indices from 0 to `n + 1`, `i` is 2, `x` is the index of the element `a[2]` in the list `a`.**
