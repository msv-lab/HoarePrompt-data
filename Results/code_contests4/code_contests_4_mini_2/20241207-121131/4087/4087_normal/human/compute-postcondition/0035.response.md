Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100000; `tmp` is the factorial of `n + 1`; `pow` is defined for all indices from 0 to `n + 1`; `i` is 2; `x` is the index of the element `a[2]` in the list `a`. If `a[i]` is found in the sublist `a[x + 1:]`, then `left` is set to 2 and `right` is the index of the first occurrence of `a[i]` in that sublist plus `x + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
