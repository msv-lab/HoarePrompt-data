The value of `left` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 0. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100000; `tmp` is the factorial of `n + 1`; `pow` is defined for all indices from 0 to `n + 1`; `i` is 0; `x` is the index of the element `a[i]` in the list `a`; the element `a[i]` is present in the sublist `a[x + 1:]`; `left` is 0.
