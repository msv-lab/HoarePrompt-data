To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the conditions set by the loop statement and the initial state provided.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(1, n + 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```
This means the loop will execute for each value of `i` starting from 1 up to and including `n + 1`. 

1. The variable `n` is stated to be an integer such that `1 <= n <= 100000`, which means `n + 1` will also be at least 2. Therefore, the range will produce at least one valid index (1).
2. The variable `i` will start at 1 and will go up to `n + 1`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1, which is guaranteed by the initial state.
3. The variables `tmp`, `pow`, `left`, and `right` do not influence the loop's execution conditions directly. However, `i` will start at 1 and increment with each iteration, which is essential for the loop to run.

Given this analysis, the loop can execute as long as `n` is within the specified bounds, and `i` will begin at 1 during the first execution. 

The adjustments required for the loop to execute the first time are:
- `i` should be initialized to 1, which is the starting point defined by the loop.
- The values of `n`, `tmp`, `pow`, `left`, and `right` don't need to be modified for the loop to execute; they are already defined correctly based on the given constraints.

Thus, the adjusted state can be summarized as follows:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100000, `tmp` is the factorial of `n + 1`, `pow` is defined for all indices from 0 to `n + 1`, `left` is undefined or has a value if a repeated element exists, `right` is undefined or has a value if a repeated element exists, `i` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time.**
