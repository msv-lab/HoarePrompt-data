The variable `x` is assigned the value calculated from the expression `pow[left + n - right] / (pow[i - 1] * pow[left + n - right - i + 1])`. However, the values of `left` and `right` are undefined, which means that the expression cannot be evaluated. Consequently, the state of the other variables remains unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100000; `i` is 3; `ans` is calculated as `pow[n + 1] / (pow[3] * pow[n - 2])`; `x` cannot be calculated due to undefined `left` and `right` values.
