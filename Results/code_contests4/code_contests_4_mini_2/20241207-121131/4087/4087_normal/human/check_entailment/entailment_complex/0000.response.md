Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Subsequences**: The problem description asks for the number of different subsequences of the given sequence with length k (for k = 1 to n+1). However, the program attempts to calculate this using combinations involving factorials and indices of repeated elements, which does not accurately reflect the count of distinct subsequences of the specified lengths.

2. **Handling of Repeated Elements**: The method of finding the first and second occurrences of repeated elements (using `a.index(a[i])`) is flawed. This approach does not properly handle cases where there are multiple repeated elements or when the first occurrence is not the one being used for subsequence calculations.

3. **Output Logic**: The outputs are derived from a calculation that subtracts values based on indices of repeated elements, which does not correspond to the count of distinct subsequences. The logic is not aligned with the requirements of counting subsequences based solely on the length k.

4. **Modulo Operation**: The program attempts to apply a modulo operation after the subtraction of `x` from `ans`, but this is not placed correctly, as the calculation itself does not yield the required counts of subsequences.

5. **Overall Structure**: The program does not maintain a structure that aligns with the requirements, specifically the need to count distinct subsequences rather than manipulate factorials based on indices.

In summary, the program fails to compute the number of different subsequences for lengths from 1 to n+1 correctly, as it uses an incorrect approach based on factorial manipulation and indexing rather than directly counting the subsequences as required by the problem description.
