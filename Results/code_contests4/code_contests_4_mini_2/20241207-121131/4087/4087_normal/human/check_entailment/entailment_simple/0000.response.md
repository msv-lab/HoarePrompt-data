The provided program does not correctly implement the functionality described in the problem. Here are the key points that demonstrate its issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` which is not available in Python 3. The correct function should be `input()`. Additionally, the use of `re.split()` is unnecessary as `input().split()` would suffice to read the integers directly.

2. **Calculation of Factorials**: The program calculates the factorial values and stores them in the `pow` list, but it uses integer division (`/`) instead of modular division which can lead to incorrect results when the values become large, especially since the output is required modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Finding Subsequences**: The logic to find `left` and `right` does not correctly account for the conditions needed to count the unique subsequences of length `k`. The method used (`a.index()` and searching for the next occurrence) is inefficient and does not handle cases correctly, especially when there are multiple duplicates.

4. **Output Calculation**: The calculation of `ans` and `x` does not properly follow the combinatorial logic required to count the number of distinct subsequences of a certain length in the given sequence. The logic appears flawed, as it does not account for all subsequences correctly.

5. **Modulo Operation**: The final print statement attempts to apply the modulo operation incorrectly after the subtraction. It should be applied to the result of the entire expression.

6. **Final Output Format**: The program structure does not guarantee that it will output `n + 1` lines correctly as required by the problem statement.

For these reasons, the program does not satisfy the problem description correctly and fails to handle numerous edge cases.

Correctness: **False**
