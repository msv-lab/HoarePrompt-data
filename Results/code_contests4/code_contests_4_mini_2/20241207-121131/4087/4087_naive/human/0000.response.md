Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of different subsequences of the given sequence with length k for all cases. 

One potential issue arises from the division operations used in the calculation of `ans` and `x`. In Python 2, the division of integers results in an integer, which can lead to incorrect results if not handled properly. This could cause the program to produce incorrect outputs for various values of `n` and the sequence `a`.

For example, if we consider the input:

```
n = 2
a = [1, 1, 2]
```

The expected output would be:

```
3
3
1
```

However, the use of integer division (`/`) in the formula may lead to incorrect calculations of `ans` and `x`, especially when `pow[i]` or `pow[n + 1 - i]` are greater than `pow[n + 1]`, leading to potential negative results or incorrect counts of subsequences.

Moreover, the way the code tries to find the `left` and `right` indices could also lead to incorrect results for certain inputs, particularly when the numbers repeat or are not in a straightforward sequence.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description in all potential cases.
