Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that prevent it from meeting the requirements outlined in the problem description. 

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Factorials**: The program calculates factorial values incorrectly. It initializes `pow` with `0` and incorrectly appends `2` to the size by using `n + 2`. The correct approach should initialize `pow` to have `n + 2` elements, to store the factorial values from `0` to `n + 1`.

2. **Division Operation**: The program uses the division operator `/` for integer division, which can lead to incorrect results. In Python 2 (the environment suggested by the use of `raw_input()`), this will perform float division. To ensure that integer division is performed, the program should use the `//` operator instead.

3. **Handling of Subsequences**: The logic used to count the number of different subsequences seems flawed. The program attempts to find the number of subsequences through the use of indices and appears to be hard to follow, which raises doubt about its correctness.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not seem to handle edge cases properly, such as when the input sequence consists of repeated elements in a specific manner that could affect the counting of subsequences.

For example, consider the input:
```
2
1 1 2
```
The expected output would be:
```
2
3
1
```
However, the logic in the code may not correctly derive these counts, especially for larger sequences or specific arrangements of repeated elements, potentially leading to inconsistencies in the results.

Due to these issues, I conclude that the program does not fulfill the requirements as described, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
