Postcondition: ***`k` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `j` is less than `m`, `m` is greater than 0, `frnds` contains elements from `mtrx[i-1][j]`, `mtrx[i][j-1]`, `mtrx[i][j+1]`, and `mtrx[i+1][j]` depending on the conditions met during the loop iterations; the value of `mtrx[i][j]` is equal to `c`, and `mtrx[i][j]` is not equal to '.'; and `i - 1` is greater than 0.***
