According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `m` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute another time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than 2.

State: **`k` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, `mtrx[i][j]` equals `c` and is not a '.', if `i + 1` is less than `n`, then `frnds` has added `mtrx[i + 1][j]` to the list of friends.**
