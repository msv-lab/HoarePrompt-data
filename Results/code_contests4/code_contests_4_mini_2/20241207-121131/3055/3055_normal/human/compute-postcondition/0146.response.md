The code adds the value of `mtrx[i][j + 1]` to the set `frnds`. Here, `i` is 2, and `j` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `m`, which is greater than 0. Therefore, `j + 1` is guaranteed to be within bounds (since `j` cannot be `m - 1` if `m` is greater than `j`).

The previous values of the affected variables are not fully known, but we know that `frnds` is updated with the value of `mtrx[2][j + 1]`. Other variables (`k`, `n`, `j`, `m`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `m`, `m` is greater than 0; `frnds` now includes `mtrx[2][j + 1]` along with its previous elements.**
