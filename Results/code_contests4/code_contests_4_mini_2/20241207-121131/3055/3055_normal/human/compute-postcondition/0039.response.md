According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. For the loop to execute, `j` must be less than `m`. Right before the loop, `j` is 0, and `m` is equal to its initial value. Since `j` is 0, the loop can execute as long as `m` is greater than 0. To ensure that the loop can execute at least once, we need to confirm that `m` is indeed greater than 0. 

State: **`j` is 0, `m` is equal to the initial value of `m`, for the loop to execute the first time `m` must be greater than 0**
