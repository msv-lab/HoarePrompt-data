The variable `frnds` is updated by adding the value from `mtrx[i][j - 1]`. The previous state of `i` is 2, which leads to `mtrx[2][j - 1]`. The values of `k`, `n`, `j`, and `m` do not affect this operation. Therefore, we can conclude the output state.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `m`, `m` is greater than 0; `frnds` is updated by adding `mtrx[2][j - 1]**
