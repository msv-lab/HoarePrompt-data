Postcondition: ***`k` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `m`, `m` is greater than 0. If `j - 1` is greater than 0, `frnds` now contains the element `mtrx[i][j - 1]` added to its previous elements. If `j - 1` is not greater than 0, `frnds` remains unchanged.***
