The code attempts to extend `mtrx[k]` with `col[j]`. However, since `j` is 0 and `m` is 1, the context of the loop or the conditions for executing this code are not provided. We cannot determine if this line of code is actually executed because it depends on the surrounding logic (like a loop or conditional statement which is not shown). Therefore, the values of `j` and `m` remain unchanged as there is no execution happening.

Output State: **`j` is 0, `m` is 1 and the line `mtrx[k].extend(col[j])` does not execute.**
