The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is 0, so after execution, `j` will be 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, and `mtrx[k]` is extended by the elements of `col[0]`.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, and `mtrx[k]` is extended by the elements of `col[0]**
