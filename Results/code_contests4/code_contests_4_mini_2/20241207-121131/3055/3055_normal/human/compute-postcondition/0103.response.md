Postcondition: ***`k` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `m`, `m` is greater than 0. If `mtrx[i][j]` equals `c` and is not '.', then if `i + 1` is less than `n`, `frnds` is updated to include `mtrx[i + 1][j]`; otherwise, `frnds` remains unchanged.***
