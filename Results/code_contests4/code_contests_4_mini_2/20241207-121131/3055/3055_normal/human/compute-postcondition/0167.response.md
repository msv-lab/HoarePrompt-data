The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it operates on predefined variables `n`, `m`, `c`, and an office-room matrix represented as `n x m` containing uppercase Latin letters and '.' characters. The function returns a value based on the conditions related to the matrix and the color `c`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process an n x m office-room matrix and return a value based on the presence and arrangement of uppercase Latin letters and '.' characters in relation to the color represented by `c`. 

Functionality: **The function processes an n x m office-room matrix and returns a value based on the matrix contents and the color represented by the uppercase letter c.**
