Postcondition: ***Given that `k` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `m`, and `m` is greater than 0, if `i - 1` is greater than 0, then `frnds` is updated by adding `mtrx[i - 1][j]`. If `i - 1` is not greater than 0, no changes are made to `frnds`.***
