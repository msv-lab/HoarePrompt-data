The code attempts to add an element from `mtrx[i + 1][j]` to `frnds`. Given the initial state, we need to evaluate the impact of this line on the variables. 

The initial state indicates that:
- `k` is greater than 0
- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 2
- `m` is greater than 2

Calculating `i + 1` gives us 2, and `j` is 2. Therefore, `mtrx[i + 1][j]` translates to `mtrx[2][2]`. 

Since `j + 1` equals `3`, we check if `3` is less than `m`. Since `m` is greater than 2, the condition is satisfied. This means that an element from `mtrx[2][2]` will be added to `frnds`.

Thus, the Output State reflects that `frnds` now contains one additional element from `mtrx[2][2]`, but the previous state of `frnds` is not defined. 

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, and an element from `mtrx[2][2]` has been added to `frnds`.**
