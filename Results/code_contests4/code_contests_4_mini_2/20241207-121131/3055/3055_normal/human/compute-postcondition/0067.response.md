According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is greater than or equal to 0 and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be less than `m`.

State: **`k` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, and `mtrx[i][j]` equals `c` and is not a '.', if `i + 1` is less than `n`, then `frnds` has added `mtrx[i + 1][j]`.**
