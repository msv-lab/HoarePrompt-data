The value of `j` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The states of the other variables, including `m` and `mtrx[k]`, are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 3, `m` is greater than 0, and for the loop to execute again `m` must be greater than 2; `mtrx[k]` is extended by `col[2]`.

Output State: **`j` is 3, `m` is greater than 0, and for the loop to execute again `m` must be greater than 2; `mtrx[k]` is extended by `col[2]**
