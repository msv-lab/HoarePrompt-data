The value of `j` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value from 0 to 1. The value of `m` remains unchanged at 1. The line `mtrx[k].extend(col[j])` does not execute, so it does not affect any variable. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 1, `m` is 1, and the line `mtrx[k].extend(col[j])` does not execute.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `m` is 1, and the line `mtrx[k].extend(col[j])` does not execute.**
