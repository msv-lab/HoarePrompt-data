According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` has been increased by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `m`, which means `m` must be greater than the current value of `j`. Since `j` is now at its incremented value, `m` must be greater than this new value of `j`.

State: **An error occurred due to attempting to extend a non-existent list in `mtrx`; j is increased by 1 and for the loop to execute again m must be greater than j**
