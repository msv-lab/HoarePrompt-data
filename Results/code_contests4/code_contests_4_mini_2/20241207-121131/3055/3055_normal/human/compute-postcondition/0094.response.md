Postcondition: ***`k` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is greater than 0 and less than `m`, `m` is greater than 0. If `i - 1` is greater than 0, `frnds` contains the element `mtrx[i - 1][j]` added to its previous elements, `mtrx[i][j]` is equal to `c`, `mtrx[i][j]` is not equal to '.', and `j - 1` is greater than 0.***
