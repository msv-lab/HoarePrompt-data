Postcondition: ***`k` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `m`, `m` is greater than 0, and `frnds` contains elements from the neighbors of `mtrx[i][j]` that equal `c` and are not '.'. If `mtrx[i][j]` equals `c` and is not '.', if `i + 1` is less than `n`, `frnds` now includes `mtrx[i + 1][j]`. Additionally, if `j + 1` is less than `m`, `frnds` now includes `mtrx[i][j + 1]`. If `j + 1` is not less than `m`, then `frnds` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `frnds` remains unchanged.***
