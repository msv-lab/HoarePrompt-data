The variable `j` is assigned the value of `0`, which means it is now directly set to this value. The previous state of `j` was equal to `m`, but now it is overwritten. The variables `m`, `k`, and `col` remain unaffected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`j` is 0, `m` is equal to the initial value of `m`, `k` is increased by 1, `col` is an input string**.
