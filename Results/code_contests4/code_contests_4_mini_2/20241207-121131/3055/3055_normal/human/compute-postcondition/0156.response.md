The code snippet `frnds.add(mtrx[i][j + 1])` is executed. The value of `i` is 2, so we look at `mtrx[2][j + 1]`. The variable `j` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `m`, therefore `j + 1` is a valid index as long as it is less than `m`.

Since `j` is in the range [0, m-1], `j + 1` can be in the range [1, m]. Thus, `mtrx[i][j + 1]` accesses a valid element from the matrix `mtrx`.

The previous state of `frnds` is not known, but an element from the matrix indexed by `i` and `j + 1` is added to the set `frnds`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `m`, `m` is greater than 0; an element from `mtrx[2][j + 1]` is added to `frnds`.**
