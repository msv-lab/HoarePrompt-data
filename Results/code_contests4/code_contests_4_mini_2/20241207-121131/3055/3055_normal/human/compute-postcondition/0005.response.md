The code `mtrx = [[] for _ in range(n)]` creates a list of empty lists. The variable `n` determines how many empty lists will be created. Since `n` is assigned the value of `k[0]` converted to an integer, the number of empty lists in `mtrx` will be equal to the integer value of `k[0]`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is assigned k[0] converted to an integer, `m` is assigned k[1] converted to an integer, `c` is assigned k[2]; `i1` is 0, `ii` is 1, `iii` is 2; `mtrx` is a list containing `n` empty lists.

Output State: **`n` is assigned k[0] converted to an integer, `m` is assigned k[1] converted to an integer, `c` is assigned k[2]; `i1` is 0, `ii` is 1, `iii` is 2; `mtrx` is a list containing `n` empty lists.**
