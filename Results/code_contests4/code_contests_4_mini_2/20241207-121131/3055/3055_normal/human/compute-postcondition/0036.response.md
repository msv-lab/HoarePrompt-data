According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and `n`. The loop can execute again if `k` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is increased by 1, which implies that `k` is now equal to its previous value plus 1. Since `j` is equal to `m` and `m` is equal to its initial value, it does not impact the loop condition. Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `k` must be less than `n`. 

If `k` is equal to `n` at the end of the last iteration, the loop cannot run again. Thus, we need to adjust `k` to be less than `n`. 

State: **`j` is equal to `m`, `m` is equal to the initial value of `m`, `k` is increased by 1, and for the loop to execute again `k` is less than `n`.**
