According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, which means there is at least one iteration to perform. In the provided state, `k` is equal to `n`, and since `n` remains unchanged at 0, the loop will not execute. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `n` needs to be greater than 0, and consequently, `k` must also be adjusted to match this new value.

State: **`k` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
