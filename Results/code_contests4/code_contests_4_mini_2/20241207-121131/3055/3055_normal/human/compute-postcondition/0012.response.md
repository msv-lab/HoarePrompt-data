The code attempts to extend the `k`-th list within the `mtrx` list by adding the element at index `j` of the `col` string. 

Given the initial state:
- `mtrx` is a list containing 0 empty lists, which means it has no sublists to extend.
- `col` is an input string, but its value is not specified in the initial state.
- `j` is 0, which indicates we are trying to access the first character of the `col` string.

Since `mtrx` has no lists (it contains only empty lists), attempting to access `mtrx[k]` will result in an IndexError if `k` is not defined properly or if `mtrx` doesn't have any lists initialized.

Therefore, since the attempt to extend the list will fail due to the absence of sublists in `mtrx`, the execution cannot be completed successfully.

Output State: **An error occurred due to attempting to extend a non-existent list in `mtrx`.**
