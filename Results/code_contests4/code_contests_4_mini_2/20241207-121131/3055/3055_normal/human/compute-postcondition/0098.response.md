The code adds the element `mtrx[i][j + 1]` to the set `frnds`. Since `j` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `m`, `j + 1` will be less than `m`, allowing `mtrx[i][j + 1]` to be accessed. The value of `frnds` will change as it adds this new element to its previous elements. The previous state of `frnds` is not specified, but it will now include the new element. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `m`, `m` is greater than 0, `j + 1` is less than `m`, `frnds` now contains the element `mtrx[i][j + 1]` added to its previous elements.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `m`, `m` is greater than 0, `j + 1` is less than `m`, `frnds` now contains the element `mtrx[i][j + 1]` added to its previous elements.**
