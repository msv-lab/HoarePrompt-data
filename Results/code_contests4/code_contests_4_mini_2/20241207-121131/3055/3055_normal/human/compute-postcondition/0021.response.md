The value of `k` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `k` is not specified in the initial state. The values of the other variables (`j`, `m`, `n`, `m`, `c`, `i1`, `ii`, `iii`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is equal to `m`, `mtrx[k]` has attempted to extend with elements from `col`, but an error occurred due to `mtrx` having no lists to extend; `n`, `m`, `c`, `i1`, `ii`, and `iii` remain unchanged at 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, and 2 respectively; `k` is increased by 1.
