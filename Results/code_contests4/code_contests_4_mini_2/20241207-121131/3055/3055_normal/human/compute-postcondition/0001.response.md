The variable `ii` is assigned the value of `False or 1`. In Python, the `or` operator evaluates to the first truthy value. Here, `False` is falsy, and `1` is truthy, so `ii` is assigned the value `1`. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `c`, `i1`, and the office-room matrix) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 100; `c` is an uppercase Latin letter; `i1` is 0; the office-room is represented as an `n` x `m` matrix with uppercase Latin letters and '.' characters; `ii` is 1.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 100; `c` is an uppercase Latin letter; `i1` is 0; the office-room is represented as an `n` x `m` matrix with uppercase Latin letters and '.' characters; `ii` is 1**.
