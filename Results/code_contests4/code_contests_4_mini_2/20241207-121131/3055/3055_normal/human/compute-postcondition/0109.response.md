The code `frnds.add(mtrx[i][j + 1])` adds an element from the matrix `mtrx` at the position `[i][j + 1]` to the set `frnds`. The current state shows that `i` is 1 and `j` is 2. Therefore, `j + 1` equals 3, so the code will attempt to add `mtrx[1][3]` to `frnds`. 

The values of `k`, `n`, and `m` do not affect the execution of this code directly, and the state of `frnds` will change depending on the value of `mtrx[1][3]`. Since we do not have the value of `mtrx[1][3]`, we cannot specify the exact value added to `frnds`.

Thus, the Output State is: `k` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, and `frnds` has a new element added from `mtrx[1][3]`.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, and `frnds` has a new element added from `mtrx[1][3]`.**
