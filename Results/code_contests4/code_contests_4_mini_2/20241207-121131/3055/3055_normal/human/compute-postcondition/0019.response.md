The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is unknown, but it is stated that `j` is already increased by 1 prior to this operation. Therefore, after executing `j = j + 1`, `j` will be increased by an additional 1. The other variables, such as `mtrx[k]` and `col[j]`, are not affected by this line of code. 

Output State: **`j` is increased by 2, and `mtrx[k]` remains extended with `col[j]`**.
