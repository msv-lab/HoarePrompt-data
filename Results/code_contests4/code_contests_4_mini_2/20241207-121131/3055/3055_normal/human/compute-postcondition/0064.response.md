The code `frnds.add(mtrx[i + 1][j])` attempts to add the value from the matrix `mtrx` at the position `[i + 1][j]` to the set `frnds`. 

Given the initial state:
- `k` is greater than 0
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `j` is greater than 0
- `m` is greater than 0
- `frnds` is updated to include `mtrx[i][j + 1]` if `j + 1` is less than `m`, and `i + 1` is less than `n`.

Since `i` is 0, `i + 1` is 1. Therefore, `mtrx[1][j]` will be accessed. The values of `i`, `j`, and the condition of `frnds` being updated imply that the operation will proceed, as `i + 1` (which is 1) is less than `n` (which is greater than 0), and `j` is also valid as it is greater than 0.

The output state reflects the addition of the value at `mtrx[1][j]` to `frnds`, but since we do not know the exact content of `mtrx`, we will refer to the addition operation in general terms.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0; `frnds` has added `mtrx[1][j]`.**
