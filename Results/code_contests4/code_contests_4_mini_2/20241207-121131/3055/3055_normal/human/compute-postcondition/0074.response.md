The code `frnds.add(mtrx[i + 1][j])` adds the value of `mtrx[i + 1][j]` to the set `frnds`. The initial state indicates that `i` is 0 and `j` is 1. Therefore, we need to check the value of `mtrx[1][1]` (since `i + 1` is 1 and `j` is 1). 

The previous values indicate that `mtrx[i][j]` equals `c`, and since `mtrx[i + 1][j]` is being added, it must be a valid position in the matrix. The state of other variables is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `mtrx[i][j]` equals `c` and is not a '.', `frnds` has added `mtrx[1][1]` to the list of friends.**
