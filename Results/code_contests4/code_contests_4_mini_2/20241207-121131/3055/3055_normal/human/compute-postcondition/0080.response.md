The variable `frnds` is updated by adding the value of `mtrx[i][j - 1]` to it. Given that `j` is 2, the expression evaluates `mtrx[i][1]`. The variable `mtrx[i][j]` is equal to `c`, which implies that `mtrx[i][1]` has some value that is not specified but is assumed to be valid for addition to the set `frnds`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, `mtrx[i][j]` equals `c` and is not a '.', and the value `mtrx[i][1]` has been added to `frnds`.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, `mtrx[i][j]` equals `c` and is not a '.', `frnds` now includes `mtrx[i][1]`.**
