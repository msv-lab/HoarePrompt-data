Postcondition: ***`k` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `m`, `m` is greater than 0, `frnds` contains elements from the neighbors of `mtrx[i][j]` that equal `c` and are not '.', `mtrx[i][j]` equals `c` and is not '.', and if `i + 1` is less than `n`, then `frnds` now includes `mtrx[i + 1][j]`.***
