The `frnds` set is updated to include the element at position `mtrx[i][j + 1]`. The previous values indicate that `j` is greater than 0 and `j + 1` is less than `m`, which means that `mtrx[i][j + 1]` is a valid position and can be accessed. The other variables `k`, `n`, `i`, `j`, and `m` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, and `frnds` is updated to include `mtrx[i][j + 1]`.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, and `frnds` is updated to include `mtrx[i][j + 1]`.**
