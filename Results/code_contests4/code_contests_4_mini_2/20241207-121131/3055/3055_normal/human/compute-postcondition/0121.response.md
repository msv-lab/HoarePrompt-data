The code `frnds.add(mtrx[i + 1][j])` attempts to add a value from a matrix `mtrx` to the set `frnds`. The variable `i` is 1 and `j` is 3, so `i + 1` equals 2 and `j` is 3. We need to access `mtrx[2][3]` to determine what value is added to `frnds`. The variables `k`, `n`, and `m` do not directly affect this operation.

Thus, the output state after executing the code is dependent on what value `mtrx[2][3]` contains, but since that value isn't provided, we can summarize the intended action.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `m` is greater than 2; `frnds` is updated to include `mtrx[2][3]`**.
