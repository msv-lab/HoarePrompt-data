According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute as long as `j` starts from 0 and continues until it is less than `m`. Given that `m` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Since `j` is already initialized to a value that satisfies the loop's condition (0 â‰¤ `j` < `m`), there is no need for adjustment to `j`.

Thus, for the loop to execute the first time, we confirm that `m` is greater than 0 and that `j` starts at 0.

State: **`k` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `j` is less than `m`, `m` is greater than 0, `frnds` contains elements from the neighbors of all `mtrx[i][j]` that equal `c` and are not '.'**
