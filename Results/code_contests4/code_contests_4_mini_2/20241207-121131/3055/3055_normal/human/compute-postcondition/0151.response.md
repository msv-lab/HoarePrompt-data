According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit defined by `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `m`, meaning that it has already executed for some value of `j`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1. Therefore, the next value of `j` will be `j + 1`, and it should still satisfy the condition of being less than `m`.

State: **`k` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `m`, `m` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than `m` and `j` will be `j + 1`.**
