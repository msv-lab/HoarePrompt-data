The variable `frnds` is updated to include the value `mtrx[i + 1][j]`. The values of `i` and `j` are known: `i` is 0 and `j` is 2. Therefore, the value being added to `frnds` is `mtrx[1][2]`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, `mtrx[i][j]` equals `c` and is not a '.', `frnds` now includes `mtrx[1][2]`.**
