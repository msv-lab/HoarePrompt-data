The values of `n`, `m`, and `c` are assigned based on the values from the list `k`, where `k[i1]`, `k[ii]`, and `k[iii]` correspond to `k[0]`, `k[1]`, and `k[2]` respectively. Since `k` is a list of strings obtained from splitting an input, the integer values for `n` and `m` are derived from the first two elements of `k`, and `c` is set to the third element of `k`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is assigned k[0] converted to an integer, `m` is assigned k[1] converted to an integer, `c` is assigned k[2]; `i1` is 0, `ii` is 1, `iii` is 2.**
