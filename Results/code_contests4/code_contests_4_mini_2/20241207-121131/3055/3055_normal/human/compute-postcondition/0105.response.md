The code `frnds.add(mtrx[i - 1][j])` involves adding an element to the set `frnds`. The value being added is obtained from the matrix `mtrx` at the position `[i - 1][j]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1 and `j` is 2, so we need to evaluate `mtrx[1 - 1][2]`, which simplifies to `mtrx[0][2]`.

Since `k`, `n`, and `m` are only mentioned to be greater than certain values, they do not directly affect the operation of adding an element to `frnds`. The only relevant factor is the value of `mtrx[0][2]`, which we don't know explicitly but is assumed to be a valid value in the matrix.

Thus, the output state will reflect that an element from the matrix at the specified index is added to the set `frnds`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than 2; an element from `mtrx[0][2]` is added to `frnds`.**
