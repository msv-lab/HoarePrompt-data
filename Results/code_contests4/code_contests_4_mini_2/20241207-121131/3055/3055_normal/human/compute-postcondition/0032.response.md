The code `mtrx[k].extend(col[j])` extends the list `mtrx[k]` with the elements of the list `col[j]`. The values of `j` and `m` are not directly affected by this operation. Since `j` is 2, it means we are accessing the third element (index 2) of the list `col`, and the state of `m` remains unchanged at 1. The loop condition for `m` to execute again (i.e., `m` needs to be greater than 2) is not affected by this line of code either.

Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 2, `m` is 1, and `mtrx[k]` is extended with the elements of `col[2]`.

Output State: **`j` is 2, `m` is 1, and `mtrx[k]` is extended with the elements of `col[2]**
