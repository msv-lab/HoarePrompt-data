The value of `j` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The value of `m` remains unchanged at 1, and since the loop execution does not continue, the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 2, `m` is 1 and the loop execution will not continue.

Output State: **`j` is 2, `m` is 1 and the loop execution will not continue.**
