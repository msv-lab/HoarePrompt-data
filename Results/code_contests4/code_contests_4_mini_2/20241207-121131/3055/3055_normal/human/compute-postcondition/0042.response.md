According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `m` is greater than 0. Since `m` being greater than 0 does not guarantee that the loop will execute one more time, we need to ensure that `m` is at least 2 for the loop to execute again, considering that `j` is currently 1.

State: **`j` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, and for the loop to execute again `m` must be greater than 1**
