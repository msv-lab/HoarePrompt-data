The variable `frnds` is updated by adding the value of `mtrx[i][j + 1]`. Given the initial state, we know that `j` is 2, so the expression `j + 1` evaluates to 3. Since `mtrx[i][j]` equals `c` and is not a '.', we can assume that `mtrx[i][3]` will hold a value that can be added to `frnds`.

The previous values of the affected variables are:
- `k` is greater than 0
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `j` is 2
- `m` is greater than 2
- `mtrx[i][j]` equals `c` and is not a '.'

The variable `frnds` now includes `mtrx[i][3]`. The previous state of `frnds` is not specified, but it will now include the new value.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, `mtrx[i][j]` equals `c` and is not a '.', `frnds` now includes `mtrx[i][3]`.**
