The value of `k` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `k` is unknown, so the output state is: `j` is equal to `m`, `m` remains the same as its initial value, `mtrx[k]` is extended by the elements of `col` from index 0 to index `m-1`, and `k` is increased by 1.  
Output State: **`j` is equal to `m`, `m` remains the same as its initial value, `mtrx[k]` is extended by the elements of `col` from index 0 to index `m-1`, and `k` is increased by 1.**
