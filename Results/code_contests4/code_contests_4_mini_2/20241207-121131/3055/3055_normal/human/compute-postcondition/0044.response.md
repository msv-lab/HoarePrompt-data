`j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` was 1, so after execution, `j` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 2, `m` is greater than 0, and for the loop to execute again `m` must be greater than 1; `mtrx[k]` is extended with the value of `col[1]`.

Output State: **`j` is 2, `m` is greater than 0, and for the loop to execute again `m` must be greater than 1; `mtrx[k]` is extended with the value of `col[1]`.**
