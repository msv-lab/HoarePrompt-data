According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. Specifically, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`k` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `m`, `m` is greater than 0, and `frnds` contains elements from the neighbors of all `mtrx[i][j]` that equal `c` and are not '.'**
