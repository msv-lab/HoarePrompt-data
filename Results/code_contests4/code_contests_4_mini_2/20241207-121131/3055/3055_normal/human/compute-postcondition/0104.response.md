According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. Since `j` is currently in the range of `0` to `m-1`, to execute the loop one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Given that `j` is currently less than `m`, the next value of `j` will be `2` (assuming it is currently `1`), and for the loop to execute one more time, `m` must still be greater than `2`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `1`, and `m` is greater than `0`. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `j` will be `2`.

State: **`k` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than 2.**
