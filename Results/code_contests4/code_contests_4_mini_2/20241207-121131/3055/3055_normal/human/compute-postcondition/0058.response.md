The code `frnds.add(mtrx[i][j - 1])` adds the element at position `mtrx[i][j - 1]` to the set `frnds`. Given the initial conditions, `j - 1` is greater than 0, which means that the position `mtrx[i][j - 1]` is valid and can be accessed. The element at this position will be added to the `frnds` set.

Since `k`, `n`, and `m` are greater than 0, and `i` is 0, we can conclude that the operation of adding to `frnds` does not affect these variables. The output state will reflect the addition of the element from `mtrx[i][j - 1]` to the `frnds`.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, the element at position `mtrx[i][j]` is equal to `c`, and `frnds` is updated to include the element at position `mtrx[i][j - 1]`.**
