The `remove` method is called on the list `frnds`, which removes the first occurrence of the element `'.'`. Given that `frnds` contains the element `'.'`, it will be removed from the list. The values of `k`, `n`, and `m` are not affected by this operation, and they remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is equal to `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, and `frnds` no longer contains the element `'.'`.

Output State: **`k` is equal to `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, and `frnds` no longer contains the element '.'**
