Postcondition: ***Given that `k` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `m`, and `m` is greater than 0, if `mtrx[i][j]` is equal to `c` and not equal to '.', and if `i + 1` is less than `n`, then an element from `mtrx[i + 1][j]` is added to `frnds`; otherwise, no changes are made to `frnds.***
