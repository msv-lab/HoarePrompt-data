Postcondition: ***`k` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, the element at position `mtrx[i][j]` is equal to `c`, `frnds` is updated to include the element at position `mtrx[i][j - 1]` if `j - 1` is greater than 0, and `j + 1` is less than `m`.***
