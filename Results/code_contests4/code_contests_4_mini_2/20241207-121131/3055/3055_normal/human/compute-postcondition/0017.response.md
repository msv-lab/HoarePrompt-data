According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` has been increased by 1, and for the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than this new value of `j`. Therefore, `m` needs to be adjusted to be greater than the updated value of `j`.

State: **`j` is increased by 1, and for the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than the new value of `j`**
