The code `frnds.add(mtrx[i][j - 1])` adds the value of `mtrx[i][j - 1]` to the set `frnds`. The previous values of the affected variables are `i`, `j`, and the contents of `mtrx`. Given that `i` is 2 and `j` is within the bounds specified (0 to less than `m`), `j - 1` is guaranteed to be valid, making `mtrx[i][j - 1]` a valid access.

The state of `frnds` will change to include `mtrx[2][j - 1]`. The other variables remain unaffected in this operation.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `m`, `m` is greater than 0; `frnds` now includes `mtrx[2][j - 1]` along with its previous elements.**
