The value of `i1` is assigned the result of the expression `False or 0`. In Python, `False` evaluates to `0` in a boolean context, so the result of this expression is `0`. Therefore, `i1` is assigned the value `0`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `m`, and `c`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 100; `c` is an uppercase Latin letter; `i1` is 0; the office-room is represented as an `n` x `m` matrix with uppercase Latin letters and '.' characters.**
