The value of `frnds` is updated by adding the element `mtrx[i - 1][j]` to it. Given that `i` is 2, the expression `i - 1` equals 1, so we access `mtrx[1][j]`. The initial conditions state that `mtrx[i][j]` equals `c` and is not '.', and it is also specified that `j` is less than `m`, indicating that `j` is a valid index for the second dimension of `mtrx`. The previous values of the affected variables are not specified, but we know that `frnds` is being modified by adding an element from `mtrx`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `j` is less than `m`, `m` is greater than 0, `frnds` now includes `mtrx[1][0]` (or `mtrx[1][j]` if `j` is not 0).

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `j` is less than `m`, `m` is greater than 0, `frnds` now includes `mtrx[1][j]`**
