The code `frnds.add(mtrx[i + 1][j])` adds the value from `mtrx[i + 1][j]` to the set `frnds`. The initial values indicate that `i` is 2, which means `i + 1` is 3. Therefore, the value being added to `frnds` will be `mtrx[3][j]`. 

Since `k`, `n`, `j`, and `m` are not directly involved in this operation, their states remain unchanged. The only change occurs in the `frnds` set, which now includes the element `mtrx[3][j]`.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `m`, `m` is greater than 0; `frnds` now includes `mtrx[3][j]` along with its previous elements.**
