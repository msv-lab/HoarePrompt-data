The code attempts to add an element from the `mtrx` matrix to the `frnds` set. The values of `i` and `j` are provided as 1 and 2, respectively. Therefore, `j - 1` equals 1, and the code will add the element `mtrx[i][1]` to `frnds`. The value of `mtrx[i][1]` is dependent on the matrix, but it is implied that it is accessible as `m` is greater than 2, which suggests that the matrix has sufficient dimensions.

Since there is no else part, `frnds` will only be modified if the condition `i - 1 > 0` is true. Given that `i` is 1, the condition evaluates to false (`1 - 1 > 0` is false), so `frnds` remains unchanged. Therefore, only the state of `frnds` is relevant here.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, and `frnds` remains unchanged.**
