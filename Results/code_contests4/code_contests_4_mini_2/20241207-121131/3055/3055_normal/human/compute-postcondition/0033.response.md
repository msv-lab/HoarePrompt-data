The variable `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is 2, so after execution, `j` becomes 3. The values of `m` and `mtrx[k]` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 3, `m` is 1, and `mtrx[k]` is extended with the elements of `col[2]`.

Output State: **`j` is 3, `m` is 1, and `mtrx[k]` is extended with the elements of `col[2]**
