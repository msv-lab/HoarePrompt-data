The `frnds` set is updated to include `mtrx[i][j - 1]`. The values of `i` and `j` are 1 and 3, respectively, so the expression `mtrx[i][j - 1]` evaluates to `mtrx[1][2]`. The previous state of `frnds` is not provided, but it will now include the value `mtrx[1][2]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `m` is greater than 2; `frnds` is updated to include `mtrx[1][2]**.
