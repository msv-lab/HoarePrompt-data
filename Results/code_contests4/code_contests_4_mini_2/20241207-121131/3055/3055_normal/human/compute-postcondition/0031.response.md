According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. The loop will execute if `j` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `m` is 1. Since `j` is not less than `m`, the loop cannot execute again. 

To allow the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust `m` to be greater than 2 (for example, `m` could be 3 or higher). No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`j` is 2, `m` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `m` needs to be greater than 2**
