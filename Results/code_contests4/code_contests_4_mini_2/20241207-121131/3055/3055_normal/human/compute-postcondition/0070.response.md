The code `frnds.add(mtrx[i][j - 1])` adds the value from `mtrx[i][j - 1]` to the set `frnds`. 

Given the initial state:
- `k` is greater than 0
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `j` is 1
- `m` is greater than 1
- `mtrx[i][j]` equals `c` and is not a '.'
- `i - 1` is not greater than 0, so `frnds` has not added `mtrx[i - 1][j]`.

We focus on the operation `frnds.add(mtrx[i][j - 1])`. The current values indicate that `j` is 1, thus `j - 1` equals 0. Therefore, we will access `mtrx[i][0]`.

Assuming `mtrx` is defined correctly and contains valid data at the specified indices, the value being added to `frnds` is `mtrx[i][0]`.

The state of `frnds` is updated to include this new value, but we do not know the previous contents of `frnds` or the specific value of `mtrx[i][0]`.

Thus, the output state reflects the addition to the set and the existing conditions. 

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `mtrx[i][j]` equals `c` and is not a '.', `frnds` has added `mtrx[i][0]`.**
