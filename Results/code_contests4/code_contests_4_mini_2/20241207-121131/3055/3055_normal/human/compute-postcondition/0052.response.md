According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `m` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Given that `k` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0 before the loop starts, we need to ensure that `m` is also greater than 0 for the loop to execute for the first time. 

Thus, the states need to be adjusted to include that `m` is greater than 0, and at the start of the loop, `j` is initialized to 0.

State: **`k` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is greater than 0, and `j` is 0**
