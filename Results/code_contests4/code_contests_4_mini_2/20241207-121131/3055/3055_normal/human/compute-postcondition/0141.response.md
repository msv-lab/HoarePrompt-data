According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is less than `m`, which indicates that the loop can execute again. 

Given that `j` is currently a value less than `m`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will become the next value in the range, which is `j + 1`. 

Since `j` is currently greater than or equal to 0 and less than `m`, after the increment it will still be valid as long as `j + 1` is less than `m`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute again, we simply need to update the value of `j` to `j + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

State: **`k` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `m`, `m` is greater than 0, `frnds` contains elements from the neighbors of `mtrx[i][j]` that equal `c` and are not '.', and if `mtrx[i][j]` equals `c` and is not '.', then if `i + 1` is less than `n`, `frnds` now includes `mtrx[i + 1][j]`, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than `m`.**
