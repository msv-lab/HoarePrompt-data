The value of `j` is assigned 0. The previous value of `j` was equal to `m`, which is 0, so now `j` remains 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 0, `m` is 0, `n` needs to be greater than `m`, `c` is 0, `i1` is 0, `ii` is 1, `iii` is 2, `k` is increased by 1, `col` is an input string.

Output State: **`j` is 0, `m` is 0, `n` needs to be greater than `m`, `c` is 0, `i1` is 0, `ii` is 1, `iii` is 2, `k` is increased by 1, `col` is an input string.**
