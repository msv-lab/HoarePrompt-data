Postcondition: ***`k` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `m`, `m` is greater than 0; if `j - 1` is greater than 0, `frnds` now includes `mtrx[2][j - 1]` along with its previous elements. If `j - 1` is not greater than 0, `frnds` remains unchanged.***
