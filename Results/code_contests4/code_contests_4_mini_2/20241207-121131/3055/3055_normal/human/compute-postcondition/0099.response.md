Postcondition: ***`k` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `m`, `m` is greater than 0. If `j + 1` is less than `m`, `frnds` contains the element `mtrx[i][j + 1]` added to its previous elements. If `j + 1` is not less than `m`, `frnds` remains unchanged.***
