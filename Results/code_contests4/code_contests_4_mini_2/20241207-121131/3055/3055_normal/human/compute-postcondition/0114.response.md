According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and since `m` is greater than 2, the loop can execute one more time for `j` equal to 3. 

State: **`k` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `m` is greater than 2, for the loop to execute a third time `m` must be greater than 3.**
