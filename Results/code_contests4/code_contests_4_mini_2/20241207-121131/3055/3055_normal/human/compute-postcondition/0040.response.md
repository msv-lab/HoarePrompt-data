The code `mtrx[k].extend(col[j])` extends the list `mtrx[k]` by appending elements from the list `col[j]`. The current values of `j` and `m` are `0` and greater than `0`, respectively, allowing the loop to execute. The values of `mtrx[k]` and `col[j]` are not provided, but it is implied that `col[j]` is a list since it is being used with `extend`.

Therefore, while the state of `j` remains unchanged at `0`, and `m` remains greater than `0`, the list `mtrx[k]` is modified by adding the elements of `col[j]`. 

Output State: **`j` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, and `mtrx[k]` is extended by the elements of `col[j]`.**
