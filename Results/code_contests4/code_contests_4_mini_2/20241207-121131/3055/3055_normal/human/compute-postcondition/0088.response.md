According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the variable `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` being 1. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`k` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is less than `m`, `m` is greater than 0, and `frnds` contains elements from `mtrx[i-1][j]`, `mtrx[i][j-1]`, `mtrx[i][j+1]`, and `mtrx[i+1][j]` depending on the conditions met during the loop iterations.**
