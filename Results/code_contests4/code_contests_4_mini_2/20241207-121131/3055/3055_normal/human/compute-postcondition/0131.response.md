Postcondition: ***`k` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is greater than 0, `j` is less than `m`, `m` is greater than 0, `frnds` contains elements from the neighbors of `mtrx[i][j]` that equal `c` and are not '.', and `mtrx[i][j]` equals `c` and is not '.', and `j - 1` is greater than 0. If `i - 1` is greater than 0, `frnds` now includes `mtrx[i - 1][j]`.***
