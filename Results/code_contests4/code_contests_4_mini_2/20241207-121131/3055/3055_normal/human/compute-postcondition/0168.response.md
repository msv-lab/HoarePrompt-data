Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `m`, and an uppercase Latin letter `c`. It processes an `n x m` matrix filled with uppercase Latin letters and '.' characters, counting unique neighboring elements of all occurrences of `c` in the matrix, excluding the '.' character. The function returns the count of these unique neighboring elements. If there are no occurrences of `c`, it returns 0. Additionally, if `m` is 0, the matrix will be empty, and the function will also return 0. **
