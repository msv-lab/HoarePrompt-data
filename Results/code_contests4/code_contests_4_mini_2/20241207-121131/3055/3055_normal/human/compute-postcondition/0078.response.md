The code attempts to add the value `mtrx[i - 1][j]` to the set `frnds`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, so `i - 1` equals -1. This implies that the code is trying to access the row `-1` in the `mtrx`, which is typically out of bounds for a matrix in standard indexing. However, since the task does not specify the behavior of out-of-bounds access, we will assume that this operation is acknowledged but does not change the state of `frnds`.

No new values are added to `frnds`, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is: `k` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, `mtrx[i][j]` equals `c` and is not a '.', and `frnds` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, `mtrx[i][j]` equals `c` and is not a '.', and `frnds` remains unchanged.**
