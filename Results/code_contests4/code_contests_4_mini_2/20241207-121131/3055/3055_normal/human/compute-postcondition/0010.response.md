The variable `j` is assigned the value `0`. The previous value of `j` was not defined, but now it is explicitly set to `0`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is 0, `m` is 0, `c` is 0; `i1` is 0, `ii` is 1, `iii` is 2; `mtrx` is a list containing 0 empty lists; `frnds` is an empty set; `col` is an input string; `j` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is 0, `m` is 0, `c` is 0; `i1` is 0, `ii` is 1, `iii` is 2; `mtrx` is a list containing 0 empty lists; `frnds` is an empty set; `col` is an input string; `j` is 0**
