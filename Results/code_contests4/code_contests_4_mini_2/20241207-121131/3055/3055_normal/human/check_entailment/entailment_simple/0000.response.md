Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` and `extend()` in a way that is not appropriate for building the matrix. `mtrx[k].extend(col[j])` adds each character of the string `col` to the list `mtrx[k]`, but it does not handle the matrix correctly. The `mtrx` should be a list of lists where each sublist represents a row of the office-room layout, but this is not achieved correctly.

2. **Boundary Conditions**: The checks for neighboring desks (the President's desk neighbors) use `if i - 1 > 0:` and similar conditions, which will incorrectly skip the topmost row and leftmost column. The correct conditions should be `if i - 1 >= 0:` and `if j - 1 >= 0:` to ensure that the program checks all valid neighbors.

3. **Counting Deputies**: The logic for counting deputies is flawed. The program adds colors of neighboring desks to the `frnds` set regardless of whether they are adjacent to the President's desk. It should only count colors that are immediately adjacent to the cells that represent the President's desk.

4. **Using Set to Remove Duplicates**: The check to remove `'.'` from the `frnds` set is unnecessary and incorrect because `'.'` represents empty cells in the matrix, which should not be part of the neighboring desk colors in the first place.

5. **Incomplete Output Logic**: The program prints the length of `frnds`, but it is not guaranteed that this set contains only the deputy desks' colors. The conditions and logic used may include incorrect or unintended colors, which does not align with the requirements to count only the adjacent desks.

Due to these issues, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description accurately or consistently for all potential cases.
