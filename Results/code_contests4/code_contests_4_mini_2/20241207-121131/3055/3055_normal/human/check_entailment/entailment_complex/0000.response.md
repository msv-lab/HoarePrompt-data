Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Counting Adjacency**: The problem states that the program must count the deputies whose desks are adjacent to the President's desk. However, the program incorrectly checks for adjacency by looking for non-empty neighboring cells that are not the President's desk color. It also fails to account for the case where the President's desk might be on the edge or corner of the matrix.

2. **Incorrect Conditionals**: The conditions used to access neighboring cells (`if i - 1 > 0`, `if j - 1 > 0`, etc.) are incorrect. They should use `>=` instead of `>` to correctly include the first row and first column when checking for neighbors.

3. **Handling of Empty Cells**: The program incorrectly tries to remove the `'.'` character from the `frnds` set, which does not align with the need to count deputies. The presence of `'.'` should not be part of the adjacency check at all.

4. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` which is not a valid function in Python 3 (it should be `input()`). Also, the way the matrix is populated could lead to incorrect behavior due to improper indexing.

5. **Output Logic**: The output should be the count of deputies adjacent to the President's desk, but the program outputs the size of the set `frnds` directly, which may include desks that are not deputies or incorrectly excludes valid ones.

To summarize, the program fails to accurately determine and count the unique desk colors that are adjacent to the President's desk, which is a clear violation of the problem requirements. Thus, it does not fulfill the specifications of the problem description correctly.
