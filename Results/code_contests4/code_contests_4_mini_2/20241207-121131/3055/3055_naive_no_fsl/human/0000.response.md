Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains several issues that prevent it from functioning correctly based on the problem description. Here are the key problems:

1. **Incorrect Index Check**: The checks for adjacent desks in the following lines are incorrect:
   ```python
   if i - 1 > 0:  # Should be i - 1 >= 0
   if j - 1 > 0:  # Should be j - 1 >= 0
   if j + 1 < m:  # Correct
   if i + 1 < n:  # Correct
   ```
   The condition `i - 1 > 0` would skip the first row entirely (i.e., when `i` is 0), which means it will not check the desk above the president's desk. This should be `i - 1 >= 0`. Similarly, `j - 1 > 0` should be `j - 1 >= 0` to check the left side.

2. **Counting the Color of President's Desk**: The program currently does not verify if the president's desk color is actually present in the matrix. If the president's desk color is not present, the program would still attempt to count deputies, leading to incorrect results.

3. **Incorrect Initialization of Variables**: The initialization of `k` and `ii`, `i1`, and `iii` using `False` and `0` is misleading and makes the code less readable. The program should initialize `k` directly to `0`.

4. **Using `raw_input`**: The program uses `raw_input()`, which is not valid in Python 3. This would result in an error if the code were executed in a Python 3 environment.

5. **Handling of Empty Cells**: The logic to remove `'.'` from the `frnds` set is unnecessary since `'.'` should not be added in the first place, as the only colors of desks should be counted.

### Example where the program fails:

Consider the following input:
```
3 4 R
G.B.
.RR.
TTT.
```

Here, the president's desk is represented by 'R'. The program should output `2` because there are two adjacent desks ('G' and 'T'). However, due to the index checking issue, it may fail to correctly identify all adjacent desks, especially if the president's desk is located at the edge of the matrix.

Due to these issues, the correctness of the program is false.
