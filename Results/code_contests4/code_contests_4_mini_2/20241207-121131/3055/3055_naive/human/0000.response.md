To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the code carefully.

### Problem Description Recap:
The program should count the number of deputies whose desks are adjacent to the president's desk in a given matrix representation of an office room. Each desk is represented with a unique uppercase letter, and empty spaces are represented with a period (`.`).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The first line reads the dimensions of the matrix and the president's desk color.
   - The subsequent lines read the matrix rows.

2. **Matrix Construction:**
   - The matrix is constructed using a list of lists.

3. **Finding Adjacent Desks:**
   - The program iterates through the matrix to find the president's desk.
   - For each cell that matches the president's desk color, it attempts to add the colors of adjacent cells to a set.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The logic checks the bounds using `if i - 1 > 0`, which should instead be `if i - 1 >= 0` to include the first row.
   - Similarly, checks for `j - 1 > 0` should be `j - 1 >= 0`, and `j + 1 < m` and `i + 1 < n` are correct.

5. **Counting Unique Colors:**
   - The program uses a set to avoid counting duplicates, but it incorrectly checks for the presence of a `.` in the set and tries to remove it, which doesn't align with the problem description.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Boundary Check:**
   - The program can access out-of-bounds indices when checking adjacent cells. For example, if the president's desk is at `(0, 0)`, checking `mtrx[-1][0]` would lead to an IndexError.

2. **Incorrect Logic to Remove `.`:**
   - The program unnecessarily checks for and removes `.` from the set `frnds`, which should not be needed. The set should only contain the colors of the desks that are adjacent.

3. **Counting Logic:**
   - The logic may miss deputies that are adjacent to the president's desk due to incorrect boundary conditions.

### Example Test Case:
Consider the following input:
```
2 2 A
A.
.B
```
The expected output is `1` (there is one deputy's desk `B` adjacent to `A`). The program, however, may not correctly identify this due to its boundary checks.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle edge cases and can lead to runtime errors or inaccurate counts. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements stated in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
