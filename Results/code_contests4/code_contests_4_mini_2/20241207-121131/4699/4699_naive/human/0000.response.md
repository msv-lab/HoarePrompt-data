To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze both the requirements and the program itself.

The task is to calculate the maximum number of diamonds that Joe can steal without triggering the bank's security system. The security system checks the sums of adjacent cells, and Joe can move diamonds but cannot cause any discrepancies in these sums.

### Key Points from the Problem Description:
1. **Input Limitations**:
   - `n`: Number of cells (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4)
   - `m`: Maximum number of moves per minute (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9)
   - `k`: Total minutes (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9)
   - Each cell contains diamonds from 0 to 10^5.

2. **Security System Check**: 
   - The system checks sums of adjacent cells. Joe can perform operations to redistribute diamonds but must ensure that the sums remain the same after his operations.

3. **Output**: 
   - The maximum number of diamonds Joe can steal.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
1. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates potential moves and determines the maximum diamonds Joe can steal based on the diamond distribution.
   - In cases where `n` is 1, it simply returns the minimum between the diamonds in that cell and the total moves (`m * k`).
   - If `n` is even, it returns 0, implying that Joe cannot steal any diamonds without triggering the system.
   - The function calculates the minimum number of diamonds in cells at odd indices and scales that based on moves and time.

2. **Handling Cases**:
   - The function does not account for cases where the distribution of diamonds could potentially allow stealing without triggering the system. For example, if there are ways to move diamonds without affecting adjacent sums, that logic is not explored.
   - The function specifically returns 0 for even `n`, which may not always be correct; Joe could still steal some diamonds based on the distribution.

### Potential Case Where the Program Fails:
- Consider a case with `n = 4`, `m = 2`, `k = 1`, and the diamonds distribution as `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. The program would return 0 because `n` is even. However, Joe could potentially move diamonds without triggering the system. For example, he can move diamonds from the third cell to his pocket, leaving the distribution as `[1, 2, 2, 4]` which does not trigger a change in the sums of any adjacent pairs.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to correctly account for scenarios where Joe can move diamonds without triggering the security system, particularly in cases with even `n`. Therefore, the correctness assessment is:

Correctness: **False**.
