`n` is assigned the value of `len(A)`, which calculates the number of elements in the list `A`. The values of `A`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is a list of integers, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, and `n` is the length of `A`.

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `n` is the length of `A`.**
