The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `A`, `m`, and `k`. 

- `A` is a list of integers representing the number of diamonds in each cell, with a length (`n`) such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and each element in `A` is an integer from 0 to 10^5.
- `m` is a positive integer representing the maximum number of operations Joe can perform in one minute.
- `k` is a positive integer representing the total number of minutes Joe has before morning.

After executing the function body, the function can return different values based on specific conditions:

- Case 1: If `n` equals 1, the function returns the minimum value between the first element of the list `A` and the product of `m` and `k`.
- Case 2: The function returns 0.
- Case 3: The function returns 0, which is a constant value regardless of the values of `A`, `m`, `k`, `n`, and moves.
- Case 4: The function returns the minimum value between `M` (the minimum value of the elements at even indices of `A`) and the result of `m` divided by `moves` (a non-integer value greater than 1) multiplied by `k` (a positive integer).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `A`, a positive integer `m`, and a positive integer `k`, and to return different values based on the specified conditions related to the input parameters. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers A, a positive integer m, and a positive integer k. It returns different values based on specific cases, including the minimum value between the first element of A and m multiplied by k if n equals 1, a constant value of 0, or the minimum value between M and a calculated expression involving m, moves, and k.**
