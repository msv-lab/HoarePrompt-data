#State of the program right berfore the function call: A is a list of integers representing the number of diamonds in each cell, m is a positive integer representing the maximum number of operations Joe can perform in one minute, and k is a positive integer representing the total number of minutes Joe has before morning. The length of A (n) is such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and each element in A is an integer from 0 to 10^5.
def func_1(A, m, k):
    n = len(A)
    if (n == 1) :
        return min(A[0], m * k)
        #The program returns the minimum value between the first element of the list `A` and the product of `m` and `k`, given that `n` equals 1.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`A` is a list of integers, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `n` is the length of `A`, and `n` is greater than 1.
    if (n % 2 == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`A` is a list of integers, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `n` is the length of `A`, `n` is greater than 1, and `n` is an odd integer.
    moves = n / 2 + 1
    if (moves > m) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0, which is a constant value regardless of the values of A, m, k, n, and moves.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`A` is a list of integers, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `n` is the length of `A`, and `moves` is a non-integer value greater than 1. The value of `moves` is less than or equal to `m`.
    M = min(A[0:n:2])
    return min(M, m / moves * k)
    #The program returns the minimum value between M (the minimum value of the elements at even indices of A) and the result of m divided by moves (a non-integer value greater than 1) multiplied by k (a positive integer)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `A`, a positive integer `m`, and a positive integer `k`. It returns the minimum value between the first element of `A` and the product of `m` and `k` if `A` contains only one element. If `A` has an even number of elements, it returns 0. If `A` has an odd number of elements and the required moves exceed `m`, it returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the minimum value between the smallest element in `A` at even indices and the result of `m` divided by the number of required moves (calculated as `n / 2 + 1`) multiplied by `k`.
