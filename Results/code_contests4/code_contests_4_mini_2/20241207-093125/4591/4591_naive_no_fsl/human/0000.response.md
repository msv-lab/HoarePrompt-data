Correctness: **True**

The provided program implements the algorithm for approximating the cube root based on the recurrence formula described in the problem statement. It starts with an initial guess of \( x_1 = \frac{q}{2} \) and iteratively refines this guess using the formula until the condition \( |x^3 - q| < 0.00001 \cdot q \) is satisfied.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the program adheres to the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads multiple lines of input until it encounters `-1`, which correctly matches the problem's requirement to handle multiple datasets.

2. **Initial Guess**: It correctly initializes \( x_1 \) as \( \frac{q}{2} \), which is consistent with the problem description.

3. **Recurrence Formula**: The update step \( x = x - \frac{x^3 - q}{3x^2} \) correctly follows the specified recurrence relation.

4. **Stopping Condition**: The program checks if \( |x^3 - q| < 0.00001 \cdot q \) to determine when to stop iterating, as required.

5. **Output Format**: The program prints the result formatted to six decimal places, which adheres to the output specification.

Given that the algorithm aligns with the problem requirements, and considering the edge cases such as the smallest and largest values for \( q \) within the specified range, the program will correctly calculate and output the approximation of the cube root for each valid dataset.

Since I cannot identify any potential case where the program fails to meet the requirements, I conclude that the implementation is correct.

Thus, the final determination is:

Correctness: **True**
