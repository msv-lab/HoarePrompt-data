Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the Newton-Raphson method for approximating the cube root of a positive integer \( q \) according to the problem description. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads multiple datasets, stopping when it encounters -1, which aligns with the problem statement.
2. **Initial Approximation**: It correctly initializes \( x_1 \) to \( \frac{q}{2} \), as specified.
3. **Iteration Logic**: The while loop continues updating \( x \) using the recurrence relation provided until the condition \( |x^3 - q| < 0.00001 \cdot q \) is satisfied, which is the required stopping criterion.
4. **Output Format**: The result is printed with six decimal places, ensuring the output's precision meets the error requirement.

No edge cases or potential failures in the logic were identified, indicating that the program meets the problem's requirements for all valid inputs.
