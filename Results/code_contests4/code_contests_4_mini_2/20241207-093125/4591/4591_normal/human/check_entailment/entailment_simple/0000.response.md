Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the algorithm described in the problem statement for approximating the cube root of a positive integer \( q \). Here is a breakdown of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads multiple datasets of positive integers until it encounters the sentinel value of -1. This aligns with the problem statement, which specifies that input will consist of multiple datasets followed by -1 to indicate the end.

2. **Initial Value**: It initializes \( x \) with \( \frac{q}{2} \), as required by the problem description. This serves as the starting point for the iterative approximation of the cube root.

3. **Recurrence Formula**: The program implements the recurrence formula \( x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{x_n^3 - q}{3x_n^2} \) correctly within the while loop. This formula iteratively refines the value of \( x \) until it is sufficiently close to the true cube root.

4. **Stopping Condition**: The condition to stop the iteration is based on whether \( |x^3 - q| < 0.00001 \times q \). The program computes \( diff \) as \( q \times 1e-05 \), which is consistent with the problem's requirement for determining when the approximation is "small enough."

5. **Output Format**: Finally, the program prints the result formatted to six decimal places, which is appropriate for the level of precision specified (an error of 0.00001 or less).

Thus, the program adheres to all aspects of the problem description, ensuring that it always produces the correct output for the given constraints.
