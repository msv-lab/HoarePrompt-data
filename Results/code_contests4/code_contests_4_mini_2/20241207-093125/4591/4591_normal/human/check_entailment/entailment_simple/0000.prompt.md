You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The solution of $ x ^ 3 = q $ is to calculate the recurrence formula $ x_ {n + 1} = x_n-\ frac {x_ {n} ^ 3 --q} {3x_ {n} ^ 2} $ It can be calculated approximately with.

Put a positive number $ \ frac {q} {2} $ in $ x_1 $

$ x_2 = x_1-\ frac {x_ {1} ^ 3 --q} {3x_ {1} ^ 2} $, $ x_3 = x_2-\ frac {x_ {2} ^ 3 --q} {3x_ {2} ^ Calculate as 2} $,â€¦.

While doing this calculation

When the value of $ | x ^ 3 --q | $ becomes small enough, stop the calculation and use the last calculated $ x_n $ as an approximate solution of $ x ^ 3 = q $.

Follow this method to create a program that outputs an approximation of the cube root of $ q $ for the input positive integer $ q $. However, use $ | x ^ 3-q | <0.00001 q $ to determine that it is "small enough".



input

Multiple datasets are given. For each dataset, $ q $ ($ 1 \ leq q <2 ^ {31} $) (integer) is given on one line. The end of the input is -1.

The number of datasets does not exceed 50.

output

Print $ x $ (real number) on one line for each dataset. The output result may contain an error of 0.00001 or less.

Example

Input

15
15
-1


Output

2.466212

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function processes multiple datasets of positive integers q, where 1 <= q < 2^31, and terminates when the input is -1. The number of datasets does not exceed 50.
def func():
    for line in stdin:
        q = int(line)
        
        if q == -1:
            break
        
        x = q / 2.0
        
        diff = q * 1e-05
        
        while True:
            x = x - (x ** 3 - q) / (3 * x * x)
            if abs(x ** 3 - q) < diff:
                break
        
        print('{:.6f}'.format(x))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `q` is a positive integer input from the datasets, `x` is the cube root of `q` (accurate to within `q * 1e-05`), `diff` is equal to `q * 1e-05`, and the output is formatted to six decimal places.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
