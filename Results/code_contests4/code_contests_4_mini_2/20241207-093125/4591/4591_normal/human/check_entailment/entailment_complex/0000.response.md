Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the algorithm described in the problem statement to approximate the cube root of a positive integer \( q \).

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the program aligns with the requirements from the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads multiple datasets of positive integers \( q \) until it encounters -1, which is the termination condition. This matches the requirement that the input consists of positive integers with a maximum of 50 datasets.

2. **Initial Value of \( x \)**:
   - The program starts with \( x = \frac{q}{2.0} \), which aligns with the problem's requirement to start with a positive number for the approximation.

3. **Recurrence Formula**:
   - The iterative process follows the recurrence formula \( x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{x_n^3 - q}{3x_n^2} \) as described. The program continuously updates \( x \) until the difference \( |x^3 - q| \) is small enough.

4. **Stopping Criterion**: 
   - The stopping condition in the program checks if \( |x^3 - q| < 0.00001 \times q \), which is exactly what the problem description requires for determining when the approximation is "small enough."

5. **Output Formatting**:
   - The output is formatted to six decimal places using `print('{:.6f}'.format(x))`, which ensures precision as required by the problem.

Given these points, the program adheres to the specifications of the problem description and will yield correct results for all valid input cases as per the stipulated constraints. Thus, the correctness of the program is confirmed.
