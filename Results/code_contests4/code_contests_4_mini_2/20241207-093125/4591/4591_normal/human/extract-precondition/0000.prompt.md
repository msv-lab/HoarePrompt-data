You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: The solution of $ x ^ 3 = q $ is to calculate the recurrence formula $ x_ {n + 1} = x_n-\ frac {x_ {n} ^ 3 --q} {3x_ {n} ^ 2} $ It can be calculated approximately with.

Put a positive number $ \ frac {q} {2} $ in $ x_1 $

$ x_2 = x_1-\ frac {x_ {1} ^ 3 --q} {3x_ {1} ^ 2} $, $ x_3 = x_2-\ frac {x_ {2} ^ 3 --q} {3x_ {2} ^ Calculate as 2} $,â€¦.

While doing this calculation

When the value of $ | x ^ 3 --q | $ becomes small enough, stop the calculation and use the last calculated $ x_n $ as an approximate solution of $ x ^ 3 = q $.

Follow this method to create a program that outputs an approximation of the cube root of $ q $ for the input positive integer $ q $. However, use $ | x ^ 3-q | <0.00001 q $ to determine that it is "small enough".



input

Multiple datasets are given. For each dataset, $ q $ ($ 1 \ leq q <2 ^ {31} $) (integer) is given on one line. The end of the input is -1.

The number of datasets does not exceed 50.

output

Print $ x $ (real number) on one line for each dataset. The output result may contain an error of 0.00001 or less.
