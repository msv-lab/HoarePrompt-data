The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a new positive integer from input, `x` is the cube root of the next positive integer `q`, `diff` is `q * 1e-05`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
