The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a positive integer; `x` is updated based on the formula `x = (q / 2.0) - [(q`, and the absolute value of `x`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
