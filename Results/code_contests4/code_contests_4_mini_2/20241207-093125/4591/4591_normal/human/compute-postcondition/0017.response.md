The value of `x` is updated according to the formula `x = x - (x ** 3 - q) / (3 * x * x)`. The value of `q` is a positive integer, and `x` is modified based on its current value and `q`. Other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a positive integer; `x` is updated according to the formula provided.
Output State: **`q` is a positive integer; `x` is updated according to the formula provided.**
