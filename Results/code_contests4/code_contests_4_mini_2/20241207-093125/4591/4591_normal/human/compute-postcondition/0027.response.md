`diff` is assigned the value of `q * 1e-05`. The value of `q` is a new positive integer from input, which is multiplied by `0.00001`. The value of `x` remains unchanged at `q / 2.0`. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a new positive integer from input; `x` is `q / 2.0`; `diff` is `q * 1e-05`.

Output State: **`q` is a new positive integer from input; `x` is `q / 2.0`; `diff` is `q * 1e-05`**
