Since the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, it can execute indefinitely. There are no conditions that would prevent the loop from running again. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states to allow for another iteration of the loop.

State: **`q` is a new positive integer from input, `x` is updated based on the calculation, and `diff` is `q * 1e-05`.**
