The variable `diff` is assigned the value of `q * 1e-05`, where `1e-05` is a scientific notation representing \(0.00001\). The value of `q` is a positive integer, so the calculation for `diff` results in a small positive number based on the value of `q`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a positive integer; `x` is `q / 2.0`; `diff` is `q * 0.00001`.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer; `x` is `q / 2.0`; `diff` is `q * 0.00001**
