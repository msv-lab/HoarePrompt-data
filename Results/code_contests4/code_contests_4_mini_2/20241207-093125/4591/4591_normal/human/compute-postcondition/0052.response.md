The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a new positive integer from input; `x` is updated based on the Newton-Raphson method; `diff` remains `q * 1e-05`; the absolute value of `x` cubed minus `q` is less than `diff`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
