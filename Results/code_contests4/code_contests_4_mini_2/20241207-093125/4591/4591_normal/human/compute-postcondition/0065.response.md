The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as it processes input from multiple datasets of positive integers. The input datasets are comprised of integers `q`, where each `q` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to less than 2^31, and the input terminates when `-1` is encountered. Additionally, the function processes no more than 50 datasets. 

The output of the function is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot detail the return value. However, it can be inferred that the function is designed to handle and process these datasets of integers and may return results based on that processing.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple datasets of positive integers, terminating on input -1, and processes up to 50 datasets of integers within the range specified.**
