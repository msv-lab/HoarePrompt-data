The variable `x` is updated based on the Newton-Raphson method for finding the cube root of `q`. The formula used is `x = x - (x ** 3 - q) / (3 * x * x)`, which adjusts `x` to be a better approximation of the cube root of `q`. Since `q` is a positive integer and `x` is updated accordingly, we will calculate the new value of `x`. The previous value of `x` is not specified, but it is implied to be a positive number.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `x` is updated based on the formula, while `q` remains a new positive integer.

Output State: **`q` is a new positive integer, `x` is updated based on the Newton-Raphson method.**
