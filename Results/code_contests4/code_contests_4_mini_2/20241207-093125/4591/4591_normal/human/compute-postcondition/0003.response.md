The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop. The initial state indicates that `q` was set to -1 before encountering -1, and now we are breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is equal to -1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State: **`q` is equal to -1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
