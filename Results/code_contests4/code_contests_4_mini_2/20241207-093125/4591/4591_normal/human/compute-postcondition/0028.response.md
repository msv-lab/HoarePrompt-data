Since the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, it will certainly execute at least one time regardless of the state of the variables. Therefore, no modifications are needed to ensure that the loop can execute.

State: **`q` is a new positive integer from input; `x` is `q / 2.0`; `diff` is `q * 1e-05`**
