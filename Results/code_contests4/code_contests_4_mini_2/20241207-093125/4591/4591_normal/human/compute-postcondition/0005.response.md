The variable `x` is assigned the value of `q / 2.0`. Since `q` is assigned the value of the first positive integer from stdin, `q` must be greater than 0. Therefore, `x` will be a positive float representing half of `q`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a positive integer; `x` is `q / 2.0`.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer; `x` is `q / 2.0**
