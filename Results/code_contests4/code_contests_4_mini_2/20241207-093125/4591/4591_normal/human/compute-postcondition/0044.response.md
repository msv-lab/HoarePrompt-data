The value of `q` is assigned the value of `int(line)`, where `line` is a new positive integer input. The previous values of `x` and `diff` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the new assignment of `q` without changing the other variables.

Output State: **`q` is a new positive integer from input, `x` is the cube root of the next positive integer `q`, `diff` is `q * 1e-05`**
