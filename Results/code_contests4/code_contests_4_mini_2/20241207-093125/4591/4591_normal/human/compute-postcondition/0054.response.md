According to the code, the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will always execute one more time regardless of the current state. Therefore, there are no conditions that need to be adjusted to allow the loop to continue iterating. 

State: **`q` is a new positive integer from input; `x` is updated based on the Newton-Raphson method; `diff` remains `q * 1e-05`.**
