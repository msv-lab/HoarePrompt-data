`diff` is assigned the value `q * 1e-05`. The previous value of `diff` was `q * 1e-05`, so it remains the same. The values of `q` and `x` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a new positive integer from input, `x` is `q / 2.0`, `diff` is `q * 1e-05`.

Output State: **`q` is a new positive integer from input, `x` is `q / 2.0`, `diff` is `q * 1e-05**
