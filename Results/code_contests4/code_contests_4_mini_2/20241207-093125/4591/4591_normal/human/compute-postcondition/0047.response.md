The variable `x` is assigned the value of `q / 2.0`. The initial state indicates that `q` is a positive integer, so the value of `x` will be half of `q`. The state of the other variables, `diff`, which is `q * 1e-05`, remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a new positive integer from input, `x` is `q / 2.0`, and `diff` is `q * 1e-05`. 

Output State: **`q` is a new positive integer from input, `x` is `q / 2.0`, `diff` is `q * 1e-05**
