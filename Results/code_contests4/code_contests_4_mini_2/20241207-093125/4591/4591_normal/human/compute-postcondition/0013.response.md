To determine the output state, we start with the initial state where `q` is a positive integer. The value of `x` is updated using the formula provided, which involves a series of calculations based on the current value of `x` and `q`.

1. The variable `x` is updated using the formula `x = x - (x ** 3 - q) / (3 * x * x)`. 
2. The formula consists of:
   - `x ** 3`: the cube of `x`.
   - `x ** 3 - q`: subtracting `q` from the cube of `x`.
   - `3 * x * x`: calculating three times the square of `x`.
   - The entire expression `(x ** 3 - q) / (3 * x * x)` computes a correction term.
3. The final value of `x` is derived by subtracting this correction term from the previous value of `x`.

Since `q` is a positive integer but we do not have the initial value of `x`, we cannot specify the exact numerical value of `x` after the operation. However, we can state that `x` has been updated based on the formula provided.

Therefore, the output state will indicate that `x` has been updated based on the calculation involving `q`, without specifying exact values due to the lack of initial values.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer; `x` is updated based on the formula `x = x - (x ** 3 - q) / (3 * x * x)`**.
