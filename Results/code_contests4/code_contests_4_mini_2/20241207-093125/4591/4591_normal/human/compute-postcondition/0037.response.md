Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute again regardless of the current state. Therefore, no modifications are necessary to the program state for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`q` is a new positive integer from input, `x` is updated based on the calculation, and `diff` is equal to `q * 1e-05`.**
