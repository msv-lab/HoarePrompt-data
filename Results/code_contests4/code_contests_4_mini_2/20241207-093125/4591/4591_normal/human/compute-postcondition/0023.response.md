The variable `q` is assigned the value `int(line)`, where `line` represents an input line from stdin. The previous state indicates that `q` is a positive integer, so after this assignment, `q` will hold the integer value obtained from `line`. The value of `x`, which is the cube root of `q`, will also need to be recalculated based on the new value of `q`. Since `line` contains a value that can be parsed as an integer, `q` will simply take on this new positive integer value while `x` will be updated accordingly to reflect the cube root of this new value.

However, without the exact value of `line`, we cannot determine the specific outcomes for `q` and `x`. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `q` has changed to a new input integer from `line`, and `x` will adjust to be the cube root of this new `q`.

Output State: **`q` is a new positive integer from input; `x` is the cube root of the new `q`**
