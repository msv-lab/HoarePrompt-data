According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input provided via `stdin`. The loop will process multiple datasets of positive integers until it encounters -1. For the loop to execute at least once, there must be at least one positive integer before the termination input of -1. Therefore, the state must include that there is at least one dataset (a positive integer) available before -1 is encountered.

State: **for the loop to execute, there is at least one dataset of positive integers in stdin before -1 is encountered**
