The function processes multiple datasets of positive integers, where each integer is read from the standard input until the input is -1, which terminates the process. For each positive integer `q`, it calculates the cube root of `q` using an iterative method that continues until the result is accurate to within `q * 1e-05`. The calculated cube root is then printed formatted to six decimal places. The function handles up to 50 datasets of integers and does not return any value; it only prints the results.
