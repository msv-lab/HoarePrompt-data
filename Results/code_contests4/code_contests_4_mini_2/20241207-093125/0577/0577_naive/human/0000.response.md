To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze whether it correctly handles all potential cases as outlined.

### Problem Analysis:
The program is supposed to build a family tree based on the input and then answer queries about the number of distinct names among the k-sons of a specified individual. The program must account for:
1. The direct ancestor relationships.
2. The ability to traverse the tree up to k levels.
3. Correctly handling names that may not be unique.

### Code Review:
1. The input structure appears to be set up correctly, with `n` people and their ancestors being read into the program.
2. The program creates a child list to hold children for each ancestor and a mapping for names.
3. The function `func_1` is responsible for determining the number of distinct names for the k-sons.

### Potential Case for Failure:
- The program does not adequately handle the case where a person has no children. If `k` is greater than the actual depth of the tree for that individual, the program may not return the correct count of names.
- Specifically, if all children are queried but the individual has no children, it should return `0`. However, the handling of this scenario in the logic could lead to incorrect outputs.

### Example Input for Failure Case:
Consider an input scenario where:
```
3
alice 0
bob 1
charlie 1
2
1 2
2 1
```
Here:
- Person `1` (alice) has two children: bob and charlie.
- The query `1 2` asks for the 2-sons of alice, which should return `0` because both bob and charlie are at depth `1`.
- The query `2 1` asks for the 1-son of bob, which should return `0` because bob has no children.

### Conclusion:
The current logic does not seem to correctly manage the case where a queried individual has no children or when the k-value exceeds available descendants. Therefore, there are scenarios where the output may not match the expected output based on the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
