Postcondition: ***`x` and `dep` are positive integers (1 ≤ x ≤ n, 1 ≤ dep ≤ n). If `j` is not in `ans[fa[x]]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now equal to `ans[x][j]`. Otherwise, if the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated with the result of `ans[fa[x]][j] |= ans[x][j]` and `ans[x][j]` is cleared; otherwise, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[x][j]`. In both cases, `query[x]` has been fully processed, `answer` is updated for the relevant indices, and the length of `ans[x]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]]`.***
