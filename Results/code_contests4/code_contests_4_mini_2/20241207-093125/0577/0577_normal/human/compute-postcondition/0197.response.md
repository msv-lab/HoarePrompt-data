Postcondition: ***`x` is a positive integer, `dep` is a positive integer, and `query[x]` is a list with even length. If the length of `ans[x]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, then `ans[x]` is an empty list while `ans[fa[x]]` may still contain unique elements from previous states. Otherwise, `ans[fa[x]]` contains updated values from `ans[x]`, and `ans[x]` contains values based on the conditions applied to each `j` from `ans[fa[x]]`.***
