Postcondition: ***`x` is a positive integer, `dep` is a positive integer, `ans[fa[x]]` is a list with at least 1 element, and `j` is the first element in `ans[fa[x]]` which is also an element of `ans[x]`. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now empty. Otherwise, `ans[fa[x]][j]` remains unchanged, and `ans[x][j]` now holds the value from `ans[fa[x]][j]`.***
