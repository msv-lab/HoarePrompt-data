The code `ans[fa[x]][j].clear()` clears the list or collection at the index `j` of `ans[fa[x]]`. The other variables (`x`, `dep`, and `ans`) are not affected by this operation, but the content of `ans[fa[x]][j]` is emptied. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` and `dep` are positive integers; `j` is the next index in `ans[x]`; `ans[fa[x]][j]` has been cleared.
Output State: **`x` and `dep` are positive integers; `j` is the next index in `ans[x]`; `ans[fa[x]][j]` has been cleared.**
