Postcondition: ***`x`, `dep`, and `j` are positive integers; `j` is now `j + 1`. If `j` was not in `ans[x]`, then `ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. Otherwise, if the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[x][j]` is updated with the bitwise OR of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared. If not, `ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`.***
