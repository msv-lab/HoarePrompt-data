Postcondition: ***`x` is a positive integer, `dep` is a positive integer, `query[x]` is a list with even length, and `answer` is updated based on conditions in the loop. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[x][j]` is cleared and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated. Otherwise, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[x][j]`.***
