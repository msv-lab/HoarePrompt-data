The operation `ans[x][j].clear()` is intended to clear the contents of the list at index `j` in the `ans[x]` list. This means that all elements in `ans[x][j]` will be removed, leaving it as an empty list. The values of `x`, `dep`, `ans`, and `j` are not directly altered by this operation, aside from the emptying of the specified list.

Therefore, the Output State is: `x` and `dep` are positive integers, `ans[fa[x]]` is a list with at least 3 elements, `j` is the next index in `ans[fa[x]]`, and `ans[x][j]` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`x` and `dep` are positive integers; `ans[fa[x]]` is a list with at least 3 elements; `j` is the next index in `ans[fa[x]]`; `ans[x][j]` is now an empty list.**
