Postcondition: ***`x` is a positive integer (1 ≤ x ≤ n), `dep` is a positive integer (1 ≤ dep ≤ n), `query[x]` has been fully processed, `answer` is updated for the relevant indices, the counting of answers has occurred, the length of `ans[x]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, and `j` is the first element of `ans[x]`. If `j` is not present in `ans[fa[x]]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now equal to `ans[x][j]`. Otherwise, if `j` is present in `ans[fa[x]]`, and the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to include the values from `ans[x][j]`, and `ans[x][j]` is cleared. If not, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[x][j]`.***
