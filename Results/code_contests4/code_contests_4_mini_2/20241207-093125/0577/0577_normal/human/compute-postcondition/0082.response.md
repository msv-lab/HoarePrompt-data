Postcondition: ***`x` and `dep` are positive integers. If `j` is not in `ans[x]`, then `ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. Otherwise, if the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[x][j]` is updated to the result of `ans[x][j] | ans[fa[x]][j]`, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared to an empty collection. If not, `ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`.***
