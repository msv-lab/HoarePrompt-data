The operation `ans[x][j].clear()` is called, which clears the contents of `ans[x][j]`. The previous state indicates that `ans[fa[x]][j]` includes elements from `ans[x][j]`, but this operation does not affect `ans[fa[x]][j]` directly; it only clears `ans[x][j]`. Therefore, after executing this line, `ans[x][j]` will be empty, while `ans[fa[x]][j]` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`ans[fa[x]][j]` includes the elements of `ans[x][j]` (set union), maintaining the previous constraints and relationships; `ans[x][j]` is now empty.**
