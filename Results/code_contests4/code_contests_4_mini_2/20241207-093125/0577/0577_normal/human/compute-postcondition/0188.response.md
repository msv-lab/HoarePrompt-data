The operation `ans[fa[x]][j].clear()` is intended to clear the contents of the list at index `j` of the list `ans[fa[x]]`. This operation does not affect the values of `x`, `dep`, or `j` directly; it only modifies the contents of the list at the specified location.

Before the operation:
- `ans[fa[x]]` is a list with at least 3 elements, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is presumably a list itself since we are calling `.clear()` on it.
- The previous values of `ans[fa[x]][j]` are not specified, but we know that it will be empty after the operation.

After executing the code, the state of the variables is:
- `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now cleared (i.e., it is an empty list).
- Other variables (`x`, `dep`, `ans`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`x` and `dep` are positive integers; `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now an empty list; `j` is unchanged.**
