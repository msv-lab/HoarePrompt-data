The value of `x` is reassigned to `Child[x][nowChild[x]]`. Since `nowChild[x]` is not equal to `lenChild[x]`, this means there is at least one valid child index to access in the `Child` array for the current value of `x`. The specific new value of `x` depends on the contents of the `Child` array and the current value of `nowChild[x]`, but it is guaranteed that `x` will be updated to a new valid positive integer based on these conditions. The values of `dep` and the states of the arrays `Child`, `nowChild`, and `lenChild` are not directly affected but are relevant to the operation. 

Output State: **`dep` is a positive integer (1 ≤ dep ≤ n); `x` is updated to Child[x][nowChild[x]]; `nowChild[x]` is not equal to `lenChild[x]`.**
