The command `ans[x][j].clear()` clears the contents of the list or array at the position `ans[x][j]`. Since `x` and `j` are positive integers, the operation will remove all elements from `ans[x][j]`, but the values of `x`, `dep`, and `j` are unchanged. The initial states of `x`, `dep`, and `j` remain valid, and only the contents of `ans[x][j]` are affected. Therefore, the Output State reflects the clearing of that specific position in the `ans` array.

Output State: **`x` and `dep` are positive integers; `j` is incremented by 1; `ans[x][j]` has been cleared.**
