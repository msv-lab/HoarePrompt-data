Postcondition: ***`x` is a positive integer (1 ≤ x ≤ n), `dep` is a positive integer (1 ≤ dep ≤ n), `query[x]` has been fully processed, and `answer` is updated for the relevant indices based on the conditions checked in the loop; the counting of answers has occurred. The length of `ans[x]` is greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]]`.***
