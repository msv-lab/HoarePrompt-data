Output State: **`x` is a positive integer (1 ≤ x ≤ n), `dep` is a positive integer (1 ≤ dep ≤ n), `query[x]` has been fully processed, `answer` is updated for the relevant indices, the counting of answers has occurred, the length of `ans[x]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, `j` is the first element of `ans[x]`, and `j` is not present in `ans[fa[x]]`; `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now equal to `ans[x][j]`.**
