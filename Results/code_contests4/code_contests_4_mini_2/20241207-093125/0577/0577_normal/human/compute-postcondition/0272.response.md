Postcondition: ***`x` is a positive integer (1 ≤ x ≤ n), `dep` is a positive integer (1 ≤ dep ≤ n), `query[x]` has been fully processed, `answer` is updated, the length of `ans[x]` is greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, for the loop to execute, `ans[fa[x]]` must be non-empty, `j` is initialized to the first element in `ans[fa[x]]`, and `j` is an element of `ans[x]`. The length of `ans[x][j]` is less than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`.***
