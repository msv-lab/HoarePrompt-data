Postcondition: ***`x` and `dep` are positive integers. If the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]` is less than or equal to the length of `ans[x][j]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared, resulting in it being an empty list, while `j` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`.***
