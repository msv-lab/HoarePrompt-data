The value of `ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. The variables `x` and `j` are known, and `ans[x][j]` has been cleared prior to this assignment. The variable `fa[x]` is not defined within the given state, so we assume it refers to some value based on `x`. The output state will reflect that `ans[x][j]` now holds the value from `ans[fa[x]][j]`. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`x` and `dep` are positive integers; `j` is incremented by 1; `ans[x][j]` has the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`**.
