The value of `j` is assigned the value of `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]`. Since `nowlistindex` is 4, this means `j` is assigned the value of `query[x][5]`. The values of the other variables (`x`, `dep`, `len(query[x])`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is a positive integer (1 ≤ x ≤ n), `dep` is a positive integer (1 ≤ dep ≤ n), `len(query[x])` is greater than 4, `nowlistindex` is 4, `i` is assigned the value `query[x][4]`, and `j` is assigned the value `query[x][5]`.

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer (1 ≤ x ≤ n), `dep` is a positive integer (1 ≤ dep ≤ n), `len(query[x])` is greater than 4, `nowlistindex` is 4, `i` is assigned the value `query[x][4]`, `j` is assigned the value `query[x][5]`**
