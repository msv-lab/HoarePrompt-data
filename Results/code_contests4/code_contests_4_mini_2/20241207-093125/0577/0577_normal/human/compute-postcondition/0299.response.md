Postcondition: ***`x` and `dep` are positive integers (1 ≤ x ≤ n, 1 ≤ dep ≤ n). If the length of `ans[x]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, then `ans[fa[x]]` contains updated values based on all elements in `ans[x]`, and `ans[x]` is now empty. Otherwise, `ans[fa[x]]` is updated to be equal to `ans[x]`, and `ans[x][j]` remains compatible with `ans[fa[x]][j]` based on their union and length comparisons.***
