Output State: **`x` is a positive integer (1 ≤ x ≤ n), `dep` is a positive integer (1 ≤ dep ≤ n), `query[x]` has been fully processed, `answer` is updated for the relevant indices, the counting of answers has occurred, the length of `ans[x]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, `j` is the second element of `ans[x]` (assuming it exists), and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated with the result of `ans[fa[x]][j] |= ans[x][j] and `ans[x][j]` is cleared.`**
