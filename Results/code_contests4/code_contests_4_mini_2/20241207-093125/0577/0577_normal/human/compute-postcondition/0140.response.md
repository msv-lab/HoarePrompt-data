Postcondition: ***`x` is a positive integer, `dep` is a positive integer, `query[x]` is a list with even length, `answer` is updated based on conditions in the loop, `ans[x]` is a list with at least 1 element, `j` is the first element in `ans[x]`, and `j` is present in `ans[fa[x]]`. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated by combining it with `ans[x][j]` using bitwise OR, and `ans[x][j]` is now an empty list. Otherwise, `ans[x][j]` is updated with unique elements from `ans[fa[x]][j]`, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now empty, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` holds the same values as `ans[x][j]`.***
