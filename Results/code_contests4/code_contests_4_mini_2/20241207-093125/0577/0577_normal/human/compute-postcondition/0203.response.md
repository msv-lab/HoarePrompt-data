In the provided code snippet, `x` is assigned the value from the `Child` array at the index `nowChild[x]`. The initial state indicates that `x` is a positive integer within a specific range and that `nowChild[x]` is a valid index where the length of `Child[x]` has not been fully traversed.

Since `Child[x][nowChild[x]]` retrieves a value from the `Child` array based on the current `nowChild[x]` index, this operation will update `x` to that value. The previous value of `x` remains unchanged, but now `x` holds a new value. 

Thus, the output state indicates the new value of `x`, while keeping the constraints on `dep`, and the condition on `nowChild[x]`.

Output State: **`dep` is a positive integer (1 ≤ dep ≤ n), `x` is updated to Child[x][nowChild[x]], and nowChild[x] is not equal to lenChild[x].**
