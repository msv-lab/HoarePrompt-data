According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements of `ans[fa[x]]`. Since `ans[fa[x]]` is a list with at least 1 element at the end of the last iteration, the loop can execute again as long as there are more elements in `ans[fa[x]]`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `j` is currently processing an element from `ans[fa[x]]`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to move to the next element in the list. If `j` is currently at the last index of `ans[fa[x]]`, the loop cannot execute again.

Let's denote the length of `ans[fa[x]]` as `length`. Since the loop iterates over `ans[fa[x]]`, `j` is currently at an index less than `length - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1, making it equal to the next index.

State: **`x` is a positive integer, `dep` is a positive integer, `ans[fa[x]]` is a list with at least 2 elements, `j` is the next index in `ans[fa[x]]`**
