Postcondition: ***`x` and `dep` are positive integers, `ans[fa[x]]` is a list with at least 2 elements, and `j` is the next index in `ans[fa[x]]`. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[x][j]` is the result of a bitwise OR operation between `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]`, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now cleared. Otherwise, `ans[x][j]` is updated with the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`.***
