The call to `ans[fa[x]][j].clear()` affects the variable `ans[fa[x]][j]` by clearing its contents, which means it becomes an empty collection. Meanwhile, `ans[x][j]` remains updated to the result of `ans[x][j] | ans[fa[x]][j]`, but the contents of `ans[fa[x]][j]` are now cleared. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans[x][j]` is updated to the result of `ans[x][j] | ans[fa[x]][j] and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now an empty collection after being cleared.
