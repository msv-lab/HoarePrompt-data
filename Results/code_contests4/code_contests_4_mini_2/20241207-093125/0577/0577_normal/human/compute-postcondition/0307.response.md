Postcondition: ***`x` and `dep` are positive integers with `1 ≤ x ≤ n` and `1 ≤ dep ≤ n`. If `nowChild[x]` is equal to `lenChild[x]`, then `x` is updated to `fa[x]`, `nowChild[x]` is increased by 1, and `dep` is decreased by 1, potentially updating the values in `ans`. Otherwise, `x` is assigned the value from `Child[x][nowChild[x]]`, `dep` is increased by 1 while remaining a positive integer, and `nowChild[x]` is less than `lenChild[x]`.***
