Postcondition: ***`x` and `dep` are positive integers. If `j` is not in `ans[fa[x]]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[x][j]`. Otherwise, if the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, `ans[x][j]` is cleared, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated with the bitwise OR of `ans[x][j]`. If not, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[x][j]`, modifying `ans[fa[x]][j]` accordingly.***
