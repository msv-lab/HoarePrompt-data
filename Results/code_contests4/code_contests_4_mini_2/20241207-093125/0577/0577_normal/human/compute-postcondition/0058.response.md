Output State: **`x` and `dep` are positive integers. After all iterations, for each `j` in `ans[x]`, `ans[fa[x]][j]` will contain the combined elements from both `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]`, with `ans[x][j]` cleared if it was shorter than `ans[fa[x]][j]`. If `j` was not previously in `ans[fa[x]]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` will take the value of `ans[x][j]`.**
