Postcondition: ***`x` is a positive integer, `dep` is a positive integer, `i` is assigned the value of `query[x][2]`, and `j` is assigned the value of `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]`. If `dep + i` is not in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is set to 0. Otherwise, `answer[j]` is assigned the length of `ans[x][dep + i]`.***
