Postcondition: ***`x` is a positive integer (1 ≤ x ≤ n), `dep` is a positive integer (1 ≤ dep ≤ n), `query[x]` has been fully processed, `answer` is updated for the relevant indices, the counting of answers has occurred, and the length of `ans[x]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]]`. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated with the result of `ans[fa[x]][j] |= ans[x][j]` and `ans[x][j]` is cleared; otherwise, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[x][j]`.***
