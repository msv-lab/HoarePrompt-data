The value of `j` is assigned the value of `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]`. Given that `nowlistindex` is 0, the expression `nowlistindex + 1` evaluates to 1. Therefore, `j` is assigned the value of `query[x][1]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer (1 ≤ x ≤ n), `dep` is a positive integer (1 ≤ dep ≤ n), the value of `nowChild[x]` is equal to the value of `lenChild[x]`, `ans[x][dep]` is assigned the set containing `ss[x]`, `len(query[x])` is at least 2, `nowlistindex` is 0, `i` is assigned the value of `query[x][0]`; `j` is assigned the value of `query[x][1]`.**
