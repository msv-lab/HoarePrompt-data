Postcondition: ***`x` is a positive integer, `dep` is a positive integer, `query[x]` is a list with even length, `answer` is updated based on the conditions in the loop for each pair of elements from `query[x]`, where for each pair `(i, j)`, `answer[j]` is either set to 0 if `dep + i` is not in `ans[x]` or assigned the length of `ans[x][dep + i]` if it exists; and the length of `ans[x]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]]`.***
