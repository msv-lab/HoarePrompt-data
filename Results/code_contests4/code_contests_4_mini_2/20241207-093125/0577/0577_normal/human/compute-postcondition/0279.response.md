The assignment `ans[x][j] = ans[fa[x]][j]` copies the value from `ans[fa[x]][j]` to `ans[x][j]`. Since `x` and `dep` are positive integers and `j` is the next index for the loop, we assume `fa[x]` refers to the parent or previous index of `x`, and that `ans[fa[x]]` has enough elements to allow access at index `j`. The values of `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]` are affected by this assignment, while `x`, `dep`, and `j` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the output state is: `x` and `dep` are positive integers, `j` is the next index for the loop to iterate in `ans[fa[x]]`, and `ans[x][j]` is now equal to `ans[fa[x]][j]`.

Output State: **`x` and `dep` are positive integers, `j` is the next index for the loop to iterate in `ans[fa[x]]`, and `ans[x][j]` is now equal to `ans[fa[x]][j]**
