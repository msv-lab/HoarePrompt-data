The value of `ans[x][j]` is assigned the value `ans[fa[x]][j]`. The previous values of `ans` and `fa` are not provided, but since `ans[x][j]` is currently empty, it will now take the value from `ans[fa[x]][j]`. The exact values depend on the current state of `fa[x]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]`, which are not specified. However, the operation updates `ans[x][j]` based on the value from a previously determined index.

Since the values of `fa[x]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]` are unknown, we cannot state the exact values in the output state, but we recognize that `ans[x][j]` will now hold a value derived from `ans[fa[x]][j]`.

Output State: **`x`, `dep`, and `j` are positive integers; `ans[x][j]` is now assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`.**
