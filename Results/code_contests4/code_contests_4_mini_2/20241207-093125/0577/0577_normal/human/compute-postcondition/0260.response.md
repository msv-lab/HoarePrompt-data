Postcondition: ***`x` and `dep` are positive integers. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated using the bitwise OR operation with `ans[x][j]`, and `ans[x][j]` is cleared. Otherwise, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to the value of `ans[x][j]`.***
