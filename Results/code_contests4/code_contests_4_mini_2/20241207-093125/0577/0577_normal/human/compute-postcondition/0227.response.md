Postcondition: ***`x` is a positive integer (1 ≤ x ≤ n) and `dep` is a positive integer (1 ≤ dep ≤ n). If `dep + i` is not in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is assigned the value of 0. Otherwise, `answer[j]` is assigned the value of `len(ans[x][dep + i])`, where `i` is `query[x][4]` and `j` is `query[x][5]`. The length of `query[x]` is greater than 4, and `nowlistindex` is 4.***
