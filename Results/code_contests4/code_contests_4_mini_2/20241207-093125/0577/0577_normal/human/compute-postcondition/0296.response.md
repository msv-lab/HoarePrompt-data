Output State: **`x` and `dep` are positive integers. For each `j` in `ans[fa[x]]`, `ans[x][j]` will either contain the value from `ans[fa[x]][j]`, be updated with the union of `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]`, or be cleared based on the conditions checked in the loop. The relationship between `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]` will be maintained according to the length comparisons, ensuring that `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]` remain compatible in size.**
