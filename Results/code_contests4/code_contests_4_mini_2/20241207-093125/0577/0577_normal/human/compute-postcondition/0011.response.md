Postcondition: ***`x` is a positive integer (1 ≤ x ≤ n), `dep` is a positive integer (1 ≤ dep ≤ n), `nowChild[x]` is equal to `lenChild[x]`, `ans[x][dep]` is assigned the set containing `ss[x]`, `len(query[x])` is at least 2, `nowlistindex` is 0, `i` is assigned the value of `query[x][0]`, `j` is assigned the value of `query[x][1]`, and if `dep + i` is not in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is assigned the value 0. Otherwise, `answer[j]` is assigned the value `len(ans[x][dep + i])`.***
