Postcondition: ***`x` is a positive integer, `dep` is a positive integer, and `ans[fa[x]]` is a list with at least 1 element. If `j` is not an element of `ans[x]`, then `ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. Otherwise, if `j` is an element of `ans[x]`, and if the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now empty; otherwise, `ans[fa[x]][j]` remains unchanged, and `ans[x][j]` holds the value from `ans[fa[x]][j]`.***
