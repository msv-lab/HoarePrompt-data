The `clear()` method is called on `ans[fa[x]][j]`, which removes all elements from the list or collection at that specific location in the `ans` structure. This operation does not change the values of `x`, `dep`, or `j`, but it does affect the content of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. Since `fa[x]` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact previous state of that specific `ans` element, but we know it is cleared.

Therefore, the Output State is: `x` and `dep` are positive integers; `j` is incremented by 1; and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared.

Output State: **`x` and `dep` are positive integers; `j` is incremented by 1; and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared.**
