Postcondition: ***`x` is a positive integer (1 ≤ x ≤ n), `dep` is a positive integer (1 ≤ dep ≤ n), `len(query[x])` is at least 2, `nowlistindex` is 0, `i` is assigned the value of `query[x][0]`, and `j` is assigned the value of `query[x][1]`. If `dep + i` is not in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is now 0. Otherwise, `answer[j]` is assigned the value of `len(ans[x][dep + i])`.***
