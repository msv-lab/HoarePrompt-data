Postcondition: ***`x` and `dep` are positive integers, and `j` is a valid index. If `j` is not in `ans[fa[x]]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[x][j]`. Otherwise, if the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated using a bitwise OR operation with `ans[x][j]`, and `ans[x][j]` is cleared. If the length condition is not met, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[x][j]`.***
