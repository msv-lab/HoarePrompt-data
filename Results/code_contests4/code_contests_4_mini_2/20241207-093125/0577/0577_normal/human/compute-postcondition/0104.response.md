To determine whether the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition `x != -1`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, we know that:
- `x` is a positive integer (1 ≤ x ≤ n), meaning `x` is never equal to -1.
- Therefore, as long as `x` remains within the range of 1 to n, the loop can execute again.

Since the condition for the loop is `x != -1`, and `x` is currently a positive integer, the loop will certainly execute one more time without requiring any adjustments.

State: **`x` is a positive integer (1 ≤ x ≤ n), `dep` is a positive integer (1 ≤ dep ≤ n)**
