Postcondition: ***`x` and `dep` are positive integers. If `x` is not equal to 0, then if the length of `ans[x]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, `ans[x]` is cleared while `dep` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `ans[fa[x]]` holds the previous contents of `ans[x]` and `ans[x]` remains unchanged.***
