The operation `ans[fa[x]][j].clear()` removes all elements from the list `ans[fa[x]][j]`. This will affect the contents of the list at `ans[fa[x]][j]`, but the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is a positive integer, `dep` is a positive integer, `ans[fa[x]]` is a list with at least 1 element, `j` is the first element in `ans[fa[x]]`, `j` is an element of `ans[x]`, and the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now empty.

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer, `dep` is a positive integer, `ans[fa[x]]` is a list with at least 1 element, `j` is the first element in `ans[fa[x]]`, `j` is an element of `ans[x]`, the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now empty.**
