Postcondition: ***`x` and `dep` are positive integers (1 ≤ `x` ≤ `n`, 1 ≤ `dep` ≤ `n`). If `dep + i` is not in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is set to 0. Otherwise, `i` is assigned the value of `query[x][4]`, `j` is assigned the value of `query[x][5]`, and `answer[j]` is assigned the length of `ans[x][dep + i]`.***
