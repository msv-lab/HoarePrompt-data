The code `ans[x][j].clear()` removes all elements from the list or collection `ans[x][j]`. This operation affects only the specific variable `ans[x][j]`, while the values of `x`, `dep`, and other elements in the `ans` structure remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is that `ans[x][j]` is now empty.

Output State: **`x` and `dep` are positive integers; `ans[x][j]` is now empty.**
