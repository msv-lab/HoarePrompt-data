The variable `ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. The value of `fa[x]` is used to determine the index from which `ans` is accessed. The previous values of `ans`, `x`, and `j` affect the result. Since `j` is incremented by 1, it is guaranteed to have at least `j + 1` elements for this operation to be valid. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` and `dep` are positive integers, `j` is incremented by 1, `ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`.

Output State: **`x` and `dep` are positive integers, `j` is incremented by 1, `ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]**
