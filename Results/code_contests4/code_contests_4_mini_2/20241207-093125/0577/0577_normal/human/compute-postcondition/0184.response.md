Postcondition: ***`x` and `dep` are positive integers, `ans[fa[x]]` is a list with at least 2 elements, and `j` is the next index in `ans[fa[x]]`. If `j` is not in `ans[x]`, then `ans[x][j]` is updated to `ans[fa[x]][j]`. Otherwise, if the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, `ans[x][j]` is the result of a bitwise OR operation between `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]`, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is not greater, `ans[x][j]` is updated with the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`.***
