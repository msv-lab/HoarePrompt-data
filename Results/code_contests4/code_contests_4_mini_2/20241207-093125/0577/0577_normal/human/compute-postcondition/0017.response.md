Postcondition: ***`x` is a positive integer (1 ≤ x ≤ n), `dep` is a positive integer (1 ≤ dep ≤ n), `nowChild[x]` is equal to `lenChild[x]`, `ans[x][dep]` is assigned the set containing `ss[x]`, `len(query[x])` is at least 4, `nowlistindex` is 2, `i` is assigned the value of `query[x][2]`, `j` is assigned the value of `query[x][3]`. If `dep + i` is not in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is assigned the value `0`. Otherwise, `answer[j]` is assigned the length of `ans[x][dep + i]`.***
