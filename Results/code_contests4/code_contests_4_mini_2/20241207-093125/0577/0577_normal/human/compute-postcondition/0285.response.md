Postcondition: ***`x`, `dep`, and `j` are positive integers. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[x][j]` is updated to the result of a bitwise OR operation with `ans[fa[x]][j]`, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared. Otherwise, `ans[x][j]` is updated to the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, while `ans[x][j]` was previously cleared.***
