Postcondition: ***`x` is a positive integer, `dep` is a positive integer, `query[x]` is a list with even length, `answer` is updated based on conditions in the loop, `ans[x]` is a list that still has at least 1 element, and `j` is the next element in `ans[x]` after the first element. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated with the bitwise OR of `ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[x][j]`, and `ans[x][j]` is cleared. Otherwise, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is assigned the value from `ans[x][j]`.***
