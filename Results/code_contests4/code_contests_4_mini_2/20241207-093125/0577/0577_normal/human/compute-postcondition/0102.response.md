The value of `dep` is incremented by 1. Since `dep` is a positive integer and the initial condition is that `1 ≤ dep ≤ n`, after the execution of `dep += 1`, the value of `dep` will be at least 2 and at most `n + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `dep` is now greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to `n + 1`; `x` is updated to `Child[x][nowChild[x]]`; `nowChild[x]` is not equal to `lenChild[x]`.

Output State: **`dep` is now greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to `n + 1`; `x` is updated to `Child[x][nowChild[x]]`; `nowChild[x]` is not equal to `lenChild[x]`.**
