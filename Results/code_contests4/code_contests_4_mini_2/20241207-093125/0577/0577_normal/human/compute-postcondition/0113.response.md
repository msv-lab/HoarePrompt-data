Postcondition: ***`x` and `dep` are positive integers (1 ≤ x ≤ n and 1 ≤ dep ≤ n). If `dep + i` is not in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is set to 0. Otherwise, `answer[j]` is assigned the length of `ans[x][dep + i]`, where `i` is the first element of `query[x]` and `j` is the second element of `query[x]` while `nowlistindex` remains 0.***
