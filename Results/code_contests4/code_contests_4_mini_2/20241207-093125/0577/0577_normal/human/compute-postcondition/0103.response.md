Postcondition: ***`x` is a positive integer (1 ≤ x ≤ n) and `dep` is a positive integer (1 ≤ dep ≤ n). If `nowChild[x]` equals `lenChild[x]`, then `x` is updated to `fa[x]`, `dep` is decreased by 1, `ans[x]` may be cleared or remain unchanged depending on the previous lengths of `ans[x]` and `ans[fa[x]]`, and `nowChild[x]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `dep` is between 2 and n + 1 (inclusive), `x` is updated to `Child[x][nowChild[x]]`, and `nowChild[x]` is not equal to `lenChild[x]`.***
