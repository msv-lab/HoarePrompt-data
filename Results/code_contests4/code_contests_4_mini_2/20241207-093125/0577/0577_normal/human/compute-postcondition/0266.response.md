Postcondition: ***`x` is a positive integer (1 ≤ x ≤ n), `dep` is a positive integer (1 ≤ dep ≤ n), `query[x]` has been fully processed, `answer` is updated, the length of `ans[x]` is greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, `ans[fa[x]]` is non-empty, and `j` is initialized to the first element in `ans[fa[x]]`. Additionally, `j` is not an element of `ans[x]`.***
