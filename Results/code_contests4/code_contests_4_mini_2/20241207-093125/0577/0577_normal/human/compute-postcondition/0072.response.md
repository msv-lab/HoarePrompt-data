Postcondition: ***`x` and `dep` are positive integers. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[x][j]` is updated to include the values from `ans[fa[x]][j]` using a bitwise OR operation, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared. Otherwise, `ans[fa[x]][j]` remains unchanged, and `ans[x][j]` is empty.***
