`ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, which means that the contents of `ans[fa[x]][j]` are now copied into `ans[x][j]`. The previous values of `ans[x][j]` are overwritten. The state of `ans[fa[x]][j]` remains unchanged, while `ans[x][j]` now holds the value from `ans[fa[x]][j]`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is a positive integer, `dep` is a positive integer, `ans[fa[x]][j]` has not changed, and `ans[x][j]` now holds the value from `ans[fa[x]][j]`.

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer, `dep` is a positive integer, `ans[fa[x]][j]` has not changed, `ans[x][j]` now holds the value from `ans[fa[x]][j]**
