Output State: **`x` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `x` ≤ `n`), `dep` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `dep` ≤ `n`), `nowChild[x]` is equal to `lenChild[x]`, `ans[x][dep]` is assigned the set containing `ss[x]`, `len(query[x])` is even, `nowlistindex` is the last index processed, `i` is assigned the last value of `query[x]` processed, `j` is assigned the corresponding value of `query[x]`, and `answer[j]` is assigned either 0 or the length of `ans[x][dep + i]` based on the condition checked in the loop.**
