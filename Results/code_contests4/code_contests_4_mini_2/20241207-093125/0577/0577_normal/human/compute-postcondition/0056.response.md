Postcondition: ***`x` and `dep` are positive integers, `j` is the next index in `ans[x]`, if the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated using a bitwise OR operation with `ans[x][j]`, and `ans[x][j]` is cleared. Otherwise, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[x][j]`.***
