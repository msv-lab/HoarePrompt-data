The operation `ans[x][j].clear()` is called, which clears the contents of the list (or array) at index `[x][j]` in the `ans` structure. This means that whatever data was previously held in `ans[x][j]` is removed, leaving it empty. The values of `x`, `dep`, and `j` remain unchanged as this operation does not modify them; it only affects the contents of `ans[x][j]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `x`, `dep`, and `j` are positive integers; `ans[x][j]` is now empty after being cleared.

Output State: **`x`, `dep`, and `j` are positive integers; `ans[x][j]` is now empty after being cleared.**
