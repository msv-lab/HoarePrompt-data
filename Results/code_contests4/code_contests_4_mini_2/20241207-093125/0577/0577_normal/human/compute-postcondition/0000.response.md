According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is not equal to -1, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `x` is a positive integer (1 ≤ x ≤ n), which ensures that `x` is not -1. Therefore, the loop can execute without the need for any adjustments to the states. 

State: **`x` is a positive integer (1 ≤ x ≤ n), `dep` is a positive integer (1 ≤ dep ≤ n)**
