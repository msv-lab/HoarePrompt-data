The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `x` and `dep`. Both `x` and `dep` are positive integers. The parameter `x` represents a person in the family tree and must satisfy the constraint \( 1 \leq x \leq n \). The parameter `dep` represents the depth in the family tree and must satisfy the constraint \( 1 \leq dep \leq n \). 

The return value of the function is determined based on the relationship between `x` and `dep` within the constraints of the family tree. However, specific output conditions based on the parameters have not been provided in the prompt. Therefore, without additional information on the output, we can summarize the functionality of the function based on the parameters accepted.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `x` (a positive integer representing a person in the family tree) and `dep` (a positive integer representing the depth in the family tree), both constrained to be between 1 and n.**
