Postcondition: ***`x` and `dep` are positive integers. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[x][j]` is cleared, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated with the bitwise OR of `ans[x][j]`. Otherwise, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[x][j]`, modifying `ans[fa[x]][j]` accordingly.***
