Postcondition: ***`x` and `dep` are positive integers. If `j` is not an element of `ans[fa[x]]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now equal to `ans[x][j]`. Otherwise, if the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[x][j]` is cleared. Otherwise, `ans[x][j]` is updated to include elements from `ans[fa[x]][j]`, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` now contains the same elements as `ans[x][j]`.***
