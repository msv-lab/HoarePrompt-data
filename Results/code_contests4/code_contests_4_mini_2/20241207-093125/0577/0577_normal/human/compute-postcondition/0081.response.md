Postcondition: ***`x` and `dep` are positive integers. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[x][j]` is updated to the result of `ans[x][j] | ans[fa[x]][j]`, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared to an empty collection. Otherwise, `ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`.***
