According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is not equal to -1, the loop can proceed. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is a positive integer (1 ≤ x ≤ n), which means it is not equal to -1. Therefore, the loop can execute once more without any adjustments needed for the variable `x`. 

The variable `dep` does not affect the ability of the loop to continue since the condition solely depends on `x`. Thus, there are no changes required to ensure the loop can execute again.

State: **`x` is a positive integer (1 ≤ x ≤ n), `dep` is a positive integer (1 ≤ dep ≤ n)**
