The code assigns the value of `ans[x][j]` to `ans[fa[x]][j]`. Given the initial state conditions, we know that `x` and `fa[x]` are positive integers and that the length of `ans[x]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]]`. Since `ans[fa[x]][j]` has been cleared, it is being assigned the value from `ans[x][j]`. The output state will reflect that the value at `ans[fa[x]][j]` has been updated.

Output State: **`ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to the value of `ans[x][j]`**
