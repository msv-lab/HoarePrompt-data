Output State: **`x` is a positive integer, `dep` is a positive integer, `ans[fa[x]]` is a list with at least 1 element, `j` is the first element in `ans[fa[x]]`, `j` is an element of `ans[x]`, and the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. The operation `ans[x][j] |= ans[fa[x]][j]` modifies `ans[x][j]` to include all elements from `ans[fa[x]][j]`, resulting in a merged set of elements.**
