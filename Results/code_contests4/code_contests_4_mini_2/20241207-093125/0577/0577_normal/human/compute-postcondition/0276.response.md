Postcondition: ***`x` and `dep` are positive integers, `ans[x][j]` is updated to be the union of `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]` with `ans[fa[x]][j]` cleared if the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than that of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. Otherwise, `ans[x][j]` is updated to be equal to `ans[fa[x]][j]` with `ans[x][j]` cleared, while ensuring the lengths of `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]` remain compatible.***
