Output State: **`x` is updated to `fa[x]`, and the state of `ans[x]` or `ans[fa[x]]` may change based on the previous conditions applied, but overall, if `x` is not 0, `ans[x]` could be empty, or `ans[fa[x]]` could contain updated values from `ans[x]`. If `x` is 0, there is no change in the state of the program.**
