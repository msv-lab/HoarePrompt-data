According to the code, the loop iterates over the values in `ans[fa[x]]`. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be adjusted to point to the next index in the collection `ans[fa[x]]`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is a positive integer and represents the current index in `ans[fa[x]]`. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `j + 1`. Also, for the loop to execute again, `ans[fa[x]]` must have at least `j + 1` elements.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`x`, `dep`, and `j` are positive integers, for the loop to execute a second time `ans[fa[x]]` must have at least `j + 1` elements, and `j` is now `j + 1`**
