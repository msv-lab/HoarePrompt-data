According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements in `ans[x]`. For the loop to execute again, it needs to consider the current state of `j` and the elements in `ans[x]`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is the next element in `ans[x]` after the first element. Since `ans[x]` still has at least one element, the loop can execute again for the next element in `ans[x]`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to increment `j` to point to the next element in `ans[x]`.

State: **`x` is a positive integer, `dep` is a positive integer, `query[x]` is a list with even length, `answer` is updated based on conditions in the loop, `ans[x]` is a list that still has at least 1 element, and `j` is the next element in `ans[x]`, which is now the next element after the current j.**
