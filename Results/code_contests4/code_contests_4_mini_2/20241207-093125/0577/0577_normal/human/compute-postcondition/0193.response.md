Postcondition: ***`x` and `dep` are positive integers. If `j` is not in `ans[x]`, then `ans[x][j]` is equal to `ans[fa[x]][j]` and `j` is updated to `j + 1`. Otherwise, if the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]` is less than or equal to the length of `ans[x][j]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared, remaining an empty list, with `j` unchanged. If the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]` is greater than the length of `ans[x][j]`, then `ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`.***
