    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is -1, `dep` is a positive integer (1 ≤ dep ≤ n). The loop has finished executing, meaning all child nodes have been processed according to the family tree structure, and final values in `ans` may have been consolidated.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integer parameters, `x` (representing a person in the family tree) and `dep` (representing the depth in the family tree). It processes nodes in a family tree structure, consolidating information from child nodes into their parent nodes. The final consolidated results are stored in the `ans` data structure, but the function does not return any value. The handling of edge cases such as when `x` is not found or when `dep` exceeds the expected depth is not explicitly addressed in the function, which may lead to incomplete data in `ans` if not properly initialized or managed.
