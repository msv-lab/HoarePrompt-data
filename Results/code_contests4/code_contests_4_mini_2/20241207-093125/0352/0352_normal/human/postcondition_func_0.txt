The function accepts an integer `n` within the range of 1 to 52 and determines if `n` is a power of 3 (specifically 1, 3, 9, or 27). It prints 'YES' if `n` is a power of 3 and 'NO' otherwise. The function does not utilize the second input line containing unique integers representing cards, which is not processed or needed for the output.
