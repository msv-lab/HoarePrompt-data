The variable `sq` is assigned the value `True`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 52, `i` is 3, and `sq` is True.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 52, `i` is 3, and `sq` is True**.
