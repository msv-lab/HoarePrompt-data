The value of `i` is assigned the value of `i * 3`. Since `i` is 9, the calculation yields `i = 9 * 3`, which results in `i` being 27. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 52; `i` is 27. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 52; `i` is 27**
