The value of `sq` is assigned `True`, but the values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. The conditions mentioned indicate that the loop can execute again if `n` is greater than or equal to 9, but since no loop is executed or affected by this assignment, we only note the new value of `sq`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 52, `i` is 9, `sq` is True.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 52, `i` is 9, `sq` is True**
