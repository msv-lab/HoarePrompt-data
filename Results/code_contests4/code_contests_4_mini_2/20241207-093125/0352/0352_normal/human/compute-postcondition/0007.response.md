The value of `i` is multiplied by 3. The initial value of `i` is 1, so after execution, `i` becomes 3. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and since `i` is not equal to `n` (unless `n` is 1, which would make `i` equal to `n` after multiplication), `sq` is not set to True. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 52; `i` is 3, and `sq` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 52; `i` is 3, and `sq` remains unchanged.**
