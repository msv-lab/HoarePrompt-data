The value of `i` is assigned the result of `i * 3`. Since `i` is initially 3, after execution, `i` becomes 9. The values of `n` and `sq` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 52, `i` is 9, and `sq` is True if `i` was equal to `n` before the operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 52, `i` is 9, and `sq` is True if `i` was equal to `n` before the operation.**
