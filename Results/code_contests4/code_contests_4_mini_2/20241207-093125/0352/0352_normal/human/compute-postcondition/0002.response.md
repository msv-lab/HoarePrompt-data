The variable `sq` is assigned the value `False`. The previous values of `n` and `i` are not affected by this assignment, so their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 52; `i` is 1; `sq` is False.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 52; `i` is 1; `sq` is False**
