To analyze the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, let's first understand the behavior of the loop based on the initial state and the loop code provided.

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 52; `i` is 1; `sq` is False.

The loop continues while `i` is less than or equal to `n`, and within each iteration, `i` is multiplied by 3. If `i` equals `n` at any point during the iterations, `sq` is set to True.

Let's determine the output state after all iterations:

1. **First iteration:** 
   - Initially, `i` is 1.
   - After the operation, `i` becomes 3. The condition `i <= n` is still checked for the next iteration.

2. **Second iteration:**
   - Now `i` is 3.
   - After the operation, `i` becomes 9. Again, the loop checks `i <= n`.

3. **Third iteration:**
   - Now `i` is 9.
   - After the operation, `i` becomes 27. The condition `i <= n` is checked again.

4. **Fourth iteration:**
   - Now `i` is 27.
   - After the operation, `i` becomes 81. The loop checks `i <= n` once more.

At this point, since `n` is at most 52, the loop will terminate because `i` (which is now 81) is greater than `n`. 

Throughout the iterations:
- The variable `sq` is set to True if `i` was equal to `n` at any point in the iterations. Given the values of `i` (1, 3, 9, 27, 81), `sq` will remain False if `n` was not a power of 3 that the loop encountered.

Final output state:
- The loop terminates when `i` becomes greater than `n`.
- The final value of `i` is 81, which is greater than `n`.
- The value of `sq` remains False if `n` was not equal to any of the values of `i` in the iterations.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 52; `i` is 81, `sq` is True if `n` was a power of 3 encountered (1, 3, 9, or 27), otherwise `sq` is False.**
