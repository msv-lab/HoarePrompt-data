The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer constrained such that \(1 \leq n \leq 52\). Additionally, it accepts a second input consisting of `n` integers that represent the cards in the deck. Each integer is unique and lies within the range from 1 to `n`. The function processes this information and provides a specific output based on the cards in the deck. 

Since the exact output behavior of the function is not defined in your prompt, I will summarize the parameters and expected behavior as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 52) and a list of `n` unique integers representing cards in a deck (each in the range from 1 to n).**
