Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. The program is designed to determine if a given number `n` is a power of 3, and it prints "YES" or "NO" based on that condition. 

In contrast, the problem description specifies a task related to sorting a deck of cards numbered from 1 to `n` using a specific operation of splitting and reversing parts of the deck. The goal is to output the number of operations performed and the details of each operation to sort the deck, which the program does not address at all.

Here are the specific reasons why the program is incorrect:

1. **Irrelevant Functionality**: The program does not implement any logic to sort a deck of cards or to record operations related to that sorting. Instead, it only checks if `n` is a power of 3, which is completely unrelated to the problem requirements.

2. **Lack of Input Handling for Deck of Cards**: The program does not read or process the actual deck of cards as described in the problem. It only reads an integer `n`, which is insufficient for fulfilling the task.

3. **No Output of Operations**: The program does not produce the required output, which includes the number of operations and the specifics of how the deck was manipulated to achieve a sorted order. 

Overall, the logic in the provided program is not aligned with the sorting task required by the problem description, and it fails to implement any of the necessary operations or outputs. Therefore, it does not satisfy the requirements of the problem.
