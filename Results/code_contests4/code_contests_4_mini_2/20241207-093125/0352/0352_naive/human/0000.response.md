Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not address the problem description correctly. The problem requires a series of operations to sort a deck of cards numbered from 1 to n by splitting it into contiguous parts and reversing those parts. However, the code given merely checks whether n is a power of 3 and returns "YES" or "NO", which is irrelevant to the sorting problem described.

For example, if the input is:
```
4
3 1 2 4
```
The program will incorrectly output "NO" instead of providing the sequence of operations needed to sort the deck.

Thus, the program fails to fulfill the requirements of the problem description and does not handle the sorting operations at all.
