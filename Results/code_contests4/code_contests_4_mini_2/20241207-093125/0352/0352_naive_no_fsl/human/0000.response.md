Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. The task is to sort a deck of cards by performing a specific operation that involves splitting and reversing contiguous parts of the deck. However, the code given simply checks if `n` can be reached by multiplying `i` by `3` repeatedly, which is unrelated to the sorting of the deck. 

For example, for the input:
```
4
3 1 2 4
```
The expected output is a sequence of operations that sorts the deck, but the program will incorrectly output "NO" because 4 is not equal to any power of 3 when starting from 1. This shows the program does not handle the sorting requirement, which is central to the problem. 

Hence, the program is incorrect as it does not implement the necessary logic to sort the deck as described.
