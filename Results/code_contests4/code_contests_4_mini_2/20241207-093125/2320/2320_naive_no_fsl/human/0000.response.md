Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Specifically, it fails to consider the full implications of Vanya's movement in the n Ã— n field and how the coordinates of the apple trees should influence the starting point selection.

### Issues identified:
1. **Incorrect handling of coordinates**: The code modifies the coordinates based on the greatest common divisor (gcd) but doesn't incorporate the actual path Vanya would take based on the vector (dx, dy). The path should be tracked to ensure that Vanya does not revisit any cell until all possible cells have been considered.

2. **Fixed y-coordinate output**: The program always outputs `(ans_x, 0)`, which ignores the y-coordinate entirely. The problem states that the output should be two space-separated numbers representing the starting cell, but the y-coordinate is fixed at `0`, which is not a valid assumption for all cases.

3. **Logic for counting apple trees**: The counting mechanism does not accurately reflect the traversal of the field based on the movement vector. Vanya can visit cells multiple times or miss cells entirely depending on the vector, and the current logic does not account for this.

### Example where the program fails:
Consider the following input:
```
3 3 1 1
0 0
1 1
2 2
```
Expected output could be `(1, 1)` since starting at `(1, 1)` allows visiting all cells `(0, 0)`, `(1, 1)`, and `(2, 2)` before revisiting any cell. However, the program may not accurately count the trees visited from all possible starting points due to the aforementioned issues.

In conclusion, the program does not adhere to the problem description in all cases, thus it is deemed incorrect.
