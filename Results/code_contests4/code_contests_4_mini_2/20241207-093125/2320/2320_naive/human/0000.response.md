To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

### Problem Analysis
Vanya is walking in an `n Ã— n` field and visits cells according to a movement vector `(dx, dy)`. The goal is to find the starting cell from which Vanya can see the maximum number of apple trees, given the coordinates of the apple trees.

### Code Analysis
1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**: This function seems to implement the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which finds integers `x` and `y` such that `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`. This is used to calculate transformations related to the movement vector.

2. **Input Handling**: 
   - It reads integers `n`, `m`, `dx`, `dy` which represent the size of the grid, number of apple trees, and the movement vector, respectively.
   - It initializes a list `count` of size `n` to count the number of apple trees visible from different starting points in the x-coordinate.

3. **Counting Apples**:
   - For each apple tree's coordinates `(x, y)`, it computes a transformed `rep_x` using the formula involving the gcd (`g`) of `n` and `dy`. This transformation is meant to handle the periodic movement in the x-direction.
   - It increments the count of apples visible from that transformed `rep_x`.

4. **Finding the Best Start Point**:
   - It determines the starting point with the maximum count of visible apple trees by iterating through the `count` list.

### Potential Issues
1. **Incorrect GCD Handling**: The movement in the x-direction based on the `dy` vector should properly account for the periodic nature of the movement. However, the transformation applied to `k` might not yield the correct positions for all edge cases, especially when `dy` does not cover all cells due to its value being larger than `n`.

2. **Boundary Conditions**: 
   - If `dx` or `dy` is such that starting from certain cells leads to immediate looping without visiting all cells or reaching certain cells with apples, this could result in missing some apple trees.

3. **Output Format**: The program always outputs `(ans_x, 0)`, which means it only considers the x-coordinate for the output. The problem description does not specify that the y-coordinate should always be `0`, which may not align with the expected output.

### Example Case
Consider a case where:
```
Input:
3 3 1 1
0 0
1 1
2 2
```
- With `dx = 1` and `dy = 1`, starting from `(0, 0)` will lead to a loop visiting `(0, 0) -> (1, 1) -> (2, 2) -> (0, 0)` and seeing all trees.
- Starting from `(1, 1)` would also see all trees.
- Starting from `(2, 2)` would not see `(0, 0)` and `(1, 1)` until it loops back.

However, if the count mechanism fails to account for trees when starting from `(2, 2)`, it might incorrectly report the best starting point.

### Conclusion
Given the issues identified, particularly with the handling of the movement vector and edge cases where trees might be missed, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description in all scenarios.

Correctness: **False**.
