#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the size of the n × n field, m is a positive integer representing the number of apple trees, dx and dy are positive integers representing the movement vector, and each of the following m lines contains two integers xi and yi (0 ≤ xi, yi ≤ n - 1) representing the coordinates of the apple trees.
def func_1(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return a, 1, 0
        #The program returns the values of variables 'a', 1, and 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is a positive integer representing the size of the n × n field, m is a positive integer representing the number of apple trees, dx and dy are positive integers representing the movement vector, and each of the following m lines contains two integers xi and yi (0 ≤ xi, yi ≤ n - 1) representing the coordinates of the apple trees. The value of b is not equal to 0.
    g, tmp_x, tmp_y = func_1(b, a % b)
    x = tmp_y
    y = tmp_x - tmp_y * (a / b)
    return g, x, y
    #The program returns the values g, x, and y where g is the first value returned by func_1(b, a % b), x is assigned the value of tmp_y, and y is calculated as tmp_x - tmp_y * (a / b)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`. If `b` is 0, it returns `a`, 1, and 0. If `b` is not 0, it recursively computes a value `g` using the Euclidean algorithm while also calculating `x` and `y` based on the results of the recursive call. The function effectively computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, along with coefficients `x` and `y` that satisfy the equation `g = ax + by`, where `g` is the GCD.
