The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`. If `b` is 0, it returns `a`, 1, and 0. If `b` is not 0, it recursively computes a value `g` using the Euclidean algorithm while also calculating `x` and `y` based on the results of the recursive call. The function effectively computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, along with coefficients `x` and `y` that satisfy the equation `g = ax + by`, where `g` is the GCD.
