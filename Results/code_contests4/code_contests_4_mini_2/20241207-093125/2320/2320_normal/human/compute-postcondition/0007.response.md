The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are positive integers. 

- In Case 1, if a certain condition is met, the function returns the values of `a`, `1`, and `0`.
- In Case 2, if a different condition is met, the function returns the values of `g`, `x`, and `y`, where `g` is the first value returned by `func_1(b, a % b)`, `x` is assigned the value of `tmp_y`, and `y` is calculated as `tmp_x - tmp_y * (a / b)`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `a` and `b`, and based on specific conditions, it returns a different set of values either as `a`, `1`, `0`, or as `g`, `x`, and `y` derived from further calculations. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`. It returns `a`, `1`, and `0` in Case 1, or returns `g`, `x`, and `y` in Case 2, where `g` is derived from a recursive call, and `x` and `y` are calculated based on `tmp_y` and `tmp_x`.**
