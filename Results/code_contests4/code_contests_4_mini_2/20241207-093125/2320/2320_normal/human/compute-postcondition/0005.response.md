The value of `y` is assigned the result of the expression `tmp_x - tmp_y * (a / b)`. The variables `tmp_x` and `tmp_y` are already assigned values returned by `func_1(b, a % b)`, and `b` is not equal to 0, which allows the division `(a / b)` to be computed. The output state reflects the new value of `y`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`g`, `tmp_x`, `tmp_y` are assigned the values returned by `func_1(b, a % b)`; `b` is not equal to 0; `x` is assigned the value of `tmp_y`; `y` is assigned the value of `tmp_x - tmp_y * (a / b)`**
