Correctness: **False**

The provided program only contains a function that computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm, along with coefficients that satisfy BÃ©zout's identity. However, it does not implement any logic related to Vanya's movement through the field or the task of finding the best starting square to maximize the number of apple trees encountered.

The problem description requires the program to determine the optimal starting cell for Vanya to see as many apple trees as possible while moving in a specified direction. This involves simulating Vanya's movement, keeping track of visited cells, and counting the number of apple trees encountered at each possible starting position.

Since the provided program does not address any of these requirements, it cannot produce a valid output based on the problem description. Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the task.

In summary, the program is incomplete and does not perform the necessary computations or logic as outlined in the problem description, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
