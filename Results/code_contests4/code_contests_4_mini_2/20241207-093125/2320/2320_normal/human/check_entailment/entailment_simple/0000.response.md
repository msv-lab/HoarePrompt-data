Correctness: **False**

The provided annotated program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` appears to implement the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers and to find coefficients such that \( ax + by = \text{gcd}(a, b) \). 

However, the problem description requires a solution for Vanya's movement across a field with apple trees, specifically to determine the best starting cell to maximize the number of apple trees visited. The annotated program does not address the movement across the field, the tracking of visited cells, or the counting of apple trees at those cells. 

There are several key components missing from the program:
1. **Field Traversal Logic**: The logic to simulate Vanya's movements across the field based on the vector (dx, dy) is absent.
2. **Apple Tree Counting**: There is no mechanism to count how many apple trees are visited from each starting cell.
3. **Output of a Starting Cell**: The program does not determine and print the coordinates of the optimal starting cell as required.

In summary, the annotated program does not implement the necessary logic to solve the problem as stated, thereby making it incorrect.
