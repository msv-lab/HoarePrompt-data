The variable `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`. The initial state indicates that `p` remains unchanged, and there are conditions regarding `j`, `n`, and the elements of `a`. However, none of those conditions affect the assignment of `tmp`. Since `p[i]` is a specific value from the list `p`, we can't determine its exact value without knowing `p`. Therefore, the output state describes the change without specifying the exact numerical value of `tmp`.

Output State: **`j` is `i + 1`, `p` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `p[i]` is assigned to `tmp`**.
