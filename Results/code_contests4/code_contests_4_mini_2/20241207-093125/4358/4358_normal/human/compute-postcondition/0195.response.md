The code assigns the value of `p[j]` to `p[i]`. From the initial state, `i` is 1 and `j` is 2. The value of `p` at index 2 is assigned to `p` at index 1. The value of `n` being greater than 2 does not directly affect the assignment operation here. Since the previous values of `p[i]` and `p[j]` are not provided, we can only state the operation that has occurred.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 2, `p[i]` is assigned the value of `p[j]`**.
