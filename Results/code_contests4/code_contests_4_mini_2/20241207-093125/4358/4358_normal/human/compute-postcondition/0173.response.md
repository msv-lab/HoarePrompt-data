According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` has been increased by 1, and `n` is greater than 1. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`. 

Since `j` was incremented by 1, it must currently be less than `n` for the next iteration to proceed. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` should be greater than `j`. 

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is increased by 1, and for the loop to execute again `n` is greater than `j`**
