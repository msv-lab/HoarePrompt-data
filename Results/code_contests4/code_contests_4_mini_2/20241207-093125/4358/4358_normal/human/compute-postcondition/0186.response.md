The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is at least 1, so it becomes at least 2. The states of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `p`, and `a`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is at least 2.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is at least 2**
