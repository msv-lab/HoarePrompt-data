According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 1. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 2 because `i` needs to remain less than `n`. 

Since `n` is currently only known to be greater than 1, it is not guaranteed that the loop can execute again unless we ensure that `n` is greater than 2. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n`.

State: **`i` is 2, `j` is equal to `n`, and for the loop to execute again `n` is greater than 2**
