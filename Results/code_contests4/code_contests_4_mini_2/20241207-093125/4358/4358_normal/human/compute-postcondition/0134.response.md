The variable `j` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The initial state mentions that `j` is `n`, but `i` is adjusted to be less than `n` for the loop to execute again. Thus, the exact value of `i` isn't specified, but we know it is less than `n`. Therefore, `j` will be `i + 1`, which will be a value between 1 and `n` (not inclusive). Other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`j` is `i + 1`, `p` remains unchanged, and for the loop to execute again `i` is adjusted to be less than `n**.
