According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 2. Therefore, for the loop to proceed, `n` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300 and for the loop to execute again `n` is greater than 2**
