The operation `b.append(0)` adds the integer 0 to the list `b`. Since `b` was initially an empty list, after this operation, `b` will contain the single element 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `p` is a map object of distinct integers parsed from an input string; `A` is an `n x n` binary matrix represented as a list of strings containing '0' and '1' with `A[i][i]` = '0' for all `i` and `A[i][j]` = `A[j][i]` for all 1 ≤ `i` < `j` ≤ `n`; `__author__` is 'RASULBEK'; `i` is 0; `a` is an empty list; `j` is 0; `b` is a list containing a single element 0; `s` is a non-empty input string, and the character at index `j` of `s` is '0'.
