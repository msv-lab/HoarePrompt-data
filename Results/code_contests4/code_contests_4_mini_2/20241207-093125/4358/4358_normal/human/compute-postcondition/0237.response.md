The variable `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[2]`, and then `p[5]` is assigned to `p[2]`. After that, the value of `tmp` (which holds the original value of `p[2]`) is assigned to `p[j]` (where `j` is 5). The states of the other variables, including `i`, `n`, `p`, and `a`, remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `j` is 5, `n` is greater than 5, `p` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged, and `p[5]` is assigned the original value of `p[2]`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 5, `n` is greater than 5, `p` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged, and `p[5]` is assigned the original value of `p[2]**
