According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` has been increased by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `j` is still less than `n`. Therefore, if `j` has been increased by 1, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than the new value of `j`.

State: **variable `j` is increased by 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than the new value of j**
