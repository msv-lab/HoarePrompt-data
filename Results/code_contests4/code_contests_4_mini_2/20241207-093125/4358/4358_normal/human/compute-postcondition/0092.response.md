The value of `p[i]` is assigned the value of `p[j]`. The previous value of `j` was increased by 1, but the specific values of `p[i]` and `p[j]` are not known, so we cannot determine the exact result of this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `j` is increased by 1; `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`, and `p[i]` is now equal to `p[j]`.

Output State: **`j` is increased by 1; `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`, and `p[i]` is now equal to `p[j]`.**
