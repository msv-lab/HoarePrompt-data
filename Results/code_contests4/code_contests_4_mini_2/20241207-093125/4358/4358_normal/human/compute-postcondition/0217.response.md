`j` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Since `i` is 2, the value of `j` becomes 3. The initial state of `i` is unchanged, and `n` remains greater than 2, which allows the loop to potentially execute again. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `j` is 3, and `n` is greater than 2.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 3, and `n` is greater than 2**
