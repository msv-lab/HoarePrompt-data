The value of `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`. The variable `p` remains unchanged, and the previous values indicate that `j` is `i + 2`. However, since the code only involves the assignment of `tmp`, we do not have information about the specific values of `p` or `i`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `tmp` is assigned from `p` at index `i`. 

Output State: **`j` is `i + 2`, `p` remains unchanged, and `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]**
