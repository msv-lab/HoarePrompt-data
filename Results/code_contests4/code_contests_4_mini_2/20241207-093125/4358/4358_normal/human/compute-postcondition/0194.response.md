`tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`. The value of `i` is 1, so `tmp` takes the value from `p` at index 1. The values of `j`, `n`, and the conditions involving `p` and `a` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, the value of `p` at index 1 is assigned to `tmp`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, the value of `p` at index 1 is assigned to `tmp**.
