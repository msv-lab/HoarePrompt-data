According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i + 3`. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than `j`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than `i + 3`. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`j` is `i + 3`, `p` remains unchanged and for the loop to execute again `n` is greater than `i + 3**
