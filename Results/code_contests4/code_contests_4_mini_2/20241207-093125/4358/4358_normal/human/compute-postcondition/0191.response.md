According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `j` is 2, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1. Since `j` is currently 2, for the loop to execute at least one more time, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute the first time then `n` must be greater than 2**
