The variable `p[i]` is assigned the value of `p[j]`. Since `j` has been increased by 1 and `n` is greater than `j`, it indicates that `j` is still within the bounds of the list `p`. As a result, the value at index `j` in the list `p` is now being copied to index `i`. The previous values of `p[i]` are overwritten, but the exact previous value of `p[j]` is not specified. Therefore, the output state reflects the current state of the variables affected and the operation performed.

Output State: **`j` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than `j`, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`, and `p[i]` is now assigned the value of `p[j]`.**
