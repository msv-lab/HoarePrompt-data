The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The values of `j` and `s` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 3, `j` is equal to `n`, and `s` is updated by appending `str(p[2]) + ' '`.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `j` is equal to `n`, and `s` is updated by appending `str(p[2]) + ' '`**.
