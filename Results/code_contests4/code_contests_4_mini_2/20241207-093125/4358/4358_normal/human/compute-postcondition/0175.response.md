The code `p[i] = p[j]` assigns the value of `p[j]` to `p[i]`. Given that `i` is 0 and `j` is increased by 1, we have that `j` is now 1 (though we don't know the previous value of `j`). The assignment will copy the value from `p[1]` to `p[0]`. The state of other variables, such as `n` and `tmp`, is not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is increased by 1, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[0]`, and the value of `p[i]` (which is `p[0]`) is replaced by `p[j]` (which is `p[1]`).

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is increased by 1, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[0]`, and `p[i]` is replaced by `p[j]`.**
