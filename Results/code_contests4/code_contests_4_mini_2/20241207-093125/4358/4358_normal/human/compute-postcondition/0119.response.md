To determine the output state, we analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet.

1. Initial State: `j` is `i + 2`, `p` remains unchanged, and `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`.
2. The code `p[i] = p[j]` assigns the value located at index `j` of array `p` to index `i` of array `p`.

- Since `j` is `i + 2`, `p[j]` refers to `p[i + 2]`.
- The value of `p[i + 2]` will be assigned to `p[i]`.

The state of `p` changes, specifically at index `i`, but the other variables (`j`, `p`, and `tmp`) are not directly affected by this assignment operation. We assume `p` is an array with defined values at the indices.

Thus, we can summarize the output state as follows:

Output State: **`j` is `i + 2`; `p[i]` is assigned the value of `p[i + 2]`**.
