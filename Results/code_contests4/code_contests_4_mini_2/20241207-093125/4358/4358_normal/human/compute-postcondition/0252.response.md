According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `j` is equal to `n`. This means that `n` is at least 2. However, since `j` is equal to `n`, we cannot conclude that `i` is less than `n` because we do not know the exact value of `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, we need `n` to be greater than 2.

State: **`i` is 2, `j` is equal to `n`, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2**
