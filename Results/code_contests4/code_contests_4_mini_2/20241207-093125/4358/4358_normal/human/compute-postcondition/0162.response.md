According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop can execute if `i` is less than `n`. Right before the loop, `i` is 0, and `j` is equal to `n`. Since `j` is not directly affecting the loop condition and `p` is unchanged, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. Therefore, the condition we need to adjust is that `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **`i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time then `n` must be greater than 0**
