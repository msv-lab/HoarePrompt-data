The code appends the string representation of `p[i]` followed by a space to `s`. The value of `i` is 1, and the value of `j` is equal to `n`, but we do not have specifics on `p` or `s`. The execution of this line does not affect `i`, `j`, or `n`, but it modifies the string `s`. The output state reflects that `s` has been updated to include the string representation of `p[1]` along with a space.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is equal to `n`, `s` is updated with str(p[1]) + ' '**
