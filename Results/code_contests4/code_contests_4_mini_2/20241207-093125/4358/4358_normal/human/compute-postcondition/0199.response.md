The value of `j` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The values of `i`, `n`, and `p` remain unchanged as the code only affects `j`. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `n` is greater than 2, and the values of `p` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 3, `n` is greater than 2, and the values of `p` remain unchanged.**
