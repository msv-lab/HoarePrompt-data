The variable `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`, where `i` is 1. The value of `p` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine what `tmp` is assigned to specifically. The other variables `j` and `n` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of `tmp` without specifying its value.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 3, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[1]`**
