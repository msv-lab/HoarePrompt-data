According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. The loop can execute if `j` is less than `n`. Right before the loop, `j` is equal to `i + 1`. For the loop to execute, `i + 1` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`. 

Since `p` remains unchanged and does not affect the loop condition, no adjustments are needed for it. The variable `i` is increased by 1, which means that `j` will be equal to the updated value of `i + 1`. 

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than `i + 1`. 

State: **`j` is `i + 1`, `p` remains unchanged, for the loop to execute the first time `n` must be greater than `i + 1**
