To analyze the provided code snippet, we start with the initial state:

- `i` is 1
- `j` is 4
- `p[1]` is assigned the value of `p[4]` (this could mean that `p` is an array or list, but the specific values of `p[1]` and `p[4]` are not given).

Now, we look at the line of code:
```
p[j] = tmp
```
Here, `j` has the value 4, so this line will assign the value of `tmp` to `p[4]`. However, since we do not have information about the value of `tmp`, we cannot determine the new value of `p[4]`. Additionally, `p[1]` was previously assigned the value of `p[4]`, but without knowing what `p[4]` is or what `tmp` is, we cannot provide specific values for `p[1]` and `p[4]`. 

Since the values of `tmp` and the contents of the array `p` are unknown, the output state reflects what has changed and what remains affected:

- `i` is 1
- `j` is 4
- `p[4]` is now assigned the value of `tmp` (but `tmp` is unknown).

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 4, `p[4]` is assigned the value of `tmp` (unknown value).**
