According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `j` is equal to `n`. However, we don't know the exact value of `n`, only that `j` equals it. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be less than `n`. Given that `i` is currently 1 and `j` is equal to `n`, we can deduce that for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1. 

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is 1, `j` is equal to `n`, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1**
