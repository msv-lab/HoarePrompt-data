The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is `i + 1`. Therefore, after execution, `j` will be `i + 2`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Thus, the Output State is: `j` is `i + 2`, `p` remains unchanged, and `n` is greater than `i + 1`.

Output State: **`j` is `i + 2`, `p` remains unchanged, and `n` is greater than `i + 1**.
