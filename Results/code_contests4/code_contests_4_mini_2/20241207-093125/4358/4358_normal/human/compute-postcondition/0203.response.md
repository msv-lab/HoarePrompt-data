The variable `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[1]`. Since `p[1]` is equal to `p[3]`, `tmp` now holds the value of `p[3]`. The code `p[j] = tmp` assigns the value of `tmp` to `p[j]`, which means `p[3]` will be updated with the value of `p[3]`. Therefore, the value of `p[3]` remains unchanged, and the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 3, `tmp` is equal to `p[3]`, and `p[3]` remains unchanged.**
