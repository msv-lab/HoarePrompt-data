The value of `j` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value of 2 to 3. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300, `p` is a map object of distinct integers parsed from an input string, `A` is an `n x n` binary matrix, `__author__` is 'RASULBEK', `i` is 1, `j` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300, `p` is a map object of distinct integers parsed from an input string, `A` is an `n x n` binary matrix, `__author__` is 'RASULBEK', `i` is 1, `j` is 3**
