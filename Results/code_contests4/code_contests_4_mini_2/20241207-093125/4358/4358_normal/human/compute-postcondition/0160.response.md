After all iterations of the loop have executed, the following states can be determined:

- The outer loop controlled by `i` runs from `0` to `n-1`, thus after all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`.
- The inner loop controlled by `j` begins at `i + 1` and runs while `j < n`, meaning that after all iterations of the inner loop for all values of `i`, `j` will also be equal to `n` on the last execution.
- The value of `p` may have been modified depending on the values of `p[i]` and `p[j]` during the execution of the loops and the conditions that were met (i.e., if `p[i] > p[j]` and both `a[i][j]` and `a[j][i]` are `1`).

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `j` is `n`, `p` may be modified based on the conditions met during the loop iterations, but its final state depends on the specific input values and relationships in `a`.**
