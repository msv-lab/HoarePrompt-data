The variable `j` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The previous value of `i` is unknown, but it has been increased by 1 prior to this line of code. Therefore, if `i` was previously `x`, it is now `x + 1`, and thus `j` will be assigned the value of `x + 1 + 1`, which equals `x + 2`. The values of `p` and `n` remain unchanged. 

Since `j` is now defined based on the incremented value of `i`, we have:

Output State: **`j` is `i + 1`, `p` remains unchanged, `i` is increased by 1**
