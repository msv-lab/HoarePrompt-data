The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value from 1 to 2. The values of `j`, `n`, and `p` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `j` is equal to `n`, `n` is greater than 1, and the values of `p` remain unchanged if the conditions for swapping are not met during the iterations.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is equal to `n`, `n` is greater than 1, and the values of `p` remain unchanged if the conditions for swapping are not met during the iterations.**
