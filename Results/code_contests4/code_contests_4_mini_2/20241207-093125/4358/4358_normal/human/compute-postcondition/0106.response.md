According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been increased by 1 and is now equal to `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n`. 

To achieve this, `n` must be adjusted to be greater than `n` (which would mean increasing its value). Since `j` is `n`, we can state that `n` must be increased to ensure that `i` is less than `n`.

State: **`j` is `n`, `p` remains unchanged, `i` is increased by 1, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than `j`**
