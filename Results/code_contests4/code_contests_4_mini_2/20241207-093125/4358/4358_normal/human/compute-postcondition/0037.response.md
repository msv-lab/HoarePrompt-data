The code `b.append(0)` adds the integer `0` to the list `b`. Since `b` is currently an empty list, after executing the code, `b` will contain one element, which is `0`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300, `p` is a map object of distinct integers parsed from an input string, `A` is an `n x n` binary matrix, `__author__` is 'RASULBEK', `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `b` is [0], `a` is now a list containing the binary representation of `b`, `s` is a non-empty string (i.e., `len(s) > 0`), and the character at index `j` in `s` is '0'.
