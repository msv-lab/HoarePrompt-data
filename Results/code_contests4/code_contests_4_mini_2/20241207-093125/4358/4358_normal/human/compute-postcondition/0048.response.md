Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300, `p` is a map object of distinct integers parsed from an input string, `A` is an `n x n` binary matrix, `__author__` is 'RASULBEK', `i` is 1, `j` is 2; if `s[j]` is '1', then the list `b` has an additional element `1` appended to it. Otherwise, a value `0` has been appended to the list `b`.***
