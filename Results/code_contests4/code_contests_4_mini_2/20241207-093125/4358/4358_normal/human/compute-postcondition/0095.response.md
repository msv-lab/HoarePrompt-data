Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if statement, if `p[i]` is greater than `p[j]` and both `a[i][j]` and `a[j][i]` are equal to 1, then `j` is increased by 1, `tmp` takes the value of `p[i]`, `p[i]` is updated to `p[j]`, and `p[j]` is updated to `tmp`. If the condition is not met, there are no changes to `p` or `j`.***
