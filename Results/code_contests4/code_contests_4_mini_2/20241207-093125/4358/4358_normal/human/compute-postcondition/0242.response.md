The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and its previous value was 2. After execution, `i` becomes 3. The values of the other variables `j`, `n`, `p`, and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is equal to `n`, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 2, and `p` and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is equal to `n`, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 2, and `p` and `a` remain unchanged.**
