The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is 3, so after execution, `j` becomes 4. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `p`, and `a`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `n` is greater than 3, `p` and `a` remain as they are.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 4, `n` is greater than 3, `p` and `a` remain as they are**.
