The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown since it was described as an integer increased by 1. The values of `tmp`, `p`, and `a` are not affected by this operation, as they depend on conditions that have not been executed yet. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `j` alone.

Output State: **`j` is an integer increased by 2**
