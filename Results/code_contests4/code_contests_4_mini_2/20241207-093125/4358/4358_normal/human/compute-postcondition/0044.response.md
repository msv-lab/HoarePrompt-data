The value of `j` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value of 1 to 2. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300, `p` is a map object of distinct integers parsed from an input string, `A` is an `n x n` binary matrix, `__author__` is 'RASULBEK', `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `len(s)` is greater than 1; if `s[j]` is '1', then `b` has an element `1` appended to it. Otherwise, `b` has an additional element `0` appended to it.
