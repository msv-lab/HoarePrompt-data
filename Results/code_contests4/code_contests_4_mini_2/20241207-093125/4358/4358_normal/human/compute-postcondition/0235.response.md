The variable `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`. Since `i` is 2, `tmp` will take the value from the list or array `p` at index 2. The values of `j`, `n`, `p`, and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `j` is 5, `n` is greater than 5, `p` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged, and `tmp` is assigned the value `p[2]`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 5, `n` is greater than 5, `p` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged, and `tmp` is assigned the value `p[2]**
