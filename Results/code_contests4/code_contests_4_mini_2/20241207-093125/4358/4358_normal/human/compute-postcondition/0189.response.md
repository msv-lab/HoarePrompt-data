According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `j` is equal to `n`. Since `j` is equal to `n`, this implies that `i` is not less than `n` (1 is not less than n when n is greater than or equal to 1). Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `n` must be adjusted to be greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1**
