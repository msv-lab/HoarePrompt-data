The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` was `i + 2`. Therefore, after execution, `j` becomes `i + 3`. The states of the other variables, including `p`, remain unchanged. Hence, the Output State is: `j` is `i + 3`, `p` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is `i + 3`, `p` remains unchanged**
