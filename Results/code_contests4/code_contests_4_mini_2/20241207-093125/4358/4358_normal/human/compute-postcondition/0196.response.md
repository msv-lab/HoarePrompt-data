The code `p[j] = tmp` assigns the value of `tmp` to `p[j]`. The previous values of the affected variables are `j` which is 2, and we have no information about `tmp`. The value of `p[i]` is assigned from `p[j]`, but since we are only executing `p[j] = tmp`, the value of `p[i]` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `p[j]` is now set to `tmp`, but we don't know the value of `tmp`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 2, `p[j]` is set to `tmp`**
