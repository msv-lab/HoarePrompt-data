The code `p[i] = p[j]` assigns the value of `p[j]` to `p[i]`. The variable `i` is 0, and `j` has been increased by 1, so the index `j` is now at least 1 (since `n` is greater than 1). Therefore, we are accessing the elements of the list `p` at indices 0 and j (where j is at least 1). 

The value of `p[j]` is assigned to `p[0]`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `tmp`) are not directly affected by this assignment.

The Output State is: `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is at least 1, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[0]`, and `p[i]` (which is `p[0]`) is now equal to `p[j]`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is at least 1, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[0]`, and `p[i]` is now equal to `p[j]`.**
