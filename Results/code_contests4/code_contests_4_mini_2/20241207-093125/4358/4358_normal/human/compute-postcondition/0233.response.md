The value of `j` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 4 to 5. The values of `i`, `n`, `p`, and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `j` is 5, `n` is greater than 4, and `p` and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 5, `n` is greater than 4, and `p` and `a` remain unchanged.**
