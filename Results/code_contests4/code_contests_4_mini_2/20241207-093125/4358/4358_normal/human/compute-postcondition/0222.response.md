The code `p[i] = p[j]` assigns the value of `p[j]` to `p[i]`. Given that `i` is 2 and `j` is 3, this means `p[2]` will be set to the value of `p[3]`.

Initially, we know that the value of `p[i]` (which is `p[2]`) is greater than the value of `p[j]` (which is `p[3]`). However, after the assignment, `p[2]` will take on the value of `p[3]`, meaning `p[2]` will no longer be greater than `p[3]`. 

The other variables (`n`, `a[i][j]`, `a[j][i]`, and `tmp`) are not affected by this assignment.

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, the value of `p[2]` is now equal to the value of `p[3]`, `a[i][j]` is 1, `a[j][i]` is 1, and `tmp` retains its previous value of `p[i]`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, the value of `p[2]` is now equal to the value of `p[3]`, `a[i][j]` is 1, `a[j][i]` is 1, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]` (previously).**
