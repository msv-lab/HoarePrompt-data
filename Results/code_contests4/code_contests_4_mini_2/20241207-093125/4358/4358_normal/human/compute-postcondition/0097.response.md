According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` has been increased by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than the new value of `j`.

Since `j` has been increased by 1, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than this new value of `j`. Thus, if `j` was initially some value `k`, now it is `k + 1`, and we must adjust `n` to be greater than `k + 1`.

State: **`p` remains unchanged, `j` is increased by 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` is greater than `j`**
