The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The initial state does not provide the current value of `j`, but since it is affected, the output state reflects that `j` has been increased by 1. The values of other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is increased by 1, and if `p[i]` is greater than `p[j]`, then if `a[i][j]` and `a[j][i]` are both equal to 1, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[0]`, and `p[j]` is now equal to `p[0]`. If `p[i]` is not greater than `p[j]`, no changes are made.**
