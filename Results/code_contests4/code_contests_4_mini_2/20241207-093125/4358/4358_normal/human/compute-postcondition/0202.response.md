To determine the output state after executing the given code snippet, we need to analyze the initial state and the impact of the code.

Initial State: `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[1]`

1. The code `p[i] = p[j]` means that the value at index `j` of the list `p` will be assigned to the index `i` of the same list. Since `i` is 1 and `j` is 3, we will be copying the value of `p[3]` to `p[1]`.

2. The initial values of `i` and `j` do not change during this operation, but the value at `p[1]` will now be equal to `p[3]`.

Now, since we do not have the specific values of the list `p`, we cannot determine the exact values that are assigned. However, we know that `p[1]` will now hold the value of `p[3]`.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the assignments and the values of the other variables. 

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 3, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[1]`, and `p[1]` is now equal to `p[3]`.**
