The code assigns the value of `tmp` (which holds the value of `p[i]`) to `p[j]`. The previous values are: `j` has been increased by 1, `n` is greater than `j`, and `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`. After the execution, `p[j]` now holds the value of `p[i]`. 

The states of the other variables are not directly affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than `j`, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`, and `p[j]` is now assigned the value of `p[i]`.

Output State: **`j` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than `j`, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`, and `p[j]` is now assigned the value of `p[i]`.**
