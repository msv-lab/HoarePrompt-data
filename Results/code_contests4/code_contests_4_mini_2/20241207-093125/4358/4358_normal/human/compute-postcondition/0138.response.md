`tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`. The value of `p` remains unchanged, and since `p[i]` is accessed, it is based on the current state of `p` at index `i`. Other variables, such as `j`, `n`, and `a`, are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is `i + 1`, `p` remains unchanged, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `p[i]` is greater than `p[j]`, and both `a[i][j]` and `a[j][i]` are equal to 1; `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`.

Output State: **`j` is `i + 1`, `p` remains unchanged, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `p[i]` is greater than `p[j]`, and both `a[i][j]` and `a[j][i]` are equal to 1; `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`.**
