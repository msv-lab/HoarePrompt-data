The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is 2, so after execution, `j` becomes 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `p` is a map object of distinct integers parsed from an input string; `A` is an `n x n` binary matrix represented as a list of strings containing '0' and '1' with `A[i][i]` = '0' for all `i` and `A[i][j]` = `A[j][i]` for all 1 ≤ `i` < `j` ≤ `n`; `__author__` is 'RASULBEK'; `i` is 0; `a` is an empty list; `j` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `p` is a map object of distinct integers parsed from an input string; `A` is an `n x n` binary matrix represented as a list of strings containing '0' and '1' with `A[i][i]` = '0' for all `i` and `A[i][j]` = `A[j][i]` for all 1 ≤ `i` < `j` ≤ `n`; `__author__` is 'RASULBEK'; `i` is 0; `a` is an empty list; `j` is 3.**
