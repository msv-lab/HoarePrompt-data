The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing `i` from 1 to 2. The values of `j` and `s` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `j` is equal to `n`, `s` is updated with str(p[1]) + ' '.
Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is equal to `n`, `s` is updated with str(p[1]) + ' '**
