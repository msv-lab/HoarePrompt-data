According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the length of the string `s`. If `j` is less than the length of `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `len(s)` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute once more. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `len(s)` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `j` is 1; for the loop to execute again `len(s)` is greater than 1**
