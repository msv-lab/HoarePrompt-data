The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown. The other variables (`j`, `b`, `n`, and `a`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is equal to the length of the input string `s`, `b` contains a list of integers corresponding to the characters in `s`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300, `a` now contains `b` as an appended element, and `i` is increased by 1.
