The value of `i` is assigned the value 0. The previous value of `i` was `n`, but now it is overwritten. The values of `j` and `p` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `j` is `n`, `p` may be modified based on conditions but is unchanged in this operation.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is `n`, `p` may be modified based on conditions but is unchanged in this operation.**
