According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. Right before the loop, `j` is 3 and `n` is greater than 2. Since `j` (3) is already greater than the minimum value of `n` (2), for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be adjusted to be greater than 3. 

State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 3, for the loop to execute the first time `n` must be greater than 3**
