According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` has been increased by 1, and `n` is greater than 1. Since `j` is currently 1 (because it was increased by 1 from 0) and `n` is greater than 1, the loop can execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is increased by 1**
