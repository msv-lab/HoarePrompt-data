In the given code snippet, `p[i]` is assigned the value of `p[j]`. 

From the initial state, we have:
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 4
- `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[1]` (though we don't have the actual contents of `p` stated in the initial state).

The operation `p[i] = p[j]` means that the element at index `i` of list `p` will be set to the value of the element at index `j`. Since `i` is 1 and `j` is 4, this translates to `p[1] = p[4]`.

The output state does not need to define the contents of `p` but indicates that the value at index 1 of `p` has been updated to whatever the value at index 4 was. 

Thus, the Output State will reflect this assignment without needing to specify the exact contents of `p`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 4, `p[1]` is assigned the value of `p[4]**
