`b` is an empty list, and the code appends the integer `1` to it. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `j` is 0; `b` is now [1]; `s` is a non-empty string (length of `s` > 0) with the character at index `j` being '1'.
