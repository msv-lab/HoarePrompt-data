The code appends `0` to the list `b`. The previous state of `b` is an empty list, so after the execution, `b` will contain one element, which is `0`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `j`, `s`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `j` is 0; `b` is [0]; `s` is a non-empty string (length of `s` > 0) and the character at index `j` of `s` is not '1'.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `j` is 0; `b` is [0]; `s` is a non-empty string (length of `s` > 0) and the character at index `j` of `s` is not '1'.**
