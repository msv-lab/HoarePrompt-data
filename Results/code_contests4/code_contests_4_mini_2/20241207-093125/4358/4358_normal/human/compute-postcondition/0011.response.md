The code `b.append(1)` appends the integer `1` to the list `b`. Since `b` is initially an empty list, after this operation, `b` will contain one element: `[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `p` is a map object of distinct integers parsed from an input string; `A` is an `n x n` binary matrix represented as a list of strings containing '0' and '1' with `A[i][i]` = '0' for all `i` and `A[i][j]` = `A[j][i]` for all 1 ≤ `i` < `j` ≤ `n`; `__author__` is 'RASULBEK'; `i` is 0; `a` is an empty list; `j` is 0; `b` is now `[1]`; `s` is a non-empty input string; the character at position `j` in `s` is '1'.
