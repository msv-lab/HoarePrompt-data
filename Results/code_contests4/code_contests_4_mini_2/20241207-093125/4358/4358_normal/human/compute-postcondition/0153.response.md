In the provided scenario, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`, and then `p[i]` is updated with the value of `p[j]`. Since `j` is already increased by 1, we conclude that `p[j]` will be assigned to `p[i]`. The value of `tmp` will hold the original value of `p[i]` before this assignment occurs.

The states of the other variables are not mentioned to be affected, so we can summarize the output state based on the changes made.

Output State: **`j` is increased by 1, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`, and `p[i]` is updated to `p[j]`.**
