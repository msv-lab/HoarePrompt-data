Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300, `p` is a map object of distinct integers parsed from an input string, `A` is an `n x n` binary matrix, `__author__` is 'RASULBEK', `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and `s` is a non-empty string. If the character at index `j` in `s` is '1', then `b` is a list containing the value [1], `a` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if the character at index `j` in `s` is '0', then `b` is [0], and `a` is now a list containing the binary representation of `b`.***
