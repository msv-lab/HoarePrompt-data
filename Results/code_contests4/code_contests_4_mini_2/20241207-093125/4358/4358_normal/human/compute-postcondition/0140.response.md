In the provided code snippet, `p[j]` is assigned the value of `tmp`, which holds the value of `p[i]`. The initial state indicates that `tmp` is `p[i]`, and since `p[i]` is greater than `p[j]`, we can conclude that `p[j]` will take on the value of `p[i]`. The values of `i`, `j`, `n`, and `p` are not altered by this operation, and `p` remains unchanged except for the assignment.

The output state will reflect the assignment made to `p[j]` while noting that `tmp` was previously `p[i]`. 

Output State: **`j` is `i + 1`, `p` is unchanged except `p[j]` is now `p[i]`, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `p[i]` is greater than `p[j]`, `a[i][j]` is 1, `a[j][i]` is 1, and `tmp` holds the value of `p[i]`.**
