According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i + 2`, and `n` is greater than `i + 1`. 

Since `j` is `i + 2`, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `j`. This means that `n` needs to be adjusted to be greater than `i + 2`. Given that `n` is currently only known to be greater than `i + 1`, we can conclude that it needs to be adjusted accordingly.

State: **`j` is `i + 2`, `p` remains unchanged, and for the loop to execute again `n` is greater than `i + 2`**
