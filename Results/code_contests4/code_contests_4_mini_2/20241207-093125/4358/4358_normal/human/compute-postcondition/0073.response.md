The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is unknown, but it is being increased by 1. The values of `n` and `b` remain unchanged at this point. Therefore, the Output State reflects that `j` has been incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `j` is incremented by 1**
