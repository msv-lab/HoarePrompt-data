The operation `a.append(b)` adds the current value of `b` to the list `a`. Since `a` is initially an empty list, after this operation, `a` will contain one element, which is the value of `b`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `p` is a map object of distinct integers parsed from an input string; `A` is an `n x n` binary matrix represented as a list of strings containing '0' and '1' with `A[i][i]` = '0' for all `i` and `A[i][j]` = `A[j][i]` for all 1 ≤ `i` < `j` ≤ `n`; `__author__` is 'RASULBEK'; `i` is 0; `j` is now equal to `len(s)`; `b` contains a binary representation of the characters in the input string `s`; `a` is now a list containing the binary representation `b`.
