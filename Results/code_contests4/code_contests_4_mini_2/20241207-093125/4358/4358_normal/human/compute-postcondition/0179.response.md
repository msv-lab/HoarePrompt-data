The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `j` was already increased by 1 prior to this operation, and now it will be increased again. However, without knowing the exact previous value of `j`, we cannot definitively state its updated value. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `p`, and `a`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is increased by 1 again.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is increased by 1 again**
