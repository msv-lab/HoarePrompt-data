According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. The loop will execute if `j` is less than `n`. Right before the loop, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be greater than 1. Therefore, `n` needs to be adjusted to ensure it is greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time then `n` is greater than 1**
