`j` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Since `i` is 1, the value of `j` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1. 
Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.**
