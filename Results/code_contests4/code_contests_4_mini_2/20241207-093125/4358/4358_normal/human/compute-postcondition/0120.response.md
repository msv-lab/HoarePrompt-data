In the given initial state, `j` is defined as `i + 2`, and `p[i]` is assigned the value of `p[i + 2]`. The code snippet `p[j] = tmp` assigns the value of `tmp` to the index `j` of the list `p`. 

Since `j` is `i + 2`, this means that `p[j]` corresponds to `p[i + 2]`. The value of `tmp` will overwrite whatever value was previously at `p[i + 2]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Thus, the output state is: `j` is `i + 2`, and `p[j]` is assigned the value of `tmp`.

Output State: **`j` is `i + 2`; `p[j]` is assigned the value of `tmp`**
