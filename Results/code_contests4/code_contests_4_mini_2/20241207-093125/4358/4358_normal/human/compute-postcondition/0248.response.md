The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value from 0 to 1. The values of `j` and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `j` is equal to `n`, `s` is updated to include the string representation of `p[0]` followed by a space.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is equal to `n`, `s` is updated to include the string representation of `p[0]` followed by a space.**
