The value of `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`, where `i` is 2. After this assignment, `p[j]` is set to the value of `tmp`. Since `j` is 3, the value of `p[3]` will now be equal to `p[2]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, the value of `p[2]` is now equal to the value of `p[3]`, `a[i][j]` is 1, `a[j][i]` is 1, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`, and `p[3]` is now equal to `p[2]`.**
