Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300, `p` is a map object of distinct integers parsed from an input string, `A` is an `n x n` binary matrix, `__author__` is 'RASULBEK', `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `b` is an empty list, `a` is a list containing the binary representation `b`, and `s` is a non-empty string (i.e., `len(s) > 0`). The character at index `j` of `s` is '1'.***
