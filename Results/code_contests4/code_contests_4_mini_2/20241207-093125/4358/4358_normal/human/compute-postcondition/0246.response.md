According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is 0 and `j` is equal to `n`, which implies that `n` is not less than or equal to `i`. To ensure that the loop can execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0. Since `j` is equal to `n`, it does not need to be adjusted, but `n` must be greater than 0 to allow `i < n` to be true. 

State: **`i` is 0, `j` is equal to `n`, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0**
