The value of `p[j]` is assigned the value of `tmp`, which was previously assigned the value of `p[i]`. Since `p[i]` is equal to `p[j]`, `tmp` holds the same value as `p[j]`. After this assignment, `p[j]` will remain unchanged because it is being set to its own previous value. The states of the other variables (`n`, `p[i]`, and `tmp`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300 and `n` is greater than 1; `p[i]` is equal to `p[j]` before assignment; `p[j]` remains unchanged; `tmp` is equal to `p[i]` (or `p[j]`).

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300 and `n` is greater than 1; `p[i]` is equal to `p[j]` before assignment; `p[j]` remains unchanged; `tmp` is equal to `p[i]` (or `p[j]`)**.
