`j` is assigned the value of `i + 1`, where `i` is 0. Therefore, `j` becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. The output state reflects the updated value of `j`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `p` is a map object of distinct integers parsed from an input string; `A` is an `n x n` binary matrix represented as a list of strings containing '0' and '1'; `__author__` is 'RASULBEK'; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; `b` contains a list of integers representing the binary values of the last input string read; `a` is a list containing `n` binary lists corresponding to each input string.**
