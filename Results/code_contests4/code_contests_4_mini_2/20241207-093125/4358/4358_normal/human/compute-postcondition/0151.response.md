According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` has been increased by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than the new value of `j`. Therefore, if `j` has been increased by 1, then `n` must be greater than this new value of `j`.

State: **`j` is increased by 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` is greater than the new value of j**
