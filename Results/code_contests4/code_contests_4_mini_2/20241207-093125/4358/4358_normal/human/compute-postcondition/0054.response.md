`j` is assigned the value of 0. The value of `n` remains unchanged and is still a positive integer within the specified range (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300), and the condition for the loop to execute again is still valid as long as `n` is greater than 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300 and for the loop to execute again `n` is greater than 2; `j` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300 and for the loop to execute again `n` is greater than 2; `j` is 0**
