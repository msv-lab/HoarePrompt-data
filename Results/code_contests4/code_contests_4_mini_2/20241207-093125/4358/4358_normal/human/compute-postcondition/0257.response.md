The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters as it is defined without any input arguments. However, it operates under the constraints that `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 300, `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and n, and `A` is an `n x n` binary matrix represented as a list of strings containing '0' and '1', with the conditions that `A[i][i] = '0'` for all `i` and `A[i][j] = A[j][i]` for all `1 ≤ i < j ≤ n`.

The specifics of the output are not provided in the task, so we cannot determine what the function returns.

Functionality: **The function operates under the constraints that n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 300), p is a list of n distinct integers (each between 1 and n), and A is an n x n binary matrix following specific rules, but does not explicitly accept any parameters or define its output.**
