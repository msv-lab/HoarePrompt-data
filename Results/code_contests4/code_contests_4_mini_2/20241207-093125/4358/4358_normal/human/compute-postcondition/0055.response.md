The variable `b` is assigned an empty list. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed by this operation, and the state of other variables remains unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300 and for the loop to execute again `n` is greater than 2; `j` is 0; `b` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300 and for the loop to execute again `n` is greater than 2; `j` is 0; `b` is an empty list**
