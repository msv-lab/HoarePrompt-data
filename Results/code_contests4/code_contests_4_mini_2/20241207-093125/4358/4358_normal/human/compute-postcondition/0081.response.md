According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and its relation to `n`. The loop will execute if `j` is less than `n`. Right before the loop, `j` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300. For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be greater than 1, since `j` is currently 1. Thus, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 2 for the loop to iterate. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300, for the loop to execute the first time then `n` must be greater than 1**
