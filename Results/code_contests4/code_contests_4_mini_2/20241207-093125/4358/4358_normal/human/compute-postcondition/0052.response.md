The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is 1, so after execution, `i` becomes 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `p` is a map object of distinct integers parsed from an input string; `A` is an `n x n` binary matrix; `__author__` is 'RASULBEK'; `i` is 2; `j` is equal to the length of `s`; `b` contains a list of integers representing the binary values of each character in `s` (1 for '1' and 0 for '0'); `s` remains unchanged; `a` now contains the appended list `b`.
