The variable `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`, where `i` is 1. The previous value of `i` is 1, but the value of `p` is unknown. Therefore, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[1]`, which we cannot determine without knowing `p`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Thus, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `j` is 4, and `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[1]`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 4, and `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[1]**
