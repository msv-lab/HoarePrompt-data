The variable `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`. The value of `i` is 2, so `tmp` will hold the value of `p[2]`. The states of the other variables, including `j`, `n`, `p`, `a`, and their relationships, are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, the value of `p[i]` is greater than the value of `p[j]`, and both `a[i][j]` and `a[j][i]` are equal to 1, while `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, the value of `p[i]` is greater than the value of `p[j]`, both `a[i][j]` and `a[j][i]` are equal to 1, and `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`.**
