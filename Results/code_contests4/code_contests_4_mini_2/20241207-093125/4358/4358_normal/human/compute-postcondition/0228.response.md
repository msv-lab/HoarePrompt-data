The variable `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`. Given that `i` is 2, `tmp` will take the value of the element at index 2 of the list or array `p`. The values of `j`, `n`, `p`, and `a` remain unchanged, and since the specific value of `p` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `tmp`. Therefore, the Output State reflects that `tmp` is assigned a value based on the current value of `p`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 4, `n` is greater than 4, `p` and `a` remain as they are; `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[2]**.
