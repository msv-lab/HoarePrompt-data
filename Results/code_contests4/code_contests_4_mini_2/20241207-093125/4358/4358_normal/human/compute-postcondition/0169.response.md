The value of `p[j]` is assigned the previously stored value of `tmp`, which is equal to `p[0]`. The values of `i`, `n`, `p`, and `a` remain unchanged, while `p[j]` gets updated to a new value. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `p[i]` is greater than `p[j]`, `a[i][j]` and `a[j][i]` are equal to 1, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[0]`, and `p[j]` is now equal to `p[0]`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `p[i]` is greater than `p[j]`, `a[i][j]` and `a[j][i]` are equal to 1, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[0]`, and `p[j]` is now equal to `p[0]**
