The value of `b` is an empty list initially. The code appends the integer `1` to the list `b`. This means that after execution, `b` will contain the single value `1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300, `p` is a map object of distinct integers parsed from an input string, `A` is an `n x n` binary matrix, `__author__` is 'RASULBEK', `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and `b` is a list containing the value [1]; `a` remains unchanged, and `s` is a non-empty string where the character at index `j` is '1'.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300, `p` is a map object of distinct integers parsed from an input string, `A` is an `n x n` binary matrix, `__author__` is 'RASULBEK', `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `b` is a list containing the value [1], `a` remains unchanged, and `s` is a non-empty string where the character at index `j` is '1'.**
