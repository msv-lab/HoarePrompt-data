Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `p` is a map object of distinct integers parsed from an input string; `A` is an `n x n` binary matrix represented as a list of strings containing '0' and '1' with `A[i][i]` = '0' for all `i` and `A[i][j]` = `A[j][i]` for all 1 ≤ `i` < `j` ≤ `n`; `__author__` is 'RASULBEK'; `i` is 0; `a` is an empty list; `j` is now 1; if `s[j]` equals '1', then `b` now includes the value 1. Otherwise, `b` now has an element 0 appended.***
