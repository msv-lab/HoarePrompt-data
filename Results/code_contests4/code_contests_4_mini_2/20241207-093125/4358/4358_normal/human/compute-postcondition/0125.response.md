The variable `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`. The initial state indicates that `j` is `i + 3`, but since there is no information about the current value of `i` or `p`, we cannot determine the exact value of `tmp`. However, we know that `p` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is `i + 3`, `p` remains unchanged, and `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`.

Output State: **`j` is `i + 3`, `p` remains unchanged, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`**
