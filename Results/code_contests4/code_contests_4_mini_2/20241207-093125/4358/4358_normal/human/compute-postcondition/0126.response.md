In the given initial state, `j` is `i + 3`, and `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`. The code `p[i] = p[j]` assigns the value at index `j` of the list `p` to index `i` of the list `p`. 

To analyze the impact:
- The variable `p` is being modified at index `i`, specifically, the value of `p[j]` is being assigned to `p[i]`.
- The variable `j` is already defined as `i + 3`, meaning it is referencing a value that is three positions ahead of the index `i` in the list `p`.
- The value of `p` at index `j` is taken and placed into index `i`, which changes the value of `p[i]`.

Since we do not have the specific values of `p`, `i`, or the resulting changes, we will state that `p[i]` is updated to the value of `p[j]`, but we cannot specify what these values are.

Output State: **`j` is `i + 3`, `p` is modified such that `p[i]` is now equal to `p[j]`**.
