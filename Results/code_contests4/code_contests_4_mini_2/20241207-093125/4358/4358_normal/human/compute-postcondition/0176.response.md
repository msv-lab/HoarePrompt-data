The value of `p[j]` is assigned the value of `tmp`, which is the previous value of `p[0]`. The variables `i`, `n`, and `j` are not directly affected by this assignment, but the value at `p[j]` changes. The previous state of `tmp` is determined by `p[0]`, and since `j` has been increased by 1, `p[j]` now holds the value that was previously in `p[0]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is increased by 1, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[0]`, and `p[j]` is now equal to `p[0]`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is increased by 1, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[0]`, and `p[j]` is now equal to `p[0]**.
