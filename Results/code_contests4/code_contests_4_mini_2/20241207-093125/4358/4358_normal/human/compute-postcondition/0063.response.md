The value of `j` is incremented by 1, changing it from 0 to 1. The values of `n` and `b` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `j` is 1; and `b` is updated based on the character at index `0` of string `s`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `j` is 1; and `b` is updated based on the character at index `0` of string `s.**
