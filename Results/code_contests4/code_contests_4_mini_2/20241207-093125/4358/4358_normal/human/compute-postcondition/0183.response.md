The variable `p[j]` is assigned the value of `tmp`, which was previously assigned the value of `p[0]`. Therefore, after execution, `p[j]` will now hold the value of `p[0]`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged. The output state reflects the new value of `p[j]` and the unchanged state of the other variables. 

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is at least 1, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[0]`, and `p[j]` is now equal to `p[0]`.**
