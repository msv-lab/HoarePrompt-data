The value of `p[i]` is assigned the value of `p[j]`. Since it is given that `p[i]` is greater than `p[j]`, the previous value of `p[i]` will change to the value of `p[j]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300 and `n` is greater than 1; `p[i]` is now equal to `p[j]`; `p[j]` remains unchanged; `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]` before the assignment.
