The code assigns the value of `tmp` to `p[j]`. The variable `tmp` holds the value of `p[i]`, and since `p[i]` is being updated to `p[j]`, this means that `p[j]` now takes the value that was previously in `p[i]`. The values of `j` and `i` are not affected by this assignment.

Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is increased by 1; `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`, and `p[j]` now holds the value of `p[i]`.

Output State: **`j` is increased by 1; `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`, and `p[j]` now holds the value of `p[i]`.**
