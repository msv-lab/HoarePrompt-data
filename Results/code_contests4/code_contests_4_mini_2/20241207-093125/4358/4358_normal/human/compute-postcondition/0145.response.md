`tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`. The values of `j` and `n` do not change, and since the loop is set to execute again as long as `n` is greater than `j`, the output state reflects that `tmp` holds the value from the list `p` at index `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than `j`, and `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`.

Output State: **`j` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than `j`, and `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]**
