The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing `i` from 0 to 1. The values of `j` and `p` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 1, `j` is equal to `n`, and `p` may have been modified or remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is equal to `n`, and `p` may have been modified or remains unchanged.**
