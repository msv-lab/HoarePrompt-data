The value of `j` is incremented by 1, changing its original value from 5 to 6. The states of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `p`, and `a`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `j` is 6, `n` is greater than 5, and `p` and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 6, `n` is greater than 5, and `p` and `a` remain unchanged.**
