Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ `n` â‰¤ 300, `p` is a map object of distinct integers parsed from an input string, `A` is an `n x n` binary matrix, `__author__` is 'RASULBEK', `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `b` is an empty list, `a` is now a list containing the binary representation `b`, `s` is a non-empty string (i.e., `len(s) > 0`), and the character at index `j` in `s` is '0' (i.e., `s[j] != '1')***
