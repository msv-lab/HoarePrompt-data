#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct integers `p` followed by an `n x n` binary matrix `A`. It modifies the list `p` based on comparisons defined by the binary matrix, attempting to swap values in the list if certain conditions are met. Finally, it prints the modified list `p` as a space-separated string. It does not accept parameters directly nor does it handle any edge cases related to invalid inputs or the format of the input, such as ensuring that the values in `p` are indeed distinct and within the expected range.
