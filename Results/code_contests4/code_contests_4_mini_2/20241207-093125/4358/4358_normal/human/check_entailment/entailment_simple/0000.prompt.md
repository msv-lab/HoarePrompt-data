You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: User ainta has a permutation p1, p2, ..., pn. As the New Year is coming, he wants to make his permutation as pretty as possible.

Permutation a1, a2, ..., an is prettier than permutation b1, b2, ..., bn, if and only if there exists an integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ n) where a1 = b1, a2 = b2, ..., ak - 1 = bk - 1 and ak < bk all holds.

As known, permutation p is so sensitive that it could be only modified by swapping two distinct elements. But swapping two elements is harder than you think. Given an n × n binary matrix A, user ainta can swap the values of pi and pj (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n, i ≠ j) if and only if Ai, j = 1.

Given the permutation p and the matrix A, user ainta wants to know the prettiest permutation that he can obtain.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the size of the permutation p.

The second line contains n space-separated integers p1, p2, ..., pn — the permutation p that user ainta has. Each integer between 1 and n occurs exactly once in the given permutation.

Next n lines describe the matrix A. The i-th line contains n characters '0' or '1' and describes the i-th row of A. The j-th character of the i-th line Ai, j is the element on the intersection of the i-th row and the j-th column of A. It is guaranteed that, for all integers i, j where 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n, Ai, j = Aj, i holds. Also, for all integers i where 1 ≤ i ≤ n, Ai, i = 0 holds.

Output

In the first and only line, print n space-separated integers, describing the prettiest permutation that can be obtained.

0000000
0000010

Note

In the first sample, the swap needed to obtain the prettiest permutation is: (p1, p7).

In the second sample, the swaps needed to obtain the prettiest permutation is (p1, p3), (p4, p5), (p3, p4). 

<image>

A permutation p is a sequence of integers p1, p2, ..., pn, consisting of n distinct positive integers, each of them doesn't exceed n. The i-th element of the permutation p is denoted as pi. The size of the permutation p is denoted as n.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
