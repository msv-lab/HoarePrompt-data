Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description due to several key issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` which is not defined in Python 3. Instead, it should use `input()`. This inconsistency implies that the code might not run correctly in the intended environment.

2. **Logic for Swapping**: The program attempts to swap elements in the permutation `p` based on a condition involving the binary matrix `A`. However, the logic only considers direct comparisons between pairs of elements. The problem allows for swaps based on the paths defined by the binary matrix `A`. This means that even if two elements are not directly swappable (i.e., `A[i][j]` is not `1`), they might still be swappable through a series of other swaps. The current implementation does not account for this possibility, leading to an incomplete solution.

3. **Repeated Swapping Logic**: The portion of the code responsible for swapping elements is executed twice in succession with the same logic, which is unnecessary. This redundancy does not contribute to the correctness and makes the code less efficient.

4. **Final Output Format**: The final output is constructed as a string with spaces, but it is not guaranteed to match the expected output format described in the problem. The problem requires a space-separated list of integers, whereas the string manipulation does not ensure this properly.

These issues indicate that the program does not correctly or fully implement the requirements set forth by the problem description, particularly regarding the swappability of elements based on the binary matrix. The failure to account for indirect swaps is a critical flaw that leads to incorrect results.
