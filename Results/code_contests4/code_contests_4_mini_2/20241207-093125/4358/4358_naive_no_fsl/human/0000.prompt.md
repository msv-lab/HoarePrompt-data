You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: User ainta has a permutation p1, p2, ..., pn. As the New Year is coming, he wants to make his permutation as pretty as possible.

Permutation a1, a2, ..., an is prettier than permutation b1, b2, ..., bn, if and only if there exists an integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ n) where a1 = b1, a2 = b2, ..., ak - 1 = bk - 1 and ak < bk all holds.

As known, permutation p is so sensitive that it could be only modified by swapping two distinct elements. But swapping two elements is harder than you think. Given an n × n binary matrix A, user ainta can swap the values of pi and pj (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n, i ≠ j) if and only if Ai, j = 1.

Given the permutation p and the matrix A, user ainta wants to know the prettiest permutation that he can obtain.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the size of the permutation p.

The second line contains n space-separated integers p1, p2, ..., pn — the permutation p that user ainta has. Each integer between 1 and n occurs exactly once in the given permutation.

Next n lines describe the matrix A. The i-th line contains n characters '0' or '1' and describes the i-th row of A. The j-th character of the i-th line Ai, j is the element on the intersection of the i-th row and the j-th column of A. It is guaranteed that, for all integers i, j where 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n, Ai, j = Aj, i holds. Also, for all integers i where 1 ≤ i ≤ n, Ai, i = 0 holds.

Output

In the first and only line, print n space-separated integers, describing the prettiest permutation that can be obtained.

Examples

Input

5 2 4 3 6 7 1
0001001
0000000
0000010
1000001
0000000
0010000
1001000


Output

1 2 4 3 6 7 5


Input

00100
00011
10010
01101

Output

1 2 3 4 5

Note

In the first sample, the swap needed to obtain the prettiest permutation is: (p1, p7).

In the second sample, the swaps needed to obtain the prettiest permutation is (p1, p3), (p4, p5), (p3, p4). 

<image>

A permutation p is a sequence of integers p1, p2, ..., pn, consisting of n distinct positive integers, each of them doesn't exceed n. The i-th element of the permutation p is denoted as pi. The size of the permutation p is denoted as n.
Program:
```
__author__ = 'RASULBEK'
n = input()
p = map(int, raw_input().split())
i = 0
a = []
while i < n:
    j = 0
    b = []
    s = raw_input()
    while j < len(s):
        if s[j] == '1':
            b.append(1)
        else:
            b.append(0)
        j += 1
    a.append(b)
    i += 1
i = 0
while i < n:
    j = i + 1
    while j < n:
        if p[i] > p[j]:
            if a[i][j] == 1 and a[j][i] == 1:
                tmp = p[i]
                p[i] = p[j]
                p[j] = tmp
        j += 1
    i += 1
i = 0
while i < n:
    j = i + 1
    while j < n:
        if p[i] > p[j]:
            if a[i][j] == 1 and a[j][i] == 1:
                tmp = p[i]
                p[i] = p[j]
                p[j] = tmp
        j += 1
    i += 1
i = 0
s = ''
while i < n:
    s += str(p[i]) + ' '
    i += 1
print(s)
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
