Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here are the main issues:

1. **Harmonization Logic**: The program does not ensure that the union of sets of rooks of two different colors is connected only if the two colors harmonize with each other. While it builds connections based on the edges input, it doesn't enforce the required connectivity condition based on color harmonization.

2. **Rook Placement**: The placement of rooks is not guaranteed to be valid according to the requirements. The program simply appends coordinates based on the edges without ensuring that all rooks of a color are connected. The output suggests that rooks of a color can be placed arbitrarily without ensuring they form a connected component.

3. **Output Format**: The output structure in terms of rook coordinates does not follow the constraints of the problem. Specifically, it does not guarantee that rooks of the same color are placed at coordinates that are connected.

4. **Maximum Rooks Constraint**: Although the problem guarantees that a solution exists, the program does not have a mechanism to ensure that the total number of rooks does not exceed 5000. The way rooks are added based on input edges could lead to exceeding this limit.

In summary, the program fails to satisfy the conditions of the problem description, particularly in ensuring connectedness based on the harmonization pairs and managing the rook placement correctly. This leads to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
