The value of `len(ans[i])` is calculated, where `ans` is a list and `i` is equal to `n`. Since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `ans[i]` refers to an element in the list `ans` at the index `n`. The length of this element is determined, but the specific value of `len(ans[i])` is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of other variables along with the information that the length of `ans[i]` is printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is `n`, `ans` is a list with at least 102 elements, `j` is the last index of `ans[i]`; the length of `ans[i]` is printed.**
