The code appends the list `[i + n + 1, j[0]]` to `ans[j[0] - 1]`. Here, `j[0]` is an index, and `ans` is a list where we are adding a new element at the index corresponding to `j[0] - 1`. The value of `i` is incremented by `1` in the loop, but this particular line does not affect `i` directly. The initial values do not change for `n`, `j`, or `ans` but `ans[j[0] - 1]` will now contain the new appended element.

Thus, the output state reflects that `ans[j[0] - 1]` has been modified to include the new element `[i + n + 1, j[0]]`.

Output State: **`ans[j[0] - 1]` has the element `[i + n + 1, j[0]]` appended to it.**
