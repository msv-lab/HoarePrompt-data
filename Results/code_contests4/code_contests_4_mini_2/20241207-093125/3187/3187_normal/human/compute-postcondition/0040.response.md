According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ans[i]`. For the loop to execute, `ans[i]` must not be empty; it should contain at least one element. Since `i` is equal to `n` and `n` is within the range of 1 to 100, `i` is valid as an index of `ans` (given that `ans` has at least 102 elements). 

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to confirm that `ans[i]` contains at least one element. Since `j` is initialized to iterate over `ans[i]`, it will start from the first element in that list.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is `n`, `ans` is a list with at least 102 elements, for the loop to execute the first time `ans[i]` must contain at least 1 element, and `j` is the first element in `ans[i]`**.
