The code appends the list `[i, i]` to the `ans` list at index `i - 1`. Given that `i` is 1, the value of `i - 1` is 0. This means that `[1, 1]` will be added to the first element of `ans`. The initial state of `ans` is unknown, but it can accommodate this operation since the task assumes a valid setup.

Therefore, assuming `ans` is a list of lists, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is 1, and the first element of `ans` now contains the list `[1, 1]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is 1, and the first element of `ans` contains the list `[1, 1]**
