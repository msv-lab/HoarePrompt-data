According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the list `ans`. Since `i` is `n + 1` and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` will be at least 2 and at most 101. If `ans` does not have an index `i`, the loop will result in an IndexError. Therefore, for the loop to execute without errors, `ans` must have at least `i + 1` elements (i.e., it must be at least 102 elements long).

At the start of the loop, `j` will be used to iterate over `ans[i]`. Therefore, we need to ensure the following states:

- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100.
- `i` is `n + 1`, which is guaranteed by the initial state.
- `ans` must have at least `i + 1` elements (i.e., `ans` must be a list with at least 102 elements).
- `j` will start at the first index of `ans[i]`, which is 0.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is `n + 1`, `ans` is a list with at least 102 elements, `j` is 0**.
