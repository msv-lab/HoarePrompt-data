The code attempts to print the value of `j`, which is currently set to 0. The `*` operator is used for unpacking, but since `j` is an integer and not an iterable, it will result in a TypeError. However, since we are focused on the output state and not on errors, the value of `j` is simply printed.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is `n`, `ans` is a list with at least 102 elements, `j` is 0, and the value of `j` is printed as 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is `n`, `ans` is a list with at least 102 elements, `j` is 0, and the value of `j` is printed as 0.**
