To analyze the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we need to consider how the loop modifies the state of the variable `ans`. 

The loop iterates over the `edges`, which means for each edge (represented as a tuple) in `edges`, it appends new elements to the lists in `ans` corresponding to the nodes represented by that edge. The code appends a specific element that includes the current index of the loop (adjusted by `n + 1`) and the node value from the edge.

1. After all iterations, for every edge `(j[0], j[1])` in `edges`, `ans[j[0] - 1]` and `ans[j[1] - 1]` will have had new elements appended to them.
2. The number of elements appended to each `ans` list corresponds to the number of edges connected to each node represented in `edges`.

Therefore, after the loop has executed for all edges:

- `n` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `ans` is a list containing `n` elements.
- Each `ans[k]` for \(k = 0\) to \(n-1\) will contain the initial element `[[k+1, k+1]]` along with additional elements that were appended during the loop execution, representing the edges connected to the node \(k + 1\).

Thus, the final output state after all iterations would be:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `ans` is a list containing `n` elements, where each `ans[i-1]` contains the original `[[i, i]]` plus all appended elements from the edges related to node `i`.**
