The value `ans[j[1] - 1]` is updated by appending the list `[i + n + 1, j[1]]` to it. The previous value of `i` is `i + 1`, and `j` has been updated to the next tuple in `edges`. Therefore, the output state reflects the changes made to `ans` and the current values of `i` and `j`.

Output State: **`ans[j[1] - 1]` has the element `[i + n + 1, j[1]]` appended to it; `i` is `i + 1`; `j` is the next tuple in `edges`.**
