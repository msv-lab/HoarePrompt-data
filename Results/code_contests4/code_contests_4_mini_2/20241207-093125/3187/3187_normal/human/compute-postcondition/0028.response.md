The loop iterates over the elements of `ans[i]`, where `i` starts at 0. After all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` will equal the number of elements in `ans` that have been processed. Given that `n` is at least 1 and at most 100, and `ans` contains `n` elements, `i` will increment until it reaches the length of `ans`, which is `n`. The loop will print the elements of each sub-iterable in `ans[i]`. Therefore, after all iterations:

- If `ans` is a list of iterables, `j` would have been defined for each element in `ans[i]` for the corresponding `i`.
- The final value of `i` will be the length of `ans`, which is `n`.
- The variable `ans` remains unchanged, containing `n` elements.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is equal to `n`, `ans` is a list containing `n` elements, and all elements of `ans[0]` to `ans[n-1]` have been printed.**
