According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute `n` times, starting from `i = 0` and going up to `i = n - 1`. Given that `n` is guaranteed to be between 1 and 100, the loop is set to execute at least once. 

At the start of the loop, the variable `i` should be initialized to 0, which is the first value it will take during the first execution of the loop. The list `ans` will contain `n` elements, which ensures that it is properly initialized for the loop's execution.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is 0, `ans` is a list containing `n` elements**
