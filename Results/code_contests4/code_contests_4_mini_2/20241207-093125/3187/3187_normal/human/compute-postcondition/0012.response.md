The code appends the value `[i + n + 1, j[1]]` to the list located at the index `j[1] - 1` in `ans`. The state of the variable `ans` is affected by this operation, while `n` retains its integer condition, and `j` is a list with at least two elements since `j[0]` and `j[1]` are being accessed. The output state must reflect this change.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `ans` is a list containing `n` elements; `ans[j[1] - 1]` has the element `[i + n + 1, j[1]]` appended to it.**
