Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `m`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 100` and `0 ≤ m ≤ min(1000, (n(n-1))/(2))`. It processes `m` pairs of colors and constructs a list of lists called `ans`, where each element `ans[i]` contains pairs representing the nodes associated with color `i`. The function then prints the number of entries in each `ans[i]` followed by the entries themselves. The output may vary based on the input pairs provided, but the function does not return any value; it only prints the results. **
