According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n` (since the range is from 1 to `n + 1`, `i` will take values from 1 to `n`). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` will increment by 1, making `i` equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 2, allowing `i` to be less than or equal to `n`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**
