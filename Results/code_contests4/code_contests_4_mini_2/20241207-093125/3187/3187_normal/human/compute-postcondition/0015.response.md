The code appends the list `[i + n + 1, j[1]]` to the element at `ans[j[1] - 1]`. The previous state indicates that `ans[j[0] - 1]` already has the element `[i + n + 1, j[0]]` appended to it, but this operation does not affect that particular state. The values of `i`, `n`, and `j` are not specified, so we can't determine their specific contributions to the values being appended. However, the operation impacts only the list at `ans[j[1] - 1]`.

Output State: **`ans[j[1] - 1]` now has the element `[i + n + 1, j[1]]` appended to it.**
