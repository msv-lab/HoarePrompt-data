The line of code defines a lambda function `rints` which reads a line of input, splits it into components, and converts each component to an integer. This function itself does not change the values of `n` and `m`, but it prepares to read a list of integers from the input, which may be used later in the program. Since it does not execute any input reading or processing in the current step, the output state remains as defined by the initial conditions.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ min(1000, (n(n-1))/(2)), and `rints` is a function that reads and converts input to a list of integers.**
