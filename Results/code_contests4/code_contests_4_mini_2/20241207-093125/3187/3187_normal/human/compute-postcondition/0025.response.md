The code `print(*j)` unpacks the iterable `j` and prints its elements. Since `j` is the first element of `ans[0]`, which is an iterable with at least one element, the output will be the unpacked elements of `j`.

No variables are modified by this operation, so the values of `n`, `i`, and `ans[0]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is 0, `ans[0]` is an iterable with at least 1 element, and the elements of `j` are printed.**
