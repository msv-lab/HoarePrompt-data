The code appends the value `[i + n + 1, j[0]]` to the list located at `ans[j[0] - 1]`. The previous state indicates that `ans[j[1] - 1]` already has an element appended to it, and for the loop to execute again, `edges` must have at least `i + 2` elements, indicating that `i` is incremented by 1, and `j` is updated to the next tuple in `edges`. 

The output state reflects the changes made by the append operation and the updated state of `i` and `j`:

Output State: **`ans[j[0] - 1]` has the element `[i + n + 1, j[0]]` appended to it; `i` is `i + 1`; `j` is the next tuple in `edges`.**
