According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop iterates from 1 to `n`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1, making it 3. 

For the loop to execute a third time, `n` must be at least 3 (since the loop runs while `i` is less than or equal to `n`). Given that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, if `i` is 2, then for the next iteration, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be greater than or equal to 3**
