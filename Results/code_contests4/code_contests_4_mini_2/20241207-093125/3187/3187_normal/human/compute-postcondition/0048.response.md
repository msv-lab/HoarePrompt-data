The function `func` does not take any parameters explicitly, but it operates on the constraints provided. It works with an integer `n` that must satisfy the condition 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and an integer `m` that must satisfy 0 ≤ m ≤ min(1000, (n(n-1))/(2)). The function processes `m` pairs of colors, where each pair consists of two integers that represent colors numbered from 1 to n. The output and behavior of the function based on these inputs are not provided in your description. Therefore, without further details on what the function returns or computes, we cannot specify the functionality completely.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `n` and `m` based on specified constraints and processes `m` pairs of colors, but the exact output and behavior are not defined.**
