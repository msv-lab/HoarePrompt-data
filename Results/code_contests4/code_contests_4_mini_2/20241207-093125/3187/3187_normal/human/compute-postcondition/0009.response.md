The loop appends the list `[i, i]` to the `ans` list for each integer `i` from 1 to `n`. After all iterations, `ans` will contain `n` elements, each being a list with a single sublist `[i, i]` where `i` ranges from 1 to `n`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `ans` is a list containing `n` elements, where each element `ans[i-1]` contains the list `[[i, i]]` for `i` from 1 to `n`.**
