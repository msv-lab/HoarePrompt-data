According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute for `i` taking values from 1 to `n` inclusive. Since `n` is guaranteed to be at least 1 (1 ≤ `n`), the loop can execute at least once. 

At the start of the loop:
- The variable `i` needs to be initialized to 1 for the first iteration.
- The other variables `edges`, `ans`, and `m` do not impact the loop's ability to execute but are relevant to the context in which the loop operates.

Thus, for the loop to execute the first time, we need `i` to be 1, and since `n` is guaranteed to be at least 1, the loop will execute.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time**
