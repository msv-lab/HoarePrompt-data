The code snippet prints the length of the `i`-th element of the list `ans`. The variable `i` is initialized to 0. Since `ans` contains `n` elements, the `i`-th element is `ans[0]`. The output will be the length of this first element. The values of `n` and `ans` are not directly changed by this operation, but the output of the print statement is crucial.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `i` is 0; `ans` is a list containing `n` elements; output is the length of `ans[0]`.**
