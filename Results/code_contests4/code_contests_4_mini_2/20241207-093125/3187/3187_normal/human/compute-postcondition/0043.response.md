The code is executing the print function with unpacking operator `*` applied to `j`. The variable `j` is assigned the value of the first element in the list `ans` at index `n + 1`. Since `i` is `n + 1`, we can say that `j` is `ans[i]`. The output will be the elements of `ans[i]` printed out. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `i` is `n + 1`; `ans` is a list with at least 102 elements; `j` is the first element in `ans[n + 1]`, which will be printed.**
