According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the list `ans`. The loop will execute as long as `j` can take the next value from `ans[i]`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is `n + 1`, and `ans` is a list with at least 102 elements, meaning `ans[i]` is valid. Since `i` is `n + 1`, it must be noted that `ans[n + 1]` is being accessed.

For the loop to execute one more time, `ans[n + 1]` must contain at least one more element beyond what has already been iterated over. Since `j` is the first element in `ans[n + 1]`, we can conclude that `j` needs to be updated to the next element in `ans[n + 1]`.

If `j` is currently the first element in `ans[n + 1]`, for the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be updated to the second element in `ans[n + 1]`. Therefore, `i` remains as `n + 1` and we need to specify that `j` is now the second element in `ans[n + 1]`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `i` is `n + 1`; `ans` is a list with at least 102 elements; `j` is the second element in `ans[n + 1]`, which will be printed.**
