The code attempts to print the value of `j`, but `j` is an integer with a value of 1. The `print` function will unpack and print `j`, which means it will output the value directly. The other variables (`n`, `i`, and `ans`) are not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `i` is `n + 1`; `ans` is a list with at least 102 elements; `j` is 1 and the value of `j` is printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `i` is `n + 1`; `ans` is a list with at least 102 elements; `j` is 1 and the value of `j` is printed.**
