Postcondition: ***`f` is a closed file object representing 'input.txt'; `d`, `n`, `m` are assigned values from `input[0]`, `input[1]`, `input[2]`; `S` is a set containing sorted values from 0 and `input[3:3 + n - 1]`; `K` contains at least 2 values; if either `(k + 1) % 8` is in `S` or `(k - 1) % 8` is in `S`, then `sum` is updated to `sum + 1`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
