Since the `while` loop is structured as `while True`, it will always execute at least once regardless of the program state right before the loop. Therefore, no adjustments to the program state are needed for the loop to execute the first iteration.

State: **`f` is a closed file object representing 'input.txt'; `d`, `n`, `m` are assigned values from `input[0]`, `input[1]`, `input[2]`; `S` is a set containing sorted values from 0 and `input[3:3 + n - 1]`; `K` contains at least 2 values for the loop to execute a second time; `sum` is updated to `sum + i`, where `i` is 1, and `k` is the second value in `K`**
