Postcondition: ***`f` is a closed file object representing 'input.txt'; `d`, `n`, `m` are assigned values from `input[0]`, `input[1]`, `input[2]`; `S` is a set containing sorted values from 0 and `input[3:3 + n - 1]`; `K` contains at least 1 value for the loop to execute; `sum` is initialized to 0; `i` is 2. If `(k + i) % 8` or `(k - i) % 8` is in `S`, we break out of the most internal loop.***
