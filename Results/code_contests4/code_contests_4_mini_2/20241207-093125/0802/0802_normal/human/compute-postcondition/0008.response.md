Since the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute at least once regardless of the state variables. There is no need to adjust any states for the loop to execute.

State: **`f` is a file object representing the opened file 'input.txt' is now closed; `d`, `n`, `m` are assigned values from `input[0]`, `input[1]`, `input[2]`; `S` is a set containing sorted values from 0 and `input[3:3 + n - 1]`; `K` must contain at least 1 value for the loop to execute; `sum` is initialized to 0; `i` is 1.**
