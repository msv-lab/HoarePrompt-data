According to the code, since the loop is a `while True`, it will always execute again regardless of the state of the variables. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any variables, and the program state can remain the same as at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`f` is a closed file object representing 'input.txt'; `d`, `n`, `m` are assigned values from `input[0]`, `input[1]`, `input[2]`; `S` is a set containing sorted values from 0 and `input[3:3 + n - 1]`; `K` contains at least 1 value for the loop to execute; `sum` is initialized to 0; `i` is 3.**
