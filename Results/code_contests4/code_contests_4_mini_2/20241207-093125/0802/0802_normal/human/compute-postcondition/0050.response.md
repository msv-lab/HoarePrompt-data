The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The states of the other variables (`sum` and `k`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `sum` is increased by 1, `i` is 3, and `k` is an integer.

Output State: **`sum` is increased by 1, `i` is 3, and `k` is an integer**.
