The value of `sum` is increased by `i`. The previous value of `sum` is unchanged, but now it will include the value of `i`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `sum` has been updated with the addition of `i`, while `k` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is unchanged; `sum` is increased by `i`.**
