According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the iterable `K`. If `k` has not yet reached the end of `K`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is unchanged, meaning it is still pointing to the current element in `K`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must advance to the next item in `K`.

Assuming `K` has at least one more element after the current `k`, the next value of `k` would be the next item in `K`.

State: **`sum` is increased by `i`, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be the next element in K**
