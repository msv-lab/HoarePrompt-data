The variable `i` is assigned the value of 1. The previous state of the variables indicates that `sum` has been increased by `i`, but we do not have the exact value of `sum` prior to this assignment. Other variables, including `k`, are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `i`.

Output State: **`sum` is increased by `i`, `i` is 1**
