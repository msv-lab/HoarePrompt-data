The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `i` is 1, so after execution, `i` becomes 2. The values of `sum` and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `sum` is increased by 1, `i` is 2, and `k` is an integer.

Output State: **`sum` is increased by 1, `i` is 2, and `k` is an integer**
