According to the code, the loop is a `while True`, which means it will continue to execute indefinitely unless a break statement is encountered. Since `while True` does not have any exit condition, the loop can always execute one more time regardless of the state variables. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states.

State: **`sum` is increased by 1, `i` is 2, and `k` is an integer**
