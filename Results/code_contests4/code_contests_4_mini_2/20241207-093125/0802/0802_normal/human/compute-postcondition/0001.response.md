The variable `input` is assigned the result of mapping a lambda function over the lines read from the file 'input.txt'. Each line is stripped of whitespace and split by newline characters, and then each segment is converted to an integer. The values of `d`, `n`, `m`, `d2`, ..., `dn`, and `k1`, ..., `km` remain unchanged until further processing of the file occurs. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the new mapping.

Output State: **`f` is a file object representing the opened file 'input.txt' for reading; `d`, `n`, `m`, `d2`, ..., `dn`, and `k1`, ..., `km` remain unchanged; `input` is a mapped object of integers from the lines in 'input.txt'**.
