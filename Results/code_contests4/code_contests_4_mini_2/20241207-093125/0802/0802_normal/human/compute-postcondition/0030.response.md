According to the code, since it is a `while True` loop, the loop will always execute again regardless of the state of the variables. There are no conditions that need to be met for the loop to continue; it will run indefinitely. Therefore, I do not need to make any modifications to the program state.

State: **variable `i` is increased by 1**
