The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly since the input is provided in a specific format (via standard input). The function processes a series of inputs where `d` is a positive integer representing the total length of the loop line, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of stores (including the main store), `m` is a positive integer representing the number of orders, followed by a series of integers representing the locations of stores (except the main store) and the delivery destination locations. The function continues to process these inputs until a value of `d` equal to 0 is encountered.

The output of the function is not explicitly described, but it is implied that the function will handle the input data and likely produce results based on the locations of stores and delivery destinations. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a series of inputs describing the length of a loop line, the number of stores, the number of orders, and their respective locations, processing this data until a terminating condition is met (d = 0).**
