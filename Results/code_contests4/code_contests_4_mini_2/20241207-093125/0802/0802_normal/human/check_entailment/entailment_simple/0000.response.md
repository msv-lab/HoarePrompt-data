Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Incorrect Modulus Operation**: The program uses the modulus operation `% 8` to check the distances, which does not align with the problem's description that states the total length of the loop line is `d`. Instead, it should be checking distances modulo `d`. This is a significant error because the delivery locations can range from `0` to `d-1`, and the code should reflect this range.

2. **Inefficient Distance Calculation**: The program uses a loop with incrementing `i` to find the nearest store. While this approach may work for small values, it is inefficient and does not guarantee performance within the problem constraints, especially when `d` can be as large as `10^9`. A more efficient method would involve calculating distances directly rather than incrementing and checking one by one.

3. **Missing Output for Multiple Datasets**: The program does not handle multiple datasets correctly. The problem description states that the input can consist of multiple datasets until `d` equals `0`, but the program only processes one dataset and doesn't loop through the input.

4. **Summation Logic**: The way the total distance is computed (`sum += i`) does not consider the actual distance from the store to the delivery point. Instead, it accumulates the number of increments `i`, which does not represent the distances correctly.

In summary, the program does not adhere to the specifications laid out in the problem description, particularly in terms of distance calculations, handling of input, and efficiency. Therefore, it is incorrect.
