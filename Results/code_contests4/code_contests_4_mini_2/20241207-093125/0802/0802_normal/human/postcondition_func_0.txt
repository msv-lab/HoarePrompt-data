The function reads input data from a file, which includes the total length of a loop line, the number of stores, and the number of orders along with their respective locations. It calculates the total of the smallest integers `i` for each delivery location `k` such that either `(k + i) % 8` or `(k - i) % 8` matches a store location. The result is then written to an output file. The function operates until it encounters a termination condition where `d` (the loop line length) is 0. However, it does not handle cases where the input is not formatted as expected or does not meet the specified input conditions.
