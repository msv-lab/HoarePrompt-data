#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a positive integer representing the total length of the loop line, n is a positive integer representing the number of stores (including the main store), m is a positive integer representing the number of orders, d2, ..., dn are integers representing the locations of stores (except the main store) with values between 1 and d-1, and k1, ..., km are integers representing the delivery destination locations with values between 0 and d-1. The input ends when d is 0.
def func():
    f = open('input.txt', 'r')
    input = map(lambda x: int(x), f.read().strip().split('\n'))
    f.close()
    d, n, m = input[0], input[1], input[2]
    S, K = set(sorted([0] + input[3:3 + n - 1])), input[3 + n - 1:]
    sum = 0
    for k in K:
        i = 1
        
        while True:
            if (k + i) % 8 in S or (k - i) % 8 in S:
                break
            i += 1
        
        sum += i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `f` is a closed file object representing 'input.txt'; `d`, `n`, `m` are assigned values from `input[0]`, `input[1]`, `input[2]`; `S` is a set containing sorted values from 0 and `input[3:3 + n - 1]`; `K` is a list containing values from `input[3 + n - 1:]`; `sum` is equal to the total of all `i` values found for each `k` in `K`, where each `i` is the smallest integer such that either `(k + i) % 8` or `(k - i) % 8` is in `S`.
    f = open('output.txt', 'w')
    f.write(str(sum))
    f.close()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input data from a file, which includes the total length of a loop line, the number of stores, and the number of orders along with their respective locations. It calculates the total of the smallest integers `i` for each delivery location `k` such that either `(k + i) % 8` or `(k - i) % 8` matches a store location. The result is then written to an output file. The function operates until it encounters a termination condition where `d` (the loop line length) is 0. However, it does not handle cases where the input is not formatted as expected or does not meet the specified input conditions.
