d is a positive integer representing the total length of the loop line (2 ≤ d ≤ 10^9), n is a positive integer representing the number of stores (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), m is a positive integer representing the number of orders (1 ≤ m ≤ 10000), and d2, d3, ..., dn are integers representing the locations of the stores other than the main store (1 ≤ di ≤ d - 1), and k1, k2, ..., km are integers representing the locations of the delivery destinations (0 ≤ ki ≤ d - 1).
