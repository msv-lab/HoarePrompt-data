The operation `cur = cur[:-1]` modifies the list `cur` by removing its last element. Since `cur` is currently an empty list, slicing it with `cur[:-1]` will still result in an empty list. The value of `i` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `cur` remains an empty list, and `i` is 1.

Output State: **`cur` is an empty list, `i` is 1**
