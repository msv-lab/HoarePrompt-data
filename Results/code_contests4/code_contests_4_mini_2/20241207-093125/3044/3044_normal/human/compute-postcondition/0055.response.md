The value of `s` is updated to be the substring of itself starting from index 1, effectively removing the first character of `s`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `cur` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `s` is the substring of the original `s` starting from index 1, `cur` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `s` is the substring of the original `s` starting from index 1, `cur` is an empty list**
