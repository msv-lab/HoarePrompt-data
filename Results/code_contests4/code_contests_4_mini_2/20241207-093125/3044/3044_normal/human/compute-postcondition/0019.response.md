The code `cur.append(x)` adds the value of `x` to the list `cur`. Since `cur` is currently an empty list, after this operation, `cur` will contain one element, which is the value of `x`. The variable `i` remains unaffected. The output state reflects the change in `cur`.

Output State: **`cur` contains `x`, `i` is 1**
