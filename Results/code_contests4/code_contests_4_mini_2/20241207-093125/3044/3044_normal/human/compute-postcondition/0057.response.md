According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The `split('/')` method will create a list based on the occurrences of the '/' character in `s`. If `s` is an empty string or does not contain the '/' character, the resulting list will contain a single element (the entire string) or be empty, respectively. 

Given that `n` is greater than 1 and `i` is 1, we need to ensure that `s` is not an empty string after any potential updates. If the first character of `s` is '/', it will be updated to remove this character, and `cur` will be initialized as an empty list. This means `s` should be checked to ensure it has at least one character after the update to allow the loop to execute.

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `s` contains at least one non-empty substring after the split operation. 

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `s` is a non-empty string either as the second substring of the input string or the updated substring without the first character if it was '/', and `cur` is initialized as an empty list**.
