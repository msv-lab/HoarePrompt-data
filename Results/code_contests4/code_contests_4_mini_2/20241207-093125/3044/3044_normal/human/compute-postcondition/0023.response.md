The variable `cur` is affected by the `append` method, which adds the value of `x` to the list `cur`. If `x` is `'..'`, then `cur` remains an empty list after the operation. If `x` is not `'..'`, then `cur` will contain the value of `x`. The state of `i` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`cur` is either an empty list (if `x` was '..') or contains `x` (if `x` was not '..'); `i` is 2**
