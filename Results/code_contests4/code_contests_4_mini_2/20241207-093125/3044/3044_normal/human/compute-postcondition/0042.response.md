The value of `cur` is updated by appending the value of `x`, but since `x` is not defined in the initial state provided, we cannot determine its value. However, we know that `cur` is currently an empty list. Therefore, after executing the code, `cur` will contain the value of `x` (which is unknown), while other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`cur` contains the value of `x`, `i` is 1**
