Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `s` is the second substring of the input string. If the first character of `s` is '/', then `s` is updated to be the substring of the original `s` starting from index 1 and `cur` is initialized as an empty list. If the first character of `s` is not '/', there are no changes made to `s` or `cur`.***
