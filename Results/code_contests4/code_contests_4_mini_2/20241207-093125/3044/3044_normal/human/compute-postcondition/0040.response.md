According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `s` and its content after being split by '/'. In the last iteration, `cur` is an empty list and `i` is 0. The value of `x` is determined by the current element from `s.split('/')`.

1. If `x` is equal to '..', then no changes are made to `cur` or `i`, and the loop's execution continues with the next element of `s.split('/')`.
2. If `x` is not equal to '..', then `cur` contains `x` (the current non-'..' element), and `i` remains 0.

Since `s` is a string that contains at least one '/', the split operation will generate at least two elements. Therefore, after the last iteration, to execute the loop one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1 to point to the next element of the split string.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be 1, and `x` will be the second element from the split string.

State: **`cur` is an empty list, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `s.split('/')` must have at least 2 elements**
