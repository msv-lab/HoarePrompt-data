The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it internally handles a number of commands as specified by the constraints. The function processes commands which can be either 'pwd' or 'cd' followed by a specific parameter. The function does not return a value directly but is designed to manage the state of a simulated filesystem based on the commands executed. Given the constraints, the functionality of the function is to interpret and execute a series of filesystem commands that affect the current working directory, while ensuring the commands are valid according to the specified rules.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of filesystem commands, either 'pwd' or 'cd', affecting the state of the current working directory without accepting any parameters.**
