The code `cur.append(x)` adds the value of `x` to the list `cur`. Since `cur` is initially an empty list, after executing this line, `cur` will contain the value of `x`. The values of `i` and `s` remain unchanged, and there are no other variables affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `cur` contains `x`, `i` is 0, `s` is a string that contains at least one '/', and `x` is not equal to '..'.

Output State: **`cur` contains `x`, `i` is 0, `s` is a string that contains at least one '/', `x` is not equal to '..'**
