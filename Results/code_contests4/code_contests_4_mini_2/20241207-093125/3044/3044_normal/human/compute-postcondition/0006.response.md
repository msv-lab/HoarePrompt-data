The value of `s` is reassigned to `s.split()[1]`, which means that `s` is being split into a list of words and the second word (index 1) is selected. Since `s` is an input string and is not equal to 'pwd', we can assume that `s` contains at least two words. Therefore, after execution, `s` will hold the value of the second word from the original input string. The values of `cur` and `i` remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`cur` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `s` is the second word of the input string**.
