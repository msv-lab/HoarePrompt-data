The code `cur = cur[:-1]` modifies the list `cur` by slicing it to exclude the last element. Since `cur` is currently an empty list, slicing it will result in an empty list as well. The variable `i` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, after execution, the output state is: `cur` is still an empty list, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`cur` is an empty list, `i` is 1**
