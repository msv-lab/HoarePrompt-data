The value of `s` is reassigned to `s[1:]`, which means it will now contain all characters of the original `s` except for the first character (the forward slash). Since the first character of `s` is a forward slash ('/'), after executing this line, `s` will now be the remainder of the string starting from the second character. The states of the other variables, `cur` and `i`, are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `cur` is an empty list, `i` is 0, and `s` is the string without its first character.

Output State: **`cur` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `s` is the string without its first character**
