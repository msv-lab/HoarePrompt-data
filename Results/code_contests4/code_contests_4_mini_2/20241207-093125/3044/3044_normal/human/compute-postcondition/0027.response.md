According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input value provided to `int(input())`. If the input is greater than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the number of valid directory names processed. For the loop to execute one more time, the input must be greater than `i`, and since `i` increments with each iteration, it will be `i + 1` for the next iteration.

State: **`cur` is a list of valid directory names from `s` if `s` is not 'pwd'; if `s` is 'pwd', the output printed is '/'. At the start of the next iteration `i` is `i + 1`, and for the loop to execute again, the input must be greater than `i + 1`.**
