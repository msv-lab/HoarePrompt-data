According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list generated by `s.split('/')`. If there are more elements in the list after the current index `i`, the loop can continue to execute. At the end of the last iteration, `cur` is either an empty list (if `x` was '..') or contains `x` (if `x` was not '..'), and `i` is 1. 

To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `i` should be 2, and `x` should be the next element in the list produced by `s.split('/')`. For the loop to execute again, we can only ascertain that there must be at least 2 elements in the original string `s` split by '/'.

State: **`cur` is an empty list (if `x` was '..') or contains `x` (if `x` was not '..'), `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time, the split list must have at least 2 elements.**
