Postcondition: ***`cur` is either an empty list if `x` was '..' or contains the value of `x` if `x` was not '..'; `i` is 2; if `x` was '..', `cur` is updated to remove the last element. If `x` was not '..', `cur` contains `x` and remains unchanged if `x` was not '..', while the loop is set to execute a second time if `s.split('/')` has at least 2 elements.***
