The code executes a print statement that constructs a string. The list `cur` is empty, so `'/'.join(cur)` results in an empty string. The final output of the print statement is thus `'/'`. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `cur` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `s` is 'pwd', and the output printed is '/'.

Output State: **`cur` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `s` is 'pwd', and the output printed is '/'**
