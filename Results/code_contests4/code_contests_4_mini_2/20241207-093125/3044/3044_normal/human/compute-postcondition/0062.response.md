Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `s` is a non-empty string either as the second substring of the input string or the updated substring without the first character if it was '/'; if `x` is equal to '..', `cur` is an empty list after removing the last element (if any). Otherwise, `cur` is updated to include `x`, and `x` is not equal to '..'.***
