The code `cur = cur[:-1]` modifies the list `cur` by removing the last element from it. Since `cur` is initially an empty list, slicing it with `cur[:-1]` will result in an empty list, as there are no elements to remove. The values of the other variables (`i`, `s`, `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cur` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `s` is a string that contains at least one '/', `x` is equal to '..'**
