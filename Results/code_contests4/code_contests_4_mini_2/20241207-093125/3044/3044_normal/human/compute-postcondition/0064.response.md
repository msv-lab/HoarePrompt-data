The code `cur = cur[:-1]` modifies the variable `cur` by assigning it the value of itself minus the last character. However, the initial state does not provide a value for `cur`, nor does it indicate how `cur` relates to `n`, `i`, `s`, or `x`. Therefore, since the value of `cur` is not defined, we cannot determine its impact.

Given this, the output state will reflect the unchanged variables and a statement about the operation that was attempted without a defined `cur`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `s` is a non-empty string with at least 2 substrings, `x` is the second substring of `s`, and `cur` has not been defined; operation on `cur` was attempted.**
