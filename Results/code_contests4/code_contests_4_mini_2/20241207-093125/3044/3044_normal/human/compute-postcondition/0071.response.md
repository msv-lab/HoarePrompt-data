To determine the final state after all iterations of the loop, we analyze the loop and its effects on the variables involved.

The loop iterates over the substrings created by splitting `s` by the '/' character. For each substring `x`, if `x` equals '..', it attempts to remove the last element from the list `cur`. If `x` does not equal '..', it appends `x` to `cur`.

1. If `s` is empty or does not contain any '/' character, the loop will not execute.
2. If `s` contains substrings, the loop will iterate over each substring:
   - For each '..', an element would be removed from `cur` if it exists.
   - For any other string, `cur` will have that string appended.

The output state will reflect the final values of `cur`, `n`, and `i`.

Given that:
- `n` is greater than 1 (remains unchanged),
- `i` will equal the number of substrings in `s` after processing,
- `s` will be the same as the non-empty input string,
- `cur` will contain the resulting list based on the operations performed during the loop.

Therefore, the output state, assuming the loop processes all substrings of `s`, will be:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is the number of substrings in `s`, `s` is a non-empty string, and `cur` contains the final processed list of substrings after handling '..' operations.**
