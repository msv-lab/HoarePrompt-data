According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `s` being split by the delimiter `/`. The variable `x` takes on each element of the resulting list from `s.split('/')`. At the end of the last iteration, `cur` is an empty list and `i` is 0. The loop will execute once for each element in the list produced by `s.split('/')`. 

Since `cur` is empty and `i` is 0, if the next element from `s.split('/')` is not equal to '..', `cur` will contain that element, and `i` will remain 0. If `x` is equal to '..', then there are no changes to `cur` or `i`.

To prepare for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we must account for the next element in the list produced by `s.split('/')`, meaning that `i` should be 1.

State: **`cur` is an empty list, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `s.split('/')` must have at least 2 elements.**
