According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input value that is read using `int(input())`. The loop will execute if this value is at least 1. At the end of the last iteration, `cur` remains an empty list. Therefore, for the loop to be executed the first time, the input must be greater than 0, and the loop variable `i` will start at 0.

State: **`cur` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time the input must be greater than 0, and `i` is 0**
