According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the content of the string `s`. The loop will run for each element in the list created by splitting `s` using the delimiter '/'. For the loop to execute at least once, `s` must contain at least one '/' character, which would result in at least two elements when split. Additionally, `cur` is an empty list initially, and `i` is not specified before the loop, so we can assume it starts at 0.

For the loop to execute at least once:
- `s` must be a string that contains at least one '/' (e.g., "a/b").
- `cur` is an empty list.
- `i` is 0 prior to the first iteration.

State: **`cur` is an empty list, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute `s` is a string that contains at least one '/'**
