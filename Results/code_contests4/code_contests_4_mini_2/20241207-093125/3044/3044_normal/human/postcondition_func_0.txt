The function processes a series of filesystem commands, specifically 'pwd' and 'cd', to manage the current working directory. It prints the current directory path when 'pwd' is called, and updates the directory based on 'cd' commands, handling both relative and absolute paths, as well as the special case of going up one directory with '..'. If the 'cd' command is provided with a root directory ('/'), it resets the current directory to the root. The function does not take any parameters, and it assumes valid input based on the constraints described in the comments.
