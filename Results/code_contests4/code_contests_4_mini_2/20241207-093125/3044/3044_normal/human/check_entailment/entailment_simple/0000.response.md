To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we will analyze the program's logic and behavior in relation to the requirements.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Initial State**: The program initializes a list `cur` to represent the current directory path, starting empty since it begins at the root directory.

2. **Command Processing**:
   - The program reads a number of commands and processes each one.
   - For the command `pwd`, it constructs the current absolute path by joining the elements of `cur` with slashes and prepending a slash to ensure it starts from the root. This is correct as per the requirement to display the current directory.
   - For the command `cd`, it checks if the path is absolute (starts with `/`). If it is:
     - It resets `cur` to an empty list (going to root) and processes the rest of the path.
   - The path is then split by slashes, and each part is processed:
     - If the part is `..`, it removes the last directory from `cur` (moving up one level).
     - Otherwise, it adds the directory name to `cur`.

3. **Final Output**: After executing all commands, the program correctly outputs the current directory for each `pwd` command.

### Requirements Check:
- **Absolute and Relative Paths**: The program correctly distinguishes between absolute and relative paths.
- **Handling `..`**: The program correctly handles the `..` command by removing the last directory in `cur`, as required.
- **Output Format**: The output for `pwd` correctly starts with a `/` and ends with a `/`, ensuring it matches the problem description.
- **No Movement Above Root**: The program guarantees that there is no attempt to move above the root, as specified in the problem.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles edge cases such as multiple `..` commands, directories with the same names, and transitions from the root to another directory correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program adheres to the problem description and correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
