n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of commands. Each command is either 'pwd' or 'cd' followed by a space and a non-empty parameter consisting of lowercase Latin letters, slashes, and dots. The command parameter 'cd' does not end with a slash unless it is the root directory represented by a single slash. The length of the command parameter is between 1 and 200 characters inclusive.
