To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the relevant parts of the code and see if it handles all edge cases effectively.

### Code Analysis
1. **Current Directory Initialization**: 
   - The program starts with `cur = []`, which represents the current directory starting from the root.

2. **Reading Commands**: 
   - The program reads commands in a loop for `n` iterations.

3. **Handling 'pwd' Command**: 
   - When the command is `pwd`, it prints the current directory in the format `"/" + "/".join(cur)`. This seems correct as it properly formats the current directory path.

4. **Handling 'cd' Command**: 
   - For `cd`, the program checks if the path starts with a `/`. If it does, it resets `cur` to `[]`, indicating a move to the root directory.
   - The program then splits the path using `/` and processes each component:
     - If the component is `..`, it removes the last directory from `cur`.
     - Otherwise, it appends the directory name to `cur`.

### Potential Edge Cases
1. **Multiple Consecutive Dots**: 
   - The program does not explicitly handle cases where multiple `..` can be used in succession. For instance, `cd ../../..` could potentially go beyond the root directory, but the problem states that there will be no attempt to transition to the parent directory of the root.

2. **Relative Paths with Leading Dots**: 
   - The program does not handle paths like `cd ./dir1` or `cd dir1/../dir2`, where `.` (current directory) may be used. However, since the input constraints guarantee valid commands, this may not be an issue.

3. **Handling of Empty Directory Names**: 
   - The problem description states that directory names are non-empty, so the code does not need to handle empty strings.

### Test Cases
Now, let's create a few test cases that might expose any issues with the current implementation.

#### Test Case 1
Input:
```
5
pwd
cd /a/b
pwd
cd ../c
pwd
```
Expected Output:
```
/
/a/b/
/a/c/
```
The program should handle this correctly.

#### Test Case 2
Input:
```
5
pwd
cd /a/b
cd ../../d
pwd
cd ..
pwd
```
Expected Output:
```
/
/a/b/
/d/
```
This should also work correctly.

### Conclusion
In reviewing the code, it seems to handle the expected inputs correctly based on the constraints provided in the problem statement. There are no visible edge cases that would cause the program to fail, given that it adheres strictly to the rules set forth in the problem description.

Correctness: **True** 

The program correctly implements the specified behavior for both commands `cd` and `pwd`, managing the current directory state accurately according to the hierarchical tree structure described.
