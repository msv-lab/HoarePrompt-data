Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle all possible combinations of the input values. For example, it fails to consider the case when the input is `5 7 5` or `7 5 5`, both of which should return `YES` since they can form a Haiku (5 syllables, 7 syllables, 5 syllables). 

The current checks only cover specific arrangements of the syllable counts and do not account for all permutations of the values A, B, and C that meet the Haiku requirements. Therefore, there are valid inputs for which the program will incorrectly output `NO`.
