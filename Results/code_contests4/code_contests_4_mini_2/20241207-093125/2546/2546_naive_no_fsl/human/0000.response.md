Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the requirement to form a Haiku. Specifically, it only checks three specific combinations of the input values and does not account for all possible orders of A, B, and C that could satisfy the Haiku syllable structure (5, 7, 5).

For instance, the input (7, 5, 5) outputs "NO", but it should actually output "YES" because the phrases can be rearranged to form a valid Haiku (5 syllables, 7 syllables, 5 syllables).

Additionally, it fails to account for any combination of A, B, and C that does not specifically match the conditions it has set. This means that valid combinations could be missed entirely.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
