Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description. 

### Explanation of the Issues:

1. **Hardcoded Conditions**: The program checks for specific values (5, 5, 7), (5, 7, 5), and (7, 5, 5) individually in multiple conditional statements. While these combinations are correct for forming a Haiku, the program fails to account for all the possible permutations of the phrases that could sum to a valid Haiku structure.

2. **Missing Valid Combinations**: The Haiku structure allows for any combination of the syllable counts (5, 7, 5). The program should be able to handle input like (5, 7, 5) or (7, 5, 5) in any order, but it only explicitly checks three specific arrangements. For instance, if the input were (7, 7, 5), the program would return "NO", which is correct for Haiku construction, but it would incorrectly return "YES" for invalid configurations like (7, 5, 5) since it only checks for specific orderings.

3. **No Generalized Check**: A correct implementation should check if any of the inputs match the required syllable counts regardless of order, rather than checking for specific sequences. 

### Conclusion:
Because the program structure is rigid and only checks a limited number of cases, it fails to meet the problem's requirements comprehensively. The program must be restructured to check if the input contains the valid counts (5, 5, and 7) in any order, rather than hardcoding checks for specific sequences. 

Thus, the correctness of the program is **False**.
