To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description and output hints, let's analyze the code step by step.

### Problem Description
The goal is to check if three phrases with syllables A, B, and C can be arranged to form a Haiku, which requires the syllable counts to be specifically 5, 7, and 5.

### Code Analysis
The program uses the following logic:
```python
(a, b, c) = map(int, raw_input().split())
if a == 5 and b == 5 and (c == 7):
    print('YES')
elif a == 5 and b == 7 and (c == 5):
    print('YES')
elif a == 7 and b == 5 and (c == 5):
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```
The code checks for three specific combinations of the values of A, B, and C that would allow for a valid Haiku:
1. (5, 5, 7)
2. (5, 7, 5)
3. (7, 5, 5)

### Edge Cases
The code does not handle any cases outside of these specific combinations. For example:
- If the input is (1, 2, 3), the output will be "NO", which is correct.
- If the input is (5, 5, 5), the output will also be "NO", which is incorrect because it does not represent a valid Haiku.

### Output Hints Analysis
The output hints state that the function checks specific combinations and will print "NO" for anything outside these combinations. This aligns with the code logic.

### Conclusion
The program fails to cover all potential cases as per the problem description. For example, it does not return "YES" for the case (5, 7, 5) arranged differently or any other permutation that could create a valid Haiku. Additionally, it does not handle the case where the input is valid but in an order not explicitly checked by the conditions.

Thus, based on the analysis:
Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, as it fails to account for valid permutations of the syllable counts that could form a Haiku.
