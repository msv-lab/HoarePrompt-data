Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if a Haiku can be formed with the given phrases. According to the problem description, a Haiku can be constructed if the phrases have syllable counts of 5, 7, and 5 in any order. 

However, the program only checks for three specific permutations: (5, 5, 7), (5, 7, 5), and (7, 5, 5). It fails to account for other valid combinations like (7, 5, 5) and (5, 7, 5) properly. The requirement is to check if the three integers can represent the syllable counts of a Haiku, which means it should validate if there exists any permutation of the values (5, 7, 5).

For instance, the input (5, 6, 5) would produce 'NO', which is incorrect because it doesn't account for the fact that 6 is not a valid syllable count for a Haiku. The program incorrectly limits valid combinations and misses valid permutations that could result in a Haiku.

In summary, the program does not correctly match the problem's requirements to check for the presence of the specified syllable counts in any order. Thus, it is incorrect.
