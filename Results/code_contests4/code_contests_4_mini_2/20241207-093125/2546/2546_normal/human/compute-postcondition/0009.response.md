Postcondition: ***`A`, `B`, and `C` are integers such that 1 <= A, B, C <= 10; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned from input, and it is not the case that `a` is 7, `b` is 5, and `c` is 5. Therefore, at least one of the following must be true: `a` is not 7, or `b` is not 5, or `c` is not 5. Additionally, `a` can be any integer, `b` can be any integer, and `c` can be any integer, as long as the conditions stated are satisfied.***
