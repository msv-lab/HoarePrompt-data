The code snippet provided simply prints the string 'YES'. There are no assignments or calculations affecting the integer variables `A`, `B`, `C`, `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial conditions provided do not change as a result of the print statement. Therefore, the output state reflects that the string 'YES' will be printed.

Output State: **`A`, `B`, and `C` are integers such that 1 <= A, B, C <= 10; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned from input. It is not the case that `a` is 5, `b` is 7, and `c` is 5. At least one of the following must be true: `a` is not 5, or `b` is not 7, or `c` is not 5. Additionally, `a` is equal to 7, `b` is equal to 5, and `c` is equal to 5. 'YES' is printed.**
