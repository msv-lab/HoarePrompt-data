Functionality: ** The function accepts input for three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (from user input) and checks specific combinations of these values. It prints 'YES' if any of the following conditions are met: (5, 5, 7), (5, 7, 5), or (7, 5, 5). If none of these conditions are met, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value and does not handle cases outside of the specified combinations, meaning any inputs that don't match the conditions will simply result in 'NO'. **
