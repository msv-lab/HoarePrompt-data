The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned from the input which is split and converted to integers using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The initial state indicates that `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers in the range from 1 to 10, but the specific values for `a`, `b`, and `c` are unknown since they are taken from user input. Therefore, the output state reflects that `a`, `b`, and `c` are now assigned values based on the input, while `A`, `B`, and `C` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A`, `B`, and `C` are integers such that 1 <= A, B, C <= 10; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned from input.**
