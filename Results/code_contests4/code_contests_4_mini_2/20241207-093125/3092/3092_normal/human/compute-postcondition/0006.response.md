The variable `result` is assigned the value of -1. The previous state of the other variables, `n` and `s`, remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `s` is the input string of length `n`; `result` is -1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `s` is the input string of length `n`; `result` is -1**
