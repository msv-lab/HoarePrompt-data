Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting only of lowercase English letters. If `n` is less than or equal to 26, it calculates the result as `n` minus the number of unique characters in `s` and prints this result. If `n` is greater than 26, it sets the result to -1 and prints it. The output is printed only when the function is executed as the main module. **
