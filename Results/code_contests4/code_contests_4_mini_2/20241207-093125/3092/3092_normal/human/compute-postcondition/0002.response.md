`n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, which means `n` is now an integer based on the user's input. The variable `s` is then assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which takes an input string from the user. The initial state of `n` being an integer remains the same, but `s` is now defined and holds the user's input string. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `s` is the input string of length `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `s` is the input string of length `n`.**
