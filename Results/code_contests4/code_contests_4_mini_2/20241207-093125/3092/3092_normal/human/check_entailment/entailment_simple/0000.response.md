To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the problem and the code.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. We need to ensure all substrings of a given string `s` are distinct.
2. If there are duplicate substrings, we should calculate the minimum number of character changes needed to achieve uniqueness.
3. If it is impossible to make all substrings distinct, we should return -1.

### Analyzing the Program:
- The program reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself.
- The program checks if `n` is less than or equal to 26 (the number of unique lowercase letters).
  - If `n <= 26`, it calculates the number of character changes required by subtracting the number of unique characters in `s` from `n`. This is based on the assumption that if `n` is less than or equal to 26, it is possible to change the characters and achieve distinct substrings.
  - If `n > 26`, the program directly returns -1, assuming it is impossible since there are only 26 unique lowercase letters available.

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Changes**: The program only considers the case when `n <= 26` and counts the number of non-unique characters. This approach does not accurately reflect the problem's requirement, as it fails to account for situations where simply counting duplicates may not lead to the minimum number of changes required to ensure all substrings are distinct. There could be configurations where more changes are necessary based on the arrangement of characters.
  
2. **Handling of `n > 26`**: The assumption that `n > 26` makes it impossible is correct in a general sense because you cannot have more than 26 distinct characters. However, the program does not handle the scenario correctly as it does not consider the possibility of transforming characters effectively before reaching that limit.

### Conclusion:
The program does not sufficiently address the requirements laid out in the problem description. Specifically, it does not calculate the minimum required changes correctly for strings of length `n <= 26` and incorrectly assumes that `n > 26` is always impossible without considering the potential for effective character changes.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
