Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. 

Here's the breakdown of why it is incorrect:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to ensure that all substrings of the given string `s` are distinct, which means that we need to ensure that no two substrings are the same. The only way to ensure this is to change characters in such a way that no sequence of characters (of any length) is repeated.

2. **Handling of String Length**: The program checks if `n` (the length of the string) is less than or equal to 26. If it is, it calculates the result as `n - len(set(s))`, which counts how many characters are not unique. However, having `n` less than or equal to 26 does not guarantee that all substrings will be distinct. For example, with `s = "aa"` (where `n=2`), there are repeated substrings ("a" and "aa"), and thus only a single change is needed. The program correctly identifies that one change is required in this case.

3. **Handling for n > 26**: If `n` is greater than 26, the program simply returns `-1`, suggesting that it is impossible to create a string with all distinct substrings. However, this logic is flawed because it does not consider the actual content of the string. For example, a string like `s = "abcdefghijabcdefghij"` (which has a length greater than 26) is fully capable of being modified to have distinct substrings, but the program incorrectly states it is impossible.

4. **Failure to Count Changes Appropriately**: The current logic does not take into account the actual characters in the string and how many changes may be necessary to make the substrings distinct beyond simply counting unique characters. 

In conclusion, the program fails to implement the required logic to ensure all substrings of the string are distinct based on the problem's requirements. It does not correctly calculate the minimum number of changes needed and incorrectly states impossibility in some cases.
