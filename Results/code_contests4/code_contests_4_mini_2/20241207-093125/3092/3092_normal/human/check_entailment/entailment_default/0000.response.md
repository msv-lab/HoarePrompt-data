The program aims to determine the minimum number of character changes required to make all substrings of a given string distinct. 

Initial assessment of the code:
1. The code first checks if the length of the string `n` is less than or equal to 26. This is crucial because there are only 26 lowercase English letters, and if `n` exceeds 26, it is impossible to have all distinct substrings, hence the result should be -1.
2. If `n` is less than or equal to 26, the program calculates the number of changes needed by subtracting the number of unique characters in the string from `n`. This is based on the assumption that the maximum number of distinct characters that can exist in the string is limited to 26.

Potential edge cases to consider:
- If `n` is 1, the output should be 0 since a single character string has only one substring, which is itself.
- If `n` is 26 and all characters are distinct, the output should be 0.
- If `n` is 26 and all characters are the same (e.g., "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"), the output should be 25 since 25 changes are needed to create all unique characters.
- If `n` is greater than 26, regardless of the string content, the output should always be -1.

Now, let's evaluate the output hints:
- The hints state that if `n` is greater than 26, it correctly sets the result to -1, which is consistent with the code.
- For `n` less than or equal to 26, the hint claims the result is `n` minus the number of unique characters in `s`, which aligns with the logic in the code.

Upon reviewing the edge cases against the code and the hints:
1. The code handles the case where `n` is 1 correctly.
2. It also covers cases where `n` equals 26 correctly for both unique and non-unique characters.
3. The case for `n` greater than 26 is also handled correctly.

Since the code adheres to the problem description and handles all potential edge cases correctly, including those outlined in the output hints, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
