Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The issue arises with the handling of the scenario when the length of the string `s` is greater than 26. 

In the case where `n > 26`, the program directly returns `-1`, indicating that it's impossible to make all substrings distinct. However, this is not necessarily true. For example, consider the string `s = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdef"`, which has a length of 30. While it is true that there are repeated characters, it is still possible to modify the string such that all substrings become distinct by changing some characters. The program fails to account for this possibility, as it simply returns `-1` without checking if changes can be made to achieve distinct substrings.

Additionally, the calculation of `result = n - len(set(s))` only provides the number of duplicates, but does not take into account the minimum number of changes required to ensure all substrings are distinct.

For example:
- Input: `n = 30`, `s = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdef"`
- Expected Output: Should not be `-1`, but rather a non-negative integer representing the minimum number of changes required.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
