Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. Here's a detailed explanation of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of heads (`n`) and the number of tracks to read (`m`), followed by the initial positions of the heads (`h`) and the tracks to be read (`p`). It ensures that both `h` and `p` are distinct integers sorted in ascending order, which matches the problem constraints.

2. **Binary Search for Minimum Time**: The program uses a binary search approach to efficiently find the minimum time needed to read all the required tracks. It initializes `ss` and `ll` to set the search range for the average time, which aligns with the goal of minimizing the time required.

3. **Feasibility Check**: Inside the binary search loop, the program checks whether it is possible to read all tracks within the current average time (`avg`). It iterates through the heads and tracks, ensuring that each track can be reached by a head within the constraints defined by the average time. This includes calculating whether heads can move left or right to cover the required tracks. The logic used for determining whether a head can reach a given track is sound and follows the problem's requirements.

4. **Final Output**: Once the binary search concludes, the program prints the minimum average time found, which corresponds directly to the solution required by the problem description.

The program accounts for all potential scenarios covered in the problem statement, including edge cases where heads start at positions that are far from the required tracks. It guarantees that all required tracks are read in the minimum time possible.

Overall, the program accurately reflects the specifications of the problem and solves it as intended. Thus, it is correct.
