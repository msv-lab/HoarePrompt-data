The function accepts two lists `h` and `p` containing `n` and `m` distinct integers, respectively, both sorted in ascending order. It calculates the minimum average time required such that each position in `p` can be reached from the corresponding position in `h` based on specific movement rules. The function prints this minimum average time as an integer after processing the lists. It also handles cases where no valid average can be found, ensuring that all elements of `p` are accounted for within the calculated ranges.
