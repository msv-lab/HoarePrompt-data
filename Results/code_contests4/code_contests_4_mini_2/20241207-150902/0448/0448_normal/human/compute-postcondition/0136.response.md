The variable `pidx` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `pidx` is unknown, but it will now be one greater than its previous value. The states of the other variables (`leftime`, `remtime`, `furthestright`, and the contents of `p`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State reflects the change in `pidx`.

Output State: **`leftime` is max(0, curpos - leftget); `remtime` is max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2); `furthestright` is curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime); `pidx` is incremented by 1.**
