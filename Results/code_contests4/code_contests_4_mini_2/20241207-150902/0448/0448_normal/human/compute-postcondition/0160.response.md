Output State: **`hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 0, `works` is False, `ss` is equal to `avg + 1`, `len(h)` is greater than or equal to `hidx`, `len(p)` is greater than or equal to `pidx`, `pidx` is not equal to the length of `p`, `avg` is calculated as (ss + ll) // 2, `leftget` is p[0], `curpos` is h[0], and `getbacktime` is calculated as max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget)).**
