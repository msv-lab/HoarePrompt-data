The `remtime` variable is assigned the value of `max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2)`. However, since `leftime` cannot be assigned a value due to an IndexError, we cannot compute the expression `(avg - leftime)`. Therefore, `remtime` cannot be calculated, and the state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`hidx` is 1, `pidx` is equal to the length of `p`, `curpos` cannot be assigned a value due to an IndexError; `alsotoright` is assigned the value max(0, avg - getbacktime); `leftime` cannot be assigned a value due to an IndexError; `remtime` cannot be calculated.**
