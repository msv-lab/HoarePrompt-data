The value of `getbacktime` is assigned the result of the expression `max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget))`. The previous values are `curpos` which is `h[hidx]` and `leftget` which is `p[pidx]`. The expression calculates `curpos - leftget`, multiplies it by 2, and takes the maximum of that result and 0. The other variables (`avg`, `works`, `h`, `hidx`, `p`, `pidx`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `getbacktime` is calculated based on these values.

Output State: **`curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `getbacktime` is calculated as max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget))**
