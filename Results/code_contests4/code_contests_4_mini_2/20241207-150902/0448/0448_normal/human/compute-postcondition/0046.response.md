Output State: **`pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`, `curpos` remains assigned the value of `h[hidx]`, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]` if `pidx` is less than the length of `p`, otherwise it is undefined. `furthestright` is calculated as `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`.**
