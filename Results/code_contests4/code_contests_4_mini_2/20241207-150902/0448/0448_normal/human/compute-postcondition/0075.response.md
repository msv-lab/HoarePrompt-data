Postcondition: ***`hidx` is equal to the length of `h`, `pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to the last calculated `furthestright`, if `works` is True, then `ll` is assigned the value of `avg`; otherwise, `ss` is assigned the value of `avg + 1`, with `works` remaining False and `pidx` not equal to the length of `p`.***
