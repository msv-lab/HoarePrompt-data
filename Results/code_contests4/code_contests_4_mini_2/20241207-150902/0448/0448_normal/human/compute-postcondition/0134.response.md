The value of `pidx` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `pidx` is unknown. The states of the other variables (`leftime`, `remtime`, `furthestright`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `leftime` is max(0, curpos - leftget); `remtime` is max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2); `furthestright` is curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime); `pidx` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`leftime` is max(0, curpos - leftget); `remtime` is max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2); `furthestright` is curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime); `pidx` is incremented by 1.**
