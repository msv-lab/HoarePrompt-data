The code assigns values to `n` and `m` based on user input, which is split into two integers. The previous values of `n` and `m` are not known since they are being assigned for the first time. The lists `hi` and `pi` remain unaffected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `hi` is a list of n distinct integers in ascending order; `pi` is a list of m distinct integers in ascending order; `n` and `m` are now assigned values based on user input.

Output State: **`hi` is a list of n distinct integers in ascending order; `pi` is a list of m distinct integers in ascending order; `n` and `m` are now assigned values based on user input.**
