The variable `avg` is not defined in the initial state but is used in the calculation of `alsotoright`. The expression `alsotoright` is assigned the value of `max(0, avg - getbacktime)`. The previous values of the affected variables do not provide a specific value for `avg`, so we cannot determine the exact value of `alsotoright`. However, `getbacktime` has been assigned a value based on the calculation `max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget))`.

The output state indicates that while we cannot determine `alsotoright` without a value for `avg`, we can describe the relationship.

Output State: **`hidx` is increased by 1, `len(h)` is greater than `hidx`, `len(p)` is greater than `pidx`, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`, `getbacktime` is assigned the value of max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget)), and `alsotoright` is assigned the value of max(0, avg - getbacktime) where `avg` is not defined.**
