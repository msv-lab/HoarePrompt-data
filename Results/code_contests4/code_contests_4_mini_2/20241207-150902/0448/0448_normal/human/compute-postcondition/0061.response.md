To determine whether the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions based on the provided state and the loop condition. 

The loop condition is:
```
while pidx < len(p) and p[pidx] <= furthestright:
```

1. **Condition 1: `pidx < len(p)`**
   - This condition checks whether `pidx` is less than the length of the list `p`. If `pidx` has been incremented by 1 in the last iteration, we need to ensure that `pidx` is still less than the length of `p` for the loop to execute again. Hence, `len(p)` must be greater than `pidx` after the increment.

2. **Condition 2: `p[pidx] <= furthestright`**
   - This condition checks whether the current value in the list `p` at index `pidx` is less than or equal to `furthestright`. Since `pidx` has been incremented, we need to ensure that the new `pidx` still points to a valid index and that the corresponding value in `p` satisfies the condition.

Given the state provided:

- `alsotoright` is assigned `max(0, avg - getbacktime)`, which implies it is non-negative.
- `leftime` is either `0` or `curpos - leftget`.
- `remtime` is assigned `max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2)`, which is also non-negative.
- `furthestright` is calculated based on `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`, which ensures it is at least `curpos`.

Since `pidx` has been incremented, we need to check the following:

- For the loop to execute again, `pidx` must be less than `len(p)`, meaning `len(p)` must be greater than the incremented `pidx` value.
- The value `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

Therefore, assuming `len(p)` was `pidx + 1` or more before the increment, we need to ensure that `p[pidx]` is valid and satisfies the condition.

State: **`alsotoright` is assigned `max(0, avg - getbacktime); leftime` is either `0` or `curpos - leftget; remtime` is assigned `max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2); furthestright` is assigned `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime); for the loop to execute again `len(p)` must be greater than `pidx` and `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.**
