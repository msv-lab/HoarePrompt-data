To determine the output state, we need to analyze the initial state and how the code snippet affects the variables involved.

1. **Initial Values**:
   - `hidx` is 0
   - `pidx` is 0
   - `works` is False
   - `ss` is equal to `avg + 1`
   - `len(h)` is greater than 0
   - `len(p)` is greater than 0
   - `leftget` is equal to `p[pidx]`
   - `curpos` is equal to `h[0]`
   - `getbacktime` is equal to max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget))
   - `alsotoright` is equal to max(0, avg - getbacktime)
   - `leftime` is equal to max(0, curpos - leftget)
   - `remtime` is equal to max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2)

2. **Calculating `furthestright`**:
   - `furthestright = curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`

Now, we will outline the impact of calculating `furthestright`:
- `curpos` remains unchanged as it is equal to `h[0]`.
- `alsotoright` is calculated based on `avg` and `getbacktime`.
- `remtime` is calculated based on `avg` and `leftime`.
- The code computes the maximum of `alsotoright` and `remtime`, which will then be added to `curpos` to determine the value of `furthestright`.

3. **Output State**:
In the output state, we need to reflect that `furthestright` has been calculated, while the other variables remain unchanged, and we acknowledge that `furthestright` is dependent on the previous calculations of `curpos`, `alsotoright`, and `remtime`.

Thus, the output state is:
Output State: **`hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 0, `works` is False, `ss` is equal to `avg + 1`, `len(h)` is greater than 0, `len(p)` is greater than 0, `leftget` is equal to `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is equal to `h[0]`, `getbacktime` is equal to max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget)), `alsotoright` is max(0, avg - getbacktime), `leftime` is max(0, curpos - leftget), `remtime` is max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2), `furthestright` is equal to curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)**.
