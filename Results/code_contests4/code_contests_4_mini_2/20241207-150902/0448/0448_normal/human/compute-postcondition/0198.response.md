The value of `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[2]`, which is not specified but is assumed to be greater than `leftget` based on the context, since `curpos - leftget` is compared to `avg`. The value of `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, and `pidx` is less than `len(p)`. 

The expression `curpos - leftget` is calculated, and since it's mentioned that if this value is greater than `avg`, `works` is set to False, it implies that `curpos` is indeed greater than `leftget`. 

The code snippet calculates `getbacktime` as `max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget))`. The `getbacktime` will be non-negative, since `max` with 0 ensures the result is at least 0.

Since `curpos` and `leftget` are not explicitly defined values, we denote the relationship between them. Thus, `getbacktime` will yield a value based on the difference multiplied by 2, ensuring it's at least 0.

Output State: **`hidx` is 2, `len(h)` is greater than 2, `pidx` is less than `len(p)`, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[2]`, and `getbacktime` is computed as `max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget))`.**
