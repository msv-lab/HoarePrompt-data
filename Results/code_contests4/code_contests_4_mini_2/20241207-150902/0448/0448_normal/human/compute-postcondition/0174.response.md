The code assigns `leftget` the value of `p[pidx]`. Since `pidx` is equal to the length of `p`, this means `p[pidx]` is trying to access an index that is out of range (as list indices start from 0 and the maximum valid index is `length of p - 1`). Therefore, the output state reflects that there is an issue due to the index being out of bounds. 

Output State: **`hidx` is 1, `pidx` is equal to the length of `p`, attempting to access `p[pidx]` results in an IndexError due to out of bounds access.**
