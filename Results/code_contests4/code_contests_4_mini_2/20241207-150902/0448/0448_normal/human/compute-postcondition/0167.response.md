According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `pidx` and the elements in the list `p`. The loop will execute as long as `pidx` is less than the length of `p` and the value at `p[pidx]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `pidx` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:
1. `pidx` must be less than `len(p)`. Given that `pidx` is currently 1, `len(p)` must be greater than 1.
2. The value at `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`. 

Since `furthestright` must be defined and greater than or equal to `p[0]`, we need to ensure that `furthestright` is also greater than or equal to `p[1]` for the loop to run again.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `p` has at least 2 elements and that `furthestright` is at least `p[1]`.

State: **`hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 1, `works` is False, `ss` is equal to `avg + 1`, `avg` is calculated as `(ss + ll) // 2`, `leftget` is `p[0]`, `curpos` is `h[0]`, `leftime` is calculated as `max(0, curpos - leftget)`, `remtime` is calculated as `max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2); furthestright must be defined and greater than or equal to p[1]`**
