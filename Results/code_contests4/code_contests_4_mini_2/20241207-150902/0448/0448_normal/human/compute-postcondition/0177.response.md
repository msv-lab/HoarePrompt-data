The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is 1, `pidx` is equal to the length of `p`, `curpos` cannot be assigned a value due to an IndexError, and `works` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
