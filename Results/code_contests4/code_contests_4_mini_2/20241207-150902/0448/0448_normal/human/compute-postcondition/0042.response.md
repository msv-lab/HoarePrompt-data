To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions specified in the `while` loop. The loop will continue as long as two conditions are met: `pidx < len(p)` and `p[pidx] <= furthestright`.

At the end of the last iteration, we know:
- `pidx` has been increased by 1.
- `curpos`, `leftget`, and `furthestright` have already been calculated.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need:
1. `pidx` must be less than `len(p)`.
2. The next value of `p[pidx]` (after the increment) must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

Since `pidx` was increased by 1, we need to ensure that `pidx` (after the increment) is still less than `len(p)`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `len(p)` must be greater than `pidx` after the increment. This implies that the initial value of `len(p)` must be greater than the previous value of `pidx` before the increment.

Additionally, we need to ensure that `p[pidx]` (the value at the new `pidx`) must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

State: **`curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `furthestright` is calculated as `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`; for the loop to execute again, `len(p)` must be greater than `pidx` and `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.**
