According to the code, the loop can execute again if both conditions `hidx < len(h)` and `pidx < len(p)` are satisfied. 

At the end of the last iteration, `hidx` has been increased by 1, which means `hidx` is now equal to its previous value plus 1. Since the loop must execute one more time, `hidx` must be less than `len(h)`, which implies that `len(h)` must be greater than `hidx`.

For the variable `pidx`, it is currently equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`. Since `pidx` must also be less than `len(p)` for the loop to execute again, `len(p)` must be greater than `pidx`.

Thus, to allow the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that:
1. `len(h)` is greater than `hidx`, which is now increased by 1.
2. `len(p)` is greater than `pidx`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the states accordingly:

State: **`hidx` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute again `len(h)` is greater than `hidx` and `len(p)` is greater than `pidx`**
