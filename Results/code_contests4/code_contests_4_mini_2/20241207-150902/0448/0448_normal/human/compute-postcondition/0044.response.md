To determine if the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to evaluate the conditions: `pidx < len(p)` and `p[pidx] <= furthestright`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`.
- `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`.
- `furthestright` is calculated as `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`.
- `pidx` has been increased by 1.

Now, let's analyze the conditions:
1. `pidx < len(p)`: This condition must hold true for the loop to execute again. Since `pidx` was increased by 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `pidx` must have been less than `len(p)` before the increment. Therefore, we need to ensure that `pidx` is less than `len(p)` after the increment for the loop condition to hold.
2. `p[pidx] <= furthestright`: This condition must also hold true for the loop to execute again. We need to ensure that `p[pidx]` (the value at the new `pidx`) is less than or equal to `furthestright`.

Given that `pidx` was just incremented, we need to adjust the state to ensure that:
- `pidx` before incrementing must have been less than `len(p) - 1` so that after incrementing, it is less than `len(p)`.
- The value of `p[pidx]` (which is now the next index after the increment) must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

Thus, we need to adjust the state accordingly.

State: **`curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `furthestright` is calculated as `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`; for the loop to execute again `pidx` must be less than len(p) - 1 and `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.**
