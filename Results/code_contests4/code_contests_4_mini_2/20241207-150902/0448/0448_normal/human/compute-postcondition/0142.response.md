Postcondition: ***`hidx` is equal to `len(h)`, `pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright` after the last iteration, `works` is False, `ss` is equal to `avg + 1`, `len(h)` is greater than or equal to `hidx`, `len(p)` is greater than or equal to `pidx`, and `pidx` is not equal to the length of `p`.***
