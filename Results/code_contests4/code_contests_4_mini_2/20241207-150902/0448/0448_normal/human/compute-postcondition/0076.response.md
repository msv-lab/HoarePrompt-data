To determine if the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition `ss < ll`. 

From the provided state:
- `ss` is currently less than `ll` (since the loop executed).
- We know that `ll` is assigned the value of `avg` when `works` is True, and `ss` is assigned the value of `avg + 1` when `works` is False.

Given that `works` is False at the end of the previous iteration, we have:
- `ss` is equal to `avg + 1`
- `ll` is equal to `avg`

Thus, we have: 
- `ss` (which is `avg + 1`) is indeed greater than `ll` (which is `avg`), meaning the condition `ss < ll` is not satisfied.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `ss < ll`. This can be achieved by adjusting the value of `ss`. Since `ss` is currently `avg + 1`, we need to change it to a value that is less than `ll`, hence it should be less than or equal to `avg`.

Therefore, the adjustment needed is:
- Change `ss` to be less than or equal to `avg` (e.g., `ss` could be `avg` or lower).

Since no other states are affected or need to be adjusted for the loop to execute once more, we can summarize the necessary change.

State: **`hidx` is equal to the length of `h`, `pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to the last calculated `furthestright`, `works` is False, `ss` is equal to `avg + 1`, and for the loop to execute again `ss` needs to be less than or equal to `avg`**.
