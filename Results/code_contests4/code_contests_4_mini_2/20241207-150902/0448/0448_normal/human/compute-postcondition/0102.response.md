The variable `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`. The initial state indicates that `hidx` has been increased by 1, and conditions for looping are such that `len(h)` is greater than `hidx` and `len(p)` is greater than `pidx`. Therefore, the assignment of `leftget` will be successful, and since the specific values of `p` and `pidx` are not provided, we can only state that `leftget` will hold the value from the list `p` at the index `pidx`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`hidx` is increased by 1, `len(h)` is greater than `hidx`, `len(p)` is greater than `pidx`, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]**.
