The value of `pidx` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `pidx` was 0, so after execution, `pidx` becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 1, `works` is False, `ss` is equal to `avg + 1`, `len(h)` is greater than 0, `len(p)` is greater than 0, `leftget` is equal to `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is equal to `h[0]`, `getbacktime` is equal to max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget)), `alsotoright` is max(0, avg - getbacktime), `leftime` is max(0, curpos - leftget), `remtime` is max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2), `furthestright` is equal to curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime), and for the loop to execute the first time then p[0] must be less than or equal to furthestright.
