To determine the output state, we first analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet.

Initial State:
- `leftime` is assigned the value of `max(0, curpos - leftget)`.
- `remtime` is assigned the value of `max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2)`.

Now, we execute the code snippet:
```
furthestright = curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)
```

1. The variable `furthestright` is calculated by adding `curpos` to the maximum of `alsotoright` and `remtime`.
2. The values of `curpos`, `alsotoright`, and `remtime` affect the calculation of `furthestright`.
3. The previous values of `leftime` and `remtime` do not change, but they are used to compute `remtime`.

Thus, the output state captures the computed value of `furthestright` based on the above calculations.

Output State: **`leftime` is max(0, curpos - leftget); `remtime` is max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2); `furthestright` is curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)**
