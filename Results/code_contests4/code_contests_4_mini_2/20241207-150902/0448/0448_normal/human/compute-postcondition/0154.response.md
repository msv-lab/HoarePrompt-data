The variable `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`. Given the initial state, `pidx` is 0, which means `leftget` will take the value of the first element in the list `p`. The values of `hidx`, `works`, `ss`, `len(h)`, `len(p)`, and `avg` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State reflects the unchanged values of these variables along with the newly assigned value of `leftget`.

Output State: **`hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 0, `works` is True, `ss` is equal to `avg + 1`, `len(h)` is greater than or equal to `hidx`, `len(p)` is greater than or equal to `pidx`, `pidx` is not equal to the length of `p`, `avg` is calculated as (ss + ll) // 2, `leftget` is p[0]**
