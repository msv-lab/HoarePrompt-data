Output State: **`hidx` is increased by 1, `len(h)` is greater than `hidx`, `len(p)` is greater than `pidx`, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`, `getbacktime` is assigned the value of max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget)), `alsotoright` is assigned the value of max(0, avg - getbacktime), `leftime` is assigned the value of max(0, curpos - leftget), `remtime` is assigned the value of max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2), `furthestright` is assigned the value of curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime), `pidx` is increased by 1.**
