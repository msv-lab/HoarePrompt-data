The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is increased by 1; `len(h)` is greater than `hidx`; `len(p)` is greater than or equal to `pidx`; `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`; `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`; `works` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
