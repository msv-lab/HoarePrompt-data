To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one time, we need to analyze the conditions specified in the `while` loop statement. The loop execution is contingent upon two conditions:

1. `pidx < len(p)`: This means that the index `pidx` must be less than the length of the list `p`. If `pidx` is currently equal to or greater than `len(p)`, the loop won't execute.

2. `p[pidx] <= furthestright`: This condition checks whether the element at index `pidx` in the list `p` is less than or equal to `furthestright`. If `p[pidx]` is greater than `furthestright`, the loop will not execute.

Based on the provided state:

- We need to ensure that `pidx` is less than `len(p)`.
- We also need to verify that the value of `p[pidx]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`.

From the given state, we have the following variables:
- `curpos` (calculated from `h[hidx]`)
- `leftget` (calculated from `p[pidx]`)
- `getbacktime`, `alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, and `furthestright` are all derived from the previous values.

To ensure the loop can execute once:
- If `pidx` is not less than `len(p)`, we need to adjust it to ensure that it is.
- If `p[pidx]` is greater than `furthestright`, we must adjust either the value of `furthestright` or the elements of `p` to ensure that this condition holds.

Since we do not have specific values for `pidx`, `len(p)`, or the contents of `p`, we can only state the necessary adjustments in a general form.

Assuming the necessary conditions are not met, the response would be:

State: **`curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `furthestright` is calculated as curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime), for the loop to execute the first time `pidx` must be less than `len(p)` and `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.**
