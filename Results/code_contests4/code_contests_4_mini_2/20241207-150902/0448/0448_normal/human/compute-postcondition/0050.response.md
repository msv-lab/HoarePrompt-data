Output State: **`pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`; `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`; `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]` if `pidx` is less than the length of `p`, otherwise it is undefined; `furthestright` is calculated as `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`; and for the loop to execute again `hidx` needs to be less than the length of `h` and `pidx` needs to be less than the length of `p`.**
