The value of `hidx` is incremented by 1, changing it from 1 to 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is 2, `pidx` is equal to the first index where `p[pidx]` exceeds `furthestright` or `len(p)` whichever comes first; `curpos` cannot be assigned a value due to an IndexError; `alsotoright` is assigned the value max(0, avg - getbacktime); `leftime` cannot be assigned a value due to an IndexError; `remtime` cannot be calculated; `furthestright` can be calculated.
