To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions in the `while` loop: `pidx < len(p)` and `p[pidx] <= furthestright`.

1. **Assessing `pidx < len(p)`:** 
   - The variable `pidx` has been increased by 1 in the previous iteration. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `pidx` must be less than the length of `p`. This means that the previous value of `pidx` needs to be less than `len(p) - 1` prior to the increment. Therefore, we need to ensure that `pidx` is less than `len(p)` after the increment.

2. **Assessing `p[pidx] <= furthestright`:** 
   - We need to ensure that the current value of `p[pidx]` (after the increment of `pidx`) is less than or equal to `furthestright`. This means `furthestright` needs to be greater than or equal to `p[pidx]` after the increment.

From the above analysis, we can conclude:
- For the loop to execute again, we need `pidx` to be less than `len(p)` after its increment.
- We also need `furthestright` to be greater than or equal to the updated `p[pidx]`.

State: **`alsotoright` is assigned `max(0, avg - getbacktime); leftime` is either `0` or `curpos - leftget; remtime` is assigned `max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2); furthestright` is assigned `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime); and for the loop to execute again, pidx is less than len(p) and p[pidx] is less than or equal to furthestright.**
