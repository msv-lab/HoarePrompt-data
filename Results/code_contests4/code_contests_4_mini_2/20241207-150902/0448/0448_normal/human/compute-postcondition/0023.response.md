To determine whether the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions: 

1. The loop condition is `pidx < len(p) and p[pidx] <= furthestright`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `pidx` has been increased by 1, which means that the current value of `pidx` is now one more than it was before this iteration.
3. For the loop to execute again, two conditions must be satisfied:
   - `pidx` must still be less than `len(p)`, meaning the length of the list `p` must be greater than `pidx`.
   - The value `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

Since `pidx` has increased by 1, we need to ensure that `len(p)` is greater than `pidx`, which it might not be depending on its value before incrementing. Thus, we need to ensure that `len(p)` is greater than the new value of `pidx`.

As for `p[pidx]`, we cannot determine its value since it depends on the contents of `p` and the value of `furthestright`, which is not provided. However, we can state that `furthestright` must be greater than or equal to the value of `p[pidx]`.

Given these considerations, we can summarize the necessary adjustments:

- For the loop to execute one more time, `len(p)` must be greater than `pidx`. Since `pidx` has increased by 1, it implies that `len(p)` should be greater than the new value of `pidx`.
- We also need to ensure that `p[pidx]` must be such that `p[pidx] <= furthestright`.

Thus, the state should reflect these conditions.

State: **`avg` is 10,500,000,000; `remtime` is either 5,250,000,000 or a value based on max(0, (10,500,000,000 - leftime) // 2); `pidx` is increased by 1 and for the loop to execute again, len(p) must be greater than `pidx` and p[pidx] must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.**
