According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `pidx`, `len(p)`, and `furthestright`. The loop can execute again if both conditions `pidx < len(p)` and `p[pidx] <= furthestright` are satisfied. 

At the end of the last iteration, we have:
- `pidx` is 2,
- `len(p)` is greater than `pidx + 1`, which means `len(p)` is greater than 3,
- `furthestright` is greater than or equal to `p[pidx + 1]`.

For the loop to execute one more time, it is necessary that:
1. `pidx` remains less than `len(p)`, which is already satisfied since `len(p)` is greater than 3.
2. The condition `p[pidx] <= furthestright` must still hold true. Since `pidx` is 2, we need `p[2] <= furthestright` to be true for the next iteration.

Thus, no states need to be adjusted, as both conditions are already satisfied.

State: **`hidx` is 1, `pidx` is 2, `len(p)` is greater than `pidx + 1`, and `furthestright` is greater than or equal to `p[pidx + 1]`**
