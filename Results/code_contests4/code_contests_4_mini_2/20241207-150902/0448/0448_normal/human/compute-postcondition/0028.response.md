The value of `hidx` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `hidx` is unknown. The other variables (`pidx`, `avg`, `remtime`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`, `avg` is 10,500,000,000; `remtime` is either 5,250,000,000 or a calculated value; `hidx` is increased by 1.
