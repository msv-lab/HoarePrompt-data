To determine whether the `while` loop can execute, we need to analyze the conditions in the loop statement: `pidx < len(p)` and `p[pidx] <= furthestright`.

1. **Current State**:
   - `hidx` is 1
   - `pidx` is equal to the length of `p`
   - `curpos` cannot be assigned a value due to an IndexError
   - `alsotoright` is assigned a value based on `avg` and `getbacktime`
   - `leftime` cannot be assigned a value due to an IndexError
   - `remtime` cannot be calculated
   - `furthestright` cannot be calculated due to IndexError

2. **Loop Conditions**:
   - The first condition `pidx < len(p)` implies that for the loop to execute, `pidx` must be less than the length of the list `p`. Since `pidx` is currently equal to the length of `p`, this condition will not be satisfied.
   - The second condition `p[pidx] <= furthestright` cannot be evaluated as we have an IndexError with `pidx` being equal to the length of the list.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust `pidx` so that it is less than `len(p)`. This can be achieved by decreasing `pidx` by at least 1.
   - Additionally, `furthestright` must be calculable, meaning the value it is derived from should also be defined and not cause an IndexError.

Thus, to allow the loop to execute, we need to ensure that:
- `pidx` should be set to `len(p) - 1` (or less than `len(p)`)
- `furthestright` must be calculable, which means `avg` and `getbacktime` need to be set appropriately such that `alsotoright` is valid.

**Final Adjusted State**:
State: **`hidx` is 1, `pidx` is set to len(p) - 1, `curpos` cannot be assigned a value due to an IndexError; `alsotoright` is assigned the value max(0, avg - getbacktime); `leftime` cannot be assigned a value due to an IndexError; `remtime` cannot be calculated; furthestright can be calculated**.
