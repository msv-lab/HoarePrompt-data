The value of `pidx` is incremented by 1. Since its previous value was 0, after execution, `pidx` becomes 1. The states of the other variables do not change. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 1, `works` is False, `ss` is equal to `avg + 1`, `avg` is calculated as `(ss + ll) // 2`, `leftget` is `p[0]`, `curpos` is `h[0]`, `leftime` is calculated as `max(0, curpos - leftget)`, `remtime` is calculated as `max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2); furthestright must be defined and greater than or equal to p[0]`.

Output State: **`hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 1, `works` is False, `ss` is equal to `avg + 1`, `avg` is calculated as `(ss + ll) // 2`, `leftget` is `p[0]`, `curpos` is `h[0]`, `leftime` is calculated as `max(0, curpos - leftget)`, `remtime` is calculated as `max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2); furthestright must be defined and greater than or equal to p[0]`**
