The value of `pidx` is incremented by 1. Since `pidx` is less than `len(p)`, after this operation, `pidx` will be one step closer to its upper limit. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is 2, `len(h)` is greater than 2, `pidx` is increased by 1, and for the loop to execute again, `len(p)` must be greater than 3 and `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

Output State: **`hidx` is 2, `len(h)` is greater than 2, `pidx` is increased by 1, and for the loop to execute again, `len(p)` must be greater than 3 and `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.**
