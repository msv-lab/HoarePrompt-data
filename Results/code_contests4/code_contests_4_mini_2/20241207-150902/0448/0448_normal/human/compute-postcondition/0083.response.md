The variable `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`. Given that `hidx` is 0 and `len(h)` is greater than 0, `curpos` will take the first element of the list `h`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 0, `works` is True, `ss` is equal to `avg + 1`, `len(h)` is greater than 0, `len(p)` is greater than 0, `leftget` is equal to p[pidx], and `curpos` is equal to h[0].

Output State: **`hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 0, `works` is True, `ss` is equal to `avg + 1`, `len(h)` is greater than 0, `len(p)` is greater than 0, `leftget` is equal to p[pidx], and `curpos` is equal to h[0]**.
