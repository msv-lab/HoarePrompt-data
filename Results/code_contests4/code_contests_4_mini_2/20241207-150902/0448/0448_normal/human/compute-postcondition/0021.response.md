To determine what needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the conditions inside the `while` loop, specifically the variables `pidx`, `p`, and `furthestright`.

1. The loop condition is `pidx < len(p)`, which means `pidx` must be less than the length of the list `p`. This implies that `p` must contain at least one element, and `pidx` must be initialized to a value that is less than this length.

2. The second part of the loop condition is `p[pidx] <= furthestright`. This means that the current element in the list `p` at index `pidx` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`. However, since `furthestright` cannot be computed because `curpos` and `alsotoright` are undefined, we cannot determine its value.

Given that `furthestright` cannot be computed, we must ensure that the loop can execute by focusing on the first condition. For the loop to execute at least once, we need to ensure that `p` is defined and that `pidx` is initialized correctly.

### Conclusion:
- `p` must be a list with at least one element.
- `pidx` must be initialized to a value that is less than the length of `p`.

Since `remtime` is either 5,250,000,000 or based on a computation that cannot be determined here, we do not need to adjust this. The main focus is on ensuring `p` has elements.

State: **`avg` is 10,500,000,000; `remtime` is either 5,250,000,000 or a value based on max(0, (10,500,000,000 - leftime) // 2); for the loop to execute the first time `p` must be a list with at least one element and `pidx` must be initialized to 0 or a value less than len(p)**
