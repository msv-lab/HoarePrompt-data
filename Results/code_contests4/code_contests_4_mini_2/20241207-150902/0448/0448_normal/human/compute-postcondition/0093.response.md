To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute one time, we need to analyze the conditions present in the loop:

The loop condition is `pidx < len(p) and p[pidx] <= furthestright`. 

1. `pidx < len(p)`: This condition checks if the `pidx` is less than the length of the list `p`. Given that `pidx` is currently 0 and `len(p)` is greater than 0 (as stated in the program state), this condition will be satisfied.

2. `p[pidx] <= furthestright`: This condition checks if the value at index `pidx` of list `p` is less than or equal to `furthestright`. We need to ensure that this condition holds true for the loop to execute.

Given the state:
- `furthestright` is equal to `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`. 
- `curpos` is equal to `h[0]`.
- `alsotoright` is max(0, avg - getbacktime), and `getbacktime` is max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget)).
- Since `works` is False, we might need to ensure that the values in `p` allow the second condition to hold true.

To ensure the loop executes:
- We need to confirm that `p[0]` (since `pidx` is 0) must be less than or equal to `furthestright`. This means we might need to adjust `p[0]` or ensure `furthestright` is large enough to satisfy this.

Thus, we can summarize:
- `p[0]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright` for the loop to execute.

State: **`hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 0, `works` is False, `ss` is equal to `avg + 1`, `len(h)` is greater than 0, `len(p)` is greater than 0, `leftget` is equal to `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is equal to `h[0]`, `getbacktime` is equal to max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget)), `alsotoright` is max(0, avg - getbacktime), `leftime` is max(0, curpos - leftget), `remtime` is max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2), `furthestright` is equal to curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime), for the loop to execute the first time then p[0] must be less than or equal to furthestright**.
