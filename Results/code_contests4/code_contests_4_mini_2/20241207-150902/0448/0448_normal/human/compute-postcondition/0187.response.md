The value of `pidx` is incremented by 1, which means it is now 2 (the previous value was incremented). The other variables, `hidx`, `len(p)`, and `furthestright`, remain unchanged. The conditions for the loop to execute again are still based on these unchanged variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is 1, `pidx` is 2, `len(p)` is greater than `pidx + 1`, and `furthestright` is greater than or equal to `p[pidx + 1]`.

Output State: **`hidx` is 1, `pidx` is 2, `len(p)` is greater than `pidx + 1`, and `furthestright` is greater than or equal to `p[pidx + 1]**
