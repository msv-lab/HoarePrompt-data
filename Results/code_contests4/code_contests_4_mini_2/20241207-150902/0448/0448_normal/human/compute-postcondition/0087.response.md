Postcondition: ***`hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 0, `works` is False, `ss` is equal to `avg + 1`, `len(h)` is greater than 0, `len(p)` is greater than 0, `leftget` is equal to p[pidx], `curpos` is equal to h[0], and if the difference between `curpos` and `leftget` is greater than `avg`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
