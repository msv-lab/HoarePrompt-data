In the provided code snippet, `leftget` is assigned the value of the element in list `p` at the index `pidx`. The value of `pidx` is defined as the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`. Therefore, `leftget` will take on the value of the corresponding element from `p`. 

Since the specific values of `p` and `furthestright` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `leftget`. However, we know that `hidx` has been increased by 1, and for the loop to execute again, `hidx` must remain less than the length of `h`, and `pidx` must also be less than the length of `p`.

The output state reflects the assignment to `leftget` and the conditions for the loop to continue executing.

Output State: **`pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`; `avg` is 10,500,000,000; `remtime` is either 5,250,000,000 or a calculated value; `hidx` is increased by 1; `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`.**
