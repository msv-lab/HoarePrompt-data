To determine the output state, let's analyze the code snippet provided in relation to the initial state.

1. **Initial State Breakdown**:
   - `hidx` is increased by 1 (let's denote the new value of `hidx` as `hidx_new`).
   - `len(h)` is greater than `hidx_new`, meaning there is at least one valid index for `h`.
   - `len(p)` is greater than `pidx`, meaning there is at least one valid index for `p`.
   - `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`.
   - `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx_new]`.
   - `getbacktime` is assigned the value of `max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget))`.
   - `alsotoright` is assigned the value of `max(0, avg - getbacktime)`.
   - `leftime` is assigned the value of `max(0, curpos - leftget)`.
   - `remtime` is assigned the value of `max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2).

2. **Execution of the Code**:
   - The line `furthestright = curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)` computes the value of `furthestright`.
   - `curpos`, `alsotoright`, and `remtime` are all previously assigned values based on the initial state.

Thus, `furthestright` will be assigned a value based on the current values of `curpos`, `alsotoright`, and `remtime`.

3. **Conclusion on Output State**:
   - Based on the computations, we know the value of `furthestright` is now defined, but the specific values of each variable depend on the initial values which are not explicitly provided.
   - Therefore, the output state will reflect that `furthestright` is defined, but we cannot specify its exact value.

Output State: **`hidx` is increased by 1, `len(h)` is greater than `hidx`, `len(p)` is greater than `pidx`, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`, `getbacktime` is assigned the value of max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget)), `alsotoright` is assigned the value of max(0, avg - getbacktime), `leftime` is assigned the value of max(0, curpos - leftget), `remtime` is assigned the value of max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2), `furthestright` is assigned the value of curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)**.
