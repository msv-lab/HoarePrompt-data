The variable `works` is assigned the value `False`. However, the previous state indicates that there is an IndexError occurring due to an out-of-bounds access when attempting to access `p[pidx]`, which means that `curpos` cannot be assigned a value. The assignments do not affect the variables `hidx`, `pidx`, or `curpos`, which remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is 1, `pidx` is equal to the length of `p`, `curpos` cannot be assigned a value due to an IndexError, and `works` is `False`.

Output State: **`hidx` is 1, `pidx` is equal to the length of `p`, `curpos` cannot be assigned a value due to an IndexError, and `works` is False.**
