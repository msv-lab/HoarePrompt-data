The variable `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`. The value of `hidx` has been increased by 1, but the previous value of `hidx` is unknown. Therefore, `curpos` will hold the value from the `h` list at the new index `hidx`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`; `avg` is 10,500,000,000; `remtime` is either 5,250,000,000 or a calculated value; `hidx` is increased by 1; `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`; `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`.**
