According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `pidx`, `len(p)`, and the condition `p[pidx] <= furthestright`. The loop will execute again if both conditions are met: `pidx` must be less than `len(p)` and `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

At the end of the last iteration, we have:
- `hidx` is 2 (this does not affect the loop)
- `len(h)` is greater than 2 (this does not affect the loop)
- `pidx` is less than `len(p)`, and since `pidx` is increased by 1, it means `pidx` is currently 1 less than `len(p)`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
1. `pidx` must still be less than `len(p)`. Given that `pidx` is currently less than `len(p)` and has been incremented by 1, it must be ensured that after this increment, `pidx` is still within bounds. Thus, `len(p)` must be greater than `pidx` (which is now increased).
2. `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`. Since we've established that `pidx` has been incremented, we must ensure that the new value of `p[pidx]` is still valid in relation to `furthestright`.

To summarize, we need to ensure:
- For the loop to execute again, `len(p)` must be greater than `pidx` after the increment, which means `len(p)` should be greater than 3 (since `pidx` was 2 before increment).
- We also need to ensure that `p[pidx]` (the current value at the new `pidx`) is less than or equal to `furthestright`.

State: **`hidx` is 2, `len(h)` is greater than 2, `pidx` is less than `len(p)`, `pidx` is increased by 1, and for the loop to execute again, `len(p)` must be greater than 3 and `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`**
