The value of `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`. Given that `len(h)` is greater than `hidx`, it confirms that `hidx` is a valid index for the list `h`. The values of the other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is increased by 1, `len(h)` is greater than `hidx`, `len(p)` is greater than `pidx`, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, and `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`.

Output State: **`hidx` is increased by 1, `len(h)` is greater than `hidx`, `len(p)` is greater than `pidx`, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`**
