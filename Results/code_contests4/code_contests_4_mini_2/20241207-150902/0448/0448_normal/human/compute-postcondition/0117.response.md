`pidx` is incremented by 1, which means its previous value is increased by 1. The values of other variables such as `hidx`, `len(h)`, and `len(p)` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is increased by 1, `len(h)` is greater than `hidx`, `len(p)` is greater than the original `pidx + 1`, and `pidx` is now the original `pidx + 1`.

Output State: **`hidx` is increased by 1, `len(h)` is greater than `hidx`, `len(p)` is greater than the original `pidx + 1`, and `pidx` is now the original `pidx + 1.**
