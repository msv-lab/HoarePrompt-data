`leftime` is assigned the value of `max(0, curpos - leftget)`. The previous value of `curpos` and `leftget` is not provided, but `leftime` will be either `0` or the result of `curpos - leftget`. The value of `alsotoright` remains unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `alsotoright` is assigned the value of `max(0, avg - getbacktime); leftime` is either `0` or `curpos - leftget`.

Output State: **`alsotoright` is assigned the value of `max(0, avg - getbacktime); `leftime` is either `0` or `curpos - leftget`**
