The value of `pidx` is assigned the value `0`. The previous state of `pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`. After this assignment, `pidx` is now `0`, which means that there are no elements in `p` that fulfill that condition. The other variables are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 0, `works` is True, `ss` is equal to `avg + 1`, `len(h)` is greater than or equal to `hidx`, `len(p)` is greater than or equal to `pidx`, `pidx` is not equal to the length of `p`, `avg` is calculated as (ss + ll) // 2.**
