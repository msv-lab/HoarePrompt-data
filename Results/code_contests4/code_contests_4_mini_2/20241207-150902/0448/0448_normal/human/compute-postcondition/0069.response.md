The variable `works` is assigned the value `False`, which indicates that the conditions were not met during the loop execution. The values of the other variables, `hidx`, `pidx`, and the boolean state of `works`, are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is equal to the length of `h`, `pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to the last calculated `furthestright`, `works` is False (as it has been explicitly set to False), and `pidx` is not equal to the length of `p`.

Output State: **`hidx` is equal to the length of `h`, `pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to the last calculated `furthestright`, `works` is False, `pidx` is not equal to the length of `p`.**
