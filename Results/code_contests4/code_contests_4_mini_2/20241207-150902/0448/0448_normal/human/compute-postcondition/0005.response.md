`avg` is assigned the value of `(ss + ll) // 2`. The initial value of `ss` is 0 and `ll` is 21000000000. Therefore, the calculation for `avg` is `(0 + 21000000000) // 2`, which results in `10500000000`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`hi` is a list of n distinct integers in ascending order; `pi` is a list of m distinct integers in ascending order; `h` is a list of integers obtained from user input; `p` is a list of integers obtained from user input split and mapped to integers; `ss` is 0; `ll` is 21000000000; `avg` is 10500000000**
