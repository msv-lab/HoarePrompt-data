The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`; `avg` is 10,500,000,000; `remtime` is either 5,250,000,000 or a calculated value; `hidx` is increased by 1; `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`; `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`; `works` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
