To determine if the `while` loop can execute, we need to analyze the conditions: `hidx < len(h)` and `pidx < len(p)`.

1. **Current State Analysis**:
   - `hidx` is 0, meaning it has not yet been incremented.
   - `pidx` is also 0, meaning it has not yet been incremented.
   - `works` is True, but this variable does not affect the loop condition.
   - `ss` is equal to `avg + 1`. Since `avg` is calculated as `(ss + ll) // 2`, we know `ss` is at least 1 greater than `avg`.
   
2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - For the loop to execute at least once, both `hidx` must be less than the length of list `h` and `pidx` must be less than the length of list `p`.
   - This means `len(h)` must be greater than 0 (to satisfy `hidx < len(h)`) and `len(p)` must also be greater than 0 (to satisfy `pidx < len(p)`).

3. **Conclusion**:
   - Since `hidx` and `pidx` are both initialized to 0, we need to ensure that both lists `h` and `p` are non-empty for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, the adjusted states needed are that both `len(h)` and `len(p)` must be greater than 0.

State: **`hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 0, `works` is True, `ss` is equal to `avg + 1`, `len(h)` is greater than 0, `len(p)` is greater than 0**
