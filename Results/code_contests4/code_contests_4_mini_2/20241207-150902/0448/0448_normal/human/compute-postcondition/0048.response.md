According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `hidx` and `pidx`. The loop will continue to execute as long as both `hidx` is less than the length of `h` and `pidx` is less than the length of `p`. 

At the end of the last iteration:
- `hidx` has been increased by 1, which means it is now at least 1 greater than its previous value.
- `pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`, which means it could potentially be at its maximum value (i.e., equal to the length of `p`).

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `hidx` needs to be less than the length of `h`, which suggests it needs to be adjusted to be less than that value.
- `pidx` must also be less than the length of `p`, which implies that it should be less than its current value if it is equal to the length of `p`.

Therefore, `hidx` being increased means it needs to be checked against the length of `h`, and `pidx` should be less than the length of `p`.

State: **`pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`, `curpos` remains assigned the value of `h[hidx]`, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]` if `pidx` is less than the length of `p`, otherwise it is undefined, `furthestright` is calculated as `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`, and for the loop to execute again `hidx` needs to be less than the length of `h` and `pidx` needs to be less than the length of `p`**.
