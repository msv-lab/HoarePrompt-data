Postcondition: ***`hidx` is equal to `len(h)`; `pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright` after the last iteration; `works` can either be True or False; `ss` is equal to `avg + 1`; `len(h)` is greater than or equal to `hidx`; `len(p)` is greater than or equal to `pidx`; `pidx` is not equal to the length of `p`; if `works` is True, then `ll` is assigned the value of `avg`, otherwise `works` remains False and `ss` is updated to `avg + 1`.***
