Postcondition: ***`hidx` is equal to the length of `h`, `pidx` is equal to the length of `p`, `ss` is equal to `avg + 1`, `avg` is calculated as `(ss + ll) // 2`, `leftget` is the last accessed value from `p`, `curpos` is the last accessed value from `h`, `leftime` is the maximum value calculated before the last iteration, `remtime` is the maximum value calculated before the last iteration, and `furthestright` is the maximum value calculated based on the last `curpos` and `alsotoright` or `remtime`. If `works` is True, then `ll` is equal to the previous value of `avg`. If `works` is False, then `pidx` is not equal to the length of `p` and `works` remains not True.***
