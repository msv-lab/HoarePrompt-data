To determine whether the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions specified in the loop statement.

The loop will continue executing as long as `pidx` is less than the length of `p` and the value at `p[pidx]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`.

1. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `pidx` has been increased by 1.
2. The condition `pidx < len(p)` needs to be true for the loop to execute again, which means `pidx` must be less than the length of the list `p`.
3. We also need to ensure that `p[pidx]` must still be less than or equal to `furthestright` for the loop to continue.

Since `pidx` has been increased, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `pidx` is still less than `len(p)`. Therefore, `len(p)` needs to be greater than the previous value of `pidx`.

Now, let's summarize the necessary adjustments:

- The condition `pidx < len(p)` implies that `len(p)` must be greater than the new value of `pidx` (which is the previous `pidx + 1`).
  
Thus, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `len(p)` must be greater than `pidx`. Additionally, we need to ensure that `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright` after incrementing `pidx`.

State: **`leftime` is max(0, curpos - leftget); `remtime` is max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2); `furthestright` is curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime); and for the loop to execute again, len(p) must be greater than pidx and p[pidx] must be less than or equal to furthestright**
