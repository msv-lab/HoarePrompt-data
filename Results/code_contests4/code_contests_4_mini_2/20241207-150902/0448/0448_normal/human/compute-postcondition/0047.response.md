The value of `hidx` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `hidx` is unknown. The values of the other variables `pidx`, `curpos`, `leftget`, and `furthestright` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`, `curpos` remains assigned the value of `h[hidx]`, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]` if `pidx` is less than the length of `p`, otherwise it is undefined, `furthestright` is calculated as `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`, and `hidx` is increased by 1.
