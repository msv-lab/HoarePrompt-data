`hidx` is incremented by 1, so its new value will be `3`. The values of `len(h)` and `pidx` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is 2, `len(h)` is greater than 2, `pidx` is equal to the total count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`, and `pidx` is no longer less than `len(p)`; now `hidx` is 3. 

Output State: **`hidx` is 3, `len(h)` is greater than 2, `pidx` is equal to the total count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`, and `pidx` is no longer less than `len(p)`**.
