The variable `hidx` is assigned the value of `0`. This variable is initialized and does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `hi` is a list of n distinct integers in ascending order; `pi` is a list of m distinct integers in ascending order; `h` is a list of integers obtained from user input; `p` is a list of integers obtained from user input split and mapped to integers; `ss` is 0; `ll` is 21000000000; `avg` is 10500000000; `works` is True; `hidx` is 0.
