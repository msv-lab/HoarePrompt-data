The value of `works` is assigned `False`, changing its previous value of `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 0, `works` is False, `ss` is equal to `avg + 1`, `len(h)` is greater than 0, `len(p)` is greater than 0, `leftget` is equal to p[pidx], `curpos` is equal to h[0], and the difference between `curpos` and `leftget` is greater than `avg`.

Output State: **`hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 0, `works` is False, `ss` is equal to `avg + 1`, `len(h)` is greater than 0, `len(p)` is greater than 0, `leftget` is equal to p[pidx], `curpos` is equal to h[0], and the difference between `curpos` and `leftget` is greater than `avg`.**
