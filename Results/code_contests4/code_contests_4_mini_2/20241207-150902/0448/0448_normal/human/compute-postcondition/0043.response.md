The value of `pidx` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `pidx` is unknown. The other variables `curpos`, `leftget`, and `furthestright` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `furthestright` is calculated as `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`; `pidx` is increased by 1.
