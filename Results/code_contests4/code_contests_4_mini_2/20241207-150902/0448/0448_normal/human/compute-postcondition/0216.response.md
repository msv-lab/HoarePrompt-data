The variable `ll` is assigned the value of `avg`. The value of `avg` has been calculated as `(ss + ll) // 2`. Since `ll` is being updated with the current value of `avg`, the state of `avg` will remain unchanged, but `ll` will now hold that value. Other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is equal to the length of `h`, `pidx` is equal to the length of `p`, `works` is True, `ss` is equal to `avg + 1`, `avg` is calculated as `(ss + ll) // 2`, `leftget` is the last accessed value from `p`, `curpos` is the last accessed value from `h`, `leftime` is the maximum value calculated before the last iteration, `remtime` is the maximum value calculated before the last iteration, `furthestright` is the maximum value calculated based on the last `curpos` and `alsotoright` or `remtime`, `ll` is now equal to the previous value of `avg`.

Output State: **`hidx` is equal to the length of `h`, `pidx` is equal to the length of `p`, `works` is True, `ss` is equal to `avg + 1`, `avg` is calculated as `(ss + ll) // 2`, `leftget` is the last accessed value from `p`, `curpos` is the last accessed value from `h`, `leftime` is the maximum value calculated before the last iteration, `remtime` is the maximum value calculated before the last iteration, `furthestright` is the maximum value calculated based on the last `curpos` and `alsotoright` or `remtime`, `ll` is now equal to the previous value of `avg`.**
