The value of `pidx` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `pidx` was 3, so after execution, `pidx` becomes 4. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is 2, `len(h)` is greater than 2, `pidx` is 4, and for the loop to execute again, `len(p)` must be greater than 3 and `p[3]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

Output State: **`hidx` is 2, `len(h)` is greater than 2, `pidx` is 4, and for the loop to execute again, `len(p)` must be greater than 3 and `p[3]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.**
