To determine if the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions of the loop:

1. The loop continues while `pidx` is less than `len(p)` and `p[pidx]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`.

From the provided state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `hidx` is 1 (not relevant to the loop condition)
- `pidx` is incremented by 1 (so its new value is `pidx + 1`)
- `curpos` cannot be assigned a value due to an IndexError (not relevant to the loop condition)
- `alsotoright` is assigned the value max(0, avg - getbacktime) (not relevant to the loop condition)
- `leftime` cannot be assigned a value due to an IndexError (not relevant to the loop condition)
- `remtime` cannot be calculated (not relevant to the loop condition)
- `furthestright` can be calculated (meaning it has a valid value for comparison)

To ensure that the loop can execute again, we need to ensure:
- `pidx + 1 < len(p)` (which means `pidx` must be less than `len(p) - 1`)
- `p[pidx + 1] <= furthestright` (the next element in `p` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`)

Since `pidx` has been incremented by 1, we need to adjust the current state so that:
- `len(p)` must be greater than `pidx + 1` (which is `pidx + 1 < len(p)`)
- `furthestright` must be greater than or equal to `p[pidx + 1]`

Thus, the state adjustments needed are:
- For the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that `len(p)` is greater than `pidx + 1` and `furthestright` is greater than or equal to `p[pidx + 1]`.

State: **`hidx` is 1, `pidx` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute again `len(p)` is greater than `pidx + 1` and `furthestright` is greater than or equal to `p[pidx + 1]**
