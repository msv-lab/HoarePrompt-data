The variable `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`. Given that `hidx` is 2 and `len(h)` is greater than 2, `h[hidx]` will access the third element of the list `h`. The values of the other variables such as `len(h)`, `pidx`, and `leftget` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is 2, `len(h)` is greater than 2, `pidx` is less than `len(p)`, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, and `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[2]`.

Output State: **`hidx` is 2, `len(h)` is greater than 2, `pidx` is less than `len(p)`, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[2]`**.
