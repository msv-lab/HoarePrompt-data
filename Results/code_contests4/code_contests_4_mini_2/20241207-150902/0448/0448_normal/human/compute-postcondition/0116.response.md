To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions specified in the `while` statement.

The loop will continue as long as both conditions in the `while` statement are satisfied:
1. `pidx < len(p)`
2. `p[pidx] <= furthestright`

Given the states at the end of the previous iteration:
- `hidx` has been increased by 1 (this is not relevant to the loop condition).
- `len(h)` is greater than `hidx` (this is also not relevant to the loop condition).
- `len(p)` is greater than `pidx` (this means the first condition is satisfied).
- For the loop to execute again, `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.
- `pidx` has been increased by 1 (meaning `pidx` is now one greater than its previous value).

Now, considering that `pidx` has been increased by 1, for the loop to execute again:
- The first condition `pidx < len(p)` must still hold true. Since we only know `len(p)` is greater than the previous value of `pidx`, we cannot conclude that it will still hold true after incrementing `pidx` by 1. Thus, we need to ensure that `len(p)` is greater than or equal to the incremented `pidx`.
- The second condition `p[pidx] <= furthestright` must also hold true for the current value of `pidx`.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust the states as follows:
- For the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `len(p)` must be greater than `pidx` after the increment (which means `len(p)` must be greater than the original `pidx + 1`).
- Additionally, we need to verify that the newly incremented `p[pidx]` must still be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:
State: **`hidx` is increased by 1, `len(h)` is greater than `hidx`, `len(p)` is greater than the original `pidx + 1`, and for the loop to execute again `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`**.
