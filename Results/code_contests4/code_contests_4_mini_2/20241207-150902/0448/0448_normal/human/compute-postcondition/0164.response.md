To analyze the provided code snippet, we need to determine the values of `curpos`, `alsotoright`, and `remtime` based on the initial state.

1. **Initial Variables**:
   - `hidx` is 0
   - `pidx` is 0
   - `works` is False
   - `ss` is `avg + 1`
   - `avg` is calculated as `(ss + ll) // 2`
   - `leftget` is `p[0]`
   - `curpos` is `h[0]`
   - `leftime` is calculated as `max(0, curpos - leftget)`
   - `remtime` is calculated as `max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2)`

2. **Calculating `furthestright`**:
   - `furthestright` is calculated as `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`.
   - Since `alsotoright` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its value.
   - `curpos` is `h[0]`, which is also not defined in the initial state.
   - `remtime` is calculated but depends on `avg` and `leftime`, which depend on `ss`, `ll`, and `leftget`, all of which are also not defined in the initial state.

Since we lack specific values for `curpos`, `alsotoright`, and `remtime`, we cannot determine `furthestright`. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `furthestright` cannot be calculated.

Output State: **`hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 0, `works` is False, `ss` is equal to `avg + 1`, `avg` is calculated as `(ss + ll) // 2`, `leftget` is `p[0]`, `curpos` is `h[0]`, `leftime` is calculated as `max(0, curpos - leftget)`, `remtime` is calculated as `max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2); furthestright cannot be calculated due to undefined variables.**
