The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `hi` and `pi`. `hi` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order, where `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 100000` and each element satisfies `1 ≤ hi[i] ≤ 10^10`. `pi` is a list of `m` distinct integers in ascending order, where `m` is an integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100000` and each element satisfies `1 ≤ pi[j] ≤ 10^10`. The function processes these lists and returns a specific output based on their contents. 

However, the output details are not provided in the prompt. To summarize, the functionality of the function `func_1` is as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `hi` of `n` distinct integers and a list `pi` of `m` distinct integers, both in ascending order, and processes these lists based on their values.**
