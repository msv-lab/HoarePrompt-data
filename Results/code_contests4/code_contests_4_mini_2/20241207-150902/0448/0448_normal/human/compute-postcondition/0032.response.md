The line `works = False` assigns the value `False` to the variable `works`. This does not affect any other variables in the initial state, which remain unchanged.

Output State: **`pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`; `avg` is 10,500,000,000; `remtime` is either 5,250,000,000 or a calculated value; `hidx` is increased by 1; `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`; `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`; `works` is False.**
