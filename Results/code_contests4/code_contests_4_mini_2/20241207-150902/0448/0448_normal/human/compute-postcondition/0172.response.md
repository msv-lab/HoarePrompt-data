Output State: **`hidx` is 1, `pidx` is equal to the length of `p`, `works` is False, `ss` is equal to `avg + 1`, `avg` is calculated as `(ss + ll) // 2`, `leftget` is `p[0]`, `curpos` is `h[0]`, `leftime` is calculated as `max(0, curpos - leftget)`, `remtime` is calculated as `max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2); furthestright must be defined and greater than or equal to p[pidx - 1] if pidx is less than or equal to len(p)`**
