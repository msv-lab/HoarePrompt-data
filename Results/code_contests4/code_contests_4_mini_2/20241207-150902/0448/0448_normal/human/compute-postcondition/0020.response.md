To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state of the variables.

Initial State: 
- `avg` is 10,500,000,000
- `remtime` is either 5,250,000,000 or a value based on the expression `max(0, (10,500,000,000 - leftime) // 2)`

The code snippet is:
```
furthestright = curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)
```

1. **Variable Analysis**:
   - `curpos`, `alsotoright`, and `furthestright` are not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine their values.
   - `remtime` can either be 5,250,000,000 or a value based on another expression, which also cannot be evaluated without knowing `leftime`.

2. **Calculation**:
   - The expression `max(alsotoright, remtime)` will choose the larger of `alsotoright` and `remtime`. Since we do not have specific values for `alsotoright` and `curpos`, we cannot compute `furthestright`.

Therefore, the output state will mention the unchanged values of `avg` and `remtime`, and the inability to compute `furthestright` due to undefined variables.

Output State: **`avg` is 10,500,000,000; `remtime` is either 5,250,000,000 or a value based on max(0, (10,500,000,000 - leftime) // 2); `furthestright` cannot be computed as `curpos` and `alsotoright` are undefined.**
