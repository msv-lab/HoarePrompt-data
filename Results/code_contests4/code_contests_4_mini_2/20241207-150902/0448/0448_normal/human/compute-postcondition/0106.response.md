Postcondition: ***`hidx` is increased by 1, `len(h)` is greater than `hidx`, `len(p)` is greater than `pidx`, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, and `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`. If `curpos - leftget` is greater than `avg`, then `works` is set to False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
