To determine if the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition specified in the loop statement: `ss < ll`.

1. **Current State**: 
   - `hidx` is equal to `len(h)`
   - `pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`
   - `works` can either be True or False
   - `ss` is equal to `avg + 1`
   - `len(h)` is greater than or equal to `hidx`
   - `len(p)` is greater than or equal to `pidx`
   - `pidx` is not equal to the length of `p`
   - If `works` is True, then `ll` is assigned the value of `avg`, otherwise `works` remains False and `ss` is updated to `avg + 1`.

2. **Loop Condition Analysis**: 
   - The loop condition checks if `ss < ll`.
   - Currently, `ss` is `avg + 1`, and depending on the value of `works`, `ll` could be `avg` (if `works` is True) or it remains undefined from the provided information (if `works` is False).

3. **Determining Adjustments**: 
   - If `works` is True, then `ss` (`avg + 1`) is greater than `ll` (`avg`), which means the loop cannot execute again. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `works` is False and `ss` is updated to `avg + 1` (which is already the case).
   - If `works` is False, `ll` is not defined from the information provided, but for the loop to run one more time, `ss` (which equals `avg + 1`) must still be less than `ll`. Since we cannot ascertain the value of `ll`, we cannot make specific adjustments.

4. **Conclusion**: 
   - Given the ambiguity surrounding `ll`, the only clear adjustment needed is to ensure `works` is False so that the loop condition could potentially allow the loop to execute again depending on the value of `ll`.

State: **`hidx` is equal to `len(h)`, `pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`, `works` is False, `ss` is equal to `avg + 1`, `len(h)` is greater than or equal to `hidx`, `len(p)` is greater than or equal to `pidx`, `pidx` is not equal to the length of `p`**
