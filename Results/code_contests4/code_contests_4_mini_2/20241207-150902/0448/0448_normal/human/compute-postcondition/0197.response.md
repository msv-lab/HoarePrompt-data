Postcondition: ***`hidx` is 2, `len(h)` is greater than 2, `pidx` is less than `len(p)`, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[2]`. If `curpos - leftget` is greater than `avg`, then `works` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
