To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute, we need to analyze the loop condition: `pidx < len(p) and p[pidx] <= furthestright`.

1. The loop will execute if both conditions are satisfied:
   - `pidx < len(p)`: This means that `pidx` must be less than the length of the list `p`. If `pidx` is already equal to or greater than `len(p)`, then this condition will not be satisfied, and the loop will not execute.
   - `p[pidx] <= furthestright`: This requires that the element at index `pidx` in list `p` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`. 

2. The values right before the loop are:
   - `leftime` is `max(0, curpos - leftget)`, which cannot be negative.
   - `remtime` is `max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2)`, which also cannot be negative.
   - `furthestright` is `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`, which depends on the values of `curpos`, `alsotoright`, and `remtime`.

3. We need to ensure that:
   - `pidx` is less than `len(p)`, which may require adjusting the initial value of `pidx` if it is equal to or greater than `len(p)`.
   - Additionally, we need to ensure that `p[pidx] <= furthestright`. This requires checking the value of `furthestright` and the current value of `p[pidx]`.

To summarize the adjustments needed:
- Ensure `pidx` is less than `len(p)`.
- Ensure that `p[pidx]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`.

Given that we do not have specific values for `pidx`, `len(p)`, or `p`, we can only make general statements about what needs to be true for the loop to execute.

State: **`leftime` is max(0, curpos - leftget); `remtime` is max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2); `furthestright` is curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime); for the loop to execute the first time, `pidx` must be less than len(p) and p[pidx] must be less than or equal to furthestright**.
