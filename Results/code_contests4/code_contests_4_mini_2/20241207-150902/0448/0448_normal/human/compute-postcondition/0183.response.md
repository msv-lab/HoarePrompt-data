The value of `furthestright` is assigned the expression `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`. However, `curpos` cannot be assigned a value due to an `IndexError`, and `remtime` cannot be calculated. Therefore, the calculation for `furthestright` cannot be completed due to the presence of these errors. 

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is 1, `pidx` is equal to the length of `p`, `curpos` cannot be assigned a value due to an IndexError; `alsotoright` is assigned the value max(0, avg - getbacktime); `leftime` cannot be assigned a value due to an IndexError; `remtime` cannot be calculated; `furthestright` cannot be calculated due to IndexError.

Output State: **`hidx` is 1, `pidx` is equal to the length of `p`, `curpos` cannot be assigned a value due to an IndexError; `alsotoright` is assigned the value max(0, avg - getbacktime); `leftime` cannot be assigned a value due to an IndexError; `remtime` cannot be calculated; `furthestright` cannot be calculated due to IndexError.**
