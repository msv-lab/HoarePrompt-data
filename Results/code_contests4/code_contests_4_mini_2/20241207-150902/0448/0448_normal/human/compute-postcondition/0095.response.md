To determine whether the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition specified in the `while` statement: `pidx < len(p) and p[pidx] <= furthestright`. 

1. The variable `pidx` is currently 1. For the loop to continue, this must be less than `len(p)`. Since we know `len(p)` is greater than 0, `pidx` being 1 is acceptable as long as `len(p)` is greater than 1.
  
2. The second part of the condition, `p[pidx] <= furthestright`, must also be satisfied. We know `furthestright` is equal to `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`. 

3. Given that `works` is `False`, it indicates that some condition related to the `works` variable is not met, but it does not directly influence the loop continuation condition.

4. `leftget` is equal to `p[pidx]` (which is `p[1]`), and this must be less than or equal to `furthestright` for the loop to execute again.

Now, since `p[pidx]` is currently `p[1]` and we need it to be less than or equal to `furthestright`, we can conclude that to allow the loop to execute one more time, `p[1]` should be adjusted to ensure it satisfies the condition with `furthestright`.

Thus, the necessary adjustment for the loop to execute one more time requires:
- `p[1]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

State: **`hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 1, `works` is False, `ss` is equal to `avg + 1`, `len(h)` is greater than 0, `len(p)` is greater than 0, `leftget` is equal to `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is equal to `h[0]`, `getbacktime` is equal to max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget)), `alsotoright` is max(0, avg - getbacktime), `leftime` is max(0, curpos - leftget), `remtime` is max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2), `furthestright` is equal to curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime), and for the loop to execute again `p[1]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.**
