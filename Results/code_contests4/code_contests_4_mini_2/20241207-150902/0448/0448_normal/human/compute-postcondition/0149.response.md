The variable `avg` is assigned the value of the integer division of `(ss + ll)` by `2`. The value of `ss` is `avg + 1`, but the specific value of `ll` is not provided in the initial state. Given that `avg` is being calculated, it is dependent on the values of `ss` and `ll`. 

Since `ss` is defined as `avg + 1`, we cannot determine a specific numerical output for `avg` without knowing the value of `ll`. Therefore, we state that `avg` is calculated from the values of `ss` and `ll`.

Output State: **`hidx` is equal to `len(h)`, `pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`, `works` is False, `ss` is equal to `avg + 1`, `len(h)` is greater than or equal to `hidx`, `len(p)` is greater than or equal to `pidx`, `pidx` is not equal to the length of `p`; `avg` is calculated as (ss + ll) // 2.**
