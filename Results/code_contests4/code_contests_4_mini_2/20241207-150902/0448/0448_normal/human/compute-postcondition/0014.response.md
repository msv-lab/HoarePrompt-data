The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `hi` is a list of n distinct integers in ascending order; `pi` is a list of m distinct integers in ascending order; `h` is a list of integers obtained from user input; `p` is a list of integers obtained from user input split and mapped to integers; `ss` is 0; `ll` is 21000000000; `avg` is 10500000000; `works` is False; `hidx` is 0; `pidx` is 0; `leftget` is the first element of list `p`; `curpos` is the first element of list `h`; and the difference between `curpos` and `leftget` is greater than `avg` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
