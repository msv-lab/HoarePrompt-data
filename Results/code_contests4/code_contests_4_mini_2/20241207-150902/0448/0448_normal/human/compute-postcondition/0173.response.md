To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the `while` loop condition:

```
while hidx < len(h) and pidx < len(p):
```

The loop will execute again if both conditions are true:

1. `hidx < len(h)`
2. `pidx < len(p)`

Now let's review the current state at the end of the previous iteration:

- `hidx` is 1
- `pidx` is equal to the length of `p`
- `works` is False
- `ss` is equal to `avg + 1`
- `avg` is calculated as `(ss + ll) // 2`
- `leftget` is `p[0]`
- `curpos` is `h[0]`
- `leftime` is calculated as `max(0, curpos - leftget)`
- `remtime` is calculated as `max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2)`
- `furthestright` must be defined and greater than or equal to `p[pidx - 1]` if `pidx` is less than or equal to `len(p)`

Given that `pidx` is equal to the length of `p`, it means `pidx < len(p)` is false. Therefore, the loop cannot execute one more time unless `pidx` is adjusted to be less than the length of `p`. 

To allow the loop to execute again, we can adjust the state of `pidx` to be less than the length of `p`. This means we need to ensure `pidx` is less than `len(p)`.

State: **`hidx` is 1, `pidx` is equal to the length of `p` and for the loop to execute again `pidx` must be less than the length of `p`**
