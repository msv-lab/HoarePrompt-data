The variable `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`. Since `hidx` has been increased by 1 and `len(h)` is greater than `hidx`, `h[hidx]` refers to a valid index in the list `h`. Therefore, `curpos` takes the value of the element at that index in `h`. The previous values of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`hidx` is increased by 1; `len(h)` is greater than `hidx`; `len(p)` is greater than or equal to `pidx`; `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]; curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]**.
