The value of `pidx` is assigned 0. This means that `pidx` is explicitly reset to 0, but no other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state remains consistent with the previous values of the other variables.

Output State: **`hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 0, `works` is True, `ss` is equal to `avg + 1`, and `avg` is calculated as `(ss + ll) // 2`**
