To determine the output state after executing the given code snippet, we need to analyze the impact of the assignment:

1. `avg` is calculated as `(ss + ll) // 2`.
2. `getbacktime` is calculated as `max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget))`.

Given these calculations, we can now calculate `alsotoright`:

3. `alsotoright` is assigned the value `max(0, avg - getbacktime)`.

Since `avg` is derived from `ss` and `ll`, and `getbacktime` depends on `curpos` and `leftget`, we need to remember that none of the initial values of `ss`, `ll`, `curpos`, or `leftget` are explicitly provided, but they are defined based on the initial state.

Since `alsotoright` is defined in terms of `avg` and `getbacktime`, the exact value cannot be determined without specific values for `ss`, `ll`, `curpos`, and `leftget`. However, we can assert that `alsotoright` will be computed based on the maximum of either 0 or the difference between `avg` and `getbacktime`.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `alsotoright` is now defined, but without specific values for the dependent variables, we cannot state its exact value.

Output State: **`hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 0, `works` is False, `ss` is equal to `avg + 1`, `len(h)` is greater than or equal to `hidx`, `len(p)` is greater than or equal to `pidx`, `pidx` is not equal to the length of `p`, `avg` is calculated as (ss + ll) // 2, `leftget` is p[0], `curpos` is h[0], `getbacktime` is calculated as max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget)), `alsotoright` is calculated as max(0, avg - getbacktime)**.
