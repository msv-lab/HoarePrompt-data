According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `pidx`, `len(p)`, and the condition `p[pidx] <= furthestright`. For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions must be satisfied: `pidx` must be less than `len(p)` and `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `pidx` is 2, `len(h)` is greater than 2, and `pidx` has been increased by 1. This means that `pidx` is now 3. Since we need `pidx` to be less than `len(p)`, `len(p)` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again. Additionally, we need to ensure that `p[pidx]` (which is now `p[3]`) must also be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute again, we need to adjust the states as follows:
- `len(p)` must be greater than 3, so it can satisfy the condition `pidx < len(p)`.
- `p[3]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`, ensuring the second condition is satisfied.

State: **`hidx` is 2, `len(h)` is greater than 2, `pidx` is 3, for the loop to execute again `len(p)` must be greater than 3 and `p[3]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`**.
