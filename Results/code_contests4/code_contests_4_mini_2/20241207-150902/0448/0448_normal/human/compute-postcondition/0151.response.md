The value of `hidx` is assigned to 0. This indicates that `hidx` is now explicitly set to 0, regardless of its previous value. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is 0, `pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`, `works` is True, `ss` is equal to `avg + 1`, `len(h)` is greater than or equal to `hidx`, `len(p)` is greater than or equal to `pidx`, `pidx` is not equal to the length of `p`; `avg` is calculated as (ss + ll) // 2.

Output State: **`hidx` is 0, `pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`, `works` is True, `ss` is equal to `avg + 1`, `len(h)` is greater than or equal to `hidx`, `len(p)` is greater than or equal to `pidx`, `pidx` is not equal to the length of `p`; `avg` is calculated as (ss + ll) // 2.**
