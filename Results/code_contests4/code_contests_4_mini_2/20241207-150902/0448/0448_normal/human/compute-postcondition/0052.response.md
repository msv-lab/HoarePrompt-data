The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`; `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`; `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]` if `pidx` is less than the length of `p`, otherwise it is undefined; `furthestright` is calculated as `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`; `works` is set to False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
