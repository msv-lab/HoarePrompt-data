To determine the output state after executing the given code snippet, we need to analyze the initial state and the impact of the code line provided.

Given the initial state:
- `hidx` is 2
- `len(h)` is greater than 2
- `pidx` is less than `len(p)`
- `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`
- `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[2]`
- `getbacktime` is computed as `max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget))`
- `alsotoright` is assigned the value of `max(0, avg - getbacktime)`
- `leftime` is assigned the value of `max(0, curpos - leftget)`
- `remtime` is assigned the value of `max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2)`

Now, we focus on the code line:
```
furthestright = curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)
```

This line calculates `furthestright` by adding `curpos` to the maximum of `alsotoright` and `remtime`. The values of `curpos`, `alsotoright`, and `remtime` have been defined in the initial state, but we don't have their specific values. 

Thus, based on the execution:
- `furthestright` is assigned a value that depends on the values of `curpos`, `alsotoright`, and `remtime`.

The output state reflects the calculations made and the assignment of `furthestright`. Since we cannot determine the exact numerical values from the initial state and the provided code snippet, we summarize the outcomes based on the relationships established.

Output State: **`hidx` is 2, `len(h)` is greater than 2, `pidx` is less than `len(p)`, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[2]`, `getbacktime` is computed as `max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget))`, `alsotoright` is assigned the value of `max(0, avg - getbacktime)`, `leftime` is assigned the value of `max(0, curpos - leftget)`, `remtime` is assigned the value of `max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2)`, `furthestright` is assigned the value of `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`**.
