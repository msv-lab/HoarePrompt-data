`pidx` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value from 1 to 2. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 2, `works` is False, `ss` is equal to `avg + 1`, `avg` is calculated as `(ss + ll) // 2`, `leftget` is `p[0]`, `curpos` is `h[0]`, `leftime` is calculated as `max(0, curpos - leftget)`, `remtime` is calculated as `max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2); furthestright must be defined and greater than or equal to p[1]`.
