Output State: **`hidx` is increased by 1, `pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`, `works` is False, `ss` is equal to `avg + 1`, `len(h)` is greater than 0, `len(p)` is greater than or equal to `pidx`, `leftget` is equal to `p[pidx]` if `pidx` is less than `len(p)`, otherwise it is out of bounds, `curpos` is equal to `h[0]`, `getbacktime` is equal to max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget)), `alsotoright` is max(0, avg - getbacktime), `leftime` is max(0, curpos - leftget), `remtime` is max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2), `furthestright` is equal to curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)**
