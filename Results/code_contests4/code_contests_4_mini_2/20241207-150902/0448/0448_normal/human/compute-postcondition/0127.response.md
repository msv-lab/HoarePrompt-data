Output State: **`hidx` is increased by 1; `len(h)` is greater than `hidx`; `len(p)` is greater than or equal to `pidx`; `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`; `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`; if `curpos - leftget` is greater than `avg`, then `works` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; `getbacktime` is assigned the value of max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget)); `alsotoright` is assigned the value max(0, avg - getbacktime)**
