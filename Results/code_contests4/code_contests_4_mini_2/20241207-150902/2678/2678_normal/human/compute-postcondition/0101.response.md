Postcondition: ***`H` is non-negative, `W` is non-negative, and `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `grid[r][c]`. If the coordinates `(r, c)` are valid and `grid[r][c]` is `'.'`, then `grid[r][c]` is updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`, and the coordinate pair `[r, c]` is added to `qq`, which contains remaining coordinate pairs in `q`. The variable `qq` continues to have at least 1 coordinate pair, and `r` and `c` remain within the bounds of the grid dimensions.***
