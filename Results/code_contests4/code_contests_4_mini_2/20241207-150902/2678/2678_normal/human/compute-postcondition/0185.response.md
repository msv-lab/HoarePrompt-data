Output State: **`q` contains valid coordinates with at least 1 coordinate, `qq` is updated to contain the new coordinate [r, c], `i` and `j` are the first coordinates from `q`, `r` is `i - 1`, `c` is `j`, `grid[r][c]` is assigned the value `grid[i][j] + 1`, and `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between its previous state and `grid[r][c]`.**
