The code `qq.append([r, c])` appends the list containing the values of `r` and `c` to the list `qq`. The values of `H`, `W`, and `maxx` remain unchanged, while the list `qq` is modified by adding a new element, which is the list `[r, c]`. Therefore, the output state reflects the new state of `qq` with the appended values.

Output State: **`H` is non-negative, `W` is non-negative, `grid[r][c]` is now a positive integer, `maxx` is the maximum of its previous value and the new value of `grid[r][c]`, and `qq` now includes the new element `[r, c]`.**
