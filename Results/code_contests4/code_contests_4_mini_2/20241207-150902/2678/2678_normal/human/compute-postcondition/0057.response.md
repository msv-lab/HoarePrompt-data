To determine what adjustments need to be made for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to analyze the condition of the loop and the state of the variables involved.

The loop condition is `while q:`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `q` is not empty. 

Right before the loop, we have the following states:
- `H` is greater than or equal to 0
- `W` is greater than or equal to 0
- `q` contains the coordinates `[i, j]` for each cell in `grid` that had a value of '#', and all such cells in `grid` have been set to 0
- `maxx` is 0

The crucial point here is the state of `q`. For the loop to execute at least once, `q` must contain at least one coordinate. 

Since the problem states that `q` contains the coordinates for cells that had a value of '#', and it doesn't specify the state of `q`, we need to ensure that `q` is not empty. Therefore, we can infer that `q` should contain at least one coordinate before the loop begins.

Thus, for the loop to execute the first time, we need to ensure that `q` is not empty.

State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is greater than or equal to 0, for the loop to execute the first time `q` is not empty**
