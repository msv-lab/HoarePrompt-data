According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the contents of the variable `q`. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are coordinates left in `q`. At the end of the last iteration, the state indicates that `H` and `W` are non-negative integers, `maxx` has been updated during the loop, and `grid` has been updated with the values of `grid[i][j] + 1`. The variable `qq` contains the coordinates that were appended during the iterations where the conditions were met.

For the loop to execute one more time, `q` must contain at least one more coordinate pair. If the last executed coordinate pair was `(i, j)`, then the next coordinate pair should be the next entry in `q`, which would be `(i', j')`.

State: **`H` is non-negative, `W` is non-negative, `maxx` is the maximum value updated during the loop, `grid` is updated with values of `grid[i][j] + 1` at valid coordinates, for the loop to execute again `q` must contain at least one more coordinate pair `(i', j')`**
