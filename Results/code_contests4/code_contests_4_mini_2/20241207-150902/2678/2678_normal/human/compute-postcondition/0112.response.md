Output State: **`H` and `W` are non-negative, `maxx` is the maximum value of `grid[i][j] + 1` for all valid coordinates updated during the loop execution, `grid` is updated at all valid coordinates where `grid[r][c]` was `'.'`, `qq` contains the remaining coordinate pairs that were added during the loop, and all coordinate pairs `(r, c)` are valid within the bounds of the grid dimensions.**
