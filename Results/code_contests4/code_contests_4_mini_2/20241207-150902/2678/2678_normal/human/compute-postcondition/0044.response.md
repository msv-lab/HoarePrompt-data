The value at `grid[i][j]` is assigned to 0. Here, `i` is 2 and `j` is 0, so `grid[2][0]` is set to 0. The other variables (`H`, `W`, `j`, and `q`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `H` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `W` is greater than 0 for the first execution and greater than 1 for the second execution, `j` is 0, and `q` contains the list [[2, 0]]; `grid[2][0]` is now 0.
