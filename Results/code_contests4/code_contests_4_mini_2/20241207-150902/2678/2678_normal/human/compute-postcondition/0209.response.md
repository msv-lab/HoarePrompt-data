Postcondition: ***`q` contains valid coordinates; `qq` includes the updated coordinates `[i + 1, j]` and now also contains `[r, c]`. If `0 <= r < H` and `0 <= c < W` and `grid[r][c]` is '.', then `grid[r][c]` is set to `grid[i][j] + 1`, and `maxx` is updated to the maximum between its previous value and `grid[i][j] + 1`.***
