The value of `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the value of `grid[r][c]`. The previous value of `grid[r][c]` is `grid[i][j] + 1`, which is a non-negative integer. Therefore, the output state reflects that `maxx` has been compared with this new value.

Output State: **`H` and `W` are non-negative integers; `maxx` is updated to max(maxx, grid[r][c]), where grid[r][c] is updated to grid[i][j] + 1.**
