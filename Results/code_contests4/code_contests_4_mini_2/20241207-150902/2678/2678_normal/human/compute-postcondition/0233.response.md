The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `grid`. `grid` is a 2D list of characters where each character is either '#' (representing a black square) or '.' (representing a white square), and the dimensions of the grid are such that 1 <= len(grid) <= 1000 and 1 <= len(grid[0]) <= 1000. The grid contains at least one black square. After executing the function body, it returns the maximum distance `maxx` updated during the loop execution based on all valid coordinate pairs in the grid. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a 2D list `grid` of characters and return the maximum distance calculated from valid coordinate pairs within the grid. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter grid, which is a 2D list of characters, and returns the maximum distance calculated from valid coordinate pairs in the grid.**
