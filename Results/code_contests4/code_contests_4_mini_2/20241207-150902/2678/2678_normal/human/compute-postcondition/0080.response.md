The value of `grid[r][c]` is assigned the value of `grid[i][j] + 1`. Since `grid[i][j]` is a value from the grid, and `grid[r][c]` is updated with this value incremented by 1, the value of `grid[r][c]` becomes greater than the previous value of `grid[r][c]` (which was '.'), and is now a non-negative integer. Other variables do not change their values. Therefore, the output state is: `H` is non-negative, `W` is non-negative, `maxx` is the maximum value updated during the loop, `grid` is updated with values of `grid[i][j] + 1` at valid coordinates, `q` contains at least one more coordinate pair `(i', j')`, `r` is `i + 1`, `c` is `j`, and `grid[r][c]` is now equal to `grid[i][j] + 1`.
