Postcondition: ***`q` contains valid coordinates, `(i, j)` is defined as the next coordinate in `q`, and `(r, c)` is defined as the next valid direction based on `(i, j)`. If the condition `0 <= r < H and 0 <= c < W and (grid[r][c] == '.')` is satisfied, then `grid[r][c]` is updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`, `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `grid[r][c]`, and `qq` now contains the appended coordinate `[r, c]`. If the condition is not satisfied, no changes are made to `grid`, `maxx`, or `qq`.***
