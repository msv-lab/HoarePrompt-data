Postcondition: ***`q` contains valid coordinates, and there is at least one valid coordinate remaining for the loop to execute a second time. `(i, j)` is defined as the next coordinate in `q`, `(r, c)` is defined as the next valid direction based on `(i, j)`, and both `r` and `c` are within the bounds of the grid (0 <= r < H and 0 <= c < W), and the value at `grid[r][c]` is '.', indicating it is a valid position.***
