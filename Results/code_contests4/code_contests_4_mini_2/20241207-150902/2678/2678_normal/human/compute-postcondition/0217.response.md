Postcondition: ***`q` contains valid coordinates, `qq` includes all valid updated coordinates. If `r` and `c` are within bounds and the cell `grid[r][c]` is empty ('.'), then `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `grid[r][c]`, and `grid[r][c]` is updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`, while `qq` now includes the coordinates [r, c].***
