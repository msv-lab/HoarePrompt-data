The variable `qq` is initialized as an empty list. The value of `q` remains unchanged and is not affected by this initialization. Since `q` must not be empty for the loop to execute again, we can conclude that the loop's execution condition is intact. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` now contains all valid coordinates added during the loop execution; `qq` is an empty list.

Output State: **`q` now contains all valid coordinates added during the loop execution; `qq` is an empty list.**
