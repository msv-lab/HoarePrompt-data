According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of coordinates surrounding the current position `(i, j)`. For the loop to execute one more time, it will take the next coordinate pair from the list `[[i + 1, j], [i - 1, j], [i, j + 1], [i, j - 1]]`. The next coordinate pair will be `[i, j + 1]`, following the order of the list.

At the end of the last iteration, we are given that `grid[r][c]` is equal to '.' for the coordinate being processed, and `maxx` has been updated based on the value of `grid[i][j] + 1`. We also know `r` and `c` are within the bounds of the grid, specifically `0 <= r < H` and `0 <= c < W`.

Now, we need to determine the next values for `r` and `c` based on the next iteration of the loop. The next coordinates `(r, c)` will change according to the next value in the list.

As the next pair to be processed in the loop will be `[i, j + 1]`, we can adjust the states accordingly. 

State: **`H` and `W` are non-negative integers. If `0 <= r < H` and `0 <= c < W` and `grid[r][c]` is equal to '.', then `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `grid[i][j] + 1`, and `qq` now contains `[r, c]`, for the loop to execute a second time `(r, c)` will be `[i, j + 1]`.**
