Postcondition: ***`q` contains valid coordinates with at least 1 coordinate, `qq` is an empty list, `i` and `j` are the first coordinates from `q`, `r` is `i + 1`, and `c` is `j` for the first iteration. If `0 <= r < H` and `0 <= c < W` and `grid[r][c]` is equal to `'.'`, then `maxx` is updated based on the comparison with `grid[r][c]`, which is equal to `grid[i][j] + 1`, and `qq` is updated to include the pair `[r, c]`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
