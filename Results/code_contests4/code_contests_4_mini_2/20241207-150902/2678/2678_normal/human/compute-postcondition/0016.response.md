According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the width `W`. The loop will iterate as long as `j` is less than `W`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `W` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, which means `j` will become 1. For the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be less than `W`, so `W` must be greater than 1.

State: **`H` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and for the loop to execute a second time `W` must be greater than 1**
