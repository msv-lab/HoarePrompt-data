Output State: **`H` is non-negative, `W` is non-negative, `maxx` is the maximum value of `grid[i][j] + 1`, `grid` is updated with the value `grid[i][j] + 1` at coordinates `(r, c)`, `qq` contains remaining coordinate pairs in `q`, `q` contains at least 1 coordinate pair, `r` is between 0 and `H-1`, `c` is between 0 and `W-1`, and `grid[r][c]` is now updated to the value `grid[i][j] + 1`.**
