Postcondition: ***`H` and `W` are non-negative integers. If `0 <= r < H` and `0 <= c < W` and `grid[r][c]` is equal to '.', then `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `grid[r][c] + 1`, `grid[r][c]` is updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`, and `qq` now includes the pair `[r, c]`. If the condition is not met, no changes are made to `maxx`, `grid`, or `qq`.***
