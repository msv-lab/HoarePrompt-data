Postcondition: ***`q` contains valid coordinates, `qq` includes all valid updated coordinates. If `r` is within the bounds of the grid and `grid[r][c]` is a '.', then `grid[r][c]` is updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`, `maxx` is updated to the maximum of `maxx` and `grid[r][c]`, and `qq` is updated to include the coordinates `[r, c]`.***
