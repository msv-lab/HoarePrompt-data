The value of `grid[i][j]` is set to 0. The current value of `i` is 1 and the current value of `j` is 3. Therefore, `grid[1][3]` is assigned the value 0. The initial state indicates that `H` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `W` is greater than 3, `j` is 3, and `q` contains the tuple [1, 2], [1, 3]; `grid[1][2]` is already set to 0. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`H` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `W` is greater than 3, `j` is 3; `q` contains the tuple [1, 2], [1, 3]; `grid[1][2]` is 0; `grid[1][3]` is set to 0.**
