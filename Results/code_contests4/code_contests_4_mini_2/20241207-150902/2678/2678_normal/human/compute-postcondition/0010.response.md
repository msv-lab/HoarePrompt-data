According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `H`. If `H` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The initial state indicates that `q` is an empty list and `dist` is a list of empty lists with length `H`, but these do not affect the loop's ability to execute. For the loop to execute the first time, `H` must be greater than 0, and `i` should start at 0 for the first iteration. 

State: **`H` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
