`q` is a list that is being appended with the tuple `[i, j]`. The previous values of `i` and `j` are 1 and 2 respectively, so the tuple appended to `q` will be `[1, 2]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `H` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `W` is greater than 1, `j` is 2; `q` now contains the tuple [1, 2].

Output State: **`H` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `W` is greater than 1, `j` is 2; `q` now contains the tuple [1, 2]**
