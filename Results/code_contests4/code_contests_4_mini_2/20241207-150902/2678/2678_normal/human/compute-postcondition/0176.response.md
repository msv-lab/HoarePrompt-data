According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of coordinate pairs formed by modifying the coordinates `i` and `j`. Since `q` contains valid coordinates and has at least 1 coordinate, the loop can execute. 

For the loop to be executed, `r` and `c` need to be defined based on the values of `i` and `j`. The first iteration will use the coordinates generated from `i` and `j`. Therefore, `r` and `c` will take their values from the first pair `([i + 1, j])` in the loop.

At the start of the loop, `i` and `j` are already set to the first coordinates from `q`, which means they are valid and ready for the loop execution. 

State: **`q` contains valid coordinates with at least 1 coordinate, `qq` is an empty list, `i` and `j` are the first coordinates from `q`, `r` is `i + 1`, `c` is `j` for the first iteration**
