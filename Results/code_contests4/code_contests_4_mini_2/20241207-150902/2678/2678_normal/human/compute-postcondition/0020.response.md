According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `j` iterating over the range defined by `W`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, which means the loop has executed for `j = 0` and `j = 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1. Therefore, `j` will be 2 for the next iteration. 

Since the loop is defined to run as long as `j` is less than `W`, for the loop to execute again, `W` must be greater than 2 (since `j` is now 2).

State: **`H` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `W` must be greater than 2**.
