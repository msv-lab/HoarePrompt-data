According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `W`. The loop will execute as long as `W` is greater than 0, with `j` starting from 0 and increasing by 1 in each iteration. Since we know that `H` is greater than 0 and `i` is 1, these states do not directly affect the execution of the loop. 

However, for the loop to execute a second time, `H` must be greater than 1, which indicates that the loop may have some dependency on `H`. The variable `j` will be 0 during the first execution, and for the loop to execute a second time, `j` will be 1 after the first iteration.

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `W` is at least 2 for the loop to run twice, and we also note that `j` will start at 0.

State: **`H` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `H` must be greater than 1, `W` is greater than 1, `j` is 1**
