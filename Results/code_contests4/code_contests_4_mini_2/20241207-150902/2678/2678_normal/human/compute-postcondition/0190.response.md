The code `qq.append([r, c])` appends the list `[r, c]` to the list `qq`. The previous value of `qq` is updated to include the new coordinates, but the values of `q` and `maxx` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` contains valid coordinates; `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `grid[r][c]`; `qq` now includes the coordinates `[r, c]`.

Output State: **`q` contains valid coordinates; `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `grid[r][c]`; `qq` now includes the coordinates `[r, c]`**.
