Output State: **`q` contains valid coordinates, `(i, j)` is defined as the next coordinate in `q`, `(r, c)` is defined as the next valid direction based on `(i, j)`, `grid[r][c]` is updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`, `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `grid[r][c]`; `qq` now contains the appended coordinate `[r, c]`.**
