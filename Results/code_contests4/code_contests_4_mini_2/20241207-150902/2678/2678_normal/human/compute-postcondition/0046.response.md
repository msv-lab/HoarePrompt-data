According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `W`. If `j` is less than `W`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `W` is greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1.

Thus, `j` will be 1 for the next iteration. Since `W` is greater than 1 for the second execution, it will still allow the loop to execute.

State: **`H` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `W` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute a second time, `j` is 1**
