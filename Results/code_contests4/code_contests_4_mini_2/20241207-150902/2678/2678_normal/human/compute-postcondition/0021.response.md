The code snippet `q.append([i, j])` appends the list `[i, j]` to the list `q`. The values of the variables `i` and `j` are used directly. Given that `i` is 0 and `j` is 2, the value being appended to `q` is `[0, 2]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `H` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `q` now contains the list `[0, 2]` appended to it.

Output State: **`H` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `q` now contains `[0, 2]`**
