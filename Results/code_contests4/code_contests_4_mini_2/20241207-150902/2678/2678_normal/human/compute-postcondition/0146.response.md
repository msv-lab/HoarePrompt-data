Postcondition: ***`q` contains valid coordinates, `(i, j)` is defined as the next coordinate in `q`, and if `(r, c)` is a valid coordinate within the grid bounds and `grid[r][c]` is '.', then `grid[r][c]` is assigned the value of `grid[i][j] + 1`, `maxx` is updated to the maximum of `maxx` and `grid[r][c]`, and `qq` now contains the coordinates [r, c]. Otherwise, no changes are made to these variables.***
