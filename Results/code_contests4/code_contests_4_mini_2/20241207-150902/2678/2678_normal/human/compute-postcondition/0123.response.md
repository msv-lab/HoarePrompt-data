Postcondition: ***`q` is assigned the value of `qq`, which contains at least 1 element. If `0 <= r < H` and `0 <= c < W` and `grid[r][c] == '.'`, then `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `grid[i][j] + 1`, and the coordinates [r, c] are appended to `qq`. If the condition is not met, no updates occur to `maxx` or `qq`.***
