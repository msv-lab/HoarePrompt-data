Postcondition: ***`q` is assigned the value of `qq`, which contains at least 1 element. If `0 <= r < H` and `0 <= c < W` and `grid[r][c]` is equal to '.', then `grid[r][c]` is updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`, `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `grid[r][c]`, and `qq` is updated to include the new element `[r, c]`.***
