Postcondition: ***`q` contains valid coordinates, `grid` has been updated, `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and the integer at `grid[r][c]`, and `qq` now includes the pair [r, c] if `0 <= r < H` and `0 <= c < W` and `grid[r][c] == '.'`. If the conditions are not met, there are no changes to `maxx` or `qq`.***
