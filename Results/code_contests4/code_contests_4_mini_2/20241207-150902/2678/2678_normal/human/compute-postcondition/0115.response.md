According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `q`. If `q` is not empty (truthy), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `q` is assigned the value of `qq`. 

Since `qq` contains all coordinate pairs `(r, c)` that were appended during the loop execution where the conditions were met, for the loop to execute one more time, `qq` must contain at least one coordinate pair. Therefore, `q` must be assigned a non-empty value.

State: **`q` is assigned the value of `qq` and for the loop to execute again, `qq` must not be empty**
