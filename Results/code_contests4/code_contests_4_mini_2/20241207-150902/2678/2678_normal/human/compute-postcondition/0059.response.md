According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `q`. For the loop to execute, `q` must contain at least one element, meaning it should not be empty. The variables `H` and `W` being greater than or equal to 0 do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute. Before the loop starts, since `qq` is an empty list, it does not influence whether the loop can execute either. The values of `i` and `j` will be determined by the first element of `q` when it is not empty.

For the loop to execute the first time, `q` should have at least one tuple for `(i, j)`, and `i` and `j` should be initialized with the respective values from the first element of `q`.

State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is greater than or equal to 0, for the loop to execute the first time `q` is not empty, `i` is the first element of the first tuple in `q`, `j` is the second element of the first tuple in `q`**
