According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the number of iterations defined by `H`. If `i` is less than `H`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `H` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `H`, which means `H` must be greater than 2.

State: **`H` is greater than 0, `W` is the number of columns in `grid`, `q` is an empty list, `dist` is a list with an empty list at index 1 and zeros at other indices, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `H` must be greater than 2.**
