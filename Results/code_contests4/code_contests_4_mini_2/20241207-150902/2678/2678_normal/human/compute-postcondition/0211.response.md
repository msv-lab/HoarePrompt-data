According to the code, the loop iterates over the coordinates contained in `q`. For the loop to execute one more time, `q` must still contain valid coordinates. At the end of the last iteration, `q` contained valid coordinates, and the loop has processed one of those coordinates, which means that for the loop to execute again, `q` must contain at least one more valid coordinate after the current iteration. 

Therefore, we would need to adjust the state such that `q` still contains valid coordinates, and since the loop processes one coordinate at a time, the next valid coordinate will be represented by `i` and `j` that will be the next coordinates to be processed.

State: **`q` contains valid coordinates; `qq` includes all valid updated coordinates; `maxx` is the maximum value updated in `grid` across all valid adjacent cells; `grid` has been updated for all valid adjacent cells based on their relationship to the value at `grid[i][j]`, and for the loop to execute again, `q` must contain at least one additional valid coordinate.**
