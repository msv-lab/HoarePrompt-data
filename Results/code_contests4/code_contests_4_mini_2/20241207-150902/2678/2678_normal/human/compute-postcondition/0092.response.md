The operation `qq.append([r, c])` adds the list `[r, c]` to the `qq` list. The previous value of `maxx` is unaffected by this operation, and other variables are not impacted either. Thus, the output state reflects the addition to the `qq` list.

Output State: **`maxx` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `grid[r][c]`, where `grid[r][c]` is `grid[i][j] + 1`; `qq` now contains an additional element [r, c]**
