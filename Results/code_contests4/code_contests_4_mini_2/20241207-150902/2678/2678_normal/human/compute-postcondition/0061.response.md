Postcondition: ***`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is greater than or equal to 0, for the loop to execute the first time `q` is not empty, `i` is the first element of the first tuple in `q`, `j` is the second element of the first tuple in `q`, and the values are within bounds (0 ≤ i < H, 0 ≤ j < W). Additionally, `r` is an integer such that 0 ≤ r < H, `c` is an integer such that 0 ≤ c < W, and the value of `grid[r][c]` is equal to '.'***
