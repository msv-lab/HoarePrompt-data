The loop iterates `H` times, assigning an empty list to each index of `dist`. Therefore, after all iterations, `dist` will contain `H` empty lists, one for each row. If `H` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `dist` remains a list of zeros with length `H`.

Output State: **`H` is the number of rows in `grid`, `W` is the number of columns in `grid`, `q` is an empty list, `dist` is a list of empty lists with length `H`.**
