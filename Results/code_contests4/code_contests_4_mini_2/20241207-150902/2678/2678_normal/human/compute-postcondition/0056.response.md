The variable `maxx` is initialized to 0. The previous values of `H`, `W`, and `q` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is greater than or equal to 0, `q` contains the coordinates `[i, j]` for each cell in `grid` that had a value of '#', and all such cells in `grid` have been set to 0; `maxx` is 0.

Output State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is greater than or equal to 0, `q` contains the coordinates `[i, j]` for each cell in `grid` that had a value of '#', and all such cells in `grid` have been set to 0; `maxx` is 0**.
