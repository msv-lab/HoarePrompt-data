Postcondition: ***`H` and `W` are non-negative. If `0 <= r < H` and `0 <= c < W` and `grid[r][c]` is '.', then `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `grid[r][c]`, `r` is updated to the next valid coordinate, `c` is updated to the next valid coordinate, `grid[r][c]` is now equal to `grid[i][j] + 1`, and `qq` now includes the new coordinate [r, c].***
