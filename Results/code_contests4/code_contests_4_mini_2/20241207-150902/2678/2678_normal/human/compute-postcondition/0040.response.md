According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `H`. If `i` is less than `H`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `H` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `H` must be greater than 2.

State: **`H` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `H` must be greater than 2**
