Postcondition: ***`q` contains valid coordinates with at least 1 coordinate. If `0 <= r < H` and `0 <= c < W` and `grid[r][c]` is '.', then `qq` is updated to contain the new coordinate `[r, c]`, `grid[r][c]` is assigned the value `grid[i][j] + 1`, and `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between its previous state and `grid[r][c]`. If the condition is not met, no changes occur to `qq`, `grid`, or `maxx`.***
