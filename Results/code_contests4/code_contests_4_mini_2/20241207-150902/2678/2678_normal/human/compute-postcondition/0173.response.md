According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `q`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `q` contains elements. At the end of the last iteration, `q` now contains all valid coordinates added during the loop execution. For the loop to execute one more time, `q` must still contain at least one valid coordinate. 

Since the current state indicates that `q` has been populated with all valid coordinates, it implies that there are valid coordinates available. However, to ensure that there is at least one valid coordinate remaining in `q`, we don't have specific information about its current state (e.g., whether it is empty or not).

Thus, we need to indicate that `q` should still contain valid coordinates for the loop to execute again.

State: **`q` now contains all valid coordinates added during the loop execution and for the loop to execute again `q` must not be empty**
