Postcondition: ***`H` and `W` are non-negative. If `0 <= r < H` and `0 <= c < W` hold true and `grid[r][c]` is '.', then `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `grid[i][j] + 1`, and `qq` includes an additional element [r, c]. If the condition does not hold, no changes are made to `maxx` or `qq`.***
