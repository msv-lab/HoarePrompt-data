According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `r` and `c` as they are determined by the expressions `[i + 1, j]`, `[i - 1, j]`, `[i, j + 1]`, and `[i, j - 1]`. Each iteration of the loop will produce a new pair `(r, c)`.

At the end of the last iteration, we know:
- `H` and `W` are non-negative integers.
- The current `(r, c)` pair being evaluated must meet the conditions `0 <= r < H` and `0 <= c < W` for the loop to execute again.
- If the conditions are not met, then the loop does not execute any further.

Since there are four pairs evaluated in this loop, we need to determine the next values of `(r, c)` for each of the pairs. Assuming the last executed pair `(r, c)` was valid and one of the following pairs, we can predict the next states:

1. From `[i + 1, j]`, the next pair will be `[i + 1 + 1, j]` which is `[i + 2, j]`.
2. From `[i - 1, j]`, the next pair will be `[i - 1 - 1, j]` which is `[i - 2, j]`.
3. From `[i, j + 1]`, the next pair will be `[i, j + 1 + 1]` which is `[i, j + 2]`.
4. From `[i, j - 1]`, the next pair will be `[i, j - 1 - 1]` which is `[i, j - 2]`.

However, since the loop will only execute if the new `(r, c)` pairs are still valid within the grid bounds and the conditions regarding `grid[r][c]` are met, we need to ensure that the next values of `r` and `c` are valid according to the grid dimensions `H` and `W`.

To keep it simple, we can state:
- For the loop to execute one more time, at least one of the new pairs must satisfy the conditions.

Assuming the last valid `(r, c)` was `[i, j]`, and considering the next valid execution based on the conditions:

State: **`H` and `W` are non-negative integers, for the loop to execute again, at least one of the pairs `(r, c)` must satisfy `0 <= r < H` and `0 <= c < W`, with potential new pairs being `[i + 1, j]`, `[i - 1, j]`, `[i, j + 1]`, or `[i, j - 1]`.**
