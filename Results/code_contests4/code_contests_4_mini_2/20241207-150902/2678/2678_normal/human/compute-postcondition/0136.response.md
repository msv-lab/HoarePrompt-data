According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the current state of `q` and the values of `(i, j)`. For the loop to execute a second time, `q` must have at least one valid coordinate remaining. At the end of the last iteration, the coordinates `(r, c)` will be the next set of coordinates derived from `(i, j)`, which means `(i, j)` must be defined before the loop starts.

State: **`q` contains valid coordinates, for the loop to execute a second time `q` must have at least one valid coordinate remaining, (i, j) is defined and will be the next coordinate in `q`, (r, c) will be the next valid direction based on (i, j).**
