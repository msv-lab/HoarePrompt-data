Postcondition: ***`q` is assigned the value of `qq`, which contains at least 1 element. If `r` is within the bounds of `H` and `c` is within the bounds of `W`, and `grid[r][c]` is `.` (indicating it is a valid cell), then `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `grid[r][c]`, with `grid[r][c]` being updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`, and the value `[r, c]` is appended to `qq`. If the conditions are not met, no changes occur to `maxx`, `grid`, or `qq`.***
