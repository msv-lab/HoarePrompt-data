Postcondition: ***`q` contains valid coordinates; `qq` now includes updated coordinates [r, c]; `maxx` is the maximum of its previous value and `grid[r][c]`; `grid` has been updated for valid adjacent cells, with `grid[r][c]` updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`, where `grid[i][j]` is the value at the coordinates in `q`, and both `r` and `c` are within the valid ranges [0, H) and [0, W), respectively.***
