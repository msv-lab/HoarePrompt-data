According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `W`. If `j` is less than `W`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `W` is greater than 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. For the loop to execute again, `W` must be greater than 2.

State: **`H` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `W` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `W` must be greater than 2**
