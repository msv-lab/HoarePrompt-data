Postcondition: ***`q` contains valid coordinates, `grid` has been updated, `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `grid[r][c]`, `qq` now includes all the valid coordinates including the newly appended `[r, c]`, and `grid[r][c]` is updated to `grid[i][j] + 1` if `0 <= r < H` and `0 <= c < W` and `grid[r][c] == '.'`.***
