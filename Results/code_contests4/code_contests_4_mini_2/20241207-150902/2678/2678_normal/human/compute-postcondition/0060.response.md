According to the code, the loop executes over a list of tuples representing the coordinates (r, c) based on the values of `i` and `j`. The loop will iterate through the four possible directions relative to the coordinates `(i, j)`. For the loop to execute, `q` must contain at least one element, which means `i` and `j` must be defined based on the first tuple in `q`. 

The current state indicates that `H` and `W` are both greater than or equal to 0, but these values do not directly affect the loop execution. The critical states that need to be defined and confirmed are the contents of `q`, specifically that it is not empty, and that `i` and `j` are initialized correctly from the first tuple in `q`.

Thus, for the loop to execute:
- `q` is not empty,
- `i` is the first element of the first tuple in `q`,
- `j` is the second element of the first tuple in `q`,
- The first tuple in `q` must be within the bounds defined by `H` and `W`.

State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is greater than or equal to 0, for the loop to execute the first time `q` is not empty, `i` is the first element of the first tuple in `q`, `j` is the second element of the first tuple in `q`, and the values should be within bounds (0 ≤ i < H, 0 ≤ j < W)**.
