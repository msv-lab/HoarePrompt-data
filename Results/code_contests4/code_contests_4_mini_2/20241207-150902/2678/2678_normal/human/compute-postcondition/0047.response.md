The code `q.append([i, j])` appends a list containing the current values of `i` and `j` to the list `q`. Since `i` is 2 and `j` is 1, the list `[2, 1]` will be added to `q`. The states of the other variables (`H` and `W`) are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `H` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `W` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, and `q` now contains the new element `[2, 1]`.

Output State: **`H` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `W` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `q` now contains the new element `[2, 1]`**.
