The code appends the list `[r, c]` to the list `qq`. The previous values of `maxx`, `grid[r][c]`, and others are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in the `qq` variable.

Output State: **`maxx` is updated based on the comparison with `grid[r][c]`, where `grid[r][c]` is equal to `grid[i][j] + 1; `qq` has been updated to include the pair `[r, c]`.**
