Postcondition: ***`H` and `W` are non-negative. If `0 <= r < H` and `0 <= c < W` and `grid[r][c]` is '.', then `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `grid[r][c]`, `grid` is updated with values of `grid[i][j] + 1` at valid coordinates, `q` contains at least one more coordinate pair `(i', j')`, `r` is `i + 1`, `c` is `j`, and the coordinate pair `[r, c]` is appended to `qq`. If the condition is not met, no changes are made to the variables.***
