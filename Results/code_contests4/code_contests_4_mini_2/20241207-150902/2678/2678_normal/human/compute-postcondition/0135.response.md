According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `q`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `q` contains valid coordinates to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `q` holds the coordinates of all valid cells explored. 

For the loop to execute a second time, `q` must contain at least one more valid coordinate. Assuming `q` has at least one coordinate left at the end of the last iteration, the next coordinates `(i, j)` can be taken from `q`. 

If `q` has valid coordinates, it must be updated to reflect that one of its elements will be processed in the next iteration, which means that for the loop to execute again, `q` should either have the same or fewer valid coordinates (but still at least one remaining) and the values of `i` and `j` should correspond to the next coordinate in the queue.

State: **`q` contains valid coordinates, for the loop to execute a second time `q` must have at least one valid coordinate remaining, and `(i, j)` will be the next coordinate in `q`.**
