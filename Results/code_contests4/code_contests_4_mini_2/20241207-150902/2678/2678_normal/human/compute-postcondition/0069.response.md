The value of `qq` is updated to include the new pair `[r, c]`, which represents coordinates. The previous values of `H` and `W` are not affected by this operation, and `maxx` and `grid` remain unchanged as well. Therefore, the Output State is: `H` and `W` are non-negative integers; `maxx` is updated to max(maxx, grid[r][c]), and `grid[r][c]` is updated to grid[i][j] + 1; `qq` now includes the pair `[r, c]`.

Output State: **`H` and `W` are non-negative integers; `maxx` is updated to max(maxx, grid[r][c]), and `grid[r][c]` is updated to grid[i][j] + 1; `qq` now includes the pair `[r, c]`.**
