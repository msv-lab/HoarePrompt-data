Postcondition: ***`q` contains valid coordinates and `(i, j)` is defined as the next coordinate in `q`. If `0 <= r < H` and `0 <= c < W` and `grid[r][c] == '.'`, then `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `grid[r][c]`, `grid[r][c]` is set to `grid[i][j] + 1`, and `qq` is updated to include the coordinates `[r, c]`.***
