Postcondition: ***`q` contains valid coordinates, `grid` has been updated, `maxx` is the maximum value found in `grid`, `qq` contains all the valid coordinates added during the loop execution, for the loop to execute one more time `q` has at least one more valid coordinate left, (r, c) is set to one of the new valid coordinates derived from (i, j), and the values of `r` and `c` are such that 0 is less than or equal to `r` which is less than `H`, 0 is less than or equal to `c` which is less than `W`, and the value of `grid[r][c]` is equal to '.'***
