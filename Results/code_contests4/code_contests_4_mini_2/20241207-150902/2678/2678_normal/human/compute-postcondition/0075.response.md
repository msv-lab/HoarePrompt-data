Postcondition: ***`H` and `W` are non-negative integers. If `0 <= r < H` and `0 <= c < W` and `grid[r][c]` is '.', then `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `grid[i][j] + 1`, and the coordinates `[r, c]` are appended to `qq`. If the conditions are not met, then no changes occur to `maxx` or `qq`.***
