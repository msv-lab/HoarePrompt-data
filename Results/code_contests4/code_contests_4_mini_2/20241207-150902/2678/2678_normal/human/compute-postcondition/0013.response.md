The operation `q.append([i, j])` adds the list `[i, j]` to the queue `q`. The values of `i` and `j` are both 0, so the operation appends the list `[0, 0]` to `q`. The other variables `H` and `W` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `H` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `W` is greater than 0, and `grid[i][j]` is equal to '#'; the queue `q` now contains the element `[0, 0]`.

Output State: **`H` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `W` is greater than 0, `grid[i][j]` is equal to '#'; the queue `q` now contains the element `[0, 0]`.**
