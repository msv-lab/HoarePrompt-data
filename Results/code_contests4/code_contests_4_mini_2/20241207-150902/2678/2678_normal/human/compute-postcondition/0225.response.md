The value of `grid[r][c]` is updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`, which affects `grid[r][c]`. After this update, the `maxx` variable is assigned the maximum value between its current value and the newly updated `grid[r][c]`. The previous value of `grid[i][j]` is not specified, but we can conclude that `grid[r][c]` will be greater than or equal to its previous value. Therefore, `maxx` will either retain its previous value or increase to the new value of `grid[r][c]`.

Output State: **`grid[r][c]` is updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`, `maxx` is updated to max(maxx, grid[r][c])**
