The command `qq.append([r, c])` adds the list containing the values of `r` and `c` to the `qq` list. The previous value of `maxx` is not affected by this operation, and there is no indication of what `qq` contained before this command. Therefore, the Output State reflects the new state of `qq` and reiterates the unchanged state of `maxx`.

Output State: **`maxx` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and the integer at `grid[r][c]`; `qq` now includes the pair [r, c].**
