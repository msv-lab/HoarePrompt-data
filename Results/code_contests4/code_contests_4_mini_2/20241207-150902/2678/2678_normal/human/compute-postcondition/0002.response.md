`dist` is assigned a list that contains `H` number of zeros, as the expression `[0] * H` creates a list with `H` elements, all initialized to 0. The values of `H`, `W`, and `q` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `H` is the number of rows in `grid`, `W` is the number of columns in `grid`, `q` is an empty list, `dist` is a list of zeros with length `H`.

Output State: **`H` is the number of rows in `grid`, `W` is the number of columns in `grid`, `q` is an empty list, `dist` is a list of zeros with length `H`**
