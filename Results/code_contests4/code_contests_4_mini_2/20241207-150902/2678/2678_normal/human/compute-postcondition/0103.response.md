The value of `grid[r][c]` is assigned the value of `grid[i][j] + 1`. The previous value of `grid[i][j]` is not specified, but since `grid[r][c]` is being updated based on `grid[i][j]`, `grid[r][c]` will now hold a value that is one greater than whatever `grid[i][j]` was. The states of `H`, `W`, `maxx`, `r`, and `c` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `H` is non-negative, `W` is non-negative, `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `grid[r][c]`, `r` is updated to the next valid coordinate, `c` is updated to the next valid coordinate, and `grid[r][c]` is now equal to `grid[i][j] + 1`.

Output State: **`H` is non-negative, `W` is non-negative, `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `grid[r][c]`, `r` is updated to the next valid coordinate, `c` is updated to the next valid coordinate, and `grid[r][c]` is now equal to `grid[i][j] + 1.**
