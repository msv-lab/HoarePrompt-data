The value of `maxx` is assigned the maximum of its current value and the value of `grid[r][c]`. Since `grid[r][c]` has been assigned the value of `grid[i][j] + 1`, where `grid[i][j]` is a valid value, `grid[r][c]` is now greater than `grid[i][j]`. Therefore, `maxx` will be updated if its current value is less than `grid[r][c]`. The state of other variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`maxx` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `grid[r][c]`, `grid[r][c]` is `grid[i][j] + 1`, state of other variables remains unchanged.**
