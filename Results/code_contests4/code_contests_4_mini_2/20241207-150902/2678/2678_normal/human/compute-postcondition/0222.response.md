Postcondition: ***`q` contains valid coordinates, `qq` includes all valid updated coordinates, and if `r` is within bounds and `c` is also within bounds while `grid[r][c]` is '.', then `qq` now includes the new coordinate `[i + 1, j]`, `grid[r][c]` is updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`, and `maxx` is updated to the maximum between its previous value and `grid[r][c]`.***
