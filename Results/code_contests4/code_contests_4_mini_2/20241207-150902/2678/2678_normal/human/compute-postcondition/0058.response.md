The variable `qq` is assigned an empty list. The previous values of `H`, `W`, and `q` remain unchanged, as this operation does not affect them. Therefore, the Output State is: `H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is greater than or equal to 0, for the loop to execute the first time `q` is not empty; `qq` is an empty list.

Output State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is greater than or equal to 0, for the loop to execute the first time `q` is not empty; `qq` is an empty list.**
