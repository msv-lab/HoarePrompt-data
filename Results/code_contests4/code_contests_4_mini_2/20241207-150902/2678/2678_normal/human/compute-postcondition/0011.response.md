According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `W`. If `W` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The states provided indicate that `H` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0, but these do not directly affect the execution of the loop. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `W` must be greater than 0, and `j` should be initialized to 0 as it will start from 0 in the loop.

State: **`H` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `W` is greater than 0, `j` is 0**
