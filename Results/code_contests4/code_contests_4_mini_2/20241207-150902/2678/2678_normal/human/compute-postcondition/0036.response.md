The code appends the list `[i, j]` to the tuple `q`. The previous values are `i` which is 1 and `j` which is 3. Thus, the list `[i, j]` becomes `[1, 3]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `H` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `W` is greater than 3, `j` is 3; `q` contains the tuple [1, 2], and after appending, `q` contains the tuple [1, 2], [1, 3]; `grid[1][2]` is set to 0.

Output State: **`H` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `W` is greater than 3, `j` is 3; `q` contains the tuple [1, 2], [1, 3]; `grid[1][2]` is set to 0.**
