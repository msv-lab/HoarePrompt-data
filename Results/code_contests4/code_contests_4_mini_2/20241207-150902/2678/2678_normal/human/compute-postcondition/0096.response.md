To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we must consider the variables involved in the loop and their current states. The loop iterates over a list of coordinate pairs derived from the current coordinates `(i, j)`. 

1. The coordinates `(r, c)` are calculated based on the current values of `i` and `j`. Therefore, the loop will execute if there are valid coordinates to iterate over.
2. The state indicates that `q` must contain at least 1 coordinate pair for the loop to execute one more time.
3. Since `grid` is updated with values of `grid[i][j] + 1` at all valid coordinates, we can infer that the coordinates `(i + 1, j)`, `(i - 1, j)`, `(i, j + 1)`, and `(i, j - 1)` must also be valid and must correspond to existing pairs in `q`.

We can summarize the necessary state adjustments as follows:

- `q` must contain at least 1 remaining coordinate pair.
- The values of `r` and `c` need to be valid derived from the current `i` and `j`. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, we can state:

State: **`H` is non-negative, `W` is non-negative, `maxx` is the maximum value of `grid[i][j] + 1`, `grid` is updated with values of `grid[i][j] + 1` at valid coordinates, `qq` contains remaining coordinate pairs in `q`, for the loop to execute one more time `q` contains at least 1 coordinate pair, `r` and `c` are derived from the current `i` and `j`.**
