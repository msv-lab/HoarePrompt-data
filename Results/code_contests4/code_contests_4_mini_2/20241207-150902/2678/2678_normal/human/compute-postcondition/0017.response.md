The code `q.append([i, j])` appends a list containing the current values of `i` and `j` to the list `q`. The previous values are `i` is 0 and `j` is 1. The variable `H` and the requirement for `W` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `H` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and the list `q` now contains a new element `[0, 1]`.

Output State: **`H` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `q` now contains the element [0, 1]**
