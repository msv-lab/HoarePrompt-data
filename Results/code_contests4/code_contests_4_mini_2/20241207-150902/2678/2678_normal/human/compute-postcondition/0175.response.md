According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the contents of the `q` variable. For the loop to execute, `q` must contain at least one valid coordinate, which means it should not be empty. If `q` is empty, the loop will not run at all. 

Since `qq` is an empty list and does not affect the loop execution, we only need to focus on `q`. We also need to ensure that `i` and `j` will be initialized with the first coordinate in `q` when the loop executes for the first time. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, `q` must contain at least one valid coordinate, and initially, `i` and `j` will take the values of the first coordinate in `q`.

State: **`q` now contains valid coordinates with at least 1 coordinate, `qq` is an empty list, `i` and `j` are the first coordinates from `q`**
