According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of coordinate pairs that represent the possible movements from the current position `(i, j)`. For the loop to execute, there must be valid coordinate pairs available in the list, meaning that `r` and `c` must represent valid movements that are within the bounds of the grid. 

The state before the loop indicates that `H`, `W`, and `maxx` are non-negative, and `grid` is already updated. However, we need to ensure that `q` contains at least one more coordinate pair `(i', j')` for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, we need to establish that `q` contains at least one coordinate pair, and we can set `r` and `c` to the first coordinate pair from the list of movements, which will be `[i + 1, j]`. 

State: **`H` is non-negative, `W` is non-negative, `maxx` is the maximum value updated during the loop, `grid` is updated with values of `grid[i][j] + 1` at valid coordinates, for the loop to execute again `q` must contain at least one more coordinate pair `(i', j')`, and the first coordinate pair `r` is `i + 1`, `c` is `j`**
