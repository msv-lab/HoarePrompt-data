The value of `maxx` is updated to be the maximum between its previous value and the updated value of `grid[r][c]`. Since `grid[r][c]` has just been updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`, `maxx` will now hold the greater of `maxx` or `grid[i][j] + 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `H` is non-negative, `W` is non-negative, `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `grid[r][c]`, `grid[r][c]` is `grid[i][j] + 1`, `grid` has been updated at coordinates `(r, c)`, `qq` contains remaining coordinate pairs in `q`, `q` contains at least 1 coordinate pair, `r` is between 0 and `H-1`, and `c` is between 0 and `W-1`.

Output State: **`H` is non-negative, `W` is non-negative, `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `grid[r][c]`, `grid[r][c]` is `grid[i][j] + 1`, `grid` has been updated at coordinates `(r, c)`, `qq` contains remaining coordinate pairs in `q`, `q` contains at least 1 coordinate pair, `r` is between 0 and `H-1`, and `c` is between 0 and `W-1`.**
