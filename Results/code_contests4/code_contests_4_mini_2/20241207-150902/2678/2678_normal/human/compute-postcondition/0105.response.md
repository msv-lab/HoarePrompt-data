The code appends the list `[r, c]` to the `qq` list, which means `qq` will have a new entry consisting of the updated coordinates `r` and `c`. The values of `H`, `W`, `maxx`, and `grid` are not affected by this operation since the code only modifies `qq`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the other variables and the new entry in `qq`.

Output State: **`H` is non-negative, `W` is non-negative, `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `grid[r][c]`, `r` is updated to the next valid coordinate, `c` is updated to the next valid coordinate, `grid[r][c]` is now equal to `grid[i][j] + 1, and `qq` now includes the new coordinate [r, c]**.
