According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the height `H`. If `i` is less than `H`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `H` is greater than 0. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 1, and for the loop to execute again, `H` must be greater than 1.

State: **`H` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `H` must be greater than 1**.
