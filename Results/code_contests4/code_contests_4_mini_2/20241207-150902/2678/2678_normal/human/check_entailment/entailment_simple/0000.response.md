To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze both the requirements and the implementation.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Given a grid of squares with `H` horizontal rows and `W` vertical columns, the squares are either black (`#`) or white (`.`).
- The task is to find out how many operations are needed until all squares become black. An operation consists of turning white squares that share a side with a black square into black squares.
- The initial grid will always have at least one black square.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization**: 
   - The program initializes `H` and `W` based on the size of the input grid.
   - It constructs a queue `q` where each entry corresponds to the coordinates of black squares (`#`).
   - The grid cells that were black are set to `0`, indicating their distance from themselves.

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Logic**:
   - The program uses a BFS approach to determine how far white squares (`.`) are from the nearest black square.
   - During each iteration, it checks the neighboring squares of each currently black square; if a neighboring square is white, it changes it to black and updates its distance.
   - The maximum distance (`maxx`) is tracked, which corresponds to the number of operations taken until all reachable white squares turn black.

3. **Termination**: 
   - The loop continues until there are no more squares to process (i.e., the queue `q` is empty).
   - Finally, it returns `maxx`, which represents the total number of operations performed.

### Correctness Verification:
The program follows these steps:
- It correctly initializes the BFS with the positions of black squares.
- It processes each square, converting white squares to black when adjacent to black squares, as described.
- The counting of operations is effectively captured by the maximum distance from the original black squares, as each increase in distance represents an additional operation.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the BFS algorithm to solve the problem of determining how many operations are required to turn all white squares black. It adheres to the problem description and constraints outlined.

Therefore, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **True**
