The function accepts a 2D list `grid` of characters, where each character is either '#' for black squares or '.' for white squares. It calculates the maximum distance from any black square to the farthest white square by performing a breadth-first search (BFS) and returns this maximum distance. The function assumes that there is at least one black square in the grid. If there are no white squares adjacent to any black square, the maximum distance will be 0.
