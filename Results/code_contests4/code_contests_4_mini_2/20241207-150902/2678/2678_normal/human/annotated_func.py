#State of the program right berfore the function call: grid is a 2D list of characters where each character is either '#' representing a black square or '.' representing a white square, and the dimensions of the grid are such that 1 <= len(grid) <= 1000 and 1 <= len(grid[0]) <= 1000. The grid contains at least one black square.
def func_1(grid):
    H, W = len(grid), len(grid[0])

    dist = [0] * H
    for i in range(H):
        dist[i] = []
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `H` is the number of rows in `grid`, `W` is the number of columns in `grid`, `q` is an empty list, `dist` is a list of empty lists with length `H`.

                grid[i][j] = 0
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is greater than or equal to 0, `q` contains the coordinates `[i, j]` for each cell in `grid` that had a value of '#', and all such cells in `grid` have been set to 0.

        qq = []

                if 0 <= r < H and 0 <= c < W and grid[r][c] == '.':
                    grid[r][c] = grid[i][j] + 1

    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `q` is empty, `H` and `W` are non-negative integers, `maxx` is the maximum distance updated during the loop execution based on all valid coordinate pairs, `grid` has been fully updated with values representing the distances from the initial positions of '#' in the grid.
    return maxx
    #The program returns the maximum distance 'maxx' updated during the loop execution based on all valid coordinate pairs in the grid.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a 2D list `grid` of characters, where each character is either '#' for black squares or '.' for white squares. It calculates the maximum distance from any black square to the farthest white square by performing a breadth-first search (BFS) and returns this maximum distance. The function assumes that there is at least one black square in the grid. If there are no white squares adjacent to any black square, the maximum distance will be 0.
