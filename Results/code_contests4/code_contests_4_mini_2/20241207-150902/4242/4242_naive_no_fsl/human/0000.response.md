Correctness: **False**

The program is intended to compute the smallest number that can be obtained from four given integers using a specified sequence of three operations (either addition or multiplication). However, there are critical issues in the logic of how it evaluates the expressions.

The program generates permutations of the four numbers and attempts to evaluate two specific expressions for each permutation. However, it fails to account for all possible parenthesizations of the operations. The operations can be grouped in various ways, leading to different results. The two expressions evaluated do not cover all potential groupings.

For example, consider the input:

```
1 2 3 4
* + +
```

The valid evaluations include:
1. `((1 * 2) + 3) + 4`
2. `(1 * (2 + 3)) + 4`
3. `(1 * 2) + (3 + 4)`
4. `1 * (2 + (3 + 4))`
5. `(1 * (2 + 4)) + 3`
6. And many other combinations...

The program only evaluates two specific cases per permutation and thus may miss the minimum result possible from valid operations. Consequently, it may not return the correct minimum value for certain combinations of inputs and operations.

Because of this limitation in handling all possible combinations and parenthesizations, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Thus, the correctness is determined to be false.
