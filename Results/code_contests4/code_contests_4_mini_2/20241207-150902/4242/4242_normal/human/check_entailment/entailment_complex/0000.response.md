Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here are the key issues:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads input using `raw_input()`, which is not valid in Python 3; it should use `input()`. This could lead to errors when the program is executed in a Python 3 environment.

2. **Variable Handling**: The variable `c` is used to represent both the permutation of the numbers and as an iteration variable in the for loop. This could lead to confusion and errors in understanding the code's logic.

3. **Permutation Logic**: The expression generated by `eval` does not correctly handle all possible parenthesizations of the operations. The program only considers two specific arrangements of parentheses, which does not cover all possible ways to group the operations. For example, it misses expressions like `((a + b) * c) + d`, which could yield different results.

4. **Incorrect Result Calculation**: The use of `eval` can lead to unintended consequences if the input format is not strictly followed. Additionally, the algorithm does not compute the result for all permutations of integers and all combinations of operations comprehensively.

5. **Initialization of `res`**: The initialization of `res` to a very large number is not robust, as the actual result could be larger than this value if an unexpected input were to be processed.

Due to these reasons, the program does not satisfy the problem's requirements and may lead to incorrect results for certain inputs.
