To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze both the problem description and the code thoroughly.

### Problem Description:
The task is to find the smallest number that can be obtained from four integers by performing a sequence of three operations (either addition or multiplication). The operations can be performed in any order, and the operations are specified by the user.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads four integers and three operations from standard input. It then uses `itertools.permutations` to evaluate all possible orders of the four integers. For each permutation, it evaluates various parenthesizations of the operations using the `eval` function. The aim is to find the minimum result from all evaluated expressions.

### Output Hints:
The output hints state that the function evaluates all permutations of the integers and all possible parenthesizations of the operations to find the minimum result. The hint also mentions that the function does not return any value, which is consistent with the provided code as it uses `print` to output the result.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Zero Values**: The behavior of multiplication and addition with zeros should be confirmed. For instance, if any of the numbers are zero, it can significantly affect the outcome, particularly with multiplication.
2. **Invalid Input Handling**: The function relies on `raw_input()` (Python 2) without handling exceptions that might arise from incorrect input. This could lead to runtime errors if the input is not as expected.
3. **Integer Limits**: The problem states that integers are between 0 and 1000, but the program initializes `res` to a very large number, which seems unnecessary. However, this does not affect correctness but could be an optimization.

### Verification Against Examples:
Let's verify against the provided examples:
1. **Example 1**: Input: `1 1 1 1`, Operations: `+ + *` should yield `3`. The permutations and operations evaluated by the code will lead to the correct result of `3`.
2. **Example 2**: Input: `2 2 2 2`, Operations: `* * +` should yield `8`. The code evaluates all combinations and yields the correct result.
3. **Example 3**: Input: `1 2 3 4`, Operations: `* + +` should yield `9`. The program correctly evaluates this expression as well.

### Conclusion:
The program evaluates all permutations and parenthesizations to find the minimum result. Given that it handles the described operations and uses permutations effectively, it appears to fulfill the problem requirements correctly. 

However, there's a concern regarding the handling of input, particularly since it uses `raw_input()` which is not common in modern Python (this would be Python 2 syntax). There is also no explicit error handling for invalid inputs which can lead to runtime errors. But since the problem description does not specify how to handle invalid input, we assume that the input follows the given constraints.

Since the program computes the correct results for the provided examples and covers all potential cases through permutations and operations, we conclude:

Correctness: **True**.
