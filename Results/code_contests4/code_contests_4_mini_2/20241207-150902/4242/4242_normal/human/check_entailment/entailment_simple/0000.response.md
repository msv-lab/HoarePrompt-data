Correctness: **False**

The annotated program does not correctly solve the problem as described for the following reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` which is not valid in Python 3; it should use `input()` instead. This means the program won't run correctly in a Python 3 environment.

2. **Variable Initialization**: The variable `a` is populated with strings (from the input), but the problem requires dealing with integers. The integers should be converted from strings to integers before any arithmetic operations.

3. **Incorrect Number of Permutations**: The program only considers two specific forms of evaluation for the operations but does not explore all possible ways to apply the operations to the four numbers. The problem states that any two numbers can be taken from the blackboard at each step, which means the program needs to evaluate all possible combinations of pairs and sequences of operations. The current implementation limits it to just two arrangements per permutation, which may not yield the smallest result.

4. **Use of `eval()`**: The use of `eval()` with dynamically generated expressions can be unsafe and is generally not a good practice. It is also prone to errors if the format of the strings isn't handled correctly.

5. **Hardcoded Large Initial Result**: The initial value of `res` is set to an extremely large number (100000000000000000000000000). While this is a valid approach for finding minimums, it is not necessary and could lead to overflow issues or performance concerns.

6. **Lack of Bracket Combinations**: The program does not account for all possible placements of parentheses which can affect the order of operations. The arithmetic operations are not associative, especially when mixing addition and multiplication, thus the order of operations can lead to different results.

In conclusion, the program is incomplete and incorrect as it does not handle all variations of the input properly and does not compute the result according to the rules laid out in the problem description.
