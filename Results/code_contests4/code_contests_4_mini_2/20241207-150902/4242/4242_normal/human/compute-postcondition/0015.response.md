Functionality: ** The function accepts a sequence of four integers entered via standard input and a sequence of three arithmetic operators ('+' or '*') also entered via standard input. It evaluates all permutations of the integers and all possible parenthesizations of the operations to find the minimum result of the expressions. The final result is printed, but the function does not return any value. Note that the integers are not passed as parameters to the function; instead, they are read from input, which could lead to issues if the input format is not strictly followed. **
