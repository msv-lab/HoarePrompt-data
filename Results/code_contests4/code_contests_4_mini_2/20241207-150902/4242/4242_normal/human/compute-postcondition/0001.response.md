The variable `a` is assigned the value of `raw_input().split()`, which means it will take input as a string, split it by whitespace, and return a list of substrings. Since the initial state indicates that `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers and does not specify the input for `a`, we cannot determine its specific values post-execution. The values of `b`, `c`, `d`, and `res` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of strings from input, `b`, `c`, and `d` are unchanged integers, and `res` is unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of strings from input, `b`, `c`, and `d` are unchanged integers, and `res` is unchanged.**
