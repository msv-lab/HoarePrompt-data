According to the code, the loop iterates over all permutations of the list `a`. At the end of the last iteration, `c` holds the first permutation of `a`. Since `itertools.permutations(a)` generates all possible permutations, and `c` will take on the next permutation in the next iteration, we need to set `c` to the next permutation of `a`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must still be a non-empty list of strings, and `c` should be updated to the next permutation. If there are no more permutations available, the loop will terminate.

Since we are currently at the first permutation, the next permutation will be the second permutation of `a`.

State: **`a` is a non-empty list of strings, `b` is unchanged, `c` is the second permutation of `a`, `d` is unchanged, `res` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the evaluated expression result.**
