The function `func` accepts four parameters: `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. All parameters are integers that must satisfy the constraint 0 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ 1000. The function performs operations based on a sequence of three signs ('+' or '*') that are separated by spaces. The output of the function will depend on the specific operations indicated by these signs applied to the parameters `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts four integer parameters a, b, c, and d (0 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ 1000), and performs arithmetic operations based on a sequence of three signs ('+' or '*') separated by spaces, returning the result of the operations applied to the parameters.**
