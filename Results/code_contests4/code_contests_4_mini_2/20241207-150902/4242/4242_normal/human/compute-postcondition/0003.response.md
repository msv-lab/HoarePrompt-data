According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `a`. The `itertools.permutations(a)` function generates permutations of the list `a`. For the loop to execute at least once, the list `a` must contain at least one string. If `a` is empty, no permutations can be generated, and the loop will not execute.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes for the first time, `a` must be a non-empty list of strings, and `c` will be the first permutation of `a`.

State: **`a` is a non-empty list of strings, `b` is unchanged, `c` is the first permutation of `a`, `d` is unchanged, `res` is unchanged, `z` is a list of strings from raw input split by whitespace**
