To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we need to analyze the impact of the code on the variables involved.

1. `c` is given as the second permutation of `a`, which means it is a specific arrangement of the elements in `a`.
2. The variable `res` is updated to the minimum value between its previous value and the result of an evaluated expression. The expression involves the elements of `c` and another variable `z`, which is not defined in the initial state but is assumed to be available.
3. The expression being evaluated is:
   ```
   '(' + c[0] + z[0] + c[1] + ')' + z[2] + '(' + c[2] + z[1] + c[3] + ')'
   ```
   This constructs a string that is then evaluated as a Python expression.

Given this, we don't have the specific values of `a`, `z`, or `res`, but we can conclude that:
- `res` will hold either its previous value or the result of the evaluated expression, which will depend on the specific values from `c` and `z`.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `res` has been updated based on the evaluation, while the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of strings, `b` is unchanged, `c` is the second permutation of `a`, `d` is unchanged, `res` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the result of the evaluated expression from `c` and `z`.**
