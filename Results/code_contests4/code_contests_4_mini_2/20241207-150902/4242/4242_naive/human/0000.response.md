To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic and operations carried out in the code.

### Problem Description:
Vladimir needs to compute the minimum possible result from four integers by performing a series of three operations (either addition or multiplication). The operations can be performed in different orders with the integers, and we need to find the minimal outcome.

### Provided Program:
```python
res = 100000000000000000000000000
a = raw_input().split()
z = raw_input().split()
for c in itertools.permutations(a):
    res = min(res, eval('((' + c[0] + z[0] + c[1] + ')' + z[1] + c[2] + ')' + z[2] + c[3]))
    res = min(res, eval('(' + c[0] + z[0] + c[1] + ')' + z[2] + '(' + c[2] + z[1] + c[3] + ')'))
print(res)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads four integers and three operations. The integers are stored in `a`, and operations are stored in `z`.
   
2. **Permutation Logic**:
   - The program generates all permutations of the four integers (`itertools.permutations(a)`).
   
3. **Evaluation of Expressions**:
   - The program evaluates two specific arrangements of the operations for each permutation of numbers. It uses `eval()` to compute the results of the expressions formulated by combining the numbers and operations in a specific order.

4. **Finding the Minimum**:
   - The minimum result is updated during each iteration through permutations, ensuring the smallest result is retained.

### Potential Issues:
- The primary issue with the implementation arises from the limited forms of expressions evaluated. The code only considers two specific arrangements:
  - `((a1 op1 a2) op2 a3) op3 a4`
  - `(a1 op1 a2) op3 (a3 op2 a4)`
  
For a comprehensive solution, it should also consider other combinations of parentheses. For instance:
- `a1 op2 (a2 op1 (a3 op3 a4))`
- `a1 op3 ((a2 op1 a3) op2 a4)`

These arrangements can produce different results, especially when multiplication and addition are mixed, due to the non-commutative nature of multiplication and addition in terms of how they influence the output.

### Conclusion:
Given that the program does not evaluate all possible parenthetical combinations of the operations, it does not guarantee that the minimum result will be found for all possible inputs and operations.

Thus, we can conclude that the provided implementation does not fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**. 

**Counterexample**: For input `1 2 3 4` with operations `* + +`, the correct minimum could be computed as `1 * (2 + (3 + 4)) = 1 * 9 = 9`, but other arrangements might yield different results which are not considered in the current implementation.
