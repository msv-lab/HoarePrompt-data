The dictionary `d` is defined, mapping string representations of card ranks to their corresponding integer values. This operation does not change the values of the other variables (`trump suit`, `coz`, `f`, and `s`) as they remain unaffected. The output state reflects the unchanged values of these variables along with the newly defined dictionary.

Output State: **the trump suit is a string that is one of "S", "H", "D", or "C"; the two cards are represented as strings in the format of two characters, where the first character is one of "6", "7", "8", "9", "T", "J", "Q", "K", "A" representing the rank, and the second character is one of "S", "H", "D", or "C" representing the suit; the two cards must be different; `coz` is an input string; `f` and `s` are assigned input strings representing the two cards; `d` is a dictionary mapping ranks to values**
