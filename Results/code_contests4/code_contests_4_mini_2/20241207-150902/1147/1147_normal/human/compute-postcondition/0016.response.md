The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as it is defined without any. However, it operates on two cards and a trump suit, which are assumed to be provided in the context of the function. The trump suit is a string that must be one of "S", "H", "D", or "C". The two cards are represented as strings in the format of two characters with the first character being one of "6", "7", "8", "9", "T", "J", "Q", "K", "A" (indicating the rank) and the second character being one of "S", "H", "D", or "C" (indicating the suit). The two cards must be different from each other.

Based on the output constraints, the function likely evaluates the cards in relation to the trump suit, but details regarding the specific output conditions are not provided. Hence, without explicit output cases, we can summarize the expected behavior.

Functionality: **The function operates on a trump suit and two different cards, determining an outcome based on the provided inputs related to their ranks and suits.**
