The variable `coz` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which accepts a string input from the user. The initial state does not provide a specific value for `coz`, so it will hold the string value that the user inputs. The other variables, including the trump suit and the two cards, are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: the trump suit is a string that is one of "S", "H", "D", or "C"; the two cards are represented as strings in the format of two characters, where the first character is one of "6", "7", "8", "9", "T", "J", "Q", "K", "A" representing the rank, and the second character is one of "S", "H", "D", or "C" representing the suit; the two cards must be different; `coz` is an input string.

Output State: **the trump suit is a string that is one of "S", "H", "D", or "C"; the two cards are represented as strings in the format of two characters, where the first character is one of "6", "7", "8", "9", "T", "J", "Q", "K", "A" representing the rank, and the second character is one of "S", "H", "D", or "C" representing the suit; the two cards must be different; `coz` is an input string.**
