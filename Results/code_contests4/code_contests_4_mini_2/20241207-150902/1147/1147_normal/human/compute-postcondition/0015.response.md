Postcondition: ***The trump suit is a string that is one of "S", "H", "D", or "C"; the two cards `f` and `s` are strings representing two different cards; `coz` is an input string. If the suit of card `f` is equal to `coz` and the suit of card `s` is not equal to `coz`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if the suit of card `f` is not equal to `coz` and the suit of card `s` is equal to `coz`, 'NO' is printed. If the suits of cards `f` and `s` are both equal to `coz` and their ranks are different, then if the rank of card `f` is greater than the rank of card `s` as defined in dictionary `d`, 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
