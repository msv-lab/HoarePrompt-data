Functionality: ** The function accepts a trump suit and two different cards represented as strings. It prints 'YES' if the first card's suit matches the trump suit and the second card's suit does not. It prints 'NO' if the first card's suit does not match the trump suit and the second card's suit does. If both cards have the same suit as the trump suit, it checks their ranks; if the rank of the first card is greater than the second's, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not validate the inputs for correctness beyond ensuring the cards are different.**
