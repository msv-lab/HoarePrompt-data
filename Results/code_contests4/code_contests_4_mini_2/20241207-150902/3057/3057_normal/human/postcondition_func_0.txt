The function accepts two integers, `steps` and `index`, read from input. It first checks if `index` is odd; if so, it prints 1. If `index` is even, it enters a loop that continues until `left` equals `right`, decrementing `steps` in each iteration based on comparisons of `index` and the midpoint of `left` and `right`. When the loop concludes, it prints the remaining value of `steps`. The function does not return any values but directly prints output based on the input conditions. It does not handle any input validation or edge cases for invalid inputs.
