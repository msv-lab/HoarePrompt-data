Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here are the issues:

1. **Variable Naming Confusion**: The variable `steps` is used both to count the number of steps (n - 1) and is decremented in the loop without clear correspondence to the intended logic of constructing the sequence.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Indices**: The loop logic attempts to navigate through a binary decision tree of sequence construction but does not effectively keep track of the actual sequence being constructed. The conditions used to adjust `left` and `right` do not align with the method of deriving the k-th element based on the sequence structure defined in the problem.

3. **Incorrect Output**: The program outputs `1` for all odd indices directly without considering the sequence generation rules appropriately. The output for even indices is also incorrect as it directly uses `steps` which has been decremented without a clear relationship to the actual sequence generation.

4. **Mathematical Errors**: The use of `/` for division should be replaced with integer division `//` to avoid floating point issues, especially when dealing with indices.

5. **Bounds Handling**: The loop does not adequately handle all possible values of `index` within the constraints provided, leading to potential logical errors.

Overall, the program does not correctly generate the sequence or derive the k-th element as specified in the problem description. Therefore, it fails to meet the requirements and is deemed incorrect.
