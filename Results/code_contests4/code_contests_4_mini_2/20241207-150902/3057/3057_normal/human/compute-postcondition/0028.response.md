The code assigns a new value to both `left` and `right`. However, we do not have initial values for `left` and `right` provided in the state. Since `steps` is decremented by 1 but not modified in the code snippet, it does not affect the output state either. Therefore, the output state only concerns the updated values of `left` and `right`. 

As `left` and `right` are both calculated using the expression `(right + left) / 2 + 1`, and since we do not have specific values for them, we cannot determine their exact values post-execution.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2^`n` - 1; `steps` is decremented by 1; `left` and `right` are updated to `(right + left) / 2 + 1`.**
