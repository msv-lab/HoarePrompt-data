Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2^`n` - 1; `steps` is decremented by 1. If `index` is less than the average of `left` and `right`, then `right` is updated to `(right + left) / 2 - 1`, and `left` remains undefined. Otherwise, if `index` is greater than the average of `left` and `right`, then `left` and `right` are updated to `(right + left) / 2 + 1`.***
