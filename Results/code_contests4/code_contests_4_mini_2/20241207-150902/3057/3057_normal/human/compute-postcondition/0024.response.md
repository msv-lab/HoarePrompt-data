Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2^`n` - 1; `steps` is decremented by 1. If `index` is less than (right + left) / 2, then `right` is modified based on its previous value and `left`. Otherwise, `left` and `right` are updated to (right + left) / 2 + 1.***
