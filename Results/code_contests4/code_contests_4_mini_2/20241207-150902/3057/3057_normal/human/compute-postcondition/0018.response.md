Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2^`n` - 1, `steps` is decremented by 1. If `index` is an even integer not equal to `2^{steps - 1}` and is less than the average of `right` and `left`, then `right` remains `2^{steps - 1} - 1` and `left` remains 1. Otherwise, `left` is updated to `2^{steps - 1} + 1` and `right` is updated to `2^{steps - 1} + 1`.***
