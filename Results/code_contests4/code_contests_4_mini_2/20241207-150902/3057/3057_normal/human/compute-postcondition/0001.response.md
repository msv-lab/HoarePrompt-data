The variable `index` is assigned the value `0`. The previous values of the affected variables are `n` (an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50), `k` (an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2^n - 1), and `steps` (which is 0). The assignment of `index` does not affect the other variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `index`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2^n - 1, `steps` is 0, `index` is 0**
