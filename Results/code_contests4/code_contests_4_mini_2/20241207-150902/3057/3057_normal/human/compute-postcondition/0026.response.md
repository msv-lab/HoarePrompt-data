The value of `steps` is decremented by 1. The initial state does not provide the value of `steps`, but it indicates that it can be any integer greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, after decrementing, `steps` will be at least 0. The states of the other variables (`n`, `k`) remain unchanged. Consequently, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2^`n` - 1; `steps` is decremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2^`n` - 1; `steps` is decremented by 1.**
