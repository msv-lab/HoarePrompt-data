`steps` is assigned the value `0`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2^n - 1, and `steps` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2^n - 1, and `steps` is 0**
