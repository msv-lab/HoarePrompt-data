The value of `index` is being converted from a string to an integer using `int(index)`. The previous state of `index` is an input string, and after execution, `index` will hold its integer equivalent. The other variables `n`, `k`, and `steps` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2^`n` - 1, `steps` is now an integer, `index` is now an integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2^`n` - 1, `steps` is now an integer, `index` is now an integer.**
