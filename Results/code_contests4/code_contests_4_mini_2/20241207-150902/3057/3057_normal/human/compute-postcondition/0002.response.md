The variables `steps` and `index` are assigned values from the `raw_input().split()` function, which takes user input and splits it into two separate values. Since `steps` and `index` were previously 0, the new values will overwrite these. The specific values of `steps` and `index` will depend on the input provided, which remains unknown at this point. 

Therefore, the output state reflects that `steps` and `index` are now assigned new values based on user input. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2^`n` - 1, `steps` is an input string, `index` is an input string**
