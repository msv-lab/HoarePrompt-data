The variable `right` is assigned the value of `int(math.pow(2, steps) - 1)`. The value of `steps` is currently unknown, but it will determine the value of `right`. Since `steps` is an integer, the value of `right` will be `2^steps - 1`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2^`n` - 1, `steps` is now an integer, `index` is now an integer, `left` is 1, and `right` is `2^steps - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2^`n` - 1, `steps` is now an integer, `index` is now an integer, `left` is 1, `right` is `2^steps - 1`**
