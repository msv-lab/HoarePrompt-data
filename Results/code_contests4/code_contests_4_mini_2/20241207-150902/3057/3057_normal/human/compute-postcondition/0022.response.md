The code assigns a new value to both `left` and `right`. The expression `(right + left) / 2 + 1` computes the average of `right` and `left`, adds 1 to it, and assigns the result to both `left` and `right`. However, since the initial values of `left` and `right` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical values they will take. Therefore, the output state reflects that `left` and `right` have been updated but their specific values are unknown. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2^`n` - 1, `steps` is decremented by 1; `left` and `right` are updated to (right + left) / 2 + 1.**
