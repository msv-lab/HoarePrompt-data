To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to verify if the program can correctly determine whether the right triangle with legs of lengths `a` and `b` can be placed on a coordinate plane with integer coordinates such that none of its sides are parallel to the axes.

### Analysis of the Code:
1. The program defines a function `func_1()` which calculates all possible right triangles with integer legs from 1 to 1000. It stores the legs and the hypotenuse in a list called `trips`.
2. It then retrieves the input values `a` and `b`.
3. The program checks if there exists a right triangle configuration where both `a` and `b` can be scaled by some integer factors derived from the right triangles in `trips`.
4. If such a configuration is found, it prints "YES" and the coordinates of the triangle vertices. If none is found, it prints "NO".

### Issues with the Program:
- The logic for determining if a triangle can be placed without any side being parallel to the axes is flawed. The triangle must not only have integer vertices but also must be positioned such that none of the sides align with the x or y-axis.
- The program checks the condition: `if i * mul1 != mul2 * j`, which attempts to ensure that the two sides do not lead to a vertical or horizontal alignment. However, this condition is not sufficient to guarantee that none of the triangle sides are parallel to the axes.

### Valid Test Case:
- Consider the input `1 1`. The correct output should be "NO" because a triangle with legs of length 1 cannot be placed without one leg being horizontal or vertical. The program appears to handle this correctly.
  
- However, for inputs like `1 2`, the program should be able to determine that a valid triangle configuration exists (for example, with vertices at `(1, 0)`, `(0, 2)`, and `(-1, -1)`), but we need to check the actual implementation if it produces the expected results for different combinations of `a` and `b`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not cover all edge cases correctly, and the logic for determining whether a triangle can be positioned as described is insufficient. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
