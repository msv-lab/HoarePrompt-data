The function generates all integer triplets (i, j, k) such that k is the integer value of the square root of the sum of squares of i and j, for all integers i and j from 1 to 1000. It then retrieves two integers a and b from a function `get_list()`. For each triplet, if both a and b are divisible by k and the condition i * (a // k) is not equal to (b // k) * j holds true, it calls another function `func_2()` with specific arguments and returns immediately. If none of the triplets satisfy the condition, it calls `func_2('NO')`. The function does not have explicit parameters and can return with no explicit value or return results from the `func_2()` calls.
