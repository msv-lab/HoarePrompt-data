To assess the correctness of the provided Python program based on the given problem description and output hints, let's break it down step by step.

### Problem Description
The task is to determine if it is possible to place a right triangle with integer leg lengths \(a\) and \(b\) on a coordinate plane such that none of its sides are parallel to the coordinate axes. If possible, we need to print the coordinates of the triangle vertices.

### Code Analysis
The main function (`func_1()`) generates all integer triplets (i, j, k) such that \(k\) is the integer value of the square root of \(i^2 + j^2\) for all integers \(i\) and \(j\) from 1 to 1000. It then checks whether both \(a\) and \(b\) are divisible by \(k\) and if \(i \cdot (a // k) \neq (b // k) \cdot j\).

#### Checking Conditions
1. **Divisibility Check**: The condition `if a % k == 0 and b % k == 0` ensures that \(a\) and \(b\) can be scaled down by \(k\).
2. **Non-parallel Check**: The condition `i * mul1 != mul2 * j` checks if the scaled triangle sides are not aligned with the coordinate axes.

### Output Hints
The output hints describe the functionality of the functions and confirm the conditions checked in the code.

### Edge Cases
1. **Minimum values**: For \(a = 1\) and \(b = 1\), the expected output is "NO". This is handled since there are no integer triplets (i, j, k) that can satisfy the conditions.
2. **Perfect squares**: For values like \(a = 5\) and \(b = 5\), the example output shows valid coordinates, indicating that the triangle can be placed correctly.
3. **General cases**: The function generates all integer triplets, so it should theoretically cover all cases for \(1 \leq a, b \leq 1000\).

### Conclusion
The logic in the code appears to align with the problem description. The conditions to check for both divisibility and non-parallel alignment are correctly implemented. The output hints also validate the functionality of the code.

However, while the function generates triplets, it does not explicitly return a configuration for all possible triangles, which could lead to scenarios where no valid triangle configuration is found even though theoretically one might exist based on the values of \(a\) and \(b\).

Based on the above analysis, while the code does cover expected scenarios, it may not be comprehensive in checking all cases for triangle placement since it relies heavily on certain generated triplet combinations. This could lead to cases where valid configurations are missed.

Correctness: **False**. 
The program does not guarantee a solution for all potential inputs of \(a\) and \(b\) within the specified range, particularly for combinations where a triangle can be positioned but is not represented in the generated triplets. An example could be when \(a\) and \(b\) are even numbers that do not relate to any generated triplet.
