Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` attempts to call `get_list()` to fetch the values of `a` and `b`, but there is no definition or import for `get_list()` in the provided code. This would result in a runtime error if executed, as the program wouldn't be able to retrieve the input values.

2. **Output Format**: The program uses `func_2` to print outputs, but it does not properly manage the arguments for `func_2`. The function appears to expect `*args` and `**kwargs`, but this is not defined in the function signature. This will lead to execution errors as well.

3. **Logic for Triangle Verification**: The logic used to determine if the triangle can be placed such that none of its sides are parallel to the coordinate axes is flawed. The program checks if both `a` and `b` are divisible by `k` (the hypotenuse), which does not ensure that the triangle can be placed without any sides being parallel to the axes. The requirement is more about the angles than the lengths being divisible.

4. **Lack of Valid Output Coordinates**: Even when the program finds a suitable condition to print "YES", the coordinates generated do not guarantee that the triangle is properly formed according to the specified constraints. The coordinates should be based on the given lengths `a` and `b` in such a way that no side is parallel to the axes, but the current logic does not ensure this.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program fails to account for edge cases such as when both sides are equal (e.g., `a = 1`, `b = 1` should directly return "NO", but the logic may not handle this correctly).

In summary, due to the incorrect input handling, erroneous logic for triangle placement, and potential runtime errors, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description accurately.
