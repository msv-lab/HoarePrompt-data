You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is a right triangle with legs of length a and b. Your task is to determine whether it is possible to locate the triangle on the plane in such a way that none of its sides is parallel to the coordinate axes. All the vertices must have integer coordinates. If there exists such a location, you have to output the appropriate coordinates of vertices.

Input

The first line contains two integers a, b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000), separated by a single space.

Output

In the first line print either "YES" or "NO" (without the quotes) depending on whether the required location exists. If it does, print in the next three lines three pairs of integers — the coordinates of the triangle vertices, one pair per line. The coordinates must be integers, not exceeding 109 in their absolute value.

Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000.
def func_1():
    trips = []
    for i in range(1, 1001):
        for j in range(1, 1001):
            k = (i ** 2 + j ** 2) ** 0.5
            if k.is_integer():
                k = int(k)
                trips.append([i, j, k])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000; `trips` contains all valid integer triplets `[i, j, k]` where k is calculated as the integer value of the square root of the sum of the squares of `i` and `j` for all `i, j` from 1 to 1000.
    a, b = get_list()
    for (i, j, k) in trips:
        if a % k == 0 and b % k == 0:
            mul1 = a // k
            mul2 = b // k
            if i * mul1 != mul2 * j:
                func_2('YES')
                func_2(0, 0)
                func_2(j * mul1, i * mul1)
                func_2(-i * mul2, j * mul2)
                return
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` and `b` are assigned values from `get_list()`, `trips` contains all the trips processed. If for any trip both `a` and `b` are divisible by `k` and `i * (a // k)` is not equal to `(b // k) * j`, the function would have returned, otherwise no return occurs. If no trip satisfies the divisibility condition, no operations are performed, and the variables remain unchanged.
    func_2('NO')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function generates all integer triplets (i, j, k) such that k is the integer value of the square root of the sum of squares of i and j, for all integers i and j from 1 to 1000. It then retrieves two integers a and b from a function `get_list()`. For each triplet, if both a and b are divisible by k and the condition i * (a // k) is not equal to (b // k) * j holds true, it calls another function `func_2()` with specific arguments and returns immediately. If none of the triplets satisfy the condition, it calls `func_2('NO')`. The function does not have explicit parameters and can return with no explicit value or return results from the `func_2()` calls.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000.
def func_2():
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        
        file.write(str(x))
        
        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000, `sep` is either a value from `kwargs` or a space, `file` is either a value from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, and the values of all elements in `args` have been written to `file`, separated by `sep` if there is more than one element in `args`.
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000, `sep` is either a value from `kwargs` or a space, `file` is either a value from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, and the value associated with `'end'` has been written to `file`. If the value of `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is True, the output buffer of `file` has been flushed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and prints the values of `args` to a specified output stream. The values are separated by a specified separator `sep`, which defaults to a space. The function also allows for an optional ending string `end` to be added after printing the values, defaulting to a newline. If the flush option is set to True, it flushes the output buffer of the file. However, the function does not handle any input for `args`, `kwargs`, or error handling, which may lead to issues if not properly provided during execution. Additionally, as the function does not return any value, its return type is implicitly `None`.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
