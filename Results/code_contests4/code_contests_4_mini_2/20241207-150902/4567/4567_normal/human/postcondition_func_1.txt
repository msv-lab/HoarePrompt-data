The function accepts no parameters and prints the values of `args` to a specified output stream. The values are separated by a specified separator `sep`, which defaults to a space. The function also allows for an optional ending string `end` to be added after printing the values, defaulting to a newline. If the flush option is set to True, it flushes the output buffer of the file. However, the function does not handle any input for `args`, `kwargs`, or error handling, which may lead to issues if not properly provided during execution. Additionally, as the function does not return any value, its return type is implicitly `None`.
