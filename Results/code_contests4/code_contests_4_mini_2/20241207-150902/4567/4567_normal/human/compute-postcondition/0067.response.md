Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are assigned values from `get_list()`, `trips` contains at least one trip, `i` is the first element, `j` is the second element, `k` is the third element of the first trip in `trips`, both `a` and `b` are divisible by `k`, `mul1` is assigned the value of `a // k`, `mul2` is assigned the value of `b // k`, and the relationship `i * mul1` is equal to `mul2 * j` holds true.***
