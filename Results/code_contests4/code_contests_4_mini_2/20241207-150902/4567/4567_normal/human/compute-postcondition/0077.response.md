Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are assigned values from `get_list()`, `trips` contains at least two trips; `i`, `j`, and `k` are the first, second, and third elements of the next trip in `trips`; `mul1` is calculated as `a // k`, and `mul2` is calculated as `b // k`. If `i * mul1` is not equal to `mul2 * j`, the function returns None. There is no specified behavior for the else part, and thus it remains undefined.***
