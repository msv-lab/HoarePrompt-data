The `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))` line attempts to write a value to `file`. It retrieves the value associated with the key `'end'` from `kwargs` and removes it. If the key `'end'` is not present in `kwargs`, it defaults to a newline character `'\n'`. The other variables (`a`, `b`, `sep`, `at_start`, and the previous state of `file`) are not affected by this operation.

Hence, the Output State is determined by the effect of popping from `kwargs` and writing to `file`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000, `sep` is either a value from `kwargs` or a space, `file` is either a value from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, and the value associated with `'end'` has been written to `file`, defaulting to `'\n'` if not present.**
