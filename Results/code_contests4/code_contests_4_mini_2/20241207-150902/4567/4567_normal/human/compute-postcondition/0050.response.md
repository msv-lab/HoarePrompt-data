The variable `k` is assigned the value of the square root of the sum of the squares of `i` and `j`. The exact value of `k` depends on the value of `i`, which is not specified in the initial state. However, `j` is given as 3. Since `a` and `b` are integers within the range of 1 to 1000, they do not affect the calculation of `k`. Thus, the output state reflects the relationship between `i` and `j`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000; `j` is 3; `k` is (i ** 2 + 3 ** 2) ** 0.5**.
