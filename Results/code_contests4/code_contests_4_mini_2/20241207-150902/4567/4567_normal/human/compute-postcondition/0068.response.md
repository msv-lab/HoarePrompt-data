Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are assigned values from `get_list()`, `trips` contains at least one trip with `i`, `j`, and `k` being the first, second, and third elements of that trip respectively. If both `a` and `b` are divisible by `k`, then `mul1` is assigned the value of `a // k`, `mul2` is assigned the value of `b // k`, and the relationship `i * mul1` is equal to `mul2 * j` holds true.***
