The variable `mul2` is assigned the value of `b // k`, where `b` is a value from `get_list()` and `k` is the third element of the next trip in `trips`. The values of `a`, `b`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged, and the only new assignment is `mul2`. Therefore, the output state includes the previously assigned values of `a` and `b`, as well as the result of the integer division.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are assigned values from `get_list()`, `trips` contains at least three trips; `i`, `j`, and `k` are the first, second, and third elements of the next trip in `trips`; `mul1` is assigned the value of `a // k`; `mul2` is assigned the value of `b // k`.**
