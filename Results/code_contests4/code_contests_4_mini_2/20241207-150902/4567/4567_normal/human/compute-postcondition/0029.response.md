The code appends a list containing the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` to the `trips` list. The value of `j` is given as 3, and `k` is an integer with an unknown specific value. The values of `a` and `b` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000; `j` is 3; `k` is an integer; and we append the list `[i, 3, k]` to `trips`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000; `j` is 3; `k` is an integer; and we append the list `[i, 3, k]` to `trips`.**
