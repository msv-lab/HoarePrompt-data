`k` is assigned the value `int(k)`, which converts `k` into an integer. Since `k` is already defined as an integer (the square root of (`i` squared plus `1` squared)), its value remains unchanged after the conversion. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000, `j` is 1, `k` is an integer.

Output State: **`a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000, `j` is 1, `k` is an integer**
