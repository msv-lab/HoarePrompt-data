Output State: **`a` and `b` are assigned values from `get_list()`, `trips` contains all the trips processed. If for any trip both `a` and `b` are divisible by `k` and `i * (a // k)` is not equal to `(b // k) * j`, the function would have returned, otherwise no return occurs. If no trip satisfies the divisibility condition, no operations are performed, and the variables remain unchanged.**
