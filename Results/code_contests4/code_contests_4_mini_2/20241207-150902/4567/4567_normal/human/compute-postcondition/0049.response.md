According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 1000, since it iterates from 1 to 1000 (inclusive of 1 and exclusive of 1001). At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.

So, after the last iteration, `j` becomes 3, and the loop will execute again as long as `j` is less than 1001.

State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000; `j` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `j` must be less than 1001.**
