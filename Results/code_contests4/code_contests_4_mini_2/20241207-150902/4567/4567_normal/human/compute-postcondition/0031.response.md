According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `j`, which is currently 3. The loop is set to iterate over a range from 1 to 1000 (inclusive). For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3, so for the loop to execute a fourth time, `j` must be 4. The range condition is still satisfied since 4 is within the bounds of 1 to 1000.

State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000; `j` is 4**
