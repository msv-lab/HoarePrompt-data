To analyze the impact of the code, we start with the initial state:

- `a` and `b` are assigned values from `get_list()`.
- `trips` contains at least three trips.
- `i`, `j`, and `k` are the first, second, and third elements of the next trip in `trips`.

The line of code provided is:
```
mul1 = a // k
```

Here, `mul1` is assigned the value of `a` divided by `k` using integer division (`//`). The specific values of `a` and `k` are not given, but we know they exist based on the initial state. 

Since `mul1` is directly influenced by the values of `a` and `k`, the output state will reflect these assignments.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are assigned values from `get_list()`, `trips` contains at least three trips; `i`, `j`, and `k` are the first, second, and third elements of the next trip in `trips`; `mul1` is assigned the value of `a // k`.**
