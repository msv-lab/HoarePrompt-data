Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000, `sep` is either a value from `kwargs` or a space, `file` is either a value from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, and the value associated with `'end'` has been written to `file`. If the value of `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is True, the output buffer of `file` has been flushed.***
