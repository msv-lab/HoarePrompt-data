The value of `k` is assigned the value of `int(k)`, which converts `k` to an integer. Since the previous value of `k` is not provided and the only information available is that `k` is (i, it suggests `k` may not have a definite numeric value at this point. Other variables (`a`, `b`, `j`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000; `j` is 3; `k` is now an integer.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000; `j` is 3; `k` is now an integer**.
