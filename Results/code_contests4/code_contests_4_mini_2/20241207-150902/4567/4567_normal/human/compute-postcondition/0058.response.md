Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are assigned values from `get_list()`, for the loop to execute the first time `trips` must contain at least one trip, `i` is the first element, `j` is the second element, `k` is the third element of the first trip in `trips`, and both `a` and `b` are divisible by `k`.***
