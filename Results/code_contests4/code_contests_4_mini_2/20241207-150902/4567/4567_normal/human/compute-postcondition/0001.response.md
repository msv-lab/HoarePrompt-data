The variables `sep` and `file` are assigned values based on the `kwargs` dictionary. The `sep` variable takes the value of the 'sep' key from `kwargs`, or defaults to a space if that key does not exist. The `file` variable takes the value of the 'file' key from `kwargs`, or defaults to `sys.stdout` if that key does not exist. The values of `a` and `b` remain unaffected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 1000; `sep` is either a value from `kwargs` or a space; `file` is either a value from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 1000; `sep` is either a value from `kwargs` or a space; `file` is either a value from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout**
