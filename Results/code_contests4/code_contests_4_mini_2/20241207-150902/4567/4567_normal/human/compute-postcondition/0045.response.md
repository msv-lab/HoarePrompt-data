The variable `k` is assigned the value of the expression `(i ** 2 + j ** 2) ** 0.5`. Given that `j` is 2, the expression simplifies to `k = (i ** 2 + 2 ** 2) ** 0.5`, which means `k` will be calculated based on the value of `i`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `trips` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000, `j` is 2, and `k` is calculated as `(i ** 2 + 4) ** 0.5`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000, `j` is 2, and `k` is calculated as `(i ** 2 + 4) ** 0.5`.**
