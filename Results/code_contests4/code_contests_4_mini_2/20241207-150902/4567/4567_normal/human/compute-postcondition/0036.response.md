Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000; `j` is 1001 (which is outside the range of the loop), and `trips` contains all valid integer triplets [i, j, k] where k is calculated as the integer value of the square root of the sum of the squares of `i` and `j` for all `j` from 1 to 1000 that result in an integer value for k.**
