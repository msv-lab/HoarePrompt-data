In the given code snippet, the statement `trips.append([i, j, k])` appends a new list containing the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` to the `trips` list. The variable `j` is known to be 4, and `k` is an integer derived from the calculation involving `i`. However, the specific values of `i` and `k` are not provided in the initial state. The output state will reflect that a new trip has been added with the known value of `j` and the placeholder for `i` and `k`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000; `j` is 4; `k` is an integer; a new trip [i, 4, k] is appended to trips.**
