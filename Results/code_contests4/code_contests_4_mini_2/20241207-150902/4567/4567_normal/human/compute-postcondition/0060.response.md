The variable `mul2` is assigned the value of `b // k`. Since both `a` and `b` are divisible by `k`, this means that the division will yield an integer result. The previous value of `b` is not specified, but since it is divisible by `k`, `mul2` will be some integer value based on the specific value of `b` and `k`. The other variables (`a`, `trips`, `i`, `j`, `k`, and `mul1`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are assigned values from `get_list()`, `trips` contains at least one trip, `i` is the first element, `j` is the second element, `k` is the third element of the first trip in `trips`, both `a` and `b` are divisible by `k`, `mul1` is assigned the value of `a // k`, and `mul2` is assigned the value of `b // k`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are assigned values from `get_list()`, `trips` contains at least one trip, `i` is the first element, `j` is the second element, `k` is the third element of the first trip in `trips`, both `a` and `b` are divisible by `k`, `mul1` is assigned the value of `a // k`, `mul2` is assigned the value of `b // k`.**
