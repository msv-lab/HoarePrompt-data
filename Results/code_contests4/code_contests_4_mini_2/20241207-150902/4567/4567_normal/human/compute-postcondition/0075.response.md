To analyze the provided code snippet and its impact on the initial state:

1. The initial state indicates that `a` and `b` have values from `get_list()`, and `trips` contains at least two trips where `i`, `j`, and `k` are the first, second, and third elements of the next trip in `trips`. 
2. The values of `mul1` and `mul2` are calculated as `a // k` and `b // k`, respectively.
3. The function `func_2` is called with arguments `-i * mul2` and `j * mul2`. This function returns (0, 0), but the output of the function does not affect any variables in the initial state.
4. The initial state variables `a`, `b`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `mul1`, and `mul2` remain unchanged by the function call.

Since the values of `a`, `b`, `i`, `j`, and `k` are based on `get_list()` and `trips`, and since the function call does not alter any of these variables, the output state reflects their unchanged status and the result of the function call.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are values from `get_list()`, `trips` contains at least two trips; `i`, `j`, and `k` are the first, second, and third elements of the next trip in `trips`; `mul1` is `a // k`, `mul2` is `b // k`; `func_2` returns (0, 0)**.
