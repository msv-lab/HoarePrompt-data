The `file.flush()` method is called, which clears the output buffer for the `file`, ensuring that all written data is physically written to the underlying file or output stream. The values of the other variables (`a`, `b`, `sep`, `at_start`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the flush operation. Since the value associated with `'end'` has already been written to `file`, the output state remains unchanged for those variables.

Output State: **`a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000, `sep` is either a value from `kwargs` or a space, `file` is either a value from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, the value associated with `'end'` has been written to `file`, and the value of `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is True; the output buffer of `file` has been flushed.**
