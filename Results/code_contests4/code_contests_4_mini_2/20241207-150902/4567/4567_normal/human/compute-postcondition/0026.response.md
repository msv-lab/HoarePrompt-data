According to the code, the loop iterates over a range from 1 to 1000, which means it will execute as long as `j` is less than 1000. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1, making it 3. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` remains less than 1001.

State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000, `j` is 3, and `k` is an integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than 1001.**
