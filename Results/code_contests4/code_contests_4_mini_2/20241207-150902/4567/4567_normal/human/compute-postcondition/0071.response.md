The variable `mul2` is assigned the value of `b // k`, where `b` is a value assigned from `get_list()` and `k` is the third element of the next trip in `trips`. The previous value of `b` remains unchanged, and `k` is also unchanged. The operation performs integer division of `b` by `k`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are assigned values from `get_list()`, `trips` contains at least two trips; `i`, `j`, and `k` are the first, second, and third elements of the next trip in `trips`; `mul1` is calculated as `a // k`, and `mul2` is calculated as `b // k`.
