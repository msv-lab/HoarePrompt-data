According to the code, the for loop iterates over `i` from 1 to 1000. The loop will execute once for each value of `i`, starting from 1 and ending at 1000. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1001, which indicates that the loop has completed its iterations because `j` exceeds the upper limit of the `range` function. 

Since `i` is currently at 1001 (after the last iteration has completed), it indicates that the loop will not execute again because the range has been exhausted. The loop will not execute again since there are no valid integers for `i` in the range from 1 to 1000 after this last execution.

Thus, there are no adjustments needed to the states for the loop to execute again, as it has already completed all its iterations.

State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000; `j` is 1001, for the loop to execute again `i` must be greater than 1000 (which will not happen within the current range).**
