The code appends a list containing the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` to the list `trips`. The variable `j` is 1, but the values of `i` and `k` are not specified in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects that a new trip entry is added, but the specific values of `i` and `k` are unknown.

Output State: **`a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000, `j` is 1, `k` is an integer; a new trip entry [i, 1, k] is appended to trips**.
