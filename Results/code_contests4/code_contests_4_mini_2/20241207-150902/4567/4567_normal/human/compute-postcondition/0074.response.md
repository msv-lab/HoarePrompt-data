The code snippet involves calling a function `func_2` with two arguments, `j * mul1` and `i * mul1`. The variables `a`, `b`, `i`, `j`, and `k` are defined prior, with `mul1` calculated as `a // k` and `mul2` as `b // k`. The function `func_2` returns two values: 0 and 0, which do not affect the state of the other variables.

The calculations for the arguments passed to `func_2` are as follows:
- The value of `mul1` is determined by the integer division of `a` by `k`.
- The arguments passed to `func_2` are `j * mul1` and `i * mul1`.

Since the values of `a`, `b`, `i`, `j`, and `k` are not specified, we can only describe the output state based on the multiplication and the function call.

The output state therefore reflects the unchanged variables and the action of calling the function:
Output State: **`a` and `b` are assigned values from `get_list()`, `trips` contains at least two trips; `i`, `j`, and `k` are the first, second, and third elements of the next trip in `trips`; `mul1` is calculated as `a // k`, `mul2` is calculated as `b // k`; function `func_2` is called with arguments `j * mul1` and `i * mul1` and returns 0, 0.**
