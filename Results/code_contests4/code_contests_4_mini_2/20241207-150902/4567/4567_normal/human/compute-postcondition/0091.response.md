The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It has three different cases for its return values. In Case_1, the function ends execution and returns with no explicit value. In Case_2, the function returns `None` since there is no value specified to return. In Case_3, the function returns the result of a function call with specific arguments derived from calculations involving `b` and other variables. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to execute different return behaviors based on internal logic without taking any input parameters.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and can return with no explicit value, return None, or return the result of a function call with specific arguments.**
