Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are assigned values from `get_list()`, `trips` contains at least three trips, `i`, `j`, and `k` are the first, second, and third elements of the next trip in `trips`, `mul1` is assigned the value of `a // k`, and `mul2` is assigned the value of `b // k`. If `i * mul1` is not equal to `mul2 * j`, the program returns the result of the function call with arguments `(-i * (b // k), j * (b // k))`. If `i * mul1` is equal to `mul2 * j`, there is no return value.***
