The variable `a` is assigned the value obtained by splitting the string `s` into individual components, converting each component from a string to an integer using `map(int, ...)`, and then converting that map object into a list. The previous values of `a` and `b` are not directly affected by this operation, but now `a` will be a list of integers derived from the string `s`. The variable `n` remains unchanged as well. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of integers derived from string `s`, `b` remains unchanged, and `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers derived from string `s`, `b` remains unchanged, and `n` remains unchanged.**
