Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. According to the problem, the function must compute the number of excellent numbers of length exactly `n` that only contain the digits `a` and `b`, with the additional requirement that the sum of the digits is also a good number. 

However, the annotated program simply initializes a list `a` with a fixed set of integers parsed from a string. It does not take any parameters, nor does it perform any calculations or logic related to the digits `a`, `b`, and `n`. Therefore, it fails to implement any of the necessary logic to determine the number of excellent numbers as outlined in the problem description.

In conclusion, because the function does not address the core requirements of counting excellent numbers based on the definitions provided, it is incorrect.
