Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not implement the logic required to count the excellent numbers based on the problem description. Instead, it simply initializes a list of integers from a string without performing any computation related to the parameters `a`, `b`, and `n`.

To illustrate a specific case where the program fails to meet the requirements, consider the example input `1 3 3`:

- According to the problem description, we need to count all the excellent numbers of length 3 that use only the digits 1 and 3. 
- The valid "good" numbers of length 3 composed of 1 and 3 are: 111, 113, 131, 133, 311, 313, 331, and 333.
- Among these, we need to check which ones are "excellent" (i.e., the sum of the digits is also a good number). 
- The number 111 has a digit sum of 3 (which is good), and 113 has a digit sum of 5 (not good), continuing this process would yield that only 111 and 333 are excellent.

However, since the program does not perform any of this logic, it does not produce the correct count of excellent numbers and thus does not meet the problem's requirements. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
