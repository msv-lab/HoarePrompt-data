You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vitaly is a very weird man. He's got two favorite digits a and b. Vitaly calls a positive integer good, if the decimal representation of this integer only contains digits a and b. Vitaly calls a good number excellent, if the sum of its digits is a good number.

For example, let's say that Vitaly's favourite digits are 1 and 3, then number 12 isn't good and numbers 13 or 311 are. Also, number 111 is excellent and number 11 isn't. 

Now Vitaly is wondering, how many excellent numbers of length exactly n are there. As this number can be rather large, he asks you to count the remainder after dividing it by 1000000007 (109 + 7).

A number's length is the number of digits in its decimal representation without leading zeroes.

Input

The first line contains three integers: a, b, n (1 ≤ a < b ≤ 9, 1 ≤ n ≤ 106).

Output

Print a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).

a = list(map(int, s.split()))
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
