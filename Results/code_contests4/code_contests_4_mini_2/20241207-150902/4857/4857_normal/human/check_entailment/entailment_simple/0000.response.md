To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze both the problem requirements and the logic of the program.

### Problem Requirements:
Vanya wants to build a pyramid with `n` cubes. The levels of the pyramid are built such that:
- Level 1 requires 1 cube.
- Level 2 requires 1 + 2 = 3 cubes.
- Level 3 requires 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 cubes.
- Level i requires 1 + 2 + ... + i = (i * (i + 1)) / 2 cubes.

The task is to find the maximum height of the pyramid that can be built with `n` cubes.

### Program Analysis:
1. The function reads an integer `x` from input, which represents the number of cubes (n).
2. It initializes several variables:
   - `i` (total cubes used so far) to 0.
   - `k` (the current level) to 1.
   - `c` (the count of levels built) to 0.
3. The `while` loop continues as long as there are enough cubes remaining (i.e., `x - (i + k) >= 0`).
4. Inside the loop:
   - `i` is incremented by `k` (the cubes needed for the current level).
   - `x` is decremented by `i` (the total cubes used so far).
   - `c` is incremented by 1 (indicating one more level has been built).
   - `k` is incremented by 1 (moving to the next level).
5. After exiting the loop, `c` is printed, which represents the maximum height of the pyramid that can be built with the given cubes.

### Correctness Check:
- The loop correctly checks if there are enough cubes to build the next level (`x - (i + k) >= 0`).
- The increment of `i` by `k` accurately accumulates the number of cubes used for each level.
- The final output `c` correctly represents the number of levels that can be built with the available cubes, as it incrementally counts the levels until cubes run out.

### Conclusion:
The program follows the problem description accurately. It determines the maximum height of the pyramid that can be constructed with the given number of cubes according to the specified rules.

Thus, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
