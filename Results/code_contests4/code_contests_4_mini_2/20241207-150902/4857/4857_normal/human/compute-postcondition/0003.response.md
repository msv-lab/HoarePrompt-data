The variable `c` is assigned the value of 0. The previous values of the affected variables `n`, `x`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000; `x` is an input integer; `i` is 0; `k` is 1; `c` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000; `x` is an input integer; `i` is 0; `k` is 1; `c` is 0**
