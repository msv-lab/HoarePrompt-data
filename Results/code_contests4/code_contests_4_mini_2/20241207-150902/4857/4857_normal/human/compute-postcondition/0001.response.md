The variable `i` is initialized with the value 0. The initial state of `n` remains unchanged, and the variable `x` is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000; `x` is an input integer; `i` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000; `x` is an input integer; `i` is 0**
