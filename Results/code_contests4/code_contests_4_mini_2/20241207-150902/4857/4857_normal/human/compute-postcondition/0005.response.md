The value of `i` is incremented by `k`, where `k` is 1 and `i` is initially 0. Therefore, after execution, `i` becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000; `x` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is 1; `k` is 1; `c` is 0**
