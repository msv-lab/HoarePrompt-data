`k` is assigned the value `k + 1`, where the previous value of `k` is 2. Therefore, after execution, `k` becomes 3. The states of the other variables (`n`, `x`, `i`, `c`) are not affected. Thus, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000; `x` is updated to `x - 3`; `i` is 3; `k` is 3; `c` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000; `x` is updated to `x - 3`; `i` is 3; `k` is 3; `c` is 2**
