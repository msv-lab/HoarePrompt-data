In this case, `x` is updated to `x - i`. The current value of `i` is 6. Therefore, `x` will be decreased by 6. The specific value of `x` is not provided in the initial state, but it is mentioned that it is updated by this operation. The values of `n` and `k` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000; `x` is updated to `x - 6`; `i` is 6; `k` is 3**
