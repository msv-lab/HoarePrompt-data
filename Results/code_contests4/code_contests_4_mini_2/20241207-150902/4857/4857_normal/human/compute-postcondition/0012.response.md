`c` is assigned the value of `c + 1`. The previous value of `c` is 1, so after execution, `c` becomes 2. The states of the other variables (`n`, `x`, `i`, `k`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000; `x` is updated to `x - 3`; `i` is 3; `k` is 2; `c` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000; `x` is updated to `x - 3`; `i` is 3; `k` is 2; `c` is 2**
