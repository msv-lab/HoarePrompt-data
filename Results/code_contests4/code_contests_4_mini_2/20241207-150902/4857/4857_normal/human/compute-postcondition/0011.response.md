The value of `x` is updated to `x - i`, where `i` is 3. Given that `x` previously must have been at least 4 for the loop to execute again, we can deduce that `x` was at least 4 before this operation. Therefore, after executing `x = x - i`, the new value of `x` becomes `x - 3`. 

Since the initial value of `x` is not specified but must have been at least 4, the output state reflects that `x` has decreased by 3. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000; `x` is updated to `x - 3`; `i` is 3; `k` is 2; `c` is 1**
