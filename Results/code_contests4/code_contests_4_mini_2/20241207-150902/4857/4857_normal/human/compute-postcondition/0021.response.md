The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer constrained by the condition that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10,000. However, since the output is not specified in the provided information, we cannot determine the exact return value of the function. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `n` that falls within the specified range. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10,000. The return value is not specified.**
