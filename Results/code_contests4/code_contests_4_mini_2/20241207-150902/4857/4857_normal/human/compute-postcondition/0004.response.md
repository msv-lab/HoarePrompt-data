According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x`, `i`, and `k`. The condition for the loop to execute is that `x - (i + k)` must be greater than or equal to 0. 

Right before the loop, we have:
- `i` is 0
- `k` is 1

Thus, the expression becomes `x - (0 + 1)`, which simplifies to `x - 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `x - 1` must be greater than or equal to 0, meaning `x` must be at least 1.

Since `n` is an integer that can range from 1 to 10,000, and `x` is an input integer, we need to ensure that `x` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, at least the following adjustment is needed:
- `x` must be greater than or equal to 1.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000, `x` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `k` is 1, `c` is 0**
