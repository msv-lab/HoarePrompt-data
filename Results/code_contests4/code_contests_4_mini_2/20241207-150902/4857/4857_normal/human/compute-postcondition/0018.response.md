`k` is assigned the value `k + 1`. The previous value of `k` is 3, so after execution, `k` becomes 4. The values of `n`, `x`, `i`, and `c` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000; `x` is updated to `x - 6`; `i` is 6; `k` is 4; `c` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000; `x` is updated to `x - 6`; `i` is 6; `k` is 4; `c` is incremented by 1.**
