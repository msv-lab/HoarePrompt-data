The value of `i` is incremented by `k`, which is 2. Therefore, `i` becomes `1 + 2`, resulting in `i` being 3. The other variables (`n`, `x`, `k`, and `c`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000; `x` is updated to `x - 1` and for the loop to execute again, `x` previously must have been at least 4; `i` is 3; `k` is 2; `c` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000; `x` is updated to `x - 1` and for the loop to execute again, `x` previously must have been at least 4; `i` is 3; `k` is 2; `c` is 1**
