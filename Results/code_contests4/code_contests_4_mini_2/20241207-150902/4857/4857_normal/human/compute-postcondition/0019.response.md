To analyze the loop's output state after all iterations have executed, we consider the nature of the loop and how the variables change.

The loop continues as long as `x - (i + k) >= 0`. During each iteration:
- `i` is incremented by `k`.
- `x` is decremented by the new value of `i`.
- `c` is incremented by 1.
- `k` is incremented by 1.

The loop effectively calculates the maximum number of times it can subtract increasing triangular numbers from `x` until it can no longer do so. 

After all iterations of the loop:
1. The value of `x` will be the remainder after subtracting the largest triangular number that can be formed with the increments of `k`.
2. The value of `i` will be the last value incremented based on the final `k`.
3. The value of `c` will represent how many times the loop executed.

Since `n`, given the constraints 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000, does not directly affect the calculations within the loop but only sets the context for valid input, we keep it as it is.

The final output state reflects the final values of `x`, `i`, `k`, and `c` once the loop can no longer execute.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000; `x` is the remainder after subtracting the largest possible sum of consecutive integers from the initial `x`; `i` is the last value incremented before exiting the loop; `k` is the final incremented value which will be greater than the last used `k`; `c` is the total number of successful iterations of the loop.**
