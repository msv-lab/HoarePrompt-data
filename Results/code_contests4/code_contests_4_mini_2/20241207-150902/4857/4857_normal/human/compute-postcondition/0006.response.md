The value of `x` is decremented by `i`. Given that `i` is 1, `x` is updated to `x - 1`. The previous value of `x` is greater than or equal to 1, so the new value of `x` will be at least 0. The values of `n`, `i`, `k`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000; `x` is updated to `x - 1`; `i` is 1; `k` is 1; `c` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000; `x` is updated to `x - 1`; `i` is 1; `k` is 1; `c` is 0**
