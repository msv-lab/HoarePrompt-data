The code `print(c)` outputs the value of `c`. Since the other variables (`n`, `x`, `i`, and `k`) are not affected by this line of code, their values remain unchanged. The value of `c`, which represents the total number of successful iterations of the loop, will be displayed as the output.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000; `x` is the remainder after subtracting the largest possible sum of consecutive integers from the initial `x`; `i` is the last value incremented before exiting the loop; `k` is the final incremented value which will be greater than the last used `k`; `c` is the total number of successful iterations of the loop, and `c` is printed.**
