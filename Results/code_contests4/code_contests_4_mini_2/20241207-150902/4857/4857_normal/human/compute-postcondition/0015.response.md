The value of `i` is updated by adding `k` to it. Since `k` is 3 and the previous value of `i` is also 3, the new value of `i` becomes 3 + 3 = 6. The values of `n` and `x` are not directly affected by this operation. Thus, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000; `x` is updated to `x - 3`; `i` is 6; `k` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000; `x` is updated to `x - 3`; `i` is 6; `k` is 3**
