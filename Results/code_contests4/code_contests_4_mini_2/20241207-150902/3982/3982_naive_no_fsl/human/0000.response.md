Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly compute the minimum number of moves needed to make the configuration of robbers safe from the searchlights. One potential case where the program fails is when the coordinates of robbers and searchlights are such that all robbers start at the same position, and there are searchlights positioned in a way that requires more specific movement than the program accounts for.

For example, consider the following input:

```
2 2
0 0
0 0
1 1
1 1
```

In this case, both robbers start at (0, 0) and both searchlights are at (1, 1). The correct logic would require moving robbers at least 1 unit right and 1 unit up. Thus, the minimum number of moves should be 2 to make the configuration safe. However, the program's logic may not handle this correctly due to its reliance on binary search and the way it handles relative positions, potentially leading to an incorrect result.

The core issue is that the program does not adequately handle all combinations of robber and searchlight coordinates and the simultaneous movement constraints, which can lead to incorrect calculations of the number of moves needed.
