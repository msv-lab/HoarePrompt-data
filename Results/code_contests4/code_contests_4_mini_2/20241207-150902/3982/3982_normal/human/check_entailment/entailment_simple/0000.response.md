To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. We have `n` robbers located at specific coordinates `(a_i, b_i)` and `m` searchlights located at coordinates `(c_j, d_j)`.
2. The robbers can be moved either all to the right (increasing `a_i` by 1) or all up (increasing `b_i` by 1) in a single move.
3. A configuration is safe if no searchlight can see any robber, meaning for every robber `i` and searchlight `j`, the conditions `a_i ≤ c_j` and `b_i ≤ d_j` must not hold simultaneously.
4. The goal is to find the minimum number of moves required to reach a safe configuration.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program begins by reading the number of robbers and searchlights, followed by their respective coordinates. This is done correctly through `func_2` and `func_4`.

2. **Relative Position Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the relative positions of searchlights with respect to robbers. It computes `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y`, which are the differences between searchlight and robber coordinates. This part of the program is crucial for determining how far the robbers need to be moved to ensure they are not seen by the searchlights.

3. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The program implements a binary search to find the minimum number of moves required to ensure no searchlight can see any robber.
   - It iterates through possible move counts and checks if there exists a configuration that keeps robbers safe from all searchlights using the accumulated values in the `avail` array.
   - The conditions used to update `avail` and the checks for `psum_min` are designed to ensure that if `psum_min` is greater than 0, it indicates a safe configuration.

### Logical Consistency:
- The logic of moving robbers in a way that avoids detection by searchlights is consistent with the problem statement.
- The implementation of binary search is appropriate for minimizing the number of moves, and the checks for visibility are correctly applied.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to determine the minimum number of moves needed to ensure all robbers are safe from being seen by the searchlights. It adheres to the problem description and systematically solves the problem as described.

Therefore, the output regarding correctness is:

Correctness: **True**
