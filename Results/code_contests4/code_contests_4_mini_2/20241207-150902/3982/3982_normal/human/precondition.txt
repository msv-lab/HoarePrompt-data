n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000; robbers' coordinates (a_i, b_i) are pairs of non-negative integers with 0 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^6 for each robber i (1 ≤ i ≤ n); searchlights' coordinates (c_j, d_j) are pairs of non-negative integers with 0 ≤ c_j, d_j ≤ 10^6 for each searchlight j (1 ≤ j ≤ m).
