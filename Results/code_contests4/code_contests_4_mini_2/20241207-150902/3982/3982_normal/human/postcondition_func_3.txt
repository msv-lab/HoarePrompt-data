The function accepts two integer parameters `n` and `m`, where `n` represents the number of times to call `func_2()`. It returns a list containing the results of calling `func_2()` exactly `n` times. The value of `m` is not utilized within this function. Thus, the functionality does not depend on `m`, and `n` must be between 1 and 2000, resulting in a list of outputs from `func_2()`.
