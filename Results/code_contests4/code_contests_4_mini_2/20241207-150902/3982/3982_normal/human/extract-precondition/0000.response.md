Precondition: **f is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers representing the coordinates of robbers, and dim is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers representing the coordinates of searchlights. The number of robbers and searchlights is such that 1 ≤ len(f), len(dim) ≤ 2000, and the coordinates are non-negative integers not exceeding 10^6.**
