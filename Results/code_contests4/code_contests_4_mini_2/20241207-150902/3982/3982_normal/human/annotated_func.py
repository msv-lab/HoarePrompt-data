#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and performs calculations based on the results of `func_2()` and `func_4()`. It processes the coordinates of robbers and searchlights, determining relative positions and executing a binary search to find the maximum value `l` such that certain conditions about the availability of lights are met. Finally, it prints the result of this binary search. The function does not return any value.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000; the coordinates of robbers (a_i, b_i) are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^6 for each robber i (1 ≤ i ≤ n); the coordinates of searchlights (c_j, d_j) are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ c_j, d_j ≤ 10^6 for each searchlight j (1 ≤ j ≤ m).
def func_2():
    return [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained from the user input, split by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns a list of integers derived from user input, where the input is expected to be a space-separated string of integers. It does not handle any exceptions that may arise from invalid input, such as non-integer values.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: o is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (a_i, b_i) representing the coordinates of robbers for the first n entries, followed by m tuples where each tuple contains two integers (c_j, d_j) representing the coordinates of searchlights. The values n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000, and 0 ≤ a_i, b_i, c_j, d_j ≤ 10^6.
def func_3(o):
    return [(int(x) + o) for x in input().split()]
    #The program returns a list of integers resulting from adding each integer from the input split by spaces to the list 'o', which contains tuples of coordinates for robbers and searchlights.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of tuples `o` containing coordinates of robbers and searchlights, but it does not utilize this input. Instead, it reads a line of input from the user, splits it into components, converts them to integers, and adds the variable `o` (which is a list) to each integer from the input. This will result in a list of integers, where each integer is the sum of an input integer and the list `o`. However, this operation does not make sense in the context of adding a list to an integer, leading to a potential TypeError. Therefore, the function may result in an error rather than returning a meaningful output.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000; the coordinates of the robbers are given as pairs of integers (a_i, b_i) for i in range(n) with 0 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^6; the coordinates of the searchlights are given as pairs of integers (c_j, d_j) for j in range(m) with 0 ≤ c_j, d_j ≤ 10^6.
def func_4(n, m):
    return [func_2() for _ in range(n)]
    #The program returns a list of results from calling func_2() n times, where n is an integer between 1 and 2000. Each result corresponds to the output of func_2() for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters `n` and `m`, where `n` represents the number of times to call `func_2()`. It returns a list containing the results of calling `func_2()` exactly `n` times. The value of `m` is not utilized within this function. Thus, the functionality does not depend on `m`, and `n` must be between 1 and 2000, resulting in a list of outputs from `func_2()`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: f is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers representing the coordinates of robbers, and dim is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers representing the coordinates of searchlights. The number of robbers and searchlights is such that 1 ≤ len(f), len(dim) ≤ 2000, and the coordinates are non-negative integers not exceeding 10^6.
def func_5(f):
    return [func_5(f, *dim[1:]) for _ in range(dim[0])] if dim else f()
    #The program returns a list generated by the function func_5 applied to the list of tuples f (coordinates of robbers) and all but the first tuple of dim (coordinates of searchlights), repeated dim[0] times, if dim is not empty; otherwise, it returns the result of calling f()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of tuples `f`, which represents the coordinates of robbers. It uses a variable `dim` (assumed to be defined elsewhere) that contains tuples representing searchlight coordinates. If `dim` is not empty, the function returns a list generated by recursively applying `func_5` to `f` and all but the first tuple of `dim`, repeated `dim[0]` times. If `dim` is empty, it calls and returns the result of the function `f()`. However, the code lacks handling for the `dim` variable's definition, which could lead to a NameError if `dim` is not properly initialized.
