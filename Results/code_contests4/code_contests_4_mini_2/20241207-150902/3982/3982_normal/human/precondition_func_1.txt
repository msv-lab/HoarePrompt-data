n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000; the coordinates of robbers (a_i, b_i) are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^6 for each robber i (1 ≤ i ≤ n); the coordinates of searchlights (c_j, d_j) are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ c_j, d_j ≤ 10^6 for each searchlight j (1 ≤ j ≤ m).
