o is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (a_i, b_i) representing the coordinates of robbers for the first n entries, followed by m tuples where each tuple contains two integers (c_j, d_j) representing the coordinates of searchlights. The values n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000, and 0 ≤ a_i, b_i, c_j, d_j ≤ 10^6.
