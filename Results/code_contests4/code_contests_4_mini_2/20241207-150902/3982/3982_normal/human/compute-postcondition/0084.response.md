The value of `x` is assigned the value from `rel_lights_x[i]`, where `i` is 1. The value of `n` is greater than 0, which allows the loop to execute, but we do not have information about the actual contents of `rel_lights_x` at index 1. However, the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `x` is assigned the value from `rel_lights_x[1]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x` is assigned the value from `rel_lights_x[1]**
