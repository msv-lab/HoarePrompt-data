According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `avail` collection. If `avail` contains at least one element, the loop will execute. The states `n`, `i`, `x`, `y`, `psum_min`, `psum`, and `ans` do not directly impact the ability of the loop to execute, but they may be relevant for the loop body. 

To ensure the loop executes for the first time, we need to confirm that `avail` is non-empty. Since we do not have information on the contents of `avail`, we cannot specify its exact state. Thus, we need to state that `avail` must contain at least one element.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `ans + n`, `avail` contains at least 1 element, `x` is the last assigned value from `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` is the last assigned value from `rel_lights_y[n-1]; `psum_min` is set to INF, `psum` is 0, `ans` is updated to `l + (r - l) // 2`**
