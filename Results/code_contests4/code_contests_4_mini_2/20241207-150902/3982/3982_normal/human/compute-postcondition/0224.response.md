The line of code `psum_min = min(psum_min, psum)` assigns `psum_min` the minimum value between its current value and the value of `psum`. The previous state indicates that `psum_min` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `psum`, and since `psum` is increased by `ax`, we know that `psum` is at least the value of `ax`.

Since `n` is greater than or equal to 0, and `i` is equal to `ans + n`, these variables do not affect the execution of the code snippet directly. The variable `avail` contains at least 2 elements, and `ax` is the next element in `avail`, which contributes to the increment of `psum`, but does not directly influence `psum_min` in this line.

Therefore, after executing the code snippet, the output state remains focused on the updated value of `psum_min`, which is now the minimum of its previous value and the new value of `psum`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `ans + n`, `avail` contains at least 2 elements, `ax` is the next element in `avail`, `psum_min` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `psum`.**
