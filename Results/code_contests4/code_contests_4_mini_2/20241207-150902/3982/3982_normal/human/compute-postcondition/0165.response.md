The `psum_min` variable is assigned the minimum value between its current value and the value of `psum`. The initial state indicates that `psum_min` is `ax` and that `psum` has been increased by `ax`. Therefore, `psum` is now greater than or equal to `ax`. This means that `psum_min` will either retain its current value of `ax` or be updated to the value of `psum`, which is greater than or equal to `ax`. 

Given these observations, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `ans + n`, `avail` contains at least one more item, `x` and `y` are the last assigned values from `rel_lights_x[n-1]` and `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `psum_min` is either `ax` or `psum`, `psum` is increased by `ax`.
