The variable `psum` is increased by the value of `ax`. Given that `psum` is either `ax` or `psum`, the new value of `psum` will be `psum + ax`. The initial conditions state that `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `ans + n`, `avail` contains at least one more item, and `x` and `y` are the last assigned values from `rel_lights_x[n-1]` and `rel_lights_y[n-1]`. However, since only `psum` is affected by this operation, the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `ans + n`, `avail` contains at least one more item, `x` and `y` are the last assigned values from `rel_lights_x[n-1]` and `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `psum_min` is either `ax` or `psum`, `psum` has been increased by `ax`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `ans + n`, `avail` contains at least one more item, `x` and `y` are the last assigned values from `rel_lights_x[n-1]` and `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `psum_min` is either `ax` or `psum`, `psum` has been increased by `ax`.**
