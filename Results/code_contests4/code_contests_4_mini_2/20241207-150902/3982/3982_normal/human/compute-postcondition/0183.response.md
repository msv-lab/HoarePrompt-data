The loop iterates from 0 to `ans`, setting each `avail[i]` to 0 for every iteration. After all iterations are completed, the values of `n`, `i`, `x`, `y`, `psum_min`, `psum`, and `ans` remain unchanged, while `avail` will have the first `ans + 1` elements set to 0. If `ans` is 0, then only `avail[0]` will be set to 0; if `ans` is greater than 0, then the first `ans + 1` elements from `avail` will be set to 0.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `ans + n`, `avail` has the first `ans + 1` elements set to 0 and the rest unchanged, `x` and `y` are the last assigned values from `rel_lights_x[n-1]` and `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `psum_min` is the minimum value among all items in `avail`, `psum` is the sum of all items in `avail`, `ans` is updated to `l + (r - l) // 2`.**
