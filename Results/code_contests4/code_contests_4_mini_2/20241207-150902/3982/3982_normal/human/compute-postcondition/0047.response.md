Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `robbers` is a list containing at least 3 tuples, `lights` is not empty, `lx` and `ly` are the first elements of the first tuple in `lights`. If both `x` and `y` are greater than or equal to 0, then `rel_lights_x` contains the previous elements plus `x`, and `rel_lights_y` contains the previous elements plus `y`.***
