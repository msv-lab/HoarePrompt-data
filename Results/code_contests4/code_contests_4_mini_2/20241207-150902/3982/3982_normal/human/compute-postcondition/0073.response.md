The value of `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[i]`. Since `i` is 0, `x` will take the value of `rel_lights_x[0]`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[0]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[0]**
