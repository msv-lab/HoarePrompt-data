`y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[i]`, where `i` is 1. The variable `rel_lights_y` is not defined in the initial state, but since `i` is known, `y` will be assigned the value at index 1 of `rel_lights_y`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x` is assigned the value from `rel_lights_x[1]`, `y` is assigned the value from `rel_lights_y[1]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x` is assigned the value from `rel_lights_x[1]`, `y` is assigned the value from `rel_lights_y[1]`**
