Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x` is assigned the value from `rel_lights_x[1]`, `y` is assigned the value from `rel_lights_y[1]`, `sp` is determined based on the expression `max(0, x - (x + y - ans))`, and `avail[sp]` is increased by 1. If `ep` is less than `ans`, `ep` is assigned the value of `min(ans, x)` and `avail[ep + 1]` is decreased by 1.***
