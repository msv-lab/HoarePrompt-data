According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `lights` list. If the list contains at least three tuples, the loop can execute again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `lights` contains at least two tuples with elements `lx` and `ly`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least three tuples, and `(lx, ly)` should be the third tuple in the list.

State: **`n` and `m` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `robbers` is a list containing at least one tuple with elements `rx` and `ry`; if `x` (calculated as `lx - rx`) and `y` (calculated as `ly - ry`) are both non-negative, then `rel_lights_x` includes the value of `x`, `rel_lights_y` is updated to include the value of `y`, and `lights` contains at least three tuples with elements `lx` and `ly`.**
