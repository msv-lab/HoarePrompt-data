According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `lights` list. If the list has at least 3 tuples, the loop can execute again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `lights` contains at least 2 tuples, and `lx` and `ly` are the first elements of the second tuple in `lights`. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, `lights` must have at least 3 tuples, and `lx` and `ly` will then be assigned the values of the next tuple in the `lights` list. If we assume that the next tuple is the third tuple, then `lx` and `ly` will be the first and second elements of that tuple.

State: **`n` and `m` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `robbers` is a list containing at least 3 tuples, `lights` is a list containing at least 3 tuples, `lx` and `ly` are the first and second elements of the third tuple in `lights`, and if `x` and `y` are both non-negative, then `x` is appended to `rel_lights_x` and `y` is appended to `rel_lights_y`.**
