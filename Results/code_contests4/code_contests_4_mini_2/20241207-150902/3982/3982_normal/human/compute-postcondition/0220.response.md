The code `psum += ax` increments the value of `psum` by the value of `ax`. The current value of `psum` is `0 + ax`, which is already calculated as `psum`. Therefore, after this execution, `psum` becomes `psum + ax`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `ans + n`, `avail` contains at least 1 element, `x` is the last assigned value from `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` is the last assigned value from `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `psum` is updated to `0 + ax + ax`, `ans` is updated to `l + (r - l) // 2`, for the loop to execute one more time `avail` must contain at least 2 elements and `ax` is the next element in `avail`.**
