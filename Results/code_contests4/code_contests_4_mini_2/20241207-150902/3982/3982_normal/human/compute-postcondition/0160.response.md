According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `avail`. For the loop to execute, `avail` must contain at least one element. Given that `n` is greater than or equal to 0, if `n` is 0, then `avail` would be an empty list, and the loop would not execute. 

To ensure that the loop executes at least once, we need to adjust the state to indicate that `n` must be greater than 0, which implies that `avail` can be populated with values in the loop prior to execution. Additionally, we can state that `i` will need to be set accordingly.

Thus, for the loop to execute, we should have `n` greater than 0, and `i` can be set to `ans + n` with `avail` containing at least one element. 

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `ans + n`, `avail` contains at least one item, `x` and `y` are the last assigned values from `rel_lights_x[n-1]` and `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `psum_min` is INF, `psum` is 0**
