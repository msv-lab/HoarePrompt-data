The statement `avail[i] = 0` assigns the value 0 to the `i`-th element of the `avail` list. Since `i` is defined as `n + 1`, this means that `avail[n + 1]` is set to 0. The other variables (`n`, `ans`, `psum`, `psum_min`, `r`, and `l`) remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `avail` has its `n`-th element set to 0, `avail[n + 1]` is now 0, `ans` is greater than or equal to `n + 1`, `psum` is the sum of elements in `avail`, `psum_min` is 0, `r` is 500000, `l` must be less than 500000.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `avail` has its `n`-th element set to 0, `avail[n + 1]` is now 0, `ans` is greater than or equal to `n + 1`, `psum` is the sum of elements in `avail`, `psum_min` is 0, `r` is 500000, `l` must be less than 500000**
