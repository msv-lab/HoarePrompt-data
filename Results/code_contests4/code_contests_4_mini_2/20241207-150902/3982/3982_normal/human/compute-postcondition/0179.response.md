According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit of the range, which is `ans + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `ans + n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `ans + 1`.

Since `i` is currently `ans + n`, for the next iteration, `i` will increase by 1. Therefore, to execute again, `ans + n` must be less than `ans + 1`, which implies that `n` must be less than 1.

At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `ans + n + 1`.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `ans + n + 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be less than 1**
