Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `ans + n`, `avail` is updated based on the values from `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` for all `n` iterations, `x` and `y` are the last assigned values from `rel_lights_x[n-1]` and `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, if all `x + y` are greater than or equal to `ans`, then `avail` reflects the counts based on the calculated `sp` and `ep` values for all iterations.**
