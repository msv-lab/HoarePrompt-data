`l` is assigned the value of `ans + 1`. Given that `ans` is unchanged at 500000, the value of `l` becomes 500001. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `avail`, `psum`, `psum_min`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `avail` contains `k` elements, `ans` is 500000, `psum` is the sum of elements in `avail`, `psum_min` is greater than 0, and `l` is 500001.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `avail` contains `k` elements, `ans` is 500000, `psum` is the sum of elements in `avail`, `psum_min` is greater than 0, and `l` is 500001.**
