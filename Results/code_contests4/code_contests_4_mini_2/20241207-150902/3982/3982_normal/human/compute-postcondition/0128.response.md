According to the provided code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. The current state indicates that `n` is greater than or equal to 0, which means it could be 0 and thus the loop would not execute. 

In order to ensure that the loop executes, we need to adjust the value of `n` to be at least 1. Additionally, the value of `i` starts at `ans + 1`, which is relevant for the loop's iterations but does not affect whether the loop can start executing.

Thus, for the loop to execute the first time, we need to specify that `n` is greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `ans + 1`**
