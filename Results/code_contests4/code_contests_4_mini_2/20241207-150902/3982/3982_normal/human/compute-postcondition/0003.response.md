The code initializes `rel_lights_x` as an empty list. This assignment does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, or `robbers`, which were previously assigned values returned by `func_2()` and `func_4()`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of those variables along with the new assignment.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are assigned values returned by `func_2()`; `robbers` is assigned the value returned by `func_4(n, 2)`; `lights` is assigned the value returned by `func_4(m, 2)`; `rel_lights_x` is an empty list.**
