Functionality: ** The function does not accept any parameters and performs calculations based on the results of `func_2()` and `func_4()`. It processes the coordinates of robbers and searchlights, determining relative positions and executing a binary search to find the maximum value `l` such that certain conditions about the availability of lights are met. Finally, it prints the result of this binary search. The function does not return any value. **
