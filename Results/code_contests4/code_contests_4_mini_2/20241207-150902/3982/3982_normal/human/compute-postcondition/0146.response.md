Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `ans + 2`, `i` is `ans + 2`, `x` is assigned from `rel_lights_x[ans + 2]`, `y` is assigned from `rel_lights_y[ans + 2]`, `sp` is max(0, ans - y), and `ep` is min(ans, x). If `ep` is less than `ans`, then `avail[sp]` is increased by 1 and `avail[ep + 1]` is decreased by 1.***
