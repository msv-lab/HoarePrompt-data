Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `robbers` is a list containing at least 3 tuples, `lights` is a list containing at least 2 tuples, `lx` and `ly` are the first elements of the second tuple in `lights`, and if `x` and `y` are both non-negative, then `x` is appended to `rel_lights_x` and `y` is appended to `rel_lights_y`.***
