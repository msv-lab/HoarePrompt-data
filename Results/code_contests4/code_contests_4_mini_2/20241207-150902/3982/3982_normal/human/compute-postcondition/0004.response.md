The code initializes a new variable `rel_lights_y` as an empty list. The previous values of the affected variables, `n`, `m`, `robbers`, `lights`, and `rel_lights_x`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are assigned values returned by `func_2()`; `robbers` is assigned the value returned by `func_4(n, 2)`; `lights` is assigned the value returned by `func_4(m, 2)`; `rel_lights_x` is an empty list; `rel_lights_y` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are assigned values returned by `func_2()`; `robbers` is assigned the value returned by `func_4(n, 2)`; `lights` is assigned the value returned by `func_4(m, 2)`; `rel_lights_x` is an empty list; `rel_lights_y` is an empty list.**
