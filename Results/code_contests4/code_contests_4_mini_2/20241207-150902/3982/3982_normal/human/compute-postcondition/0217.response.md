The variable `psum` is incremented by `ax`. The value of `ax` is not provided in the initial state, but since `psum` was previously 0, the new value of `psum` will be `0 + ax`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `ans + n`, `avail` contains at least 1 element, `x` is the last assigned value from `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` is the last assigned value from `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `psum_min` is set to INF, `psum` is `0 + ax`, `ans` is updated to `l + (r - l) // 2`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `ans + n`, `avail` contains at least 1 element, `x` is the last assigned value from `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` is the last assigned value from `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `psum_min` is set to INF, `psum` is `0 + ax`, `ans` is updated to `l + (r - l) // 2`**
