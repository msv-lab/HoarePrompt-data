The variable `rel_lights_y` is modified by appending the value of `y` to it. The value of `y` is determined by the calculation `ly - ry`, and since this value is not specified, we can refer to it as it is. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is calculated as lx - rx; `y` is calculated as ly - ry; `robbers` is a list containing at least two tuples; `lights` contains at least three tuples; `rel_lights_x` has x appended to it; `rel_lights_y` now contains the previous values along with the new value of `y`.

Output State: **`x` is calculated as lx - rx; `y` is calculated as ly - ry; `robbers` is a list containing at least two tuples; `lights` contains at least three tuples; `rel_lights_x` has x appended to it; `rel_lights_y` now contains the previous values along with the new value of `y`.**
