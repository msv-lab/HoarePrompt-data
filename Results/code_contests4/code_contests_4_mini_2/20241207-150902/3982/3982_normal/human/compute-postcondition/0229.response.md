The variable `l` is assigned the value of `ans + 1`. The value of `ans` is already defined as `ans + n`, so the new value of `l` will be `ans + 1`. The other variables `n`, `i`, `avail`, `x`, `y`, `psum`, and `psum_min` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `ans + n`, `avail` is a list containing all its original elements, `x` is the last assigned value from `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` is the last assigned value from `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `psum` is the sum of all elements in `avail`, `psum_min` is greater than 0, and `l` is equal to `ans + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `ans + n`, `avail` is a list containing all its original elements, `x` is the last assigned value from `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` is the last assigned value from `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `psum` is the sum of all elements in `avail`, `psum_min` is greater than 0, and `l` is equal to `ans + 1**.
