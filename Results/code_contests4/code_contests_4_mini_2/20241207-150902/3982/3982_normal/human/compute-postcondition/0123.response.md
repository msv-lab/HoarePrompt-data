According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `ans`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `ans`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n`, and `ans` is greater than or equal to 0. 

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become `n + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `ans` must be greater than or equal to `n + 1`.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `avail` has its `n`-th element set to 0, `ans` is greater than or equal to `n + 1`, `psum` is the sum of elements in `avail`, `psum_min` is 0, `r` is 500000, `l` must be less than 500000**.
