The variable `rel_lights_x` is a list that already contains non-negative values of `lx - rx` for tuples in `lights` where `lx >= rx`. The variable `x` is assigned the value of `lx - rx`, and since `rel_lights_x` is being appended with `x`, it means `x` is a non-negative value due to the previous assignment. The other variables, `n`, `m`, `robbers`, `rel_lights_y`, and `y`, remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State includes the updated `rel_lights_x` list with the new value of `x` appended.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `robbers` is a list containing at least two tuples, `rel_lights_x` includes all previous non-negative values plus the new value `x`, `rel_lights_y` includes the new value of `y`, `x` is assigned the value of `lx - rx`, and `y` is assigned the value of `ly - ry` from the second tuple in `lights`.**
