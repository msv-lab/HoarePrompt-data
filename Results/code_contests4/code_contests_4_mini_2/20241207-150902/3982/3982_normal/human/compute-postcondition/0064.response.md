The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `l + (r - l) // 2`. Given that `l` is 0 and `r` is 1000001, we can calculate the result as follows:

1. Calculate `(r - l)`: 
   - `(1000001 - 0) = 1000001`.

2. Calculate the integer division by 2: 
   - `1000001 // 2 = 500000`.

3. Finally, add `l` to this result:
   - `0 + 500000 = 500000`.

The other variables remain unchanged, so the output state will represent the computed value of `ans`.

Output State: **`n` is the length of `rel_lights_x`, `m` remains unchanged, `robbers` is a list of tuples, `lights` contains tuples with elements `lx` and `ly`, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, `avail` is a list of zeros with length 1000002; `ans` is 500000**.
