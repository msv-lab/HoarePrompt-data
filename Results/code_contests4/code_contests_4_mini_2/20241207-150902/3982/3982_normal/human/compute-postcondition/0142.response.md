To analyze the provided code snippet, we first note the initial conditions of the variables:

- `n` is greater than `ans + 2`
- `i` is `ans + 2`
- `x` is assigned the value from `rel_lights_x[ans + 2]`
- `y` is assigned the value from `rel_lights_y[ans + 2]`

Now, let's evaluate the code:

```
sp = max(0, x - (x + y - ans))
```

1. The expression inside the `max` function needs to be calculated. We simplify the expression:
    - `x + y - ans` is the sum of `x` and `y`, minus the value of `ans`.
    - Thus, `x - (x + y - ans)` simplifies to `x - x - y + ans`, which results in `ans - y`.

2. The value of `sp` will then be the maximum of `0` and `ans - y`. Since `n` is greater than `ans + 2`, we can infer that `ans` is less than `n - 2`, but we do not know the specific values of `ans`, `x`, or `y`.

Since the output state requires mentioning the resulting value of `sp` based on the calculations made, we must state it in terms of the variables involved.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `ans + 2`, `i` is `ans + 2`, `x` is assigned from `rel_lights_x[ans + 2]`, `y` is assigned from `rel_lights_y[ans + 2]`, `sp` is max(0, ans - y)**
