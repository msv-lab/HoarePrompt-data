According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `lights` list. If `lights` contains at least one more tuple after the current one, the loop can execute again for that additional tuple. At the end of the last iteration, `lights` has been processed up to the second tuple, and since `robbers` is a list containing at least two tuples, we can assume that there are more tuples in `lights`.

Assuming the loop has processed the first two tuples in `lights`, the next tuple to be processed will be the third tuple in the list. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `lights` must have at least three tuples.

State: **`n` and `m` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `robbers` is a list containing at least two tuples, and for the loop to execute a third time, `lights` must contain at least three tuples, processing the third tuple `(lx, ly)` from `lights`.**
