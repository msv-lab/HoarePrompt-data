According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `avail` list. If `avail` contains at least one more item, the loop can execute again for the next item. At the end of the last iteration, `avail` contains at least one item, and `ax` is the last assigned value from `avail`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments must be made:
- `ax` must be the next item in the `avail` list.
- Since `ax` is iterating over `avail`, we assume that the loop will continue with the next item, so we will track the index of `ax` as it moves to the next item in `avail`.
- We don't have a specific count of items in `avail`, but since it contains at least one item, we can denote that there should be at least one more item remaining for another iteration.

Thus, if there are more items in `avail`, the conditions for the next iteration should be noted. 

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `ans + n`, `avail` contains at least one more item, `x` and `y` are the last assigned values from `rel_lights_x[n-1]` and `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `psum_min` is `ax`, `psum` is `ax` for the loop to execute a second time**
