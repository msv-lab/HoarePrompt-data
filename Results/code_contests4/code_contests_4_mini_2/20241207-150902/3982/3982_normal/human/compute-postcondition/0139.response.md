According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop iterates while `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `ans + 1`, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become `ans + 2`. Since `n` must be greater than `i` for the loop to continue executing, at the start of the next iteration, `n` must be greater than `ans + 2`.

State: **`n` is greater than `ans + 2`, `i` is `ans + 2`, `x` will be assigned a value from `rel_lights_x[ans + 2]`, `y` will be assigned a value from `rel_lights_y[ans + 2]`.**
