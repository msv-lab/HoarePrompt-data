According to the code, the loop will execute for each element in the `avail` list. Since `avail` contains at least 1 element at the end of the last iteration, the loop has executed at least once. The variable `ax` takes on the value of the current element in `avail` on each iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `ans + n`, and `avail` still contains at least 1 element. If the loop is to execute one more time, `ax` will take the next element from the `avail` list. 

If `avail` had `m` elements, then after the last iteration, `ax` would have been assigned the value of the `(k-1)`th element of `avail`, where `k` is the current iteration count (starting from 1). For the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than or equal to `m`, so `ax` will now take the value of the `k`th element in `avail`.

Therefore, we need to track the current iteration count, which can be inferred from the number of iterations completed. 

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `ans + n`, `avail` contains at least 1 element, `x` is the last assigned value from `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` is the last assigned value from `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `psum_min` is updated to `min(INF, 0 + ax)`, `psum` is `0 + ax`, `ans` is updated to `l + (r - l) // 2`, for the loop to execute one more time `avail` must contain at least 2 elements and `ax` is the next element in `avail`.**
