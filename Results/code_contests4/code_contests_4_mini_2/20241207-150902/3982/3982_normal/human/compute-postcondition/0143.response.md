The variable `ep` is assigned the value of `min(ans, x)`. The values of `ans` and `x` are known based on the initial state. Since `n` is greater than `ans + 2` and `i` is equal to `ans + 2`, it implies that `x` is assigned from `rel_lights_x[ans + 2]`, and therefore `x` has a specific value from that assignment. 

The function `min()` will return the smaller of `ans` and `x`. The exact value of `ep` will depend on the specific values of `ans` and `x`, which are not provided in the initial state but are constrained by it.

Thus, we conclude that `ep` is a specific value derived from `min(ans, x)` where `x` is determined by `rel_lights_x[ans + 2]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `ans + 2`, `i` is `ans + 2`, `x` is assigned from `rel_lights_x[ans + 2]`, `y` is assigned from `rel_lights_y[ans + 2]`, `sp` is max(0, ans - y), `ep` is min(ans, x)**.
