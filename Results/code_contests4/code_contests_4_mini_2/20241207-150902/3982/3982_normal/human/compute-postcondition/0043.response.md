To analyze the code snippet, we need to consider the initial state and how the assignment affects the variables.

1. `lx` and `ly` are the first elements of the first tuple in `lights`. 
2. `rx` and `ry` are not defined in the initial state, so we do not have specific values for them.
3. The code `x, y = lx - rx, ly - ry` will compute `x` and `y` based on the values of `lx`, `ly`, `rx`, and `ry`. However, since we do not know the values of `rx` and `ry`, we cannot compute exact values for `x` and `y`.

Therefore, we can conclude that:
- `x` will be `lx - rx`
- `y` will be `ly - ry`

The output state will reflect that `x` and `y` are dependent on the values of `lx`, `ly`, `rx`, and `ry`, but we cannot specify their exact values without knowing `rx` and `ry`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `robbers` is a list containing at least 3 tuples, `lights` is not empty, `lx` and `ly` are the first elements of the first tuple in `lights`; `x` is `lx - rx`, `y` is `ly - ry`.**
