The code `rel_lights_x.append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the list `rel_lights_x`. Prior to this line, `x` was calculated as `lx - rx`, and since it is stated that `x` and `y` are non-negative, this means that `x` has a valid value to be added to the list. The other variables mentioned in the initial state are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` and `m` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `robbers` is a list containing at least one tuple with elements `rx` and `ry`; `x` is calculated as `lx - rx`, `y` is calculated as `ly - ry`; `rel_lights_x` now includes the value of `x`, `rel_lights_y` is updated to include the value of `y`, and `lights` contains at least three tuples with elements `lx` and `ly`.**
