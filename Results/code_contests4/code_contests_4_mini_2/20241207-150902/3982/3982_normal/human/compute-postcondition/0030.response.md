According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `lights` list. For the loop to execute a second time, there must be at least two tuples in the `lights` list remaining after the current iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `lights` contains at least one tuple, so for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least two tuples remaining. 

The next tuple to be unpacked in the loop will be the second tuple in the `lights` list. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, we need to consider that the current tuple being processed is `(lx, ly)`, and we need to update the state accordingly.

State: **`n` and `m` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `robbers` is a list containing at least two tuples, `rel_lights_x` contains all non-negative values of `lx - rx` for tuples in `lights` where `lx >= rx`, and `rel_lights_y` includes the new value of `y`, where `y` is the value of `ly - ry` from the second tuple in `lights`, for the loop to execute a second time `lights` must contain at least two tuples.**
