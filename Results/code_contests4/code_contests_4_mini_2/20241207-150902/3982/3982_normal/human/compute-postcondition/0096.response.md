The variable `ep` is assigned the value of `min(ans, x)`. The values of `ans` and `x` are not provided, but `x` is equal to `rel_lights_x[2]`. The value of `ans` is not defined in the initial state, but since `n` is greater than 0, we can assume that `ans` is a positive integer.

The output state will consider that `ep` is determined by the minimum value of `ans` and `x`, which could yield different results based on the actual values of `ans` and `rel_lights_x[2]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `x` is equal to `rel_lights_x[2]`, `y` is equal to `rel_lights_y[2]`, and `ep` is assigned the value `min(ans, x)`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `x` is equal to `rel_lights_x[2]`, `y` is equal to `rel_lights_y[2]`, `ep` is assigned the value `min(ans, x)`**.
