According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `ans + n + 1`, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. 

Since `i` is currently `ans + n + 1`, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `ans + n + 1`. However, since `n` is already greater than 0, we must increase `i` for the next iteration. Thus, `i` will increment by 1, making it `ans + n + 2`.

Therefore, we need to state that `n` must still be greater than `ans + n + 2` for the loop to execute a second time.

State: **`n` is greater than 0; `i` is `ans + n + 2`; for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than `ans + n + 2`**
