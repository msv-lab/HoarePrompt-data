The value of `psum_min` is updated to the minimum value between its current value (`psum_min`) and the value of `psum`. Since `psum` is equal to `ax`, and `psum_min` starts as `INF`, the minimum will be `psum` (which is `ax`) as long as `ax` is a finite number. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `ans + n`, `avail` contains at least one item, `x` and `y` are the last assigned values from `rel_lights_x[n-1]` and `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `psum_min` is `ax`, and `psum` is `ax`.
