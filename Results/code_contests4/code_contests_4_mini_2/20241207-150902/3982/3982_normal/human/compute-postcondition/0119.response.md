According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `r`. For the loop to execute again, `l` must be less than `r`. At the end of the last iteration, we have `l` is set to 500001 if `psum_min` is greater than 0, and `r` is assigned the value 500000 if `psum_min` is equal to 0 (or remains unchanged otherwise). 

Given that `l` is equal to 500001, and `r` is equal to 500000, we can see that `l` is not less than `r`. Therefore, to allow the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust `l` to be less than `r`. This means we need to set `l` to a value less than 500000.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `avail` contains `k` elements, `ans` remains unchanged at 500000, `psum` is the sum of elements in `avail`, `psum_min` is equal to 0, then `psum_min` is set to 0 and `r` is assigned the value 500000, and for the loop to execute again `l` must be less than 500000**
