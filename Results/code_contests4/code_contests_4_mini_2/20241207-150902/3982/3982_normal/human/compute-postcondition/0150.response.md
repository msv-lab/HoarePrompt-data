The variable `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[i]`. The value of `i` is `ans + 3`, and since `n` is greater than `ans + 3`, it indicates that there are valid indices for `rel_lights_y`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than `ans + 3`; `i` is `ans + 3`; `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[i]`; `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `ans + 3`; `i` is `ans + 3`; `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[i]`; `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[i]`**.
