The variable `ep` is assigned the value of `min(ans, x)`. The previous values of the affected variables are not specified, but we know that `n` is greater than `ans + 3`, `i` is `ans + 3`, and `sp` is `max(0, ans - y)`. The exact values of `ans` and `x` are unknown, so `ep` will be the minimum of those two values. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than `ans + 3; `i` is `ans + 3; `sp` is `max(0, ans - y); `ep` is `min(ans, x)`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `ans + 3; `i` is `ans + 3; `sp` is `max(0, ans - y); `ep` is `min(ans, x)`**
