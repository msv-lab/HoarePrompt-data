Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0; `i` is `ans + n + 2`; `y` is assigned from `rel_lights_y[i]`. If `x + y` is greater than or equal to `ans`, then `sp` is the maximum of `0` and `x - (x + y - ans)`, `ep` is assigned the value of `min(ans, x)`, `avail[sp]` is increased by 1, and if `ep` is less than `ans`, then `avail[ep + 1]` is decreased by 1.***
