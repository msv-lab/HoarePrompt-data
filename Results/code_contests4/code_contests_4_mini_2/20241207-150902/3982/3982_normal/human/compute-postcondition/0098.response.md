The code `avail[ep + 1] -= 1` decreases the value of `avail` at the index `ep + 1` by 1. The variable `ep` is assigned the value `min(ans, x)`, but we do not have specific values for `ans` or `x`. Therefore, the exact index `ep + 1` cannot be determined without more information. However, the operation still affects the `avail` array.

Since `avail[sp]` was previously increased by 1, the state of the `avail` array will change at the index `ep + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `x` is equal to `rel_lights_x[2]`, `y` is equal to `rel_lights_y[2]`, `ep` is assigned `min(ans, x)`, and `avail[ep + 1]` is decreased by 1.**
