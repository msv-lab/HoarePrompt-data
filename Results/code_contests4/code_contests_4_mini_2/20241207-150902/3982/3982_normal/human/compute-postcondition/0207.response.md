To analyze the impact of the code snippet, we first observe the initial state:

- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is `ans + n + 2`
- `y` is assigned the value from `rel_lights_y` at index `i`

Now, we have the following code:

```
sp = max(0, x - (x + y - ans))
```

Next, we will break down the computation of `sp`:

1. The expression `x + y - ans` is calculated.
2. The value of `sp` will be the maximum of `0` and the result of the expression `x - (x + y - ans)`.

Since we do not have specific values for `x`, `ans`, or `rel_lights_y`, we must acknowledge that `y` depends on the value at index `i` in `rel_lights_y`, and `i` is influenced by `ans` and `n`.

Thus, the output state should reflect the relationships and computations without exact values:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `i` is `ans + n + 2`; `y` is assigned from `rel_lights_y[i]`; `sp` is the maximum of `0` and `x - (x + y - ans)`**.
