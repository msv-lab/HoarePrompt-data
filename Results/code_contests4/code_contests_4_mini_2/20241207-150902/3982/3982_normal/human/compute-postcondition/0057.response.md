Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `robbers` is a list containing at least 3 tuples, `lights` is a list containing at least 3 tuples, `lx` and `ly` are the first and second elements of the third tuple in `lights`, `x` is calculated as `lx - rx`, and `y` is calculated as `ly - ry`. If both `x` and `y` are non-negative, then `y` is appended to `rel_lights_y`.***
