The variable `y` is assigned the value from `rel_lights_y[i]`. The previous value of `i` is `ans + n`, and since `n` is greater than 0, `i` is guaranteed to be greater than `ans`. The specific values of `rel_lights_y` and `ans` are unknown, but `y` will now hold the value from the `rel_lights_y` list at the index `i`.

Since other variables (`n`, `i`, `avail`, `x`, `psum_min`, `psum`, `ans`) are not affected by this assignment, the output state reflects the assignment of `y`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `ans + n`, `avail` has the first `ans + 1` elements set to 0 and the rest unchanged, `x` is assigned the value from `rel_lights_x[i]`, `y` is assigned the value from `rel_lights_y[i]`, `psum_min` is the minimum value among all items in `avail`, `psum` is the sum of all items in `avail`, `ans` is updated to `l + (r - l) // 2**
