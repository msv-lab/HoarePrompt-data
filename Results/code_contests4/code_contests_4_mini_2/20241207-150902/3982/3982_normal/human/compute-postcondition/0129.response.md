The value of `x` is assigned from the list `rel_lights_x` at the index `i`. The variable `i` is defined as `ans + 1`, but the specific value of `ans` is unknown. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` must also be at least 2. The value of `x` will depend on the values present in the list `rel_lights_x` at index `i`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `ans + 1`, and `x` is assigned the value from `rel_lights_x[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `ans + 1`, and `x` is assigned the value from `rel_lights_x[i]`.**
