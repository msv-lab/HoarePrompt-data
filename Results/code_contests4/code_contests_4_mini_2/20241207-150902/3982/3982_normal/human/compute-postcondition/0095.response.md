To determine the output state after executing the given code, we first analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet.

Initial State: 
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is 2
- `x` is equal to `rel_lights_x[2]`
- `y` is equal to `rel_lights_y[2]`

The code snippet is:
```
sp = max(0, x - (x + y - ans))
```

In this code:
- The variable `sp` is assigned the maximum value between `0` and the expression `x - (x + y - ans)`.
- The expression inside the `max` function simplifies to `x - x - y + ans`, which further simplifies to `ans - y`. 
- Since `n`, `i`, `x`, `y`, and `ans` are not explicitly defined in terms of specific values other than `n` being greater than 0, and `i` being 2, we can only describe the effect of the code in a general manner.

Therefore, the output state would reflect the values of `x`, `y`, and the operation performed:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `x` is equal to `rel_lights_x[2], `y` is equal to `rel_lights_y[2]; `sp` is calculated as `max(0, ans - y)`**.
