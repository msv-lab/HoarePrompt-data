The `psum_min` variable is updated to hold the minimum value between its current value (`INF`) and the value of `psum`. The value of `psum` is `0 + ax`, where `ax` is a variable that is not specified in the initial state but is part of the expression for `psum`. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 0 and `i` is equal to `n`, it does not affect the calculation directly, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Since `psum` is calculated as `0 + ax`, `psum` takes on the value of `ax`. However, without knowing the value of `ax`, we cannot determine an exact value for `psum_min`. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `psum_min` based on the comparison with `psum`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `avail` contains at least 1 element, `ans` remains unchanged at 500000, `psum_min` is updated to min(INF, psum), `psum` is 0 + ax**
