Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `ans + n`, `avail` is a list containing at least one item or is empty, `x` and `y` are the last assigned values from `rel_lights_x[n-1]` and `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `psum_min` is the minimum value among all items in `avail`, `psum` is the sum of all items in `avail`. If `psum_min` is equal to 0, then `r` is assigned the value of `ans`. Otherwise, `l` is assigned the value of `ans + 1` with `psum_min` being greater than 0.***
