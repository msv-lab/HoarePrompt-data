The variable `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[i]`. The value of `i` is determined by the previous state, where `i` is `ans + n + 1`. Since `n` is greater than 0, `i` will also be greater than `ans`. The specific value of `y` depends on the contents of the list `rel_lights_y` at the index `i`. Other variables are not modified by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `i` is `ans + n + 1`; `x` is assigned the value `rel_lights_x[i]`; `y` is assigned the value `rel_lights_y[i]`**
