According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute once more. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `ans + 2`, and `n` is greater than `ans + 2`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it `ans + 3`. The condition for the loop to execute again requires `n` to be greater than `ans + 3`.

State: **`n` is greater than `ans + 3`, `i` is `ans + 3`**
