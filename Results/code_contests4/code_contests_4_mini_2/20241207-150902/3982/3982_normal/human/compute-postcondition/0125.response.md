According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `ans`. If `i` is less than or equal to `ans`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`, which is greater than `n`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` being `n + 2`. For the loop to execute a second time, `ans` must be greater than or equal to `n + 2`.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n + 2`, `avail` has its `n`-th element set to 0, `avail[n + 1]` is now 0, `ans` is greater than or equal to `n + 2`, `psum` is the sum of elements in `avail`, `psum_min` is 0, `r` is 500000, `l` must be less than 500000**
