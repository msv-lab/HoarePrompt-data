The variable `ep` is assigned the value of `min(ans, x)`. Since `x` is assigned from `rel_lights_x[1]`, the specific value of `x` is known, and `ans` is compared to `x` to determine the minimum value.

The other variables `n`, `i`, `y`, and `sp` are not affected by this assignment. However, since `ep` is directly impacted by the values of both `ans` and `x`, the output state will reflect this relationship.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x` is assigned the value from `rel_lights_x[1]`, `y` is assigned the value from `rel_lights_y[1]`, `sp` is determined based on the expression `max(0, x - (x + y - ans))`, `ep` is assigned the value of `min(ans, x)`**.
