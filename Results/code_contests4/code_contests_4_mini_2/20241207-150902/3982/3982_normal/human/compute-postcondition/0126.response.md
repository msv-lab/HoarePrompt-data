The variable `avail[i]` is assigned the value 0. Given that `i` is `n + 2`, the `n`-th element of `avail` is already set to 0, and now the element at index `n + 2` is also set to 0. Since setting the element at `n + 2` to 0 does not change the values of `n`, `i`, `avail`, `ans`, `psum`, `psum_min`, `r`, or `l`, the output state reflects the unchanged values of these variables.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n + 2`, `avail[n]` is 0, `avail[n + 1]` is 0, `avail[n + 2]` is 0, `ans` is greater than or equal to `n + 2`, `psum` is the sum of elements in `avail`, `psum_min` is 0, `r` is 500000, `l` must be less than 500000**
