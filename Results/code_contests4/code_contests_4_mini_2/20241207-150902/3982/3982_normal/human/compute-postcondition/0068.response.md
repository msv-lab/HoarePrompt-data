The code assigns the value `0` to `avail[i]`, where `i` is `1`. As a result, `avail[1]` is set to `0`. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the length of `rel_lights_x`, `m` remains unchanged, `robbers` is a list of tuples, `lights` contains tuples with elements `lx` and `ly`, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, `avail` is a list of zeros with length 1000002, `ans` is 500000, `i` is 1, and `avail[1]` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is the length of `rel_lights_x`, `m` remains unchanged, `robbers` is a list of tuples, `lights` contains tuples with elements `lx` and `ly`, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, `avail` is a list of zeros with length 1000002, `ans` is 500000, `i` is 1, and `avail[1]` is 0.**
