According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `robbers` list. If the list contains at least three tuples, the loop can execute again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `robbers` is a list containing at least two tuples. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `robbers` must contain at least three tuples, and the next tuple to be processed will be the third one in the list.

State: **`n` and `m` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `robbers` is a list containing at least 3 tuples, (rx, ry) is the third tuple in the list.**
