The code `rel_lights_x.append(x)` adds the current value of `x` to the list `rel_lights_x`. Since `x` has been assigned the value `lx - rx`, and we know that both `x` and `y` are greater than or equal to 0, the operation will not affect any other variables. The previous values of `rel_lights_x` are not specified, but we know it is currently an empty list.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `robbers` is a list with at least one tuple, `rx` is the first element of the first tuple in `robbers`, `ry` is the second element of the first tuple in `robbers`, `rel_lights_x` is updated to include the value of `x`, `rel_lights_y` is an empty list, `lights` contains at least one tuple, `lx` and `ly` are the first elements of the first tuple in `lights`; `x` is assigned the value `lx - rx`, and `y` is assigned the value `ly - ry`, both `x` and `y` are greater than or equal to 0.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `robbers` is a list with at least one tuple, `rx` is the first element of the first tuple in `robbers`, `ry` is the second element of the first tuple in `robbers`, `rel_lights_x` is updated to include the value of `x`, `rel_lights_y` is an empty list, `lights` contains at least one tuple, `lx` and `ly` are the first elements of the first tuple in `lights`; `x` is assigned the value `lx - rx`, and `y` is assigned the value `ly - ry`, both `x` and `y` are greater than or equal to 0.**
