Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `robbers` is a list containing at least two tuples. If `x` (which is `lx - rx` from the second tuple in `lights`) and `y` (which is `ly - ry` from the second tuple in `lights`) are both non-negative, then `rel_lights_x` includes all previous non-negative values plus the new value `x`, and `rel_lights_y` has the new value of `y` appended to it.***
