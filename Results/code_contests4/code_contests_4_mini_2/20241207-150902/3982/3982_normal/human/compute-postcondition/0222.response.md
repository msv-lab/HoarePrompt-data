According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `avail` list. If `avail` contains at least 2 elements, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `avail` contains at least 1 element. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `avail` must have at least 2 elements, `ax` will be the next element in `avail`, and `i` will be updated accordingly.

Given that `i` is equal to `ans + n`, and `ans` has been updated to `l + (r - l) // 2`, the value of `i` will remain unchanged for this iteration from the last state unless otherwise noted.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `ans + n`, `avail` contains at least 2 elements, `ax` is the next element in `avail`, `psum_min` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `psum`**
