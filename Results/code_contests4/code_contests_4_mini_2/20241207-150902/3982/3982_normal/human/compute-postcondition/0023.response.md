According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `robbers` list. The loop iterates over each tuple in the `robbers` list. At the end of the last iteration, `robbers` contains at least one tuple, and the loop has already processed the first tuple. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least two tuples in the `robbers` list, and the next tuple to be processed will be the second tuple in the list.

State: **`n` and `m` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `robbers` is a list containing at least two tuples, `rel_lights_x` contains all non-negative values of `lx - rx` for tuples in `lights` where `lx >= rx`, `rel_lights_y` contains all non-negative values of `ly - ry` for tuples in `lights` where `ly >= ry`, and the next tuple to be processed in the loop is the second tuple in the `robbers` list, `(rx, ry)` being the second tuple.**
