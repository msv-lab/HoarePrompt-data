In the given code snippet, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[i]`. The variable `i` is determined by the expression `ans + n + 2`, and `n` is known to be greater than 0. However, the specific values of `ans`, `rel_lights_y`, and `i` are not provided, so the exact value of `y` cannot be determined. The state of `n` and `i` will remain unchanged, and `y` will be updated based on the value from `rel_lights_y` at the computed index `i`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `ans + n + 2`; `y` is assigned the value from `rel_lights_y` at index `i`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `i` is `ans + n + 2`; `y` is assigned the value from `rel_lights_y` at index `i`.**
