The value of `sp` is assigned the result of `max(0, x - (x + y - ans))`. The previous values of the affected variables are `x` (assigned from `rel_lights_x[i]`), `y` (assigned from `rel_lights_y[i]`), and `ans`. Given that the sum of `x` and `y` is greater than or equal to `ans`, we can deduce that `(x + y - ans)` is non-negative. Therefore, `x - (x + y - ans)` simplifies to `ans - y`. 

Since `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `ans + 1`, and the values of `x` and `y` are based on their assignments from `rel_lights_x[i]` and `rel_lights_y[i]` respectively, we conclude that `sp` will be at least `0` or equal to `ans - y`. 

Thus, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `ans + 1`, `x` is assigned a value from `rel_lights_x[i]`, `y` is assigned a value from `rel_lights_y[i]`, and `sp` is either `0` or `ans - y`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `ans + 1`, `x` is assigned a value from `rel_lights_x[i]`, `y` is assigned a value from `rel_lights_y[i]`, and `sp` is either `0` or `ans - y`.**
