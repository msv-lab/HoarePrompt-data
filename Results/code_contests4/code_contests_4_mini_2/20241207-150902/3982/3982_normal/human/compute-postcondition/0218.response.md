The value of `psum_min` is updated to the minimum of its current value (`INF`) and `psum` (which is `0 + ax`). Since `psum` is a numeric value (dependent on `ax`), `psum_min` will be updated to this new value if `psum` is less than `INF`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `ans + n`, `avail` contains at least 1 element, `x` is the last assigned value from `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` is the last assigned value from `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `psum_min` is updated to `min(INF, 0 + ax)`, `psum` is `0 + ax`, `ans` is updated to `l + (r - l) // 2`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `ans + n`, `avail` contains at least 1 element, `x` is the last assigned value from `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` is the last assigned value from `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `psum_min` is updated to `min(INF, 0 + ax)`, `psum` is `0 + ax`, `ans` is updated to `l + (r - l) // 2`**.
