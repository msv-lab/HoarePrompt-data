Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `robbers` is a list containing at least two tuples, `rel_lights_x` contains all non-negative values of `lx - rx` for tuples in `lights` where `lx >= rx`, and `rel_lights_y` includes the new value of `y`, where `y` is the value of `ly - ry` from the first tuple in `lights`. If `x >= 0` and `y >= 0`, then the conditions regarding `n`, `m`, `robbers`, `rel_lights_x`, and the updated `rel_lights_y` are satisfied, and `lights` contains at least one tuple.***
