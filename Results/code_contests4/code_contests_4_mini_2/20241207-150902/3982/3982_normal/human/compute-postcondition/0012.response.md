According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the `lights` list. If the list contains more tuples, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `lights` contains at least one tuple with elements `lx` and `ly`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another tuple in the list, and since the loop iterates over the elements, the next iteration will need the tuple at the next index. 

So if there is one tuple already processed, for the loop to execute one more time, `lights` must have at least two tuples, and the next tuple will be the second one in the list.

State: **`n` and `m` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `robbers` is a list with at least one tuple containing elements `rx` and `ry`, `rel_lights_x` is updated to include the value of `x`, `rel_lights_y` contains the value of `y`, `lights` contains at least two tuples with elements `lx` and `ly`, and the loop will process the second tuple in `lights`.**
