The code initializes the variable `avail` as a list of zeros with a length of \(10^6 + 2\) (which is \(1,000,002\)). This does not affect the values of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `robbers`, `lights`, `l`, `r`), as they remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the length of `rel_lights_x`, `m` remains unchanged, `robbers` is a list of tuples, `lights` contains tuples with elements `lx` and `ly`, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, and `avail` is a list of zeros with length 1000002.

Output State: **`n` is the length of `rel_lights_x`, `m` remains unchanged, `robbers` is a list of tuples, `lights` contains tuples with elements `lx` and `ly`, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, and `avail` is a list of zeros with length 1000002.**
