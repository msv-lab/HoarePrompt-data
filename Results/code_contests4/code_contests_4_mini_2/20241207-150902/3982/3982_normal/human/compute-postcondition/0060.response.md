The value of `n` is assigned the length of `rel_lights_x`, which means `n` will be the number of non-negative values in `rel_lights_x`. The initial values of `m`, `robbers`, and `lights` are not affected, and we do not have the specific count of `rel_lights_x`. Therefore, the output state reflects the relationship of `n` to `rel_lights_x`.

Output State: **`n` is the length of `rel_lights_x`; `m` remains unchanged; `robbers` is a list of tuples; `lights` contains tuples with elements `lx` and `ly`.**
