The variable `sp` is assigned the value of `max(0, x - (x + y - ans))`. To evaluate this, we need to simplify the expression inside the `max` function.

Given that `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[i]` and `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[i]`, we can substitute these variables into the expression. However, we don't have specific values for `x` and `y`, but we can analyze the expression in terms of `ans`.

The expression simplifies as follows:
1. Substitute `x` and `y` into the expression: `sp = max(0, x - (x + y - ans))`
2. This can be rewritten as: `sp = max(0, x - x - y + ans)`
3. Thus, it simplifies to: `sp = max(0, ans - y)`

Since `n` is greater than `ans + 3` and `i` is equal to `ans + 3`, we know that `ans` is less than `n - 3`. However, we do not have specific values for `x` and `y`, so we cannot definitively compute `sp`.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `sp` can either be zero or a positive value depending on the relationship between `ans` and `y`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `ans + 3`; `i` is `ans + 3`; `sp` is `max(0, ans - y)`**
