`y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[i]`, where `i` is equal to `ans + 1`. The exact value of `y` depends on the specific value of `rel_lights_y` at the index `i`. The values of `n` and `x` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `ans + 1`, `x` is assigned the value from `rel_lights_x[i]`, and `y` is assigned the value from `rel_lights_y[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `ans + 1`, `x` is assigned the value from `rel_lights_x[i]`, `y` is assigned the value from `rel_lights_y[i]`**.
