The variable `psum` is assigned the value `0`, meaning it is reset to 0. The previous states of the affected variables are not changed by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State remains consistent with the previous values of all other variables, while `psum` is now specifically set to 0.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0; `i` is equal to `ans + n`; `avail` is updated based on the values from `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y`; `x` is the last assigned value from `rel_lights_x[n-1]`; `y` is the last assigned value from `rel_lights_y[n-1]; `psum_min` is set to INF; `psum` is 0; `ans` is updated to `l + (r - l) // 2`**
