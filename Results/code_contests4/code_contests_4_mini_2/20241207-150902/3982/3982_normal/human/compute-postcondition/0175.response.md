According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `r`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `l` is less than `r`. 

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `l` is assigned the value of `ans + 1` (since `psum_min` is greater than 0).
- `r` is assigned the value of `ans`.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we need `l` to be less than `r` after the last iteration. Currently, `l` is `ans + 1` and `r` is `ans`, which means `l` is not less than `r`. 

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state such that `r` is greater than `l`. Therefore, `r` must be adjusted to be greater than `ans + 1`, which means `r` should be at least `ans + 2`. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `ans + n`, `avail` is a list containing at least one item or is empty, `x` and `y` are the last assigned values from `rel_lights_x[n-1]` and `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `psum_min` is the minimum value among all items in `avail`, `psum` is the sum of all items in `avail`, and for the loop to execute again `r` is greater than `ans + 1`**
