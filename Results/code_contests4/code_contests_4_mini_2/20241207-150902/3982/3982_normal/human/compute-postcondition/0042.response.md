According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `lights` variable. For the loop to execute, `lights` must be a non-empty iterable. Since `robbers` is a list containing at least 3 tuples, we do not need to make any adjustments to that, but we must ensure that `lights` is defined and contains at least one element. 

The values of `lx` and `ly` will be assigned from the first tuple in `lights`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed the first time, `lights` should not be empty, and we can assume `lx` and `ly` are the first elements of the first tuple in `lights`.

State: **`n` and `m` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `robbers` is a list containing at least 3 tuples, `lights` is not empty, `lx` and `ly` are the first elements of the first tuple in `lights`**
