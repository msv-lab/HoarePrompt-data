The value of `psum` is updated by adding `ax`, which is the first element in `avail`. Since `psum` is initially updated to 0 + ax, after the execution of the code, `psum` will now be equal to `ax`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `avail` contains at least 2 elements, `ans` remains unchanged at 500000, `psum_min` is updated to min(INF, psum), and `psum` is now equal to `ax`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `avail` contains at least 2 elements, `ans` remains unchanged at 500000, `psum_min` is updated to min(INF, psum), `psum` is now equal to `ax`**.
