According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `lights` variable. For the loop to execute at least once, `lights` must contain at least one element (tuple). Given that `n` and `m` are assigned values from `func_2()` and there are no specific conditions related to them that affect the loop execution, we focus on the `lights` variable.

Since `robbers` is a list with at least one tuple, it implies that its elements can provide some context, but they do not directly affect the `lights` variable. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that `lights` is defined and contains at least one tuple before the loop starts. 

Additionally, `lx` and `ly` will be assigned the values from the first tuple in `lights` during the first iteration of the loop. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, the states can be summarized as follows:

State: **`n` and `m` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `robbers` is a list with at least one tuple, `rx` is the first element of the first tuple in `robbers`, `ry` is the second element of the first tuple in `robbers`, `rel_lights_x` is an empty list, `rel_lights_y` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `lights` contains at least one tuple, `lx` and `ly` are the first elements of the first tuple in `lights`**
