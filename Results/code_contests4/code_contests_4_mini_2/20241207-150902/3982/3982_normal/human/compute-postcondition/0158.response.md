The variable `psum_min` is assigned the value `INF`. The previous values of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `avail`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged, as this assignment does not affect them. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged state of those variables and the new assignment for `psum_min`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `ans + n`, `avail` is updated based on the values from `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` for all `n` iterations, `x` and `y` are the last assigned values from `rel_lights_x[n-1]` and `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `psum_min` is INF**
