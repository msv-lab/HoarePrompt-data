The variable `psum` is updated by adding the value of `ax` to it. The previous value of `psum` was equal to `ax`, so after execution, `psum` will be equal to `ax + ax`, which is `2 * ax`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, `avail` contains at least 3 elements, `ans` remains unchanged at 500000, `psum` is now equal to `2 * ax`, `psum_min` remains updated to min(INF, ax).
