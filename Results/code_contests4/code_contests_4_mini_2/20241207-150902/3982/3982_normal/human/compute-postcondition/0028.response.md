The code `rel_lights_y.append(y)` adds the value of `y` to the list `rel_lights_y`. The previous state indicates that `y` is assigned the value `ly - ry`, where `ly` and `ry` are the respective values from the first tuple in the `lights` list, and both `x` and `y` are confirmed to be non-negative. Thus, the state of `rel_lights_y` will now include an additional element, which is the value of `y`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `robbers` is a list containing at least two tuples, `rel_lights_x` contains all non-negative values of `lx - rx` for tuples in `lights` where `lx >= rx`, `rel_lights_y` now includes the new value of `y`, and `lights` contains at least one tuple.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `robbers` is a list containing at least two tuples, `rel_lights_x` contains all non-negative values of `lx - rx` for tuples in `lights` where `lx >= rx`, `rel_lights_y` now includes the new value of `y`, and `lights` contains at least one tuple.**
