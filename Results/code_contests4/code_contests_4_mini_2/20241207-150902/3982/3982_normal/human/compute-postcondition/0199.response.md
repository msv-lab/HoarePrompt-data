To analyze the impact of the code on the program and calculate the new state of the variables, we start with the initial conditions.

1. `ep` is assigned the value of `min(ans, x)`.
2. From the initial state, we know:
   - `n` is greater than 0 (but its specific value is not known).
   - `i` is calculated as `ans + n + 1`.
   - `x` is taken from `rel_lights_x[i]` (the specific value of which depends on the value of `i`).
   - `y` is taken from `rel_lights_y[i]`.
   - `sp` is calculated as `max(0, ans - y)`.

Since we do not have specific values for `ans`, `x`, or `y`, we can only express `ep` in terms of these variables. The output state will summarize the relationships and dependencies of the variables.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `i` is `ans + n + 1`; `x` is `rel_lights_x[i]`; `y` is `rel_lights_y[i]`; `sp` is `max(0, ans - y)`; `ep` is `min(ans, x)`**.
