To determine the output state, we will analyze the given code snippet in conjunction with the initial state.

1. The variable `x` is assigned the value from `rel_lights_x[1]`, and `y` is assigned the value from `rel_lights_y[1]`. However, we do not have specific values for `rel_lights_x[1]`, `rel_lights_y[1]`, or `ans`.

2. The expression `max(0, x - (x + y - ans))` will calculate the value of `sp`. 

3. The term `x + y - ans` is evaluated first:
   - We don't have specific values for `x`, `y`, or `ans`, so we cannot compute `x + y - ans`.

4. The value of `sp` will depend on the result of `x - (x + y - ans)`:
   - If `x - (x + y - ans)` yields a non-negative value, `sp` will be that value.
   - If it yields a negative value, `sp` will be `0`.

5. Since we lack specific numeric values for `x`, `y`, and `ans`, we can only describe the relationship without exact calculations.

Therefore, the output state cannot specify exact values but can indicate the derived relationship.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x` is assigned the value from `rel_lights_x[1]`, `y` is assigned the value from `rel_lights_y[1]`, and `sp` is determined based on the expression `max(0, x - (x + y - ans))`.**
