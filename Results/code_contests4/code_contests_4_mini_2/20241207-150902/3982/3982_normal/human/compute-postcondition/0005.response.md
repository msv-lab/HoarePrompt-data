According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `robbers`. The loop will iterate over the `robbers` variable, which is expected to be a list or another iterable containing at least one tuple of coordinates `(rx, ry)`. 

Before the loop starts, `n` and `m` are assigned values from `func_2()`, and `robbers` is assigned the value from `func_4(n, 2)`. For the loop to execute, `robbers` must contain at least one element. If `robbers` is empty, the loop will not execute.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to specify that `robbers` contains at least one tuple and that `rx` and `ry` are assigned values from the first tuple in the `robbers` list. 

State: **`n` and `m` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `robbers` is a list with at least one tuple, `rx` is the first element of the first tuple in `robbers`, `ry` is the second element of the first tuple in `robbers`, `rel_lights_x` is an empty list, `rel_lights_y` is an empty list**
