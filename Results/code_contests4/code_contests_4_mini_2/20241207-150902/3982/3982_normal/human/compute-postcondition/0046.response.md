The variable `rel_lights_y` is being modified by appending the value of `y`. The previous values of `rel_lights_y` remain unchanged, and the new value `y` is added to the end of this list. Since `y` is greater than or equal to 0, it is a valid value to be appended. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `robbers` is a list containing at least 3 tuples, `lights` is not empty, `lx` and `ly` are the first elements of the first tuple in `lights`; `x` is `lx - rx`, `y` is `ly - ry`, and both `x` and `y` are greater than or equal to 0; `rel_lights_x` now contains the previous elements plus `x`; `rel_lights_y` now contains the previous elements plus `y`.
