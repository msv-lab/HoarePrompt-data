The variables `x` and `y` are assigned the values calculated from the expressions `lx - rx` and `ly - ry`, respectively. The values of `lx`, `ly`, `rx`, and `ry` can be derived from the third tuple `(lx, ly)` from the `lights` list and the corresponding tuple from the `robbers` list. However, the specific values of these variables are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state indicates the relationships between these variables without specifying exact values.

Output State: **`x` is calculated as lx - rx; `y` is calculated as ly - ry; `robbers` is a list containing at least two tuples; `lights` contains at least three tuples, processing the third tuple (lx, ly).**
