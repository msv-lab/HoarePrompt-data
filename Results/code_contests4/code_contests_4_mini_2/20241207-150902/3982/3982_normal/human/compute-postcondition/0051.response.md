The variable `y` is appended to the list `rel_lights_y`. The previous value of `y` is calculated as `ly - ry`, where `ly` is the second element of the second tuple in `lights` and `ry` is an unknown value. The state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are assigned values from `func_2()`; `robbers` is a list containing at least 3 tuples; `lights` is a list containing at least 2 tuples; `lx` and `ly` are the first elements of the second tuple in `lights`; `x` is assigned the value `lx - rx`; `y` is assigned the value `ly - ry`; `x` is appended to `rel_lights_x`; `y` is appended to `rel_lights_y`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are assigned values from `func_2()`; `robbers` is a list containing at least 3 tuples; `lights` is a list containing at least 2 tuples; `lx` and `ly` are the first elements of the second tuple in `lights`; `x` is assigned the value `lx - rx`; `y` is assigned the value `ly - ry`; `x` is appended to `rel_lights_x`; `y` is appended to `rel_lights_y`.**
