According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `avail` variable. The loop will execute if `avail` contains at least one element. Given that `n` is greater than or equal to 0, and since `i` is equal to `n`, it suggests that `i` is not directly affecting the loop execution. However, the state of `avail` is crucial. If `avail` is empty, the loop will not execute. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `avail` must contain at least one element.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `avail` contains at least 1 element, `ans` remains unchanged at 500000, `psum_min` is assigned the value `INF`, `psum` is 0**
