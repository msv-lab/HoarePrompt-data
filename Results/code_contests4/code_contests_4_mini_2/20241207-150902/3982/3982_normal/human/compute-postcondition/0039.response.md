Postcondition: ***`x` is calculated as `lx - rx` and `y` is calculated as `ly - ry`. `robbers` is a list containing at least two tuples, and `lights` contains at least three tuples. If `x` is greater than or equal to 0 and `y` is greater than or equal to 0, then `rel_lights_x` has `x` appended to it, and `rel_lights_y` now contains the previous values along with the new value of `y`.***
