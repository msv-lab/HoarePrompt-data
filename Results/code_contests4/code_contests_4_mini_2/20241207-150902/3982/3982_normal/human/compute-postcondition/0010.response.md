The code `rel_lights_y.append(y)` adds the value of `y` to the list `rel_lights_y`. The previous values of the affected variables are: `rel_lights_y` is an empty list, and `y` is the value calculated as `ly - ry`, which is greater than or equal to 0. Since `rel_lights_y` is empty before this operation, it will now contain the single value of `y`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `robbers` is a list with at least one tuple, `rx` is the first element of the first tuple in `robbers`, `ry` is the second element of the first tuple in `robbers`, `rel_lights_x` is updated to include the value of `x`, `rel_lights_y` contains the value of `y`, `lights` contains at least one tuple, `lx` and `ly` are the first elements of the first tuple in `lights`; `x` is assigned the value `lx - rx`, `y` is assigned the value `ly - ry`, both `x` and `y` are greater than or equal to 0.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `robbers` is a list with at least one tuple, `rx` is the first element of the first tuple in `robbers`, `ry` is the second element of the first tuple in `robbers`, `rel_lights_x` is updated to include the value of `x`, `rel_lights_y` contains the value of `y`, `lights` contains at least one tuple, `lx` and `ly` are the first elements of the first tuple in `lights`; `x` is assigned the value `lx - rx`, `y` is assigned the value `ly - ry`, both `x` and `y` are greater than or equal to 0.**
