The variable `rel_lights_y` is updated by appending the value of `y` to it. The values of `n`, `m`, `robbers`, `x`, and `lights` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `robbers` is a list containing at least one tuple with elements `rx` and `ry`; `x` is calculated as `lx - rx`, `y` is calculated as `ly - ry`; `rel_lights_x` includes the value of `x`, `rel_lights_y` now includes the value of `y` appended; and `lights` contains at least three tuples with elements `lx` and `ly`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are assigned values from `func_2()`; `robbers` is a list containing at least one tuple with elements `rx` and `ry`; `x` is calculated as `lx - rx`, `y` is calculated as `ly - ry`; `rel_lights_x` includes the value of `x`, `rel_lights_y` now includes the value of `y` appended; and `lights` contains at least three tuples with elements `lx` and `ly`.**
