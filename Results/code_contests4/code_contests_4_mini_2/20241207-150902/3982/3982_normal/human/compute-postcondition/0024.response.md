According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the `lights` list. For the loop to execute at least once, the `lights` list must contain at least one tuple. Since it is stated that `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` are derived from `lights`, we can assume that `lights` has at least two tuples because there are non-negative values calculated from them.

At the start of the loop, the first tuple `(lx, ly)` that will be processed is the first tuple in the `lights` list. Therefore, for the loop to execute, it is necessary that `lights` is not empty, and `lx` and `ly` are the first elements of the first tuple in the `lights` list.

State: **`n` and `m` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `robbers` is a list containing at least two tuples, `rel_lights_x` contains all non-negative values of `lx - rx` for tuples in `lights` where `lx >= rx`, `rel_lights_y` contains all non-negative values of `ly - ry` for tuples in `lights` where `ly >= ry`, for the loop to execute the first time `lights` is a list with at least one tuple, `(lx, ly)` is the first tuple in the `lights` list.**
