According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `ans + n`, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n` in the next iteration.

Since `i` is currently `ans + n`, for the loop to execute again, `ans + n` must be less than `n`. This is only possible if `ans` is less than 0, which contradicts the premise that `ans` has been updated. Thus, the next value of `i` will be `ans + n + 1`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `ans + n + 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `ans + n + 1`**
