Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[0]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[0]`, the sum of `x` and `y` is greater than or equal to `ans`, `sp` is either `ans - y` or 0, and `ep` is assigned the value of min(ans, x). If `ep` is less than `ans`, `avail[sp]` is increased by 1, `avail[ep + 1]` is decreased by 1, and `ep` remains less than `ans`.***
