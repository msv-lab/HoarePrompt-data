The variable `ep` is assigned the value of `min(ans, x)`. The values of `ans` and `x` are not given explicitly in the initial state but must be considered as previously defined values. Therefore, `ep` will take the minimum of whatever those values are. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `i` is `ans + n + 2`; `y` is assigned from `rel_lights_y[i]`; `sp` is the maximum of `0` and `x - (x + y - ans)`; `ep` is assigned the value of `min(ans, x)`**.
