The value of `psum_min` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the current value of `psum`. Since `psum` is now equal to `ax`, `psum_min` will be updated accordingly. The previous value of `psum_min` is `INF`, and thus `min(INF, ax)` will result in `ax` if `ax` is less than `INF` or will remain as `INF` if `ax` is greater than or equal to `INF`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `avail` contains at least 2 elements, `ans` remains unchanged at 500000, `psum` is now equal to `ax`, `psum_min` is updated to min(INF, ax)**
