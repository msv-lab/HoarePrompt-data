Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `ans + 3`; `i` is `ans + 3`; `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[i]`; `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[i]`. If `x + y` is greater than or equal to `ans`, then `sp` is set to `max(0, ans - y)` and `ep` is set to `min(ans, x)`. If `ep` is less than `ans`, `avail[sp]` is increased by 1 and `avail[ep + 1]` is decreased by 1.***
