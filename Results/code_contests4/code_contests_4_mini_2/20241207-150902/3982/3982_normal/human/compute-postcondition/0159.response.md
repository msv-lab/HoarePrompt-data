The variable `psum` is assigned the value `0`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged and are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `ans + n`, `avail` is updated based on the values from `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` for all `n` iterations, `x` and `y` are the last assigned values from `rel_lights_x[n-1]` and `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `psum_min` is INF, and `psum` is 0.
