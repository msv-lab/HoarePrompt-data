The variable `psum` is incremented by the value of `ax`. The previous value of `psum` is 0, so after execution, `psum` will be equal to `0 + ax`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `ans + n`, `avail` contains at least one item, `x` and `y` are the last assigned values from `rel_lights_x[n-1]` and `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `psum_min` is INF, `psum` is `ax`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `ans + n`, `avail` contains at least one item, `x` and `y` are the last assigned values from `rel_lights_x[n-1]` and `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `psum_min` is INF, `psum` is `ax`**
