To determine if the `while` loop can execute, we need to analyze the condition `l < r`. 

In the provided state:
- `l` is initialized to 0.
- `r` is initialized to 1000001.

Since `l` (0) is less than `r` (1000001), the loop can execute for the first time. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to proceed.

State: **`n` is the length of `rel_lights_x`, `m` remains unchanged, `robbers` is a list of tuples, `lights` contains tuples with elements `lx` and `ly`, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, and `avail` is a list of zeros with length 1000002**.
