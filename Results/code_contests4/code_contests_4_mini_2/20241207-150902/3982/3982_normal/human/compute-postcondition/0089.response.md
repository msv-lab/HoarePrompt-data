To analyze the provided code snippet, we first note the impact of the line `avail[ep + 1] -= 1`.

1. The variable `ep` has been assigned the value of `min(ans, x)`. The specific values of `ans` and `x` are not provided, but we know that `ep` will be either equal to `ans` or `x`, whichever is smaller.
2. The line `avail[ep + 1] -= 1` decreases the value at index `ep + 1` in the `avail` array by 1. This action modifies the `avail` array but does not affect the values of `n`, `i`, `x`, `y`, `sp`, or `ep`.

Thus, the output state will reflect that the value at index `ep + 1` in the `avail` array has been decreased by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x` is assigned the value from `rel_lights_x[1]`, `y` is assigned the value from `rel_lights_y[1]`, `sp` is determined based on the expression `max(0, x - (x + y - ans))`, `ep` is assigned the value of `min(ans, x)`, and `avail[ep + 1]` is decreased by 1.**
