According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`. The loop is designed to run for values of `i` from 0 to `ans`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `ans + n + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than or equal to `ans`. Since `i` is currently `ans + n + 1`, and `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is greater than `ans`. This means that the loop cannot execute again without adjusting the value of `ans`.

To allow the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be set to `ans + 1`, and `ans` must be adjusted such that `ans` is at least equal to `i`, which means `ans` must be at least `ans + n + 1`.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `ans + 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `ans` must be at least `ans + n + 1`**
