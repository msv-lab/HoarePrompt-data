According to the code, the loop iterates over the items in `avail`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more item in `avail`. At the end of the last iteration, `avail` contains at least one more item, and `ax` is assigned the next item from `avail`. 

Since `n` is greater than 0, `i` is currently `ans + n` and will not change within the loop. The last assigned values from `rel_lights_x[n-1]` and `rel_lights_y[n-1]` indicate that `x` and `y` remain unchanged during this iteration. The variable `psum_min` could be either `ax` or `psum`, but since `psum` is increased by `ax`, it will also be affected.

For the loop to execute one more time, `avail` must now have one less item available than before. If `avail` previously had at least two items, it will still have at least one item remaining after this iteration.

Therefore, after the next iteration, `ax` will be assigned the next item from `avail`, and `psum` will have increased by `ax`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `ans + n`, `avail` contains at least one more item, `x` and `y` are the last assigned values from `rel_lights_x[n-1]` and `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `psum_min` is either `ax` or `psum`, `psum` is increased by `ax`, for the loop to execute a second time `avail` must contain at least one more item.**
