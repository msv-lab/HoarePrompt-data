Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `robbers` is a list with at least one tuple containing elements `rx` and `ry`, `rel_lights_x` is updated to include the value of `x`, `rel_lights_y` contains the value of `y`, `lights` contains at least one tuple with elements `lx` and `ly`. If `x` is greater than or equal to 0 and `y` is greater than or equal to 0, then `rel_lights_x` includes the value of `x` and `rel_lights_y` contains the value of `y`.***
