Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `ans + n`, `avail` is a list containing all its original elements, `x` is the last assigned value from `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` is the last assigned value from `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `psum` is the sum of all elements in `avail`. If `psum_min` is equal to 0, then `r` is assigned the value of `ans`. Otherwise, if `psum_min` is greater than 0, then `l` is equal to `ans + 1.`***
