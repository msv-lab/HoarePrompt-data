The variable `sp` is assigned the value of `max(0, x - (x + y - ans))`. To evaluate this, we will first simplify the expression inside the `max` function. 

1. The inner expression is `x + y - ans`. Since it is given that the sum of `x` and `y` is greater than or equal to `ans`, we know this will yield a non-negative result.
2. Thus, `x - (x + y - ans)` can be rewritten as `x - x - y + ans`, which simplifies to `ans - y`.

Since `ans - y` could be positive, zero, or negative, we now apply the `max` function:
- If `ans - y` is greater than or equal to 0, then `sp` will be `ans - y`.
- If `ans - y` is less than 0, then `sp` will be 0.

However, without specific values for `x`, `y`, and `ans`, we cannot determine the exact value of `sp`. Therefore, given the conditions, we conclude that `sp` is either `ans - y` (if non-negative) or 0.

The output state summarizes the variables and the evaluation of `sp`:
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[0]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[0]`, the sum of `x` and `y` is greater than or equal to `ans`, and `sp` is either `ans - y` or 0.**
