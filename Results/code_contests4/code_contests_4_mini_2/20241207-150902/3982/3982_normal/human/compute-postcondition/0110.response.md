According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the contents of `avail`. The loop iterates over each element in `avail`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n`, which indicates that the loop has executed for all elements in `avail`. Since `i` is equal to `n`, and we know `n` is greater than or equal to 0, we cannot execute the loop again unless `avail` has more elements.

At the end of the last iteration, `avail` contains at least 2 elements, and `ax` is the current element being processed from `avail`. For the loop to execute one more time, we need `avail` to have at least 3 elements. We also need to adjust `i` to be equal to `n + 1` since the loop will have processed all elements in `avail`.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, `avail` contains at least 3 elements, `ans` remains unchanged at 500000, `psum` is now equal to `ax`, `psum_min` is updated to min(INF, ax)**
