According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `lights` list. Since `lights` is not empty and contains at least one tuple, the loop can execute at least once. At the end of the last iteration, `lx` and `ly` are the first elements of the first tuple in `lights`. After the first iteration of the loop, the iterator will move to the next tuple in the `lights` list.

For the loop to execute one more time, the `lights` list must contain at least 2 tuples (as it already contains at least 1), and `lx` and `ly` will be updated to the next tuple in the `lights` list. If `lights` contains at least 3 tuples, the loop can execute a second time for the second tuple in the list.

State: **`n` and `m` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `robbers` is a list containing at least 3 tuples, `lights` is a list containing at least 2 tuples, `lx` and `ly` are the first elements of the second tuple in `lights`.**
