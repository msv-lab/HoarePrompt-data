`y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[i]`. The value of `i` is 2, but the specific value of `rel_lights_y[2]` is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, `y` will take on the value of `rel_lights_y[2]`, which remains unknown. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `x` is equal to `rel_lights_x[2], `y` is equal to `rel_lights_y[2]**
