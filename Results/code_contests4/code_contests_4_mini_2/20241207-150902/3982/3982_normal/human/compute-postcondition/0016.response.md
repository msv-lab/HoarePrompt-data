Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `robbers` is a list containing at least one tuple with elements `rx` and `ry`; if `x` (calculated as `lx - rx`) and `y` (calculated as `ly - ry`) are both non-negative, then `rel_lights_x` includes the value of `x`, `rel_lights_y` is updated to include the value of `y`, and `lights` contains at least two tuples with elements `lx` and `ly`.***
