Output State: **`l` is equal to `r`, which represents the final result after the binary search, `n` remains unchanged, `avail` is a list reflecting the final counts based on the last iteration, `ans` is the last computed midpoint value, `psum` is the sum of the elements in `avail`, and `psum_min` is the minimum value among all items in `avail`, which is greater than 0 if the loop executed until convergence.**
