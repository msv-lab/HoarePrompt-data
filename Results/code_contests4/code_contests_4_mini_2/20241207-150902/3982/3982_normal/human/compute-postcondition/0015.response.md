The code appends the value of `y` to the list `rel_lights_y`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed by this operation, but the list `rel_lights_y` is updated to include the new value of `y`. Since `y` is defined as `ly - ry`, the output state reflects the updated list.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `robbers` is a list with at least one tuple containing elements `rx` and `ry`; `rel_lights_x` includes the value of `x` (which is `lx - rx`), `rel_lights_y` contains the previous values plus `y`, `lights` contains at least two tuples with elements `lx` and `ly`; `x` is assigned the value `lx - rx`, `y` is assigned the value `ly - ry`, and `rel_lights_y` is updated to include `y`.**
