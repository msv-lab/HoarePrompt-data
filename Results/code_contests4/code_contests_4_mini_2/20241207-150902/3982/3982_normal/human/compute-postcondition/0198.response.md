To determine the output state after executing the provided code, let's analyze the impact step by step:

1. **Initial Variables**:
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is calculated as `ans + n + 1`.
   - `x` is assigned the value `rel_lights_x[i]`.
   - `y` is assigned the value `rel_lights_y[i]`.

2. **Expression Evaluation**:
   - The expression `x + y - ans` is computed using the current values of `x`, `y`, and `ans`.
   - The `max(0, x - (x + y - ans))` operation will evaluate `x - (x + y - ans)` first.

3. **Final Calculation**:
   - The result of `x - (x + y - ans)` simplifies to `ans - y`. 
   - The `max(0, ans - y)` will give us the value of `sp`.

4. **Variables Not Affected**:
   - The values of `n`, `i`, `x`, and `y` are not changed by this expression; however, we now have calculated `sp`.

5. **Final Output State**:
   - Since `sp` is defined as `max(0, ans - y)`, we can conclude that the output state will include the original values of `n`, `i`, `x`, and `y` along with the newly calculated value for `sp`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `i` is `ans + n + 1`; `x` is `rel_lights_x[i]`; `y` is `rel_lights_y[i]`; `sp` is `max(0, ans - y)`**.
