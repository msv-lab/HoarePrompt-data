The code assigns the value of `psum` to `psum_min` only if `psum` is less than the current value of `psum_min`. Since `psum` is updated to `0 + ax + ax`, it is important to know the value of `psum_min` to determine if it changes. Other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `ans + n`, `avail` contains at least 1 element, `x` is the last assigned value from `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` is the last assigned value from `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `psum` is updated to `0 + ax + ax`, `ans` is updated to `l + (r - l) // 2`, for the loop to execute one more time `avail` must contain at least 2 elements and `ax` is the next element in `avail`, and `psum_min` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `psum`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `ans + n`, `avail` contains at least 1 element, `x` is the last assigned value from `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` is the last assigned value from `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `psum` is updated to `0 + ax + ax`, `ans` is updated to `l + (r - l) // 2`, for the loop to execute one more time `avail` must contain at least 2 elements and `ax` is the next element in `avail`, and `psum_min` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `psum`.**
