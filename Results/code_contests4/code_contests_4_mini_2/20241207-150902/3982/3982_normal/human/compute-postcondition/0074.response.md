The variable `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[i]`. The initial state indicates that `i` is 0, so `y` will take the value of `rel_lights_y[0]`. The values of `n` and `x` remain unchanged after this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[0]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[0]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[0]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[0]**
