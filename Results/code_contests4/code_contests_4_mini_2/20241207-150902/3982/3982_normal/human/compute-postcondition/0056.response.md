The variable `rel_lights_y` is updated by appending the value of `y`. The previous state of `y` was calculated as `ly - ry`, where `ly` is the second element of the third tuple in `lights`, and `ry` is not defined in the provided context. However, `rel_lights_x` was previously appended with `x`, calculated as `lx - rx`. Since `rel_lights_y` is affected by the new value of `y`, the output state reflects the change.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `robbers` is a list containing at least 3 tuples, `lights` is a list containing at least 3 tuples, `lx` and `ly` are the first and second elements of the third tuple in `lights`, `x` is calculated as `lx - rx`, `y` is calculated as `ly - ry`, and `y` is appended to `rel_lights_y`.**
