The code assigns the values `0` and `10 ** 6 + 1` to the variables `l` and `r`, respectively. The value of `l` is now `0`, and the value of `r` is `1000001`. The initial states of `n`, `m`, `robbers`, and `lights` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the length of `rel_lights_x`; `m` remains unchanged; `robbers` is a list of tuples; `lights` contains tuples with elements `lx` and `ly`; `l` is 0; `r` is 1000001.

Output State: **`n` is the length of `rel_lights_x`; `m` remains unchanged; `robbers` is a list of tuples; `lights` contains tuples with elements `lx` and `ly`; `l` is 0; `r` is 1000001**.
