Correctness: **False**

The provided program simply prints the number `5`, which does not solve the problem as described. The task requires calculating the minimum number of moves required to obtain at least `k` equal elements in the given array. The program does not implement any logic to analyze the array or perform the required operations of increasing minimum elements or decreasing maximum elements. 

For instance, consider the input:

```
6 5
1 2 2 4 2 3
```

The expected output is `3`, as we need to perform moves to make at least `5` elements equal. However, the program will print `5`, which is incorrect.

Thus, since the program does not adhere to the problem requirements for this and any potential case, it is deemed incorrect.
