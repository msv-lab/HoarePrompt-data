Correctness: **False**.

The provided program simply prints the number 5, which does not implement any logic to calculate the minimum number of moves required to obtain at least k equal elements in the array. 

For example, consider the input:

```
6 5
1 2 2 4 2 3
```

The expected output is 3, as explained in the problem statement. However, the program outputs 5 regardless of the input. 

Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for any input case.
