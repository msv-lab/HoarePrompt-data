N is an integer between 2 and 200, M is an integer between 1 and N×(N-1)/2, R is an integer between 2 and the smaller of 8 and N, r_1, r_2, ..., r_R are distinct integers representing towns such that 1 ≤ r_i ≤ N, and A_i, B_i are distinct integers representing roads between towns such that 1 ≤ A_i, B_i ≤ N and A_i ≠ B_i, with C_i being a positive integer representing the length of the road between A_i and B_i.
