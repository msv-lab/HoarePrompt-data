Precondition: **N is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 200, M is an integer such that 1 ≤ M ≤ N×(N-1)/2, R is an integer such that 2 ≤ R ≤ min(8, N), r_1, r_2, ..., r_R are distinct integers representing towns with 1 ≤ r_i ≤ N, A_i and B_i are integers representing connections between towns with 1 ≤ A_i, B_i ≤ N and A_i ≠ B_i, and C_i is an integer representing the length of the road with 1 ≤ C_i ≤ 100000. All input values are integers.**
