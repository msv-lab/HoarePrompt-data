#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 200, M is an integer such that 1 ≤ M ≤ N×(N-1)/2, R is an integer such that 2 ≤ R ≤ min(8, N), r_1, r_2, ..., r_R are distinct integers representing towns with 1 ≤ r_i ≤ N, A_i and B_i are integers representing connections between towns with 1 ≤ A_i, B_i ≤ N and A_i ≠ B_i, and C_i is an integer representing the length of the road with 1 ≤ C_i ≤ 100000. All input values are integers.
def func():
    f = lambda : list(map(int, input().split()))
    N, M, R = f()
    r = f()
    a, b, c = zip(*map(f, [0] * M))
    a = csgraph.dijkstra(csr_matrix((c, (a, b)), [N + 1] * 2), 0, r)
    print(int(min(sum(a[e[i]][r[e[i + 1]]] for i in range(R - 1)) for e in
    __import__('itertools').permutations(range(R)))))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input values for the number of towns (N), the number of connections (M), the number of distinct towns to consider (R), the list of these towns (r), and the connections between towns (A_i, B_i) along with their lengths (C_i). It then calculates the shortest paths between the towns using Dijkstra's algorithm and finds the minimum total length of roads required to connect all the specified towns. The result is printed as the output. The function does not handle edge cases like invalid input or the scenario where R is larger than the number of distinct towns provided.
