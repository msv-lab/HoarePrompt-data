The value of `t` is decremented by 1, so if `t` was a positive integer decreased by 1, its new value will be a non-negative integer. The variable `a` remains unchanged as it is an input string, and `ls` is also unaffected by this specific operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a non-negative integer, `a` is an input string, and `ls` is unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer, `a` is an input string, and `ls` is unchanged.**
