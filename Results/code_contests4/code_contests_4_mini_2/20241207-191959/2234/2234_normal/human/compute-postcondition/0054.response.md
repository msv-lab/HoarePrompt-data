The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is 3, so after execution, `count` becomes 4. The values of the other variables `t` and `z` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `count` is 4, and `z` is the third element in the list `ls`.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `count` is 4, `z` is the third element in the list `ls`**
