`c2` is assigned the value `c2 + 1`. The previous value of `c2` is 2, so after execution, `c2` becomes 3. The values of `t`, `sorted_x`, and `item` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `c2` is 3, `sorted_x` contains at least 3 strings, and `item` is the third string in `sorted_x`.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `c2` is 3, `sorted_x` contains at least 3 strings, and `item` is the third string in `sorted_x.**
