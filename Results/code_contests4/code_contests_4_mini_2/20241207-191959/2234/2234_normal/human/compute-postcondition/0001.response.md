The code initializes `ls` as an empty list. The value of `t` is not affected by this line, as it is only defining a new variable. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is assigned the value of the input integer from `raw_input()`, `ls` is an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of the input integer from `raw_input()`, `ls` is an empty list**
