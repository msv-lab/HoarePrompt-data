The `sorted_x` list is reversed, changing the order of its elements. The values of `t` and `ls` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the reversal of `sorted_x`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `ls` contains at least 0 strings, and `sorted_x` is now in reverse order.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `ls` contains at least 0 strings, and `sorted_x` is now in reverse order.**
