The value of `t` is decremented by 1. Since `t` is a non-negative integer, the new value of `t` will be `t - 1`. The values of `a` and `ls` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a non-negative integer; `a` is an input string; `ls` now contains the input string `a` appended to it; `t` is decremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer; `a` is an input string; `ls` now contains the input string `a` appended to it; `t` is decremented by 1.**
