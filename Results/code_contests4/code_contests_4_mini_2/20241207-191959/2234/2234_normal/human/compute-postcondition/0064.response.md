The value of `c2` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `c2` is 0, so after execution, `c2` will be 1. The other variables `t`, `sorted_x`, and `item` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `c2` is 1, `sorted_x` contains at least 1 string, and `item` is the first string in `sorted_x` with the second character equal to 1.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `c2` is 1, `sorted_x` contains at least 1 string, and `item` is the first string in `sorted_x` with the second character equal to 1.**
