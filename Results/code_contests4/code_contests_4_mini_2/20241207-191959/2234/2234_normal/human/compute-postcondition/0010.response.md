According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a non-negative integer, which means it could be 0 or greater. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Therefore, we need to adjust `t` to be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is a non-negative integer and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 0**
