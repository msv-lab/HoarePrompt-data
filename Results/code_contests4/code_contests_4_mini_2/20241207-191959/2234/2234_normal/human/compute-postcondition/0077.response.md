According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `sorted_x` list. For the loop to execute at least once, `sorted_x` must contain at least one string. Based on the provided state, `c2` is the count of strings in `sorted_x` where the second character equals 1. Since `c2` is less than or equal to 1, this means that either there are no strings or just one string that meets this condition.

To ensure the loop executes, `sorted_x` must have at least one string, and `x` should be the first string in the list. Additionally, since the state indicates 'YES' is printed, we can assume that the condition related to printing 'YES' is satisfied.

State: **`t` is 0, `c2` is the count of strings in `sorted_x` where the second character equals 1, for the loop to execute the first time `sorted_x` contains at least 1 string, and `x` is the first string in `sorted_x`**
