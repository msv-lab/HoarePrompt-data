According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `c1`. The loop will iterate `c1` times, so for the loop to execute at least once, `c1` must be greater than 0. The initial state indicates that `t` is 0, `c2` is the count of strings in `sorted_x` where the second character equals 1, `x` is the second string in `sorted_x`, and `c1` is the count of occurrences of `x[0]` in `ls`. 

To ensure the loop executes, the condition that needs to be satisfied is that `c1` must be greater than 0. Additionally, for the first execution of the loop, `z` should be initialized to 0.

State: **`t` is 0, `c2` is the count of strings in `sorted_x` where the second character equals 1, `x` is the second string in `sorted_x`, `c1` is greater than 0, `z` is 0**
