The function `func` accepts an integer `n`, which is in the range from 1 to 100. Following this integer, it accepts `n` strings, where each string contains only lowercase English letters and has a length between 1 and 100, inclusive. The function processes these inputs and returns a value based on its internal logic (not specified in the output).
