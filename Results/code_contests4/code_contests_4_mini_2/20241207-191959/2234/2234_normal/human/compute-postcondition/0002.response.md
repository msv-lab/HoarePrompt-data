To determine the adjustments needed for the loop to execute for the first time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop.

The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Right before the loop, `t` is assigned the value of an input integer from `raw_input()`, which means it can potentially be any integer, including negative values or zero. Since `ls` is an empty list, it does not affect the execution of the loop.

To ensure that the loop can execute, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0. This means that the input integer from `raw_input()` must be a positive integer. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `t` to be a positive integer.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `ls` is an empty list**
