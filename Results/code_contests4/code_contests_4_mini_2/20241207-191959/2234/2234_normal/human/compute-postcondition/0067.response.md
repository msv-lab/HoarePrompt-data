The value of `c2` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The other variables `t` and `item` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `c2` is 2, and `sorted_x` must contain at least 2 strings for the loop to execute a second time; `item` is the second string in `sorted_x`.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `c2` is 2, and `sorted_x` must contain at least 2 strings for the loop to execute a second time; `item` is the second string in `sorted_x`.**
