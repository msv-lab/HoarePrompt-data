The variable `c1` is assigned the value of `ls.count(x[0])`, which counts how many times the first character of the string `x` appears in the list `ls`. The values of `t`, `c2`, and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `c2` is the count of strings in `sorted_x` where the second character equals 1, `x` is the second string in `sorted_x`, `c1` is the count of occurrences of `x[0]` in `ls`.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `c2` is the count of strings in `sorted_x` where the second character equals 1, `x` is the second string in `sorted_x`, `c1` is the count of occurrences of `x[0]` in `ls.**
