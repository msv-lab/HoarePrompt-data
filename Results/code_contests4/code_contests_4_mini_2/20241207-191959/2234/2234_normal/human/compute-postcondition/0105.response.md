Postcondition: ***`t` is 0, `c2` is the count of strings in `sorted_x` where the second character equals 1, and `sorted_x` contains at least 0 strings. If `c2` is greater than 1, 'NO' has been printed. Otherwise, all characters from the first elements of `sorted_x` have been printed according to their counts in `ls`.***
