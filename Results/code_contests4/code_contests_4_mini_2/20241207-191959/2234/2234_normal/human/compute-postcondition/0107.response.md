Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` followed by `n` strings, counts how many strings contain each unique string, and checks if there is more than one string that only appears once. If there is more than one unique string that appears once, it outputs 'NO'. Otherwise, it outputs 'YES' and prints each unique string according to its frequency in the input. The function does not handle the case where `n` is 0 or incorrectly formatted input, which could lead to errors. **
