According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a positive integer decreased by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 1. Therefore, it needs to be adjusted to reflect that `t` must be at least 2.

State: **`t` is now a positive integer decreased by 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1**
