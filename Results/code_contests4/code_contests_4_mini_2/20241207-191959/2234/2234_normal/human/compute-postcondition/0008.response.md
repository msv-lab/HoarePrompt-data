`ls` is a list that will have the value of `a` appended to it. The current value of `a` is an input string, and `t` is a positive integer decreased by 1, but it does not affect the state of `ls`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `a` is appended to `ls`. 

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer decreased by 1; `a` is an input string; `a` is appended to `ls`.**
