`ls` is an empty list, and `a` is an input string. The code snippet `ls.append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `ls`. After execution, `ls` will contain the input string `a`. The variable `t` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `ls` contains the input string `a`, and `a` is the input string.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `ls` contains the input string `a`, `a` is the input string**
