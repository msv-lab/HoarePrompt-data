The code assigns the value of `count` to the key `x` in the dictionary `dict1`. The previous values of `t`, `count`, and `ls` do not change as a result of this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `count` is the number of elements in `ls` that contain `x`, and `dict1` now has a key `x` with the value of `count`.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `count` is the number of elements in `ls` that contain `x`, `dict1[x]` is assigned the value of `count`**
