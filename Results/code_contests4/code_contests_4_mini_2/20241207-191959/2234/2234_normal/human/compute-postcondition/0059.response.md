The variable `sorted_x` is assigned the value of the sorted items from `dict1`, which is a dictionary. The sorting is based on the second item of each key-value pair (the count of how many strings in `ls` contain that key string), using `operator.itemgetter(1)` as the sorting key. The order of sorting will depend on the values in `dict1`, but since we are not provided with specific values for `dict1`, we cannot determine the exact contents of `sorted_x`. Other variables `t` and `ls` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `ls` contains at least 0 strings, `sorted_x` is a sorted list of items from `dict1`.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `ls` contains at least 0 strings, `sorted_x` is a sorted list of items from `dict1**
