The value of `t` is decremented by 1, changing its state from a positive integer to a smaller positive integer (assuming `t` was greater than 1). The variables `ls` and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is now a positive integer decreased by 1; `ls` contains the input string `a`; `a` is the input string.

Output State: **`t` is now a positive integer decreased by 1; `ls` contains the input string `a`; `a` is the input string.**
