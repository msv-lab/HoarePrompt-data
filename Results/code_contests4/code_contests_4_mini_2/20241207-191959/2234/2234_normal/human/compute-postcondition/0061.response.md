The variable `c2` is assigned the value of 0. The values of `t`, `ls`, and `sorted_x` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `ls` contains at least 0 strings, `sorted_x` is now in reverse order, and `c2` is 0.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `ls` contains at least 0 strings, `sorted_x` is now in reverse order, `c2` is 0**
