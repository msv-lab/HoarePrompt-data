According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `sorted_x`. If `sorted_x` is not empty (i.e., contains at least 1 string), the loop will execute. Given that `t` is 0 and `c2` is also 0, these values do not affect the ability of the loop to execute. Thus, for the loop to be executed the first time, `sorted_x` must contain at least 1 string, and `item` will be the first string in `sorted_x`.

State: **`t` is 0, `c2` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `sorted_x` contains at least 1 string, `item` is the first string in `sorted_x`**
