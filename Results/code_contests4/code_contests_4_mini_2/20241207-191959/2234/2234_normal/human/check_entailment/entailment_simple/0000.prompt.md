You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given n strings. Each string consists of lowercase English letters. Rearrange (reorder) the given strings in such a way that for every string, all strings that are placed before it are its substrings.

String a is a substring of string b if it is possible to choose several consecutive letters in b in such a way that they form a. For example, string "for" is contained as a substring in strings "codeforces", "for" and "therefore", but is not contained as a substring in strings "four", "fofo" and "rof".

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of strings.

The next n lines contain the given strings. The number of letters in each string is from 1 to 100, inclusive. Each string consists of lowercase English letters.

Some strings might be equal.

Output

If it is impossible to reorder n given strings in required order, print "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise print "YES" (without quotes) and n given strings in required order.

Examples

Input

5
a
aba
abacaba
ba
aba


Output

YES
a
ba
aba
aba
abacaba


Input

5
a
abacaba
ba
aba
abab


Output

NO


Input

3
qwerty
qwerty
qwerty


Output

YES
qwerty
qwerty
qwerty

Note

In the second example you cannot reorder the strings because the string "abab" is not a substring of the string "abacaba".
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by n strings, each string containing only lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100, inclusive.
def func():
    t = int(raw_input())
    ls = []
    while t > 0:
        a = raw_input()
        
        ls.append(a)
        
        t = t - 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `t` is 0, `ls` contains `t` input strings provided during the loop execution.
    dict1 = {}
    for x in ls:
        count = 0
        
        for z in ls:
            if x in z:
                count = count + 1
        
        dict1[x] = count
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is 0, `ls` contains at least 0 strings, `dict1` is a dictionary where each key is a string from `ls` and the corresponding value is the count of how many strings in `ls` contain that key string.
    sorted_x = sorted(dict1.items(), key=operator.itemgetter(1))
    sorted_x.reverse()
    c2 = 0
    for item in sorted_x:
        if item[1] == 1:
            c2 = c2 + 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is 0, `c2` is the count of strings in `sorted_x` where the second character equals 1, `sorted_x` contains at least 0 strings.
    if (c2 > 1) :
        print('NO')
    else :
        print('YES')
        for x in sorted_x:
            c1 = ls.count(x[0])
            
            for z in range(c1):
                print(x[0])
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is 0, `c2` is the count of strings in `sorted_x` where the second character equals 1, `sorted_x` is a list of strings, and all characters from the first elements of `sorted_x` have been printed according to their counts in `ls`.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`t` is 0, `c2` is the count of strings in `sorted_x` where the second character equals 1, and `sorted_x` contains at least 0 strings. If `c2` is greater than 1, 'NO' has been printed. Otherwise, all characters from the first elements of `sorted_x` have been printed according to their counts in `ls`.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
