To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the program logic step by step.

### Problem Description:
The task is to find the maximum number of tables that can be decorated using a specific number of colored balloons (red, green, blue) such that no table has all three balloons of the same color.

### Program Logic:
1. The function starts by reading the values of r, g, and b, representing the number of red, green, and blue balloons, respectively.
2. It sorts these values, which allows us to always deal with the smallest number of balloons first.
3. It initializes `t` (the number of tables) with the number of red balloons (`r`).
4. It adjusts the counts of green and blue balloons by subtracting `r` from both, since `r` tables can be decorated with one red balloon each.
5. It adds to `t` how many complete groups of three can be formed from the remaining green balloons (using integer division by 3).
6. It then adjusts the count of blue balloons based on how many green balloons were used after accounting for the groups of three.
7. Finally, it checks if there are any remaining green balloons and whether they can be paired with blue balloons to form an additional table, updating `t` accordingly.

### Checking for Edge Cases:
- **Case 1**: All balloon counts are zero (e.g., `0 0 0`).
  - Expected output: `0` (no tables can be formed).
  - The program would return `0`, which is correct.
  
- **Case 2**: Only one color of balloons exists (e.g., `5 0 0`).
  - Expected output: `0` (only one color cannot form a table).
  - The program would return `0`, which is correct.

- **Case 3**: Two colors of balloons exist (e.g., `3 3 0`).
  - Expected output: `2` (can form `rbg` and `rbg`).
  - The program would return `2`, which is correct.

- **Case 4**: All colors present but with an unbalanced distribution (e.g., `1 1 1`).
  - Expected output: `1` (only one table can be formed).
  - The program would return `1`, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
Upon analyzing the logic and considering various edge cases, it seems that the function covers all possible scenarios correctly and does not fail for any given input within the specified constraints. Therefore, the program adheres to the problem description and handles all potential edge cases.

Correctness: **True**.
