You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You have r red, g green and b blue balloons. To decorate a single table for the banquet you need exactly three balloons. Three balloons attached to some table shouldn't have the same color. What maximum number t of tables can be decorated if we know number of balloons of each color?

Your task is to write a program that for given values r, g and b will find the maximum number t of tables, that can be decorated in the required manner.

Input

The single line contains three integers r, g and b (0 ≤ r, g, b ≤ 2·109) — the number of red, green and blue baloons respectively. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.

Output

Print a single integer t — the maximum number of tables that can be decorated in the required manner.

Note

In the first sample you can decorate the tables with the following balloon sets: "rgg", "gbb", "brr", "rrg", where "r", "g" and "b" represent the red, green and blue balls, respectively.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: r, g, and b are non-negative integers representing the number of red, green, and blue balloons, respectively, such that 0 ≤ r, g, b ≤ 2·10^9.
def func_1():
    r, g, b = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
    t = r
    g -= r
    b -= r
    t += g // 3
    b -= g - g % 3
    g = g % 3
    t += (g == 1 and b > 1) + (g == 2 and b > 0)
    func_2(t)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and reads three non-negative integers from input, representing the counts of red, green, and blue balloons. It then performs calculations to determine a value based on the relationships between these counts. The function ultimately calls another function, `func_2`, passing the calculated value, but does not return any value itself. It does not handle cases where the input values are outside the specified range or where inputs are invalid, such as non-integer values.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: r, g, and b are non-negative integers where 0 ≤ r, g, b ≤ 2·10^9.
def func_2():
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        
        file.write(str(x))
        
        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `r`, `g`, `b` are non-negative integers; `file` contains all elements of `args` written as strings, separated by `sep` if there are multiple elements; `at_start` is False.
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`r`, `g`, `b` are non-negative integers; `file` has written the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')`; `at_start` is False. If `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is True, then the file has been flushed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any explicit parameters and prints the string representations of elements from an unspecified iterable `args` to a specified output stream, `file`. It separates the elements with a specified separator `sep` and ends the output with a specified ending string `end`. If the `flush` keyword argument is set to True, it flushes the output stream. The function relies on the presence of `args` and `kwargs`, which are not defined within the function, suggesting that it is intended to be called with these arguments in a broader context or is part of a larger system, such as a print-like function.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
