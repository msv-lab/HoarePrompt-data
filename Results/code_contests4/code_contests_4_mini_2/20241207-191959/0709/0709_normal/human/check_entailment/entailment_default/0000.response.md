To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze both the code and the problem description closely.

### Problem Description:
We need to find the maximum number of tables that can be decorated with balloons of three different colors (red, green, and blue), ensuring that no table has three balloons of the same color. 

### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads three integers, `r`, `g`, and `b`, which represent the counts of red, green, and blue balloons.
   - It sorts these counts.
   - The initial value of `t` is set to `r` (the smallest count), which counts the number of tables that can be decorated using one balloon of the smallest color.
   - The function then reduces the counts of green and blue balloons by the smallest count `r`.
   - It adds to `t` the number of complete sets of three balloons that can be made from the remaining counts of green balloons.
   - It checks the remainder of green balloons to see if they can form additional tables with the remaining blue balloons.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- If all three balloon counts are zero (`0, 0, 0`), the function doesn't explicitly handle it, but logically, the output should be `0` since no tables can be decorated.
- If one or two colors have zero balloons, the function must ensure it doesn't try to access negative values or go beyond the available balloon counts.
- The function does not directly handle cases where the balloon counts are negative or invalid inputs, but the constraints (0 ≤ r, g, b ≤ 2·10^9) imply that inputs will be valid.

### Output Hints:
The output hints indicate:
- The function calls `func_2`, which prints the value of `t`, the maximum number of tables that can be decorated.
- It also mentions that the function does not handle cases where the input values are outside the specified range or where inputs are invalid.

### Conclusion:
The function seems to handle the primary logic needed to determine the maximum number of tables. However, it does not account for the case where all balloon counts are zero, which logically should return `0`. 

Since there exists a potential case (when all counts are zero) where the code does not yield the expected output, this indicates that the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
