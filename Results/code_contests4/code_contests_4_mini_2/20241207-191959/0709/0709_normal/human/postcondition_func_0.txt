The function accepts no parameters and reads three non-negative integers from input, representing the counts of red, green, and blue balloons. It then performs calculations to determine a value based on the relationships between these counts. The function ultimately calls another function, `func_2`, passing the calculated value, but does not return any value itself. It does not handle cases where the input values are outside the specified range or where inputs are invalid, such as non-integer values.
