The code updates the values of `sep` and `file` by popping them from the `kwargs` dictionary, with default values set to `' '` and `sys.stdout`, respectively. The initial state of `r`, `g`, and `b` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state remains focused on the assignment of `sep` and `file`.

Output State: **`r`, `g`, and `b` are non-negative integers where 0 ≤ `r`, `g`, `b` ≤ 2·10^9; `sep` is the value popped from kwargs or ' '; `file` is the value popped from kwargs or sys.stdout.**
