The value of `at_start` is set to `False`, which means the function can perform actions related to writing `sep` to `file` if `args` contains at least one element. However, since there are no details about `args` or `sep`, we cannot determine their impact. The value of `file` remains unchanged from what it was previously, as `str(x)` is already written to it. Therefore, the Output State is: `r`, `g`, `b` are non-negative integers; `at_start` is False; `file` has `str(x)` written to it.

Output State: **`r`, `g`, `b` are non-negative integers; `at_start` is False; `file` has `str(x)` written to it.**
