The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It operates based on the constraints that `r`, `g`, and `b` are non-negative integers where \( 0 \leq r, g, b \leq 2 \cdot 10^9 \). Since there are no specific output conditions or cases provided in the output section, we can conclude that the functionality of the function is currently undefined based on the information given.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and has no defined output based on the provided information.**
