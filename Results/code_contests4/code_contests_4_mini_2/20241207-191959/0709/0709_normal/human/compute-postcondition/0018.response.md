The value of `at_start` is assigned `False`, but it is already `False` in the initial state, so there is no change in its value. The states of the other variables (`r`, `g`, `b`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `r`, `g`, `b` are non-negative integers; `at_start` is False; `x` is written to `file`.

Output State: **`r`, `g`, `b` are non-negative integers; `at_start` is False; `x` is written to `file`**
