The statement `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the `file`. Since `at_start` is False, we assume that `file` has already been initialized with some content. The variable `x` is not defined in the initial state provided, so we cannot determine what value it holds. The states of `r`, `g`, `b`, and `at_start` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects that `x` is written to `file`.

Output State: **`r`, `g`, `b` are non-negative integers; `at_start` is False; `x` is written to `file`.**
