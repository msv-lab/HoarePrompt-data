The function `func` accepts two integers `n` and `m`, where `n` represents the number of distinct fruit prices and `m` represents the number of fruit purchases. It reads a list of `n` positive integers (prices) and then collects `m` fruit names from user input, counting how many times each fruit is purchased. The function calculates two values: `mini`, which is the total cost of the least expensive fruits based on the counts of purchases, and `maxi`, which is the total cost of the most expensive fruits based on the same counts. Finally, it prints the calculated values of `mini` and `maxi`.

However, it is important to note that if `m` is 0, the function will still execute but will result in both `mini` and `maxi` being 0 since there would be no fruits to calculate costs for. The function does not handle the case of zero purchases explicitly, but it will not raise an error due to the nature of the calculations. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `m`, reads `n` positive integers representing fruit prices, counts `m` fruit purchases, and calculates and prints the total minimum and maximum costs based on the purchases. If `m` is 0, it will return 0 for both costs. **
