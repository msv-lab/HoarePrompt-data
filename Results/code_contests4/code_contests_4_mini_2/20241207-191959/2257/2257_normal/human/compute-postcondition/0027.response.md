The function `func` does not explicitly accept parameters through its signature. However, it operates under the following constraints: `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100; `prices` is a list of `n` positive integers where each price does not exceed 100; and the following `m` lines contain non-empty strings representing fruit names, with the number of distinct fruits less than or equal to `n`.

The output of the function is not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred based on the provided constraints and relationships. Since the function processes the `prices` and the fruit names, the likely output involves either a calculation or a categorization based on the provided fruit names and their corresponding prices.

Functionality: **The function processes a list of prices and fruit names, returning an output based on the relationship between these inputs, while adhering to the defined constraints on `n`, `m`, and the contents of the `prices` list.**
