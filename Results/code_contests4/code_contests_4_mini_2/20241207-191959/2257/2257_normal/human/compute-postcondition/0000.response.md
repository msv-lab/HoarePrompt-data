The variables `n` and `m` are assigned values from `raw_input().split()`, which takes a string input, splits it into parts, and converts those parts into integers using `map(int, ...)`. The values of `n` and `m` will be based on the input provided. Other variables (`prices` and the list of fruit names) are not affected by this line of code. 

Since `n` and `m` are integers within the range specified (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100), after execution, the output state will reflect the new values of `n` and `m`, which are determined by user input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer based on the input, `m` is an integer based on the input**
