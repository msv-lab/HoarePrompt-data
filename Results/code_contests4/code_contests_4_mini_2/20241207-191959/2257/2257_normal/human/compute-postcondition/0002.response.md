The variable `buy` is assigned an empty dictionary. The other variables (`n`, `m`, and `cs`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer based on the input, `m` is an integer based on the input, `cs` is a sorted list of integers from input, and `buy` is an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`n` is an integer based on the input, `m` is an integer based on the input, `cs` is a sorted list of integers from input, and `buy` is an empty dictionary.**
