You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The spring is coming and it means that a lot of fruits appear on the counters. One sunny day little boy Valera decided to go shopping. He made a list of m fruits he wanted to buy. If Valera want to buy more than one fruit of some kind, he includes it into the list several times. 

When he came to the fruit stall of Ashot, he saw that the seller hadn't distributed price tags to the goods, but put all price tags on the counter. Later Ashot will attach every price tag to some kind of fruits, and Valera will be able to count the total price of all fruits from his list. But Valera wants to know now what can be the smallest total price (in case of the most «lucky» for him distribution of price tags) and the largest total price (in case of the most «unlucky» for him distribution of price tags).

Input

The first line of the input contains two integer number n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of price tags (which is equal to the number of different kinds of fruits that Ashot sells) and the number of items in Valera's list. The second line contains n space-separated positive integer numbers. Each of them doesn't exceed 100 and stands for the price of one fruit of some kind. The following m lines contain names of the fruits from the list. Each name is a non-empty string of small Latin letters which length doesn't exceed 32. It is guaranteed that the number of distinct fruits from the list is less of equal to n. Also it is known that the seller has in stock all fruits that Valera wants to buy.

Output

Print two numbers a and b (a ≤ b) — the minimum and the maximum possible sum which Valera may need to buy all fruits from his list.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100; prices is a list of n positive integers where each price does not exceed 100; and the following m lines contain non-empty strings representing fruit names, with the number of distinct fruits less than or equal to n.
def func():
    n, m = map(int, raw_input().split())
    cs = sorted(list(map(int, raw_input().split())))
    buy = dict()
    for i in range(m):
        nf = raw_input()
        
        buy[nf] = buy.get(nf, 0) + 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer based on the input, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `cs` is a sorted list of integers from input, `buy` is a dictionary with the counts of input strings, and the number of unique keys in `buy` depends on the distinct input strings received.
    counts = sorted(list(buy.values()))
    maxi = 0
    mini = 0
    for i in range(len(counts)):
        maxi += cs[-i - 1] * counts[-i - 1]
        
        mini += cs[i] * counts[-i - 1]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer based on the input, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `cs` is a sorted list of integers from input, `buy` is a dictionary with the counts of input strings, `counts` is a sorted list of the values from the `buy` dictionary, `maxi` is the sum of products of the largest elements in `cs` with their corresponding counts, `mini` is the sum of products of the smallest elements in `cs` with their corresponding counts.
    print('%d %d' % (mini, maxi))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers `n` and `m`, reads `n` positive integers representing fruit prices, counts `m` fruit purchases, and calculates and prints the total minimum and maximum costs based on the purchases. If `m` is 0, it will return 0 for both costs.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
