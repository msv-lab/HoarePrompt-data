To evaluate the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the code alongside the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to calculate the minimum and maximum possible costs Valera may incur based on the fruit prices and his list of fruits. The key requirements include:
1. Reading the number of price tags `n` and the number of fruits `m`.
2. Reading `n` positive integers representing the prices.
3. Counting the occurrences of each fruit from Valera's list.
4. Calculating the minimum and maximum total costs based on the distribution of prices.

### Code Analysis:
1. The first line reads `n` and `m`.
2. The prices are sorted in ascending order (`cs = sorted(list(map(int, raw_input().split())))`).
3. A dictionary `buy` is used to count occurrences of each fruit.
4. The counts of each fruit are sorted.
5. The maximum cost is computed by multiplying the highest prices with the counts in reverse order.
6. The minimum cost is computed by multiplying the lowest prices with the counts in reverse order.
7. Finally, it prints the minimum and maximum costs.

### Edge Case Consideration:
1. If `m` is 0 (which is not specified in the problem description), the code does not handle it explicitly; however, the problem guarantees that the number of distinct fruits from the list is less than or equal to `n`, implying `m` will always be at least 1.
2. The computation of `mini` and `maxi` relies on the assumption that there will always be enough prices to distribute, which is guaranteed by the problem statement.

### Output Hints:
The output hints confirm that the function correctly calculates the total minimum and maximum costs based on the purchases. Specifically, if `m` is 0, it states that it will return 0 for both costs, which is not considered in the provided code.

### Conclusion:
The program follows the logic outlined in the problem description for all valid inputs. However, the hint about `m` being 0 is misleading since the problem guarantees that `m` will always be at least 1. The code does not need to handle the case where `m` is 0, as it is not a valid scenario per the problem constraints.

Given the conditions and the checks performed, the code appears correct based on the specified requirements.

Correctness: **True**.
