Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's an explanation of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The function first takes two integers, `n` and `m`, where `n` is the number of price tags (and also the number of different kinds of fruits) and `m` is the number of items in Valera's list. This matches the problem constraints.

2. **Reading Prices**: It reads `n` positive integers that represent the prices of the fruits and sorts them. Sorting the prices is essential for calculating the minimum and maximum costs later.

3. **Counting Fruit Purchases**: The program uses a dictionary to count how many of each fruit Valera wants to buy. It ensures that even if the same fruit appears multiple times in Valera's list, it correctly counts the total number of that fruit.

4. **Calculating Costs**:
   - The program sorts the counts of fruit purchases, which allows it to easily match the counts with the sorted prices.
   - For the maximum cost, it multiplies the highest prices with the highest counts. This ensures that Valera ends up paying the maximum possible price (the "most unlucky" distribution).
   - For the minimum cost, it multiplies the lowest prices with the highest counts. This ensures that Valera pays the minimum possible price (the "most lucky" distribution).

5. **Output**: Finally, it prints the minimum and maximum costs in the required format.

The program handles all potential cases defined in the problem description, including cases where Valera wants to buy multiple fruits of the same kind and ensures that the total costs are calculated correctly based on the distribution of prices to fruits.

Overall, the logic, flow, and calculations in the program are consistent with the requirements of the problem description, confirming that the program is correct.
