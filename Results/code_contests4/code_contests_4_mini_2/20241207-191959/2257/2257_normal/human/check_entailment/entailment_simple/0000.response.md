To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step and see if it meets the stated requirements.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Input Requirements**:
   - Two integers `n` (number of price tags) and `m` (number of fruits Valera wants).
   - A list of `n` integers representing the prices of different fruits.
   - A list of `m` fruit names, which may contain duplicates.

2. **Output Requirements**:
   - Two integers representing the minimum and maximum possible sum Valera could spend based on the distribution of price tags.

### Program Logic
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of price tags (`n`) and the number of fruits (`m`).
   - It reads the prices and sorts them in ascending order.

2. **Counting Fruits**:
   - The program creates a dictionary `buy` to count how many of each unique fruit Valera intends to buy.

3. **Calculating Maximum and Minimum Prices**:
   - `counts` is created to hold the number of each unique fruit Valera wants to buy, sorted in ascending order.
   - `maxi` is calculated by multiplying the highest prices with the highest counts (most "unlucky" scenario).
   - `mini` is calculated by multiplying the lowest prices with the highest counts (most "lucky" scenario).

### Key Points in the Implementation
- The program correctly sorts the prices and counts.
- The program calculates the maximum price by pairing the most expensive prices with the quantities of fruits Valera wants in descending order.
- The minimum price is calculated by pairing the cheapest prices with the quantities in ascending order.

### Verification of the Logic
- By pairing the most expensive prices with the highest quantities for the maximum cost, the program fulfills the "unlucky" scenario.
- By pairing the cheapest prices with the highest quantities for the minimum cost, the program fulfills the "lucky" scenario.
- The program handles all edge cases, including:
  - Different numbers of fruit requests with duplicates.
  - Distinct fruits being less than or equal to the number of prices.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic needed to compute both the minimum and maximum costs based on the problem description. It adheres to the constraints and handles input correctly.

Therefore, the correctness of the program can be summarized as follows:

Correctness: **True**
