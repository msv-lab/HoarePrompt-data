The variable `s` is incremented by the value of `a[i] - a[i - k]`. The values of `a[i]` and `a[i - k]` depend on the previous state of the list `a` and the variable `k`, which are not provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact change in `s`. The other variables `n`, `i`, and `mn` remain unaffected. The output state reflects the operation on `s` and the unchanged variables.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 2; `s` is increased by `a[i] - a[i - k]`, `mn` is assigned the minimum value between `mn` and `s`.**
