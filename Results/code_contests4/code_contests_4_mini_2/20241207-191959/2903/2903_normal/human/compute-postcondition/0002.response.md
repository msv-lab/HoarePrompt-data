To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the loop structure and the variable conditions.

1. The loop is defined as `for i in range(0, n - 1)`, which means that `i` will take values starting from 0 up to `n - 2`.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, the upper limit of the range must be greater than 0, which means `n - 1` must be greater than 0. 
3. Therefore, `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to have any iterations (i.e., `n >= 2`).
4. The variables `k`, `s`, `mn`, and `a` do not affect whether the loop executes, but they can be in any state as they are not involved in the loop's control structure.

To summarize, the adjustments needed for the loop to execute are:
- `n` must be at least 2 to ensure that `n - 1` is at least 1.
- `i` should start at 0 when the loop begins.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 0**
