Initial State: `w` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers of length `w - 1`.

```
n, k, s, mn = map(int, raw_input().split() + [0, 10000000000])
```

Now, `raw_input().split()` is executed, which accepts a string input and splits it into a list of strings based on spaces. This list is then combined with `[0, 10000000000]`, resulting in a new list of strings. The `map(int, ...)` function converts each element of this combined list into an integer. 

The variables `n`, `k`, `s`, and `mn` are assigned the first four integer values from this list, while the last two integers (0 and 10000000000) will be assigned to `mn` in this context. 

Since we do not have the exact values of the input, we note that `n`, `k`, and `s` will be integers taken from the input, and `mn` will be assigned the value `10000000000`.

Therefore, the output state will reflect that `n`, `k`, and `s` are integers from the input, and `mn` is `10000000000`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `s` is an integer from input, `mn` is 10000000000**
