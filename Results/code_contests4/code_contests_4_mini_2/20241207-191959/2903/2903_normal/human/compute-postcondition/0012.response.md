The value of `s` is updated by adding the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - k]`. The previous value of `s` is unknown as well as the values of `a[i]` and `a[i - k]`, but `mn` is set to be the minimum of its current value and the new value of `s`. Therefore, the Output State reflects that `s` is now updated, but we cannot specify its exact value or the values of `a[i]` and `a[i - k]`. 

Output State: **`s` is updated by adding the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - k]`, and `mn` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `s`.**
