According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 2, which means `n - 1` is at least 1. Thus, the loop can execute again as `i` is currently less than `n - 1`. 

After the current iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than `n - 1`. Given that `n` is at least 2, `n - 1` is at least 1, which means the loop can still execute again when `i` is 2 if `n` is at least 3.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be at least 3**
