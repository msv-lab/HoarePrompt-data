The value of `s` is incremented by `a[i]`, where `i` is currently 1. Since `n` is at least 2, `i` is less than `n - 1`, allowing the loop to execute a second time. The previous value of `a[i]` is not specified, so we cannot determine the specific value added to `s`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, and `s` is increased by `a[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, and `s` is increased by `a[i]**.
