The variable `a` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the result of `raw_input().split()`. The previous values of `n`, `k`, `s`, and `mn` are unaffected by this operation. The output state reflects the addition of the new variable `a`, which holds a list of integers derived from user input. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `s` is an integer from input, `mn` is 10000000000, `a` is a list of integers from input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `s` is an integer from input, `mn` is 10000000000, `a` is a list of integers from input.**
