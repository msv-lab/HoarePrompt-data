The value of `s` is incremented by the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - k]`. Given that `i` is greater than or equal to `k`, both `a[i]` and `a[i - k]` are valid indices, but the exact values of `a[i]` and `a[i - k]` are unknown. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `s` due to the operation, while `mn` retains its previous assignment of the minimum value between `mn` and `s`. The states of `n` and `i` are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `i` is greater than or equal to `k, s is increased by a[i] - a[i - k]**
