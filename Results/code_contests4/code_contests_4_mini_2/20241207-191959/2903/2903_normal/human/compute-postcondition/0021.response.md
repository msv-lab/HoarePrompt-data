The function `func` does not explicitly accept parameters in the function definition provided. However, based on the parameter constraints, we can infer the following: 

- `w` is a positive integer representing the width of the river, constrained such that \(1 \leq l < w \leq 10^5\).
- `l` is a positive integer representing the maximum length of a frog's jump, constrained such that \(l < w\).
- `a` is a list of integers of length \(w - 1\), where each element \(a[i]\) (with \(0 \leq a[i] \leq 10^4\)) represents the number of stones at the distance \(i\) from the bank.

The function's output is not detailed in the provided information, but it can be inferred that the function will likely return some result based on these inputs, possibly related to the frog's ability to cross the river based on the stones available.

Since the specific output of the function is not given, we cannot detail the return value accurately. However, we can state the parameters that are inferred from the constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters w (a positive integer representing the width of the river), l (a positive integer representing the maximum length of a frog's jump), and a (a list of integers representing the number of stones at various distances from the bank). The specific return value of the function is not provided.**
