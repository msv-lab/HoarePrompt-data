According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 2, and `i` is currently 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1.

Since `i` is less than `n - 1` (because `n` is at least 2, which means `n - 1` is at least 1), the loop will execute again. The states need to be adjusted accordingly for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than `n - 1`**
