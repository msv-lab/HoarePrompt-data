The variable `s` is incremented by the value of `a[i]`, where `i` is currently 0. The values of `n` and `k` are not specified beyond the given conditions, but `i` being less than `k` implies that `i` is valid for the index of array `a`. Therefore, after execution, `s` will have the value of `s + a[0]`. 

The states of the other variables, `n`, `i`, and `k`, remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `s` is updated to `s + a[0]`, and `i` is less than `k`.**
