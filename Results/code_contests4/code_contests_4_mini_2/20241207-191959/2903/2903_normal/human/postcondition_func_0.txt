The function accepts integers `n` (number of stones), `k` (maximum number of jumps), and a list `a` (number of stones at each distance from the bank). It calculates the sum of stones in the first `k` distances and then iteratively adjusts this sum by adding stones at the current distance and subtracting stones from the distance `k` jumps back. The function returns the minimum of the final sum and the minimum sum encountered during the iterations, representing the least number of stones that a frog would have to jump over to cross the river. The function does not explicitly handle cases where `n` is less than 2 or where `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, which could lead to unexpected results.
