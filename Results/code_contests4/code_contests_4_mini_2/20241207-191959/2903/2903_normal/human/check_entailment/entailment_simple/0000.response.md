Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as defined in the problem description. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` and `map(int, raw_input().split() + [0, 10000000000])` to read input. This assumes the first input line contains two integers (width of the river `w` and maximum jump length `l`), but the program is trying to read four integers (`n`, `k`, `s`, `mn`). This is inconsistent with the problem's input format.

2. **Variable Definitions**: The variables `n` and `k` do not correspond to the values defined in the problem description. The problem description requires `w` and `l`, while the program is using `n` and `k` without clear definitions of what they represent. 

3. **Logic Errors**: The logic used in the for loop does not correctly calculate the maximum number of frogs that can cross the river. The intended logic should involve tracking the stones available at each distance and ensuring that the frogs can jump from one stone to another without exceeding their jump limit `l`. The program currently does not implement this logic.

4. **Final Output**: The output of the program is `print(min(mn, s))`, which does not match the requirement of printing the maximum number of frogs that can cross the river. The minimum of `mn` and `s` is not relevant to the problem as defined.

In summary, the program does not adhere to the requirements set forth in the problem description, both in terms of input handling and the logic to compute the maximum number of frogs that can cross the river. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
