w is an integer representing the width of the river (1 ≤ l < w ≤ 10^5), l is an integer representing the maximum length of a frog's jump (1 ≤ l < w), and a is a list of integers of length w-1, where each a[i] (0 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^4) represents the number of stones at the distance i from the starting bank.
