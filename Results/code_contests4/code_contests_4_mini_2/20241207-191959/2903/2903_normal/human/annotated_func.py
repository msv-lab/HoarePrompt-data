#State of the program right berfore the function call: w is a positive integer representing the width of the river (1 ≤ l < w ≤ 10^5), l is a positive integer representing the maximum length of a frog's jump (l < w), and a is a list of integers of length w - 1, where each element a[i] (0 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^4) represents the number of stones at the distance i from the bank.
def func():
    n, k, s, mn = map(int, raw_input().split() + [0, 10000000000])
    a = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    for i in range(0, n - 1):
        if i < k:
            s += a[i]
        else:
            mn = min(mn, s)
            s += a[i] - a[i - k]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is at least 2, `k` is a non-negative integer, `s` is the sum of the first `k` elements of `a` if `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, or the sum of all elements in `a` if `n` is less than `k`, and `mn` is the minimum value of `s` encountered during the iterations.
    print(min(mn, s))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts integers `n` (number of stones), `k` (maximum number of jumps), and a list `a` (number of stones at each distance from the bank). It calculates the sum of stones in the first `k` distances and then iteratively adjusts this sum by adding stones at the current distance and subtracting stones from the distance `k` jumps back. The function returns the minimum of the final sum and the minimum sum encountered during the iterations, representing the least number of stones that a frog would have to jump over to cross the river. The function does not explicitly handle cases where `n` is less than 2 or where `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, which could lead to unexpected results.
