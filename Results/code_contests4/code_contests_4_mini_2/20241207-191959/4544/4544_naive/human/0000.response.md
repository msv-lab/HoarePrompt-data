To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the function `func_1`.

The problem description requires the function to read participant numbers and their corresponding fish caught, and then output the participant number of the winner and the number of fish caught. If there are multiple winners (i.e., participants with the same maximum fish caught), the winner with the lowest participant number should be chosen.

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of participants and their respective fish caught.
2. **Logic for Finding Winners**:
   - The program uses a loop to compare the number of fish caught by each participant.
   - It updates the winner based on the conditions: if the current participant has caught more fish, or if they have caught the same number of fish but have a lower participant number.
3. **Output**: The program prints the winner's participant number and the number of fish caught.

### Potential Case to Check:
Let's consider an edge case where there are multiple participants with the same maximum fish caught:

**Input Example:**
```
4
1 30
2 30
3 25
4 20
```
Here, participants 1 and 2 both caught 30 fish. According to the problem statement, the output should be the participant number with the lowest number, which is `1`.

### Analysis of the Program:
- For the input above, the program will correctly identify participant 1 as the winner because it checks for the condition `v > value or (v == value and a < number)` which ensures that if two participants have the same `v`, the one with the lower `a` will be chosen.
- The program uses `maxsize` which is an appropriate initial value since it ensures that any participant's fish count will be greater on the first comparison.

### Conclusion:
The logic implemented in the program adheres to the problem description and handles the edge case correctly. 

Thus, there do not appear to be any cases where the program would fail to meet the requirements given in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.
