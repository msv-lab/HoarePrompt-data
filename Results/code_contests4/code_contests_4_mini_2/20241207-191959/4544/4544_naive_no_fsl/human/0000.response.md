To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze its logic step by step.

### Problem Requirements:
1. The program reads an integer `n`, representing the number of participants.
2. Then it reads `n` pairs of integers where each pair consists of a participant number and the number of fish they caught.
3. The program should determine the participant with the maximum number of fish caught.
4. In case of a tie (multiple participants with the same maximum number of fish), it should return the one with the lowest participant number.
5. The output should consist of the winner's participant number and the number of fish caught.

### Given Program:
```python
def func_1(readline=stdin.readline):
    value = -1
    number = maxsize
    for _ in range(int(readline())):
        (a, v) = (int(s) for s in readline().split())
        if v > value or (v == value and a < number):
            number = a
            value = v
    print(number, value)
    exit()
func_1()
```

### Analysis:
- The program initializes `value` to -1 and `number` to `maxsize`.
- It iterates `n` times, reading participant numbers and their corresponding fish counts.
- It uses a comparison to check if the current fish count `v` is greater than the `value` (the maximum found so far). If so, it updates both `number` and `value`.
- If `v` equals the current maximum `value`, it checks if the participant number `a` is smaller than `number` and updates accordingly.
- Finally, it prints the winner's participant number and the number of fish caught.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Single Participant**: If there is only one participant, the program should correctly identify them as the winner.
2. **All Participants with Zero Fish**: The program should return the participant with the lowest number when all have caught zero fish.
3. **Participants with Same Maximum Fish Count**: The program should correctly identify the participant with the lowest number in case of ties.
4. **Non-Sequential Participant Numbers**: The program should still correctly handle non-sequential participant numbers (e.g., if participants are numbered 2, 4, and 6).

### Potential Case for Incorrectness:
- If the input is:
    ```
    3
    1 10
    2 10
    3 5
    ```
  The expected output is `1 10` since both participant 1 and participant 2 have caught the same maximum number of fish (10), but participant 1 has the lower number. The program should correctly identify this scenario.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the program correctly identifies the winner based on the criteria specified in the problem description. It handles all edge cases mentioned without any flaws. 

Correctness: **True**
