The code assigns values to `a` and `v` by taking two integers from the input, where each integer `s` is read from `readline()`, split by whitespace, and converted to an integer. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 20 and `readline()` must also provide integers within the same range, the values of `a` and `v` will be assigned accordingly, but their specific values cannot be determined without an actual input.

Therefore, the Output State reflects the range of possible values for `a` and `v` given the constraints.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 20; `a` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `v` ≤ 20 from the input.**
