Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 20; `a` is an integer assigned from input; `v` is an integer assigned from input. If `v` is greater than `value` or `v` is equal to `value` and `a` is less than `number` (where `number` is equal to `a` and `value` is equal to `v`), then the condition holds. In all other cases, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
