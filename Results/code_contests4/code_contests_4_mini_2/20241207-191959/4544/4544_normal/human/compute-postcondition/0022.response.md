Functionality: ** The function accepts a callable `readline` that reads input lines, processes participant numbers and the number of fish caught by each participant, and identifies the participant with the highest number of fish caught. In the event of a tie in the number of fish, it returns the smallest participant number. If no valid participants are processed, it defaults to returning the maximum size integer (indicating no valid data), along with -1 for the number of fish caught. The function does not return a value but prints the participant number and the corresponding fish count before exiting. **
