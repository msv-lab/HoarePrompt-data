The execution of the code snippet `exit()` does not change any variable values but indicates that the program is terminating. Therefore, the previous values of the variables remain unchanged, and the program does not produce an output in the expected format. The output state will reflect the current values prior to termination.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 20; `value` is the maximum number of fish caught by any participant or -1 if no valid `v` was encountered; `number` is the participant number associated with `value` or remains `maxsize` if no participants were processed; the output is printed as (number, value).**
