The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `readline`, which is a callable that reads input lines. The function processes a series of participants, each identified by a unique integer (participant numbers) and their respective number of fish caught. The function returns the participant number who caught the most fish. If there are multiple participants with the same maximum number of fish caught, it returns the participant with the smallest number. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter readline, processes participant numbers and their fish caught, and returns the participant number with the most fish caught, prioritizing the smallest participant number in case of a tie.**
