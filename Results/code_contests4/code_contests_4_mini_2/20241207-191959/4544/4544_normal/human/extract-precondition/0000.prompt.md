You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: A smelt fishing tournament was held at Lake Hibara. The winner is the one who wins the most smelt.

Create a program that reads the list of participant numbers and the number of fish caught and outputs the number of winners and the number of fish caught. If there are multiple winners, output the one with the lowest participant number.



input

The input is given in the following format.


n
a1 v1
a2 v2
::
an vn


n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) represents the number of participants and ai represents the participant number. Participant numbers are different integers between 1 and n. vi (0 ≤ vi ≤ 100) is the number of animals acquired by the participant ai.

output

Output the winner's participant number and the number of fish caught on one line separated by blanks.

Example

Input

6
1 14
2 25
