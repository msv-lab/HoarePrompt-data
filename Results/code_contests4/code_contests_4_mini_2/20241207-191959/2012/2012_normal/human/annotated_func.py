#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are strings representing non-negative integers, potentially with leading zeroes, and i and j are non-negative integers representing the lengths of a and b respectively, with 0 <= i, j <= 10^6.
def func_1(a, b, i, j):
    if (alen > blen) :
        return '>'
        #The program returns the string '>' indicating that string 'a' is greater than string 'b'
    else :
        if (alen < blen) :
            return '<'
            #The program returns the string '<' indicating that string 'a' is less than string 'b'
        #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` and `b` are strings representing non-negative integers, potentially with leading zeroes; `i` and `j` are non-negative integers representing the lengths of `a` and `b` respectively, with 0 <= i, j <= 10^6. The length of `a` is equal to the length of `b` (i = j).
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a` and `b` are strings representing non-negative integers, potentially with leading zeroes; `i` and `j` are non-negative integers representing the lengths of `a` and `b` respectively, with 0 <= i, j <= 10^6. The length of `a` is equal to the length of `b` (i = j).
    while i < allen and j < bllen:
        if a[i] < b[j]:
            return '<'
        elif a[i] > b[j]:
            return '>'
        
        i += 1

    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `i` is equal to `allen`, `j` is equal to `bllen`, `a` and `b` are strings representing non-negative integers; if the loop executed, then the characters in `a` and `b` at positions `i` were equal for all iterations. If `a` and `b` were not equal at any point, the loop would have exited early and returned either '<' or '>'.
    return '='
    #The program returns '=' indicating that the characters in strings 'a' and 'b' are equal at all positions iterated by 'i'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two string parameters `a` and `b`, which represent non-negative integers (potentially with leading zeroes), and two integer parameters `i` and `j`, which denote the lengths of `a` and `b`. It compares the strings based on their lengths first; if `a` is longer than `b`, it returns '>', if shorter, it returns '<'. If they are of equal length, it compares the characters of `a` and `b` sequentially from index `i` and `j`, returning '<' or '>' as soon as it finds a difference, and '=' if all characters are equal. The function does not handle cases where the lengths `i` and `j` do not match the actual lengths of `a` and `b`.
