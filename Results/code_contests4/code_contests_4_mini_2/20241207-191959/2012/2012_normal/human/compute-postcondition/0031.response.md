The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `a`, `b`, `i`, and `j`. The parameters `a` and `b` are strings that represent non-negative integers, potentially with leading zeroes. The parameters `i` and `j` are non-negative integers that represent the lengths of strings `a` and `b`, respectively, with constraints that 0 <= i, j <= 10^6. 

After executing the function body, it can return various results based on the comparisons of the strings and their characters:

- Case 1: The function returns the string '>' if string 'a' is greater than string 'b'.
- Case 2: The function returns the string '<' if string 'a' is less than string 'b'.
- Case 3: The function returns the character '<' if the character at index 'i' of string 'a' is less than the character at index 'j' of string 'b'.
- Case 4: The function returns '>' if the character at position 'i' in string 'a' is greater than the character at position 'j' in string 'b'.
- Case 5: The function returns the string '<'.
- Case 6: The function returns the character '>' if the character at position 'i' in string 'a' is greater than or equal to the character at position 'j' in string 'b', while also being less than or equal to the same character in 'b'.
- Case 7: The function returns the string '<'.
- Case 8: The function returns the string '>' indicating a comparison or result without utilizing or providing information about the values of `a`, `b`, `i`, `j`, or their lengths.
- Case 9: The function returns '=' if the characters in strings 'a' and 'b' are equal at all positions iterated by 'i'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two string parameters representing non-negative integers and two integer parameters representing their lengths, and to perform various comparisons between the strings and their characters, returning specific comparison results as strings. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two string parameters `a` and `b` representing non-negative integers, and two integer parameters `i` and `j` representing their lengths. It returns comparison results as strings based on the values of `a`, `b`, and their characters at the specified indices.**
