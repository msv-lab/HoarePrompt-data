Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are strings representing non-negative integers. If the character at position `i` in string `a` is less than the character at position `j` in string `b`, the program returns the string '<'. If the character at position `i` in string `a` is greater than the character at position `j` in string `b`, the program returns the string '>'. In either case, the indices `i` and `j` are both increased by 1, and the loop will execute again if `allen` is greater than `i` and `bllen` is greater than `j`.***
