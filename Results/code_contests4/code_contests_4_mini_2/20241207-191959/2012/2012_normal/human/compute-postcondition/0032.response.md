Functionality: ** The function accepts two string parameters `a` and `b`, which represent non-negative integers (potentially with leading zeroes), and two integer parameters `i` and `j`, which denote the lengths of `a` and `b`. It compares the strings based on their lengths first; if `a` is longer than `b`, it returns '>', if shorter, it returns '<'. If they are of equal length, it compares the characters of `a` and `b` sequentially from index `i` and `j`, returning '<' or '>' as soon as it finds a difference, and '=' if all characters are equal. The function does not handle cases where the lengths `i` and `j` do not match the actual lengths of `a` and `b`.**
