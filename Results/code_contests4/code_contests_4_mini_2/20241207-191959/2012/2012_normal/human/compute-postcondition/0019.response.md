Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are strings representing non-negative integers. If the character at position `i` in string `a` is less than the character at position `j` in string `b`, the program returns the string '<'. Otherwise, since the character at position `i` in string `a` is greater than or equal to the character at position `j` in string `b` and also less than or equal to the same character in `b`, the program returns the character '>'.***
