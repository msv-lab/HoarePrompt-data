`j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown. The values of `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are strings representing non-negative integers; `i` is increased by 1; `j` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are strings representing non-negative integers; `i` is increased by 1; `j` is increased by 1**
