Output State: **`i` is equal to `allen`, `j` is equal to `bllen`, `a` and `b` are strings representing non-negative integers; if the loop executed, then the characters in `a` and `b` at positions `i` were equal for all iterations. If `a` and `b` were not equal at any point, the loop would have exited early and returned either '<' or '>'.**
