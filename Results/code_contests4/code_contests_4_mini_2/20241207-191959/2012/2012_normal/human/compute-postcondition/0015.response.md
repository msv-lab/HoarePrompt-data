To determine if the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions specified in the loop: `i < allen` and `j < bllen`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `allen` is greater than `i`
- `allen` is greater than `j`
- The character at position `i` in string `a` is greater than or equal to the character at position `j` in string `b`
- The character at position `i` in string `a` is less than or equal to the character at position `j` in string `b`
- `i` is increased by 1
- `j` is increased by 1

Since `i` has been increased by 1, we need to ensure that both `i` and `j` are still less than `allen` and `bllen`, respectively, for the loop to continue executing.

1. After the last iteration, `i` is now `i + 1`.
2. For the loop to execute one more time, we require:
   - `i + 1 < allen` → implies `i < allen - 1`
   - `j + 1 < bllen` → implies `j < bllen - 1`

Since it is given that `allen` is greater than `i`, it only needs to be adjusted to `allen` is greater than `i + 1` for the loop to potentially execute again. Similarly, `bllen` must be greater than `j + 1`.

Therefore, we conclude that:
- `allen` must be greater than `i + 1`
- `bllen` must be greater than `j + 1`

No other states need to be adjusted as they already satisfy the other conditions.

State: **`a` and `b` are strings representing non-negative integers, `allen` is greater than `i + 1`, `allen` is greater than `j + 1`, the character at position `i` in string `a` is greater than or equal to the character at position `j` in string `b`, the character at position `i` in string `a` is less than or equal to the character at position `j` in string `b`.**
