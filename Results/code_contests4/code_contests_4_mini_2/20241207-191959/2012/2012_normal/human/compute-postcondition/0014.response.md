The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown. The values of the other variables (`a`, `b`, `allen`, `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are strings representing non-negative integers, `allen` is greater than `i`, `allen` is greater than `j`, the character at position `i` in string `a` is greater than or equal to the character at position `j` in string `b`, and the character at position `i` in string `a` is less than or equal to the character at position `j` in string `b`; `i` is increased by 1, and `j` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are strings representing non-negative integers, `allen` is greater than `i`, `allen` is greater than `j`, the character at position `i` in string `a` is greater than or equal to the character at position `j` in string `b`, the character at position `i` in string `a` is less than or equal to the character at position `j` in string `b`; `i` is increased by 1, `j` is increased by 1.**
