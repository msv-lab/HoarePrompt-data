The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown, so the output state is: variable `j` is increased by 1. The values of `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`a` and `b` are strings representing non-negative integers; `i` is increased by 1; variable `j` is increased by 1.**
