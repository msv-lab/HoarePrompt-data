Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description for all possible cases. Here are the issues:

1. **Variable Naming**: The program uses `alen` and `blen` without initializing or defining them in the function. It should be using `i` and `j` to determine the lengths of `a` and `b`, respectively. This will lead to a `NameError` when the function is executed.

2. **Comparison Logic**: The comparison logic should first handle the case where the lengths of `a` and `b` are different. If `i` (length of `a`) is greater than `j` (length of `b`), then `a` is greater, and vice versa. This part is correct. 

3. **Handling Leading Zeroes**: The program does not properly handle the potential leading zeroes in the input. For instance, comparing "00012345" to "12345" should return '='. The program's logic assumes that the strings are directly comparable character by character without accounting for the leading zeroes prior to the length comparison. 

4. **Returning Values**: The return values when comparing the characters in the while loop are correct, but since the lengths of `a` and `b` are not handled correctly, the program will not function as intended.

In summary, the program fails to check for leading zeroes and does not properly initialize or use the variables needed to compare the lengths of the two numbers. Therefore, it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description in all cases.
