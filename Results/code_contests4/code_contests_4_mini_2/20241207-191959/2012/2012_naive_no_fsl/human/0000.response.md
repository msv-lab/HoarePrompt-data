Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a flaw when it comes to handling cases where both input integers have leading zeroes and are equal after trimming the leading zeroes. The logic used to compare the lengths (`alen` and `blen`) is correct, but when both numbers are equal in length, the comparison of their digits is done incorrectly. 

Hereâ€™s a specific case where the program fails:

Input:
```
000000
0
```

Expected Output: `=`

However, the program will compare the lengths of `000000` and `0` after trimming the leading zeroes, giving `alen = 6` and `blen = 1`. Since `alen > blen`, it will incorrectly return `>`.

This shows that the program does not work correctly for all potential inputs, particularly those that involve leading zeroes and are equal after trimming.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
