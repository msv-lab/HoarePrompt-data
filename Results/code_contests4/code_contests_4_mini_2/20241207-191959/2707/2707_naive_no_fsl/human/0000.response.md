To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the code carefully.

The task is to select `n1` residents for the first city and `n2` for the second city in such a way that the sum of their arithmetic means is maximized.

### Code Analysis:
1. The input consists of `n`, `n1`, and `n2`, followed by an array of integers representing the wealth of candidates.
2. The code sorts the wealth array `a` in ascending order.
3. It checks which of `n1` or `n2` is larger, swapping them if necessary so that `n1` is always less than or equal to `n2`.
4. It then calculates the total wealth of the richest `n1` candidates for the first city and the next `n2` richest candidates for the second city.
5. Finally, it computes the arithmetic means for both cities and prints their sum.

### Potential Issues:
The logic for selecting the candidates seems correct at a glance, as it prioritizes wealth by sorting and then selecting the top candidates. However, we need to ensure that the selection process adheres to the rules specified.

#### Example Case:
Let's consider an edge case:
- **Input**: 
  ```
  5 2 3
  1 2 3 4 5
  ```
- **Expected Output**: 
  - For the first city (2 candidates), select 4 and 5 (wealth = 9, mean = 4.5).
  - For the second city (3 candidates), select 1, 2, and 3 (wealth = 6, mean = 2.0).
  - Total = 4.5 + 2.0 = 6.5.

- **Program Output**:
  - The code will select the top 2 candidates (4, 5) for the first city, summing wealth to 9, and the next 3 candidates (1, 2, 3) for the second city, summing wealth to 6.
  - It calculates the means correctly and outputs 6.5.

### Misleading Cases:
However, let's look at a more problematic input:
- **Input**: 
  ```
  4 1 3
  1 2 3 4
  ```
- **Expected Output**:
  - For the first city (1 candidate), select 4 (mean = 4).
  - For the second city (3 candidates), select 1, 2, 3 (mean = 2).
  - Total = 4 + 2 = 6.

- **Program Output**:
  - The code will select 4 for the first city (wealth = 4) but then selects 3, 2, 1 for the second city (mean = 2, total = 6).
  
### Conclusion:
The code fails to consider the correct order of selection when `n1` is less than `n2`. In this specific situation, the greediness of taking the largest `n1` first may not yield the expected optimal result, as it could overlook a higher mean for the second city.

Thus the program does not meet the requirements in every potential case.

Correctness: **False**
