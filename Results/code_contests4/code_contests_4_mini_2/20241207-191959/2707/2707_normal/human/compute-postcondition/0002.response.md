The `sort` method is called on the list `a`, which rearranges the elements of `a` in ascending order. The previous values of `a` are not specified, but the state of `a` will change to reflect the sorted order of its elements. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.**
