According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n1`. The loop will execute if `n1` is at least 1. The state before the loop starts indicates that `s1` is 0, which does not affect the ability of the loop to execute. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes for the first time, we need to set `n1` to be greater than 0, and the initial value of `i` should be 0, as it will start from 0 and increment for each iteration.

State: **`s1` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n1` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
