In the provided code, `s1` is incremented by the value of `a[n - i - 1]`. The initial value of `s1` is 0, and `i` is 0. For the loop to execute the first time, `n1` must be greater than 0, implying `n` is at least 1. Therefore, we need to know the value of `a[n - i - 1]`.

Assuming `n` is at least 1, we have:

- `n - i - 1` becomes `n - 0 - 1`, which simplifies to `n - 1`.
- Consequently, `s1` is updated to `s1 + a[n - 1]`.

Since `s1` starts at 0, `s1` becomes `0 + a[n - 1]`, which is simply `a[n - 1]`.

Thus, the output state depends on the value of `a[n - 1]`, which is not specified but is valid for the execution context.

Output State: **`s1` is `a[n - 1]`, `i` is 0**
