The code initializes `s2` to 0. Since `s2` is being assigned a new value and no other variables are affected, the output state reflects the new value of `s2` while keeping the previous states of `s1` and `i` unchanged.

Output State: **`s1` is the sum of the last `n1` elements of the list `a`, where `n1` is less than or equal to the length of `a`; `i` is `n1 - 1`; `s2` is 0**
