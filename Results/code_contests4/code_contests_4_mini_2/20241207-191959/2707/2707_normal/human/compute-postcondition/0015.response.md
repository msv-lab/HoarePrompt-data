According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n2`. If `n2` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The current state shows that `i` is `n1 - 1`, which is not directly relevant to the loop's execution condition, but it does indicate that `i` is set to a valid index based on `n1`. For the loop to execute, `n2` must be greater than 0. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, the conditions need to be:
- `n2` is greater than 0
- `i` is initialized to 0 for the loop to start at the first iteration

State: **`s1` is the sum of the last `n1` elements of the list `a`, where `n1` is less than or equal to the length of `a`; `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n2` is greater than 0**
