Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers `n`, `n1`, `n2` and a list of integers `a`, representing the wealth of candidates. It calculates the average wealth of the top `n1` wealthiest candidates and the top `n2` wealthiest candidates (after sorting the list in ascending order), and then outputs the sum of these averages. The function does not return any value but prints the result directly.**
