The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly in its definition. However, it operates under the constraints that there are three implied parameters: `n`, `n1`, `n2`, and `a`. 

- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000.
- `n1` and `n2` are integers such that 1 ≤ n1, n2 ≤ 100,000 and n1 + n2 ≤ n.
- `a` is a list of integers representing the wealth of candidates, where each wealth value `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 100,000.

The output of the function is not explicitly described in the provided information. Therefore, we will need to summarize the functionality based on the constraints and relationships.

Functionality: **The function operates on an integer n, two integers n1 and n2, and a list of integers a where the wealth of candidates is represented. It processes these inputs under specific constraints but the exact return value is not described.**
