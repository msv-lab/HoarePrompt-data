According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n2`. If `i` is less than `n2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute a second time, `n2` must be greater than 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute a third time, `i` will be incremented to 2. For the loop to execute again, `n2` must be greater than 2.

State: **`s1` is the sum of the last `n1` elements of the list `a`, `i` is 2, `s2` is increased by the value of `a[n - n1 - 2]`, for the loop to execute a third time `n2` must be greater than 2.**
