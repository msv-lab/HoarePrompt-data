According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` compared to `n1`. If `i` is less than `n1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `n1` must be greater than 0, and `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1.

State: **`s1` is `a[n - 1]`, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n1` must be greater than 1**
