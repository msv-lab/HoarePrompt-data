The value of `s1` is updated by adding `a[n - i - 1]` to it. Given that `i` is 2, this means `s1` is updated by adding `a[n - 3]` to its current value. The previous value of `s1` is `a[n - 1] + a[n - 2]`. Therefore, the updated value of `s1` becomes `a[n - 1] + a[n - 2] + a[n - 3]`. The other variables are not affected. Thus, the Output State is: `s1` is `a[n - 1] + a[n - 2] + a[n - 3]`, `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute a third time, `n1` must be greater than 2.

Output State: **`s1` is `a[n - 1] + a[n - 2] + a[n - 3]`, `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute a third time, `n1` must be greater than 2.**
