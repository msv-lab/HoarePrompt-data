According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n1`. If `i` is less than `n1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute a second time, `n1` must be greater than 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2, and for the loop to execute again, `n1` must be greater than 2.

State: **`s1` is `a[n - 1] + a[n - 2]`, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a third time, `n1` must be greater than 2**
