The code `s1 += a[n - i - 1]` modifies the value of `s1` by adding to it the value of `a[n - i - 1]`. The initial value of `s1` is `a[n - 1]`, and `i` is 1. Therefore, the term `a[n - i - 1]` simplifies to `a[n - 1 - 1]` or `a[n - 2]`. 

The overall effect is that `s1` now represents the sum of its previous value and the element of array `a` at index `n - 2`. The variable `i` remains unchanged at 1. 

Thus, the Output State is: `s1` is `a[n - 1] + a[n - 2]`, `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute a second time, `n1` must be greater than 1.

Output State: **`s1` is `a[n - 1] + a[n - 2]`, `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute a second time, `n1` must be greater than 1.**
