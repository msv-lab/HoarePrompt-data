The provided program aims to solve the problem of selecting candidates for two cities in such a way that the sum of the arithmetic means of their wealth is maximized. Let's analyze the correctness of the program step by step in relation to the problem description.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the integers `n`, `n1`, and `n2`, and the list of wealths, ensuring that these values meet the constraints imposed by the problem description.

2. **Sorting the Wealth List**: The program sorts the list `a` in ascending order. This is essential because to maximize the sum of the means, we need to select the wealthiest candidates for the cities.

3. **Swapping n1 and n2**: The program checks if `n1` is greater than `n2` and swaps them if necessary. This ensures that we always select the smaller number of candidates first. This is beneficial because once we select the wealthiest candidates for the city with `n1`, the remaining wealthiest candidates will be available for the second city with `n2`.

4. **Calculating the Sums**: 
   - The first loop calculates `s1` as the sum of the wealth of the top `n1` wealthiest candidates by accessing the last `n1` elements of the sorted list.
   - The second loop calculates `s2` as the sum of the wealth of the next top `n2` wealthiest candidates by accessing the next `n2` elements from the remaining candidates.

5. **Outputting the Result**: Finally, the program computes the arithmetic means for both cities and prints their sum. 

The crucial aspect here is that by selecting the wealthiest candidates for each city after sorting, the program adheres to the requirement of maximizing the sum of the arithmetic means. Since it always picks the top wealthiest candidates available for each city, it meets the problem's goal.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. It maximizes the sum of the arithmetic means of the wealth of the selected candidates by ensuring that the wealthiest candidates are chosen for both cities based on the constraints provided.

Correctness: **True**
