To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the program and see if it meets the requirements specified.

### Problem Summary:
The problem requires finding two subsets of candidates (with sizes `n1` and `n2`) from a list of candidates based on their wealth, such that the sum of their arithmetic means is maximized. This means we need to select the wealthiest candidates for both cities.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input values for `n`, `n1`, and `n2`, and the list of wealth values `a`.

2. **Sorting**: The array `a` is sorted in ascending order. This is crucial because to maximize the sum of the means, we need to choose the wealthiest candidates.

3. **Swapping `n1` and `n2`**: The program checks if `n1` is greater than `n2` and swaps them if so. This ensures that the first city (`n1`) always has fewer or an equal number of candidates than the second city (`n2`). This is beneficial because it allows us to always take the wealthiest candidates for the first city first, which can help maximize the average.

4. **Sum Calculation**:
   - For the first city, it sums the wealth of the last `n1` candidates from the sorted list. This corresponds to selecting the wealthiest candidates for the first city.
   - For the second city, it sums the next `n2` wealthiest candidates, starting from where the first city's candidates were selected.

5. **Mean Calculation**: Finally, it calculates the arithmetic mean for both cities and adds them together for the output.

### Conclusion:
The program follows the logic needed to ensure that the wealthiest candidates are selected for both cities, and it correctly implements the arithmetic mean calculations. It handles the edge cases of the sizes of `n1` and `n2` by ensuring that `n1` is always less than or equal to `n2`, which is a smart optimization to maximize the results.

### Correctness Statement:
The program adheres to the problem description's requirements and correctly implements the logic needed to achieve the goal. Therefore, we conclude:

Correctness: **True**
