The given problem is to determine the length of the longest good string that can be formed using a certain number of 'a', 'b', and 'ab' strings, where a good string consists only of 'a's and 'b's with no two consecutive letters being the same.

The provided program is as follows:

```python
(a, b, c) = map(int, raw_input().split())
print(a + b) + 2 * c
```

### Initial Assessment

The program essentially calculates the maximum length of a good string by adding the number of 'a' and 'b' strings to twice the number of 'ab' strings. The reasoning behind this is that:
- Each 'a' contributes 1 to the length.
- Each 'b' contributes 1 to the length.
- Each 'ab' contributes 2 to the length (as it contains both 'a' and 'b').

However, to assess if this is correct, we need to ensure that the code considers all possible arrangements of these strings, particularly in edge cases where the counts of 'a' and 'b' are unequal.

### Edge Cases

1. If `a` is much larger than `b`, the program may not be able to create a good string longer than `2 * b + 1` (which would be the string alternating between 'a' and 'b'). The presence of `c` could allow for additional length, but if `a` exceeds `b + 1`, the excess 'a's cannot be added without breaking the good string condition.

2. If both `a` and `b` are zero while having `c` greater than zero (which is not possible according to the constraints, but worth mentioning), the program would incorrectly produce a length based solely on `c`.

3. The program does not handle cases where `c` is not utilized optimally. For instance, if `a` and `b` are both available, but `c` can change the maximum length, the code does not provide a mechanism to deal with combinations and arrangements effectively.

### Output Hints

The output hints state that the function computes `a + b + 2 * c`, which suggests that it is indeed summing the contributions correctly. However, they do not address the critical arrangement aspect of the problem, particularly when `a` and `b` are significantly mismatched.

### Conclusion

The program does not take into account the limitations of creating a good string based on the counts of 'a' and 'b', particularly when they are not equal. The program fails in scenarios where the string's construction becomes impossible due to having too many of one character type in comparison to the other. 

Thus, the correctness is:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not work correctly in cases where `|a - b| > 1`, failing to produce the correct maximum length of a good string. For example, if `a = 5`, `b = 2`, and `c = 0`, the maximum length should be `2 * 2 + 1 = 5`, but the program would incorrectly output `5` while correctly accounting for arrangement limits.
