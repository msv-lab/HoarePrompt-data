To evaluate the given Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic.

Problem description requires us to find the maximum length of a "good" string that can be formed using a certain number of strings "a", "b", and "ab". The good string must consist of alternating 'a' and 'b' letters, ensuring that no two consecutive characters are the same.

The provided program is:
```python
(a, b, c) = map(int, raw_input().split())
print(a + b) + 2 * c
```

Let's break down what this program does:
1. It reads three integers representing the counts of strings "a", "b", and "ab".
2. It calculates the length of the longest good string by summing the counts of "a" and "b", and adding twice the count of "ab".

Now, we need to verify if this logic correctly computes the maximum possible length of a good string.

### Reasoning:
1. Strings "a" and "b" can only be used such that they alternate, contributing at most `a + b` to the length.
2. Each "ab" string contributes 2 to the length and can be placed between the "a" and "b" strings without violating the alternating rule.

However, there is a flaw in the implementation:
- The program uses `(a + b) + 2 * c`, which suggests that it simply adds the lengths together without considering if there are enough 'a' and 'b' to accommodate the 'ab' strings correctly.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input where:
```
a = 1, b = 0, c = 2
```
- Using the formula: `(1 + 0) + 2 * 2` = `1 + 4` = `5`.
- However, the only strings we can form are "abab" or "a" or "b", which leads to a maximum length of 1 (only 'a' can be used).

In this case, the program gives an incorrect output of `5`, when it should be `1` because we cannot form a valid good string with the given counts.

### Conclusion:
The program fails for the case where `a = 1, b = 0, c = 2`, as it incorrectly calculates the maximum possible length, leading to an incorrect output.

Correctness: **False**.
