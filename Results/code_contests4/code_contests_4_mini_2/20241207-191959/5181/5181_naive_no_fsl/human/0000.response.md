To analyze the correctness of the provided program, we need to understand the requirements and then verify if the code meets those requirements for all potential cases.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. We have three types of strings:
   - `a` strings: consist of only the letter 'a'.
   - `b` strings: consist of only the letter 'b'.
   - `ab` strings: consist of the letters 'a' and 'b'.

2. A "good" string must consist of only 'a' and 'b' such that no two consecutive letters are the same.

3. We need to determine the maximum possible length of a good string that can be formed using the given counts of `a`, `b`, and `ab` strings.

### Logic to Derive the Maximum Length:
- Each `ab` string contributes exactly 2 to the length of the good string because it contains both 'a' and 'b'.
- To form a good string from `a` and `b`:
  - If you have `a` strings and `b` strings, you can use them to alternate between 'a' and 'b'.
  - The maximum length formed by alternating `a` and `b` would be `min(a, b) * 2 + 1` if the count of `a` and `b` differs, or `min(a, b) * 2` if they are equal.

### Provided Code:
```python
(a, b, c) = map(int, raw_input().split())
print(a + b) + 2 * c
```

### Evaluation of the Code:
- The expression `a + b` gives the sum of `a` and `b`, which is incorrect for calculating the alternating pattern. It does not consider the necessity of alternation and the implications of having `ab` strings.
- The expression `+ 2 * c` adds twice the number of `ab` strings, which is correct since each `ab` string contributes 2 to the length.
  
However, the combination used in the code does not correctly compute the maximum length of the "good" string since it fails to handle the alternation logic, especially when `a` and `b` counts are not equal.

### Finding a Counterexample:
Let's consider a case:
- Input: `1 0 1`
  - According to the program: `1 + 0 + 2 * 1 = 3`
  - Correct maximum length should be `2` (using one `ab` string only, resulting in "ab").
  
Thus, the program yields an incorrect result for this input.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly compute the maximum length of the good string for all cases, and at least one input case (e.g., `1 0 1`) demonstrates that it can produce an incorrect output.

Correctness: **False**
