The variable `k` is assigned the value of `int(math.log(i, 2))`. Given that `i` is 3, we calculate `math.log(3, 2)`, which is approximately 1.585. Converting this to an integer using `int` will truncate the decimal, resulting in `k` being 1. The states of the other variables (`sum`, `limit`, `n`, `A`, `s`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `sum` is an integer, `limit` is an integer, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `k` is 1, `A` contains (2, 2), `s` is incremented by 2.

Output State: **`sum` is an integer, `limit` is an integer, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `k` is 1, `A` contains (2, 2), `s` is incremented by 2**
