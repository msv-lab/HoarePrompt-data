The expression `k = (i & -i) - 1` involves a bitwise operation. The variable `i` is 2, and the calculation proceeds as follows:

1. `-i` inverts the bits of `i` (2 in binary is `10`, so `-2` is represented in two's complement as `...11111100`).
2. The bitwise AND operation `i & -i` gives the value of the least significant bit that is set in `i`. For `i = 2`, `i & -i` results in `2` (because `2` in binary is `10` and `-2` in binary is `...11111100`, thus the AND operation results in `10`).
3. Finally, subtracting `1` from this value results in `1`.

The other variables `sum`, `limit`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`sum` is an integer, `limit` is an integer, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `k` is 1, and `s` is increased by 1**.
