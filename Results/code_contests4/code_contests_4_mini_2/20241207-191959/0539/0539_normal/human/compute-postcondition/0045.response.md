Output State: **`sum`, `limit`, `n`, `i`, `k`, `A` is a list with at least `m` elements where `m` is the number of elements in `A` processed until `target` is less than or equal to 0; `s` is less than `target` before the loop starts; `selected` contains the second elements of the tuples from `A` processed until `target` is less than or equal to 0; `target` has been decreased by the sum of the first elements of the tuples in `A` processed until `target` is less than or equal to 0.**
