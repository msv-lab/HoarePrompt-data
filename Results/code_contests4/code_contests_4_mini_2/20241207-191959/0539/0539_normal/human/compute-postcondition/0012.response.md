The value of `k` is assigned the value of `int(math.log(i, 2))`. Given that `i` is 2, we calculate `math.log(2, 2)`, which equals 1. Thus, `k` will be assigned the value 1. The states of the other variables (`sum`, `limit`, `n`, `s`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `sum` is an integer, `limit` is an integer, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `k` is 1, and `s` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`sum` is an integer, `limit` is an integer, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `k` is 1, and `s` is increased by 1.**
