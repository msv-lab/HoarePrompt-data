The code appends a tuple `(2 ** k, i)` to the list `A`. The value of `k` is 0 as specified in the initial state, so `2 ** k` equals `2 ** 0`, which is 1. The value of `i` is 1. Therefore, the tuple that will be appended to the list `A` is `(1, 1)`.

The other variables `sum`, `limit`, `n`, and `k` are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`sum` and `limit` are integers, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `k` is 0; A now contains (1, 1)**.
