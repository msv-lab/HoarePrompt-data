The value of `k` is assigned the result of the expression `(i & -i) - 1`. The value of `i` is 3, so we first calculate `i & -i`. 

In binary, `3` is represented as `11`. The two's complement of `3` (which is `-3`) is `-11` (in binary, this depends on the bit-length chosen, but we can use `11111101` for a simple understanding in an 8-bit system). The bitwise AND operation results in:

```
  11   (which is 3 in binary)
&  01  (which is -3 in binary)
-------
  01   (which is 1 in binary)
```

Thus, `i & -i` gives `1`. Now, we subtract `1` from this result: 

```
1 - 1 = 0
```

So, `k` is assigned the value `0`. The states of the other variables (`sum`, `limit`, `n`, `A`, `s`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `sum` is an integer, `limit` is an integer, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `k` is 0, `A` contains (2, 2), `s` is incremented by 2.

Output State: **`sum` is an integer, `limit` is an integer, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `k` is 0, `A` contains (2, 2), `s` is incremented by 2**
