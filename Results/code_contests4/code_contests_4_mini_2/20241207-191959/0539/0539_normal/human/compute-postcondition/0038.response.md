Output State: **`sum`, `limit`, `n`, `i`, `k`, `A` is a list with at least 2 elements; `s` is less than `target`; `tup` is the second element in A; `target` is now decreased by `tup[0]`; `selected` includes `tup[1]` and `selected` now includes `tup[1]` as an additional element; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
