The variable `s` is assigned the value `0`. The previous values of the affected variables `sum`, `limit`, `target`, `n`, and `A` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `sum` and `limit` are integers such that 1 ≤ `sum`, `limit` ≤ 10^5; `target` and `n` are input integers; `A` is an empty list; `s` is 0.

Output State: **`sum` and `limit` are integers such that 1 ≤ `sum`, `limit` ≤ 10^5; `target` and `n` are input integers; `A` is an empty list; `s` is 0**
