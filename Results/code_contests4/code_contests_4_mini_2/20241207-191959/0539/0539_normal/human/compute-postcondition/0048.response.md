The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates with two integer values, `sum` and `limit`, which are defined with the constraints that 1 ≤ sum, limit ≤ 10^5. The function will return an output based on the logic applied to these integers. However, the specifics of the output are not detailed in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is centered around the use of the integers `sum` and `limit`. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters and returns a value based on the internal logic applied to the integers sum and limit, which must satisfy the constraints 1 ≤ sum, limit ≤ 10^5.**
