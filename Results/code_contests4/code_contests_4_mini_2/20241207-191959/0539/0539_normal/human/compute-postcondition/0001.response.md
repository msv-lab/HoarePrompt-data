The code initializes an empty list `A`. The previous values of the affected variables, `sum`, `limit`, `target`, and `n`, remain unchanged. The output state reflects the initialization of `A` without affecting the other variables.

Output State: **`sum` and `limit` are integers such that 1 ≤ `sum`, `limit` ≤ 10^5; `target` and `n` are input integers; `A` is an empty list.**
