The command `exit()` is executed, which terminates the program immediately. As a result, no values of the variables are changed since the execution is halted. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of the variables without any modifications.

Output State: **`sum` is an integer, `limit` is an integer, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `k` is the last computed value for `k` with `i = n`, `A` contains `n` tuples of the form `(2^k, i)` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `s` is the sum of all the first elements of the tuples in `A`, `s` is less than `target`, and `-1` has been printed.**
