The variable `selected` is updated to include the second element of the tuple `tup`, which is `tup[1]`. The previous values of the affected variables indicate that `selected` will now have an additional element. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `sum`, `limit`, `n`, `i`, `k`, `A` is a list with at least 1 element, `s` is less than `target`, `tup` is the first element in A; `target` is decreased by `tup[0] and `selected` now includes `tup[1]`.
