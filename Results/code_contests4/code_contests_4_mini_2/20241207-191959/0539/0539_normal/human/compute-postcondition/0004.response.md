The code assigns the value `(i & -i) - 1` to `k`. The value of `i` is 1, so we calculate `1 & -1`. The expression `-1` in binary is represented as all bits set to 1 in two's complement, which means `1 & -1` will result in `1`. Thus, `k` is assigned the value `1 - 1`, which is `0`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `sum` is an integer, `limit` is an integer, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, and `k` is 0.

Output State: **`sum` is an integer, `limit` is an integer, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `k` is 0**
