Postcondition: ***`sum`, `limit`, `n`, `i`, `k`, `A` is a list with at least 1 element; `s` is less than `target`; `tup` is the first element in A; `target` is decreased by `tup[0]` and `selected` now includes `tup[1]`. If `target` is less than or equal to 0, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or statement.***
