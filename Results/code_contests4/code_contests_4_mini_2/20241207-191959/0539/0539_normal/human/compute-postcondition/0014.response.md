The code appends a tuple `(2 ** k, i)` to the list `A`. The value of `k` is 1 and the value of `i` is 2. Therefore, `2 ** k` calculates to `2 ** 1`, which is `2`. The resulting tuple is `(2, 2)`. The state of other variables, including `sum`, `limit`, `n`, and `s`, are not affected by this operation. Consequently, the output state is:

Output State: **`sum` is an integer, `limit` is an integer, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `k` is 1, A contains (2, 2)**
