Functionality: ** The function reads two integers, `target` and `n`, from input, calculates a list of tuples based on powers of two and their corresponding indices, and then attempts to select indices whose corresponding powers of two sum to at least `target`. If the sum of all possible powers of two is less than `target`, it outputs -1. If a sufficient sum is found, it prints the number of selected indices and their values. The function does not accept parameters directly and relies on user input for the values of `target` and `n`. **
