The code snippet provided is a print statement that outputs `-1`. This does not affect the values of any of the variables (`sum`, `limit`, `n`, `i`, `k`, `A`, `s`, or `target`). Therefore, the output state remains unchanged for all variables, but it indicates that `-1` has been printed.

Output State: **`sum` is an integer, `limit` is an integer, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `k` is the last computed value for `k` with `i = n`, `A` contains `n` tuples of the form `(2^k, i)` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `s` is the sum of all the first elements of the tuples in `A`, `s` is less than `target`, and `-1` has been printed.**
