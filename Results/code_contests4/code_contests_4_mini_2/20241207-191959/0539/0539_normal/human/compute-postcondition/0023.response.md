Postcondition: ***`sum` is an integer, `limit` is an integer, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `k` is the last computed value for `k` with `i = n`, `A` contains `n` tuples of the form `(2^k, i)` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `s` is the sum of all the first elements of the tuples in `A`, and `s` is less than `target`.***
