Postcondition: ***`sum`, `limit`, `n`, `i` are updated to reflect the next index; `k`, `A` is a list with at least 3 elements; `s` is less than `target`; `tup` is now the third element in A; `target` has been decreased by `tup[0]`; `selected` now includes `tup[1]` as an additional element, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `target` is less than or equal to 0.***
