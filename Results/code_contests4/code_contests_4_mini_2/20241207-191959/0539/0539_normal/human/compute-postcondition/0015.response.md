The value of `s` is incremented by `A[-1][0]`. Here, `A[-1]` refers to the last element of the list `A`, which is `(2, 2)`, so `A[-1][0]` is `2`. Therefore, `s` is increased by `2`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`sum` is an integer, `limit` is an integer, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `k` is 1, A contains (2, 2), `s` is incremented by 2.**
