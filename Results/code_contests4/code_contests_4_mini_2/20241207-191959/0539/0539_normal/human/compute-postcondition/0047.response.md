The `print` statement outputs the `selected` list as a space-separated string. The previous value of `selected` is retained, and its length was printed before. Since there is no modification to `selected` in this code snippet, it simply converts the elements of `selected` to strings and joins them with spaces. Therefore, the output state is the unchanged values of the variables along with the printed representation of `selected`.

Output State: **`sum`, `limit`, `n`, `i`, `k`, `A` is a list with at least `m` elements; `s` is less than `target`; `selected` contains the second elements of the tuples from `A`; `target` has been decreased by the sum of the first elements of the tuples from `A`; length of `selected` is printed; printed value is a space-separated string of elements in `selected`.**
