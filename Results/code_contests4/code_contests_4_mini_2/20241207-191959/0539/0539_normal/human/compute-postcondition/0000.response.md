`target` and `n` are assigned values based on the input from `raw_input()`, which is split into two parts and converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The values of `sum` and `limit` remain unchanged, and the specific input values for `target` and `n` are not known. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of the new variables. 

Output State: **`sum` and `limit` are integers such that 1 â‰¤ `sum`, `limit` â‰¤ 10^5; `target` and `n` are input integers**.
