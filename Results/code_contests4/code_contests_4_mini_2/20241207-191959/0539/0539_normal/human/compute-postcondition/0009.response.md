The code `s += A[-1][0]` accesses the last element of the list `A`, which is `(1, 1)`, and retrieves the first element of that tuple, which is `1`. The value of `s` is incremented by `1`. The other variables (`sum`, `limit`, `n`, `i`, `k`) remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `sum` is an integer, `limit` is an integer, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `k` is 0, and `s` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`sum` is an integer, `limit` is an integer, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `k` is 0, and `s` is increased by 1**
