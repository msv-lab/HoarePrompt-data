According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute while `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since `n` is at least 1, the loop has executed once. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 2. Additionally, `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`sum` is an integer, `limit` is an integer, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `k` is 0, and `s` is increased by 1**
