According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is at least 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 3. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 3.

State: **`sum` is an integer, `limit` is an integer, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `k` is 1, A contains (2, 2), `s` is incremented by 2**
