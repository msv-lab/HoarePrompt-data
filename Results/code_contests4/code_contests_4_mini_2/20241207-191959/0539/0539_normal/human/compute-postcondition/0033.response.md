Output State: **`sum`, `limit`, `n`, `i`, `k`, `A` is a list with at least 1 element; `s` is less than `target`; `tup` is the first element in A; `target` is decreased by `tup[0]` and `selected` now includes `tup[1]`; `target` is less than or equal to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
