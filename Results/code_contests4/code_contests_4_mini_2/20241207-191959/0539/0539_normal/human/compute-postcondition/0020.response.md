The code snippet `A.append((2 ** k, i))` appends a tuple to the list `A`. The elements of the tuple are calculated as follows: 

- `2 ** k` where `k` is 1, so `2 ** 1 = 2`. 
- The value of `i` is 3.

Thus, the tuple `(2, 3)` will be appended to `A`. The original contents of `A` were `(2, 2)`, and after the operation, it will now contain `(2, 2)` and `(2, 3)`.

The values of the other variables (`sum`, `limit`, `n`, `i`, `k`, `s`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`sum` and `limit` are integers, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `k` is 1, `A` contains (2, 2) and (2, 3), and `s` is incremented by 2 if `i` is not equal to 1 and `k` is one less than `i`.**
