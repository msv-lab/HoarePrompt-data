To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze it against the problem description and see if it covers all the cases as specified.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads two integers `target` (sum) and `n` (limit).

2. **Calculating Lowbit**:
   - The program attempts to calculate the lowbit value for each integer from 1 to `n`. The lowbit of an integer `i` is computed as `(i & -i)`, which gives the lowest power of 2 that divides `i`.

3. **Sum Calculation**:
   - It sums the lowbit values for integers up to `n` and stores the corresponding indices in the list `A`.

4. **Checking Validity**:
   - If the total sum of the lowbit values is less than `target`, it outputs `-1`, indicating that it's impossible to find a suitable set.

5. **Selecting Elements**:
   - It sorts the list `A` and tries to select elements whose lowbit values sum up to the target, appending their indices to `selected`.

6. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the number of selected elements and their corresponding indices.

### Edge Cases and Potential Issues

1. **Limit on Selected Elements**:
   - The program does not handle cases where the selection might exceed the limit of distinct integers from 1 to `limit`. For example, if `target` and `limit` are such that it requires more distinct integers than allowed.

2. **Lowbit Calculation Logic**:
   - The logic for calculating `k` and the subsequent values might not correctly reflect the requirement for distinct integers if not handled properly. For instance, when `i` is a power of 2, the program could produce unexpected results.

3. **Example Case**:
   - Consider the input `sum = 1` and `limit = 1`. 
     - The expected output is `1` and the only element should be `1`.
     - However, the program might not handle this correctly because if it calculates the lowbit for `1`, it will consider the lowest bit, which is 1, resulting in a sum of `1` but may not select any element from `A`. 

4. **General Case**:
   - For `n = 1` and `target = 2`, the program should output `-1` since it's impossible to meet the sum requirement with distinct integers from 1 to 1 (only 1 is available).

Given the above considerations, we can conclude that the program does not consistently handle all potential cases effectively.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases, specifically when the inputs are such that the uniqueness of integers and their respective lowbit values are not handled properly. For example, it fails with inputs like `(1, 1)` or `(2, 1)`, where expected outputs do not match the program's logic.
