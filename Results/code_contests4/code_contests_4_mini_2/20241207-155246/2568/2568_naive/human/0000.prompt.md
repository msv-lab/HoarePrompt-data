You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Iahub has drawn a set of n points in the cartesian plane which he calls "special points". A quadrilateral is a simple polygon without self-intersections with four sides (also called edges) and four vertices (also called corners). Please note that a quadrilateral doesn't have to be convex. A special quadrilateral is one which has all four vertices in the set of special points. Given the set of special points, please calculate the maximal area of a special quadrilateral. 

Input

The first line contains integer n (4 ≤ n ≤ 300). Each of the next n lines contains two integers: xi, yi ( - 1000 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 1000) — the cartesian coordinates of ith special point. It is guaranteed that no three points are on the same line. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide. 

Output

Output a single real number — the maximal area of a special quadrilateral. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does't exceed 10 - 9.

Examples

Input

5
0 0
0 4
4 0
4 4
2 3


Output

16.000000

Note

In the test example we can choose first 4 points to be the vertices of the quadrilateral. They form a square by side 4, so the area is 4·4 = 16.
Program:
```
def func_1(x1, x2, x3, y1, y2, y3):
    area = x1 * (y2 - y3) + x2 * (y3 - y1) + x3 * (y1 - y2)
    return area / 2
n = int(sys.stdin.readline())
Points = []
for i in range(n):
    (x, y) = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    Points.append([x, y])
maxx = 0
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i + 1, n):
        x1 = Points[i][0]
        y1 = Points[i][1]
        x3 = Points[j][0]
        y3 = Points[j][1]
        maxx1 = 0
        maxx2 = 0
        for z in range(n):
            area = func_1(x1, y1, x3, y3, Points[z][0], Points[z][1])
            if area > 0:
                if area > maxx1:
                    maxx1 = area
            elif -area > maxx2:
                maxx2 = -area
        if maxx1 + maxx2 > maxx:
            maxx = maxx1 + maxx2
sys.stdout.write(str(maxx))
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
