To analyze the provided program for calculating the maximal area of a special quadrilateral, we need to carefully evaluate whether it meets the requirements set forth in the problem description.

**Key points from the problem:**
1. We need to find the maximal area of a quadrilateral formed by four points from a set of given points.
2. The area should be calculated correctly based on the coordinates provided.
3. The area formula used must account for the order of points to ensure a proper quadrilateral.

**Issues with the provided program:**
1. The `func_1` function is designed to calculate the area of a triangle given three points, but it is incorrectly applied to find the area of a quadrilateral. The function takes only three parameters but is being called in a way that suggests it needs to calculate the area involving four points.
2. The program does not iterate through all combinations of four points. It only considers pairs of points while trying to maximize the area, which is insufficient for calculating the area of a quadrilateral. 
3. The area calculation is not correctly capturing the properties needed to identify and maximize a quadrilateral's area, potentially leading to incorrect results.

**Example that exposes the flaw:**
Consider the input:
```
4
0 0
0 1
1 1
1 0
```
This set of points forms a square with an area of 1. However, the program does not correctly evaluate combinations of four points, as it is only looking at pairs and using a triangle area function, which will not yield the correct area for quadrilaterals.

Given this analysis, the program does not satisfy the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
