The function `func_1` accepts parameters `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, `y1`, `y2`, and `y3`. Each coordinate `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, `y1`, `y2`, `y3` is an integer within the range of -1000 to 1000, and it is guaranteed that no three points are collinear and no two points are coincident. The function calculates the area of a triangle formed by the points defined by these coordinates, using the formula \( \text{area} = x1 \cdot (y2 - y3) + x2 \cdot (y3 - y1) + x3 \cdot (y1 - y2) \) and then returns the area divided by 2. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept six integer parameters representing the coordinates of three points and return the area of the triangle formed by those points divided by 2.

Functionality: **The function accepts six integer parameters (x1, x2, x3, y1, y2, y3) representing the coordinates of three points and returns the area of the triangle formed by those points divided by 2.**
