The expression calculates the area of a triangle formed by three points with coordinates (x1, y1), (x2, y2), and (x3, y3). The variable `area` is assigned the value based on the coordinates provided. Since the exact values of (x1, y1), (x2, y2), and (x3, y3) are not specified, we cannot determine a specific numerical output for `area`. However, we can express the relationship based on the coordinates.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 300; `area` is calculated as x1 * (y2 - y3) + x2 * (y3 - y1) + x3 * (y1 - y2)**
