The function accepts six integer parameters (x1, x2, x3, y1, y2, y3) representing the coordinates of three points in a 2D space. It calculates and returns the signed area of the triangle formed by those points, divided by 2. The function assumes the points are valid as per the provided constraints, specifically that no three points are collinear and no two points are coincident.
