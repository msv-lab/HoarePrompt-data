Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it only calculates the area of a triangle formed by three points (x1, y1), (x2, y2), and (x3, y3) using the formula for the area of a triangle. The problem description requires the calculation of the maximal area of a quadrilateral formed by four points from the set of special points. 

The program does not account for all combinations of four points or calculate the area of a quadrilateral. In order to solve the problem as described, the program would need to iterate over all combinations of four points, calculate the area for each combination of those four points, and then determine the maximum area found. The current implementation does not fulfill this requirement.

In summary, the program is only capable of calculating the area of a triangle and does not address the requirement to find the maximal area of a special quadrilateral formed by four points, thus it does not meet the problem description.
