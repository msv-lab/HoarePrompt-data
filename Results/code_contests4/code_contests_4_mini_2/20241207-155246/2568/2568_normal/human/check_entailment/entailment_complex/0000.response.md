The annotated program contains a function `func_1` that calculates the signed area of a triangle formed by three points in a 2D space. However, the problem description requires the program to calculate the maximal area of a quadrilateral formed by four special points.

Here are the reasons why the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description:

1. **Triangle Calculation**: The function `func_1` only computes the area of a triangle, not a quadrilateral. The problem specifically asks for the maximal area of a quadrilateral, which involves four points.

2. **Lack of Quadrilateral Handling**: The annotated program lacks any logic to handle combinations of four points from the given set of special points. To determine the maximal area of a quadrilateral, the program would need to evaluate all combinations of four points and compute the area for each.

3. **Incorrect Input Parameters**: The function signature `func_1(x1, x2, x3, y1, y2, y3)` suggests that it takes three x-coordinates and three y-coordinates, which is not appropriate for quadrilateral area calculation, as a quadrilateral requires four points.

In conclusion, the program does not fulfill the requirements set out in the problem description. It focuses solely on triangle area calculation and does not address the need to compute the maximal area of any quadrilateral formed by four points.

Correctness: **False**
