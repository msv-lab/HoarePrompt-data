To determine the correctness of the given Python program, I will analyze the code in relation to the problem description and the output hints.

### Problem Description Analysis
The problem requires calculating the maximal area of a quadrilateral formed by four special points in a Cartesian plane. The constraints guarantee that no three points are collinear and no two points coincide. This means that any four points can form a quadrilateral, and we need to maximize the area.

### Code Analysis
The code defines a function `func_1` that computes the signed area of a triangle formed by three points using the formula:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times |x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2)| \]
The main loop iterates through pairs of points to serve as two vertices of the quadrilateral and calculates the area contributions from the remaining points to form triangles with the selected pair.

1. **Area Calculation:** The area is calculated in a way that considers two triangles formed by the chosen pair of points and the remaining points. The accumulation of these areas aims to find the maximum possible area of a quadrilateral.
2. **Iteration Logic:** The double loop appropriately selects pairs of points, and the inner loop checks the contribution of each remaining point.

### Edge Cases
1. **All Points Forming a Convex Shape:** The logic should correctly identify the maximum area, which would be the area of the convex hull formed by the points.
2. **Non-Convex Shapes:** The code needs to ensure that even if points are non-convex, it still calculates the area correctly.
3. **No Three Points Collinear:** Since the problem guarantees that no three points are collinear, the area calculation should always produce valid areas.

### Output Hints Analysis
The output hints describe the parameters to the `func_1` function and confirm the area calculation method. However, they do not highlight any potential issues with the main algorithm itself. 

### Conclusion
Upon reviewing both the code and the problem description, it appears that the code indeed calculates the maximum area of a special quadrilateral correctly by iterating over pairs of points and using the remaining points to form valid triangles. 

The method of calculating the area is sound, and given the constraints, it should work for all valid inputs defined by the problem description. There are no apparent edge cases that are mishandled, nor does the output hint provide any information that suggests the code is incorrect. 

Therefore, the program correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **True**.
