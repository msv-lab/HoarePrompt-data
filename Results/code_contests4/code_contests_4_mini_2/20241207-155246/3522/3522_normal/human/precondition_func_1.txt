p is an integer representing the number of queries, value is a list of strings where the first element is a string S of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, followed by Q queries that can either change a character in S or request the number of distinct characters in a substring of S. N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 500000, and Q is an integer such that 1 <= Q <= 20000. Each query is either of type 1 (character change) or type 2 (count distinct characters) with indices i_q, l_q, and r_q being positive integers satisfying 1 <= i_q, l_q <= r_q <= N.
