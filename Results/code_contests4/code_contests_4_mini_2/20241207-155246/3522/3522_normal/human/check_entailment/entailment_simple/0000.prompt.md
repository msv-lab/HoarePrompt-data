You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given a string S of length N consisting of lowercase English letters.

Process Q queries of the following two types:

* Type 1: change the i_q-th character of S to c_q. (Do nothing if the i_q-th character is already c_q.)
* Type 2: answer the number of different characters occurring in the substring of S between the l_q-th and r_q-th characters (inclusive).

Constraints

* N, Q, i_q, l_q, and r_q are integers.
* S is a string consisting of lowercase English letters.
* c_q is a lowercase English letter.
* 1 \leq N \leq 500000
* 1 \leq Q \leq 20000
* |S| = N
* 1 \leq i_q \leq N
* 1 \leq l_q \leq r_q \leq N
* There is at least one query of type 2 in each testcase.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
S
Q
Query_1
\vdots
Query_Q


Here, Query_i in the 4-th through (Q+3)-th lines is one of the following:


1 i_q c_q



2 l_q r_q


Output

For each query of type 2, print a line containing the answer.

Example

Input

7
abcdbbd
6
2 3 6
1 5 z
2 1 1
1 4 a
1 7 d
2 1 7


Output

3

5
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list containing a string S of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, followed by an integer Q representing the number of queries, and Q subsequent queries where each query is either of type 1 or type 2 as described, with i_q, l_q, and r_q being integers in the specified ranges.
def func_1(arr):
    for i in range(n):
        tree[ddd][n + i] = arr[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list containing a string S of length N; `i` is N-1; `tree[ddd][n + i]` is assigned the value of `arr[N-1]` for the last iteration. The tree structure has been populated with the contents of `arr` starting from index `n` to `n + N - 1`.
    for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
        tree[ddd][i] = tree[ddd][i << 1] + tree[ddd][i << 1 | 1]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list containing a string S of length N; `tree[ddd][i]` is assigned the value of `tree[ddd][i << 1] + tree[ddd][i << 1 | 1] for all indices from 1 to n-1; `i` is 0 after the loop finishes.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: p is an integer representing the number of queries, value is a list of strings where the first element is a string S of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, followed by Q queries that can either change a character in S or request the number of distinct characters in a substring of S. N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 500000, and Q is an integer such that 1 <= Q <= 20000. Each query is either of type 1 (character change) or type 2 (count distinct characters) with indices i_q, l_q, and r_q being positive integers satisfying 1 <= i_q, l_q <= r_q <= N.
def func_2(p, value):
    p += n
    tree[ddd][p] = value
    i = p
    while i > 1:
        tree[ddd][i >> 1] = tree[ddd][i] + tree[ddd][i ^ 1]
        
        i >>= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `i` is 1, `tree[ddd][1]` contains the sum of `tree[ddd][2]` and `tree[ddd][3]`, `tree[ddd][0]` contains the sum of `tree[ddd][1]` and `tree[ddd][1]`, and so on for all iterations until `i` becomes 1.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: S is a string of lowercase English letters with length N (1 ≤ N ≤ 500000), l and r are integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ N.
def func_3(l, r):
    res = 0
    l += n
    r += n
    while l < r:
        if l & 1:
            res += tree[ddd][l]
            l += 1
        
        if r & 1:
            r -= 1
            res += tree[ddd][r]
        
        l >>= 1
        
        r >>= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `l` is equal to 0, `r` is equal to 0, `res` is the sum of values from `tree[ddd]` at indices corresponding to the original values of `l` and `r` during the iterations where `l` was odd or `r` was odd, and `S` remains a string of lowercase English letters with length `N`.
    return res
    #The program returns the sum of values from `tree[ddd]` at indices corresponding to the original values of `l` and `r` during the iterations where `l` was odd or `r` was odd.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
