You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a string S of length N consisting of lowercase English letters.

Process Q queries of the following two types:

* Type 1: change the i_q-th character of S to c_q. (Do nothing if the i_q-th character is already c_q.)
* Type 2: answer the number of different characters occurring in the substring of S between the l_q-th and r_q-th characters (inclusive).

Constraints

* N, Q, i_q, l_q, and r_q are integers.
* S is a string consisting of lowercase English letters.
* c_q is a lowercase English letter.
* 1 \leq N \leq 500000
* 1 \leq Q \leq 20000
* |S| = N
* 1 \leq i_q \leq N
* 1 \leq l_q \leq r_q \leq N
* There is at least one query of type 2 in each testcase.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
S
Q
Query_1
\vdots
Query_Q


Here, Query_i in the 4-th through (Q+3)-th lines is one of the following:


1 i_q c_q



2 l_q r_q


Output

For each query of type 2, print a line containing the answer.

Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list containing a string S of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, followed by an integer Q representing the number of queries, and Q subsequent queries where each query is either of type 1 or type 2 as described, with i_q, l_q, and r_q being integers in the specified ranges.
def func_1(arr):
    for i in range(n):
        tree[ddd][n + i] = arr[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list containing a string S of length N; `i` is N-1; `tree[ddd][n + i]` is assigned the value of `arr[N-1]` for the last iteration. The tree structure has been populated with the contents of `arr` starting from index `n` to `n + N - 1`.
    for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
        tree[ddd][i] = tree[ddd][i << 1] + tree[ddd][i << 1 | 1]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list containing a string S of length N; `tree[ddd][i]` is assigned the value of `tree[ddd][i << 1] + tree[ddd][i << 1 | 1] for all indices from 1 to n-1; `i` is 0 after the loop finishes.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `arr` containing a string of lowercase English letters followed by an integer `Q`, which presumably indicates the number of queries. However, the function does not appear to process these queries; it only builds a segment tree from the string characters. The first loop populates a segment tree, and the second loop constructs the internal nodes of that tree, but the actual query handling is missing from the implementation. Therefore, the function ultimately prepares a data structure for query processing but does not perform any query operations.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: p is an integer representing the number of queries, value is a list of strings where the first element is a string S of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, followed by Q queries that can either change a character in S or request the number of distinct characters in a substring of S. N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 500000, and Q is an integer such that 1 <= Q <= 20000. Each query is either of type 1 (character change) or type 2 (count distinct characters) with indices i_q, l_q, and r_q being positive integers satisfying 1 <= i_q, l_q <= r_q <= N.
def func_2(p, value):
    p += n
    tree[ddd][p] = value
    i = p
    while i > 1:
        tree[ddd][i >> 1] = tree[ddd][i] + tree[ddd][i ^ 1]
        
        i >>= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `i` is 1, `tree[ddd][1]` contains the sum of `tree[ddd][2]` and `tree[ddd][3]`, `tree[ddd][0]` contains the sum of `tree[ddd][1]` and `tree[ddd][1]`, and so on for all iterations until `i` becomes 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `p` representing the number of queries and a list of strings `value`, where the first element is a string `S` followed by `Q` queries. It processes the queries to either change a character in `S` or perform a calculation that appears to involve a segment tree operation for counting distinct characters in a substring of `S`. However, it does not directly implement the character change or distinct character counting functionalities as described in the annotations. Instead, the function primarily updates a segment tree structure, which is incomplete without the actual handling of queries as stated. Therefore, the complete handling of the queries is missing.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: S is a string of lowercase English letters with length N (1 ≤ N ≤ 500000), l and r are integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ N.
def func_3(l, r):
    res = 0
    l += n
    r += n
    while l < r:
        if l & 1:
            res += tree[ddd][l]
            l += 1
        
        if r & 1:
            r -= 1
            res += tree[ddd][r]
        
        l >>= 1
        
        r >>= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `l` is equal to 0, `r` is equal to 0, `res` is the sum of values from `tree[ddd]` at indices corresponding to the original values of `l` and `r` during the iterations where `l` was odd or `r` was odd, and `S` remains a string of lowercase English letters with length `N`.
    return res
    #The program returns the sum of values from `tree[ddd]` at indices corresponding to the original values of `l` and `r` during the iterations where `l` was odd or `r` was odd.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters `l` and `r` and returns the sum of values from the `tree[ddd]` array at indices corresponding to the original values of `l` and `r` during the iterations where `l` or `r` are odd. It assumes that `l` and `r` are adjusted based on the value of `n`, which is not provided in the function, and sums values from `tree[ddd]` for both odd `l` and odd `r`, effectively covering a range defined by the original parameters. Edge cases include the potential for accessing out-of-bounds indices in `tree[ddd]` if `l` and `r` are not properly constrained.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
