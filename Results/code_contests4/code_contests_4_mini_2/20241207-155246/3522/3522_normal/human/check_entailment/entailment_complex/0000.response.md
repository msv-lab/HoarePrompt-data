Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly implement the requirements stated in the problem description. Specifically, the main issues are as follows:

1. **Query Handling**: The code does not handle the queries as described. The problem states that there are two types of queries: 
   - Type 1: Change a character in the string.
   - Type 2: Count the number of distinct characters in a specified substring.
   
   However, the annotations indicate that the functions focus on building a segment tree but do not implement the logic to process these queries. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` do not contain any logic for executing the queries as specified, particularly for counting distinct characters.

2. **Distinct Count Logic**: The logic to count distinct characters in a substring is missing entirely. The `func_3` function returns a sum of values from the segment tree, which does not align with the requirement to count distinct characters. This would lead to incorrect results when handling Type 2 queries.

3. **Edge Cases**: The annotations hint at potential edge cases such as accessing out-of-bounds indices in the `tree` array, which suggests that the implementation may not handle all scenarios correctly.

Since the program does not implement the required functionalities for processing the queries as described, there exist cases (specifically, any Type 2 query) where the output would be incorrect. Therefore, the conclusion is that the program is not correct.
