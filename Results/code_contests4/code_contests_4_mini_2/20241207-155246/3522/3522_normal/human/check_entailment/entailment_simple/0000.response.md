Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality as described in the problem statement. 

Here are the specific issues:

1. **Handling of Queries**: The program structure seems to imply that it uses a segment tree to manage the string and process the queries. However, the logic shown in `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` does not explicitly handle character updates or the calculation of distinct characters in a substring, which are critical requirements of the problem.

2. **Type 1 Queries**: For type 1 queries (modifying a character in the string), the program does not show any mechanism to update the string or the segment tree appropriately. The logic does not demonstrate how to change the character at position `i_q` to `c_q`.

3. **Type 2 Queries**: For type 2 queries (counting distinct characters in a substring), the program does not provide a method to count distinct characters in the specified range. The segment tree logic appears to be summing values rather than counting unique characters.

4. **Data Structure Initialization**: The variable `tree` is referenced without any prior initialization or clear definition in the provided code, which could lead to runtime errors or undefined behavior.

5. **Function Return Values**: The program has a return statement in `func_3`, but it's unclear how this function's output interacts with the overall query processing. There is no explicit output mechanism for type 2 queries, which should return the count of distinct characters.

In summary, the program does not implement the required functionality for both types of queries as specified in the problem description, leading to a conclusion that it is incorrect.
