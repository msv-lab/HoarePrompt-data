To assess the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and the output hints, let's analyze the code step by step.

### Problem Description:
The task is to process two types of queries on a string:
1. Change a specific character in the string.
2. Count the number of different characters in a specified substring.

### Functions:
1. **func_1**: Constructs a segment tree from the input string's characters but does not process any queries.
2. **func_2**: Appears to update the segment tree when a character is changed but does not implement the full functionality of changing the character in the string or counting distinct characters.
3. **func_3**: Aims to count the distinct characters in a substring using the segment tree but does not directly relate to the requirements of counting distinct characters since it returns the sum of the tree values over a range rather than the number of distinct characters.

### Output Hints:
- **Output for func_1**: It states that the function prepares a segment tree but does not handle the queries. This aligns with the analysis of the code.
- **Output for func_2**: Indicates that the function does not directly implement character change or distinct character counting functionalities, which is also confirmed by the code.
- **Output for func_3**: It mentions summing values based on the segment tree but does not clarify how distinct characters are counted, which is a crucial part of the problem.

### Initial Assessment:
The functions do not fully implement the required functionalities to handle both types of queries as described in the problem statement. Specifically:
- **func_1** prepares the segment tree but does not execute any query.
- **func_2** updates the segment tree for character changes but lacks the direct implementation of query processing.
- **func_3** attempts to count characters but does not provide a method to determine distinct characters correctly.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Changing to the same character**: The implementation should not perform an unnecessary update when the new character is the same as the current one, which is mentioned in the problem description but not effectively handled in the code.
2. **Count distinct characters in a single character substring**: The implementation should return 1 for a substring of length 1, but it may not handle this correctly based on the current logic in **func_3**.
3. **Out-of-bounds access**: If `l` or `r` are outside the expected range, it could lead to accessing invalid indices in the segment tree.

### Conclusion:
The output hints do not provide sufficient support for the functions to be seen as fulfilling the requirements of the problem description. The program fails to implement the necessary logic for both types of queries, especially in counting distinct characters correctly. Since the functions do not follow the problem description for every potential case, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**.

A specific case where the program does not work correctly is when querying the distinct character count for a substring of length 1, which should return 1, but the current implementation may not handle this case effectively due to its reliance on the segment tree without proper distinct counting logic.
