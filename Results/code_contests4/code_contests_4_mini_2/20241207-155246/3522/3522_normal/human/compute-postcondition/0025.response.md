The value of `l` is incremented by 1, which is necessary for the loop to continue executing as `l` must remain less than `r` for the loop to execute again. The values of `S`, `N`, and `res` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a string of lowercase English letters with length `N`; `res` is updated by adding `tree[ddd][l]`; `l` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`S` is a string of lowercase English letters with length `N`; `res` is updated by adding `tree[ddd][l]`; `l` is increased by 1.**
