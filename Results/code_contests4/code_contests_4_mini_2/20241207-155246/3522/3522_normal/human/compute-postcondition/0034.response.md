The function `func_3` accepts parameters `l` and `r`, both of which are integers. `l` and `r` must satisfy the conditions 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ N, where N is the length of the string `S`, which consists of lowercase English letters. After executing the function body, it returns the sum of values from `tree[ddd]` at indices corresponding to the original values of `l` and `r` during the iterations where either `l` or `r` was odd. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept two integers, `l` and `r`, and return the sum of specific values based on the conditions of `l` and `r` being odd. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `l` and `r`, and returns the sum of values from `tree[ddd]` at indices corresponding to `l` and `r` during iterations where `l` or `r` is odd.**
