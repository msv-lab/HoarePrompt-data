The value of `l` is incremented by 1. Since `l` is previously stated to be an odd integer, incrementing it by 1 will make `l` an even integer. The values of the other variables (`S`, `N`, `r`, `res`, and `tree`) do not change. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a string of lowercase English letters with length `N`; `l` is now an even integer; `r` is `r + n`; `l` is less than `r`; `res` is increased by the value of `tree[ddd][l]`.

Output State: **`S` is a string of lowercase English letters with length `N`; `l` is now an even integer; `r` is `r + n`; `l` is less than `r`; `res` is increased by the value of `tree[ddd][l]**.
