The value of `l` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `l` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `l`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a string of lowercase English letters with length `N`; `res` is incremented by `tree[ddd][l]`; `l` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`S` is a string of lowercase English letters with length `N`; `res` is incremented by `tree[ddd][l]`; `l` is increased by 1.**
