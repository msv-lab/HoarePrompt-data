Postcondition: ***`S` is a string of lowercase English letters with length `N`. If `r` is odd, it is decreased by 1, and `res` is updated by adding the value of `tree[ddd][r]` to it, while ensuring that `l` remains less than the new value of `r`. If `r` is even, no changes are made to `r` or `res`.***
