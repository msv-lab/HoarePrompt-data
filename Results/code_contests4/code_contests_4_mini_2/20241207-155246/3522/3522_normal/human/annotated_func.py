#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list containing a string S of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, followed by an integer Q representing the number of queries, and Q subsequent queries where each query is either of type 1 or type 2 as described, with i_q, l_q, and r_q being integers in the specified ranges.
def func_1(arr):
    for i in range(n):
        tree[ddd][n + i] = arr[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list containing a string S of length N; `i` is N-1; `tree[ddd][n + i]` is assigned the value of `arr[N-1]` for the last iteration. The tree structure has been populated with the contents of `arr` starting from index `n` to `n + N - 1`.
    for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
        tree[ddd][i] = tree[ddd][i << 1] + tree[ddd][i << 1 | 1]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list containing a string S of length N; `tree[ddd][i]` is assigned the value of `tree[ddd][i << 1] + tree[ddd][i << 1 | 1] for all indices from 1 to n-1; `i` is 0 after the loop finishes.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `arr` containing a string of lowercase English letters followed by an integer `Q`, which presumably indicates the number of queries. However, the function does not appear to process these queries; it only builds a segment tree from the string characters. The first loop populates a segment tree, and the second loop constructs the internal nodes of that tree, but the actual query handling is missing from the implementation. Therefore, the function ultimately prepares a data structure for query processing but does not perform any query operations.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: p is an integer representing the number of queries, value is a list of strings where the first element is a string S of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, followed by Q queries that can either change a character in S or request the number of distinct characters in a substring of S. N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 500000, and Q is an integer such that 1 <= Q <= 20000. Each query is either of type 1 (character change) or type 2 (count distinct characters) with indices i_q, l_q, and r_q being positive integers satisfying 1 <= i_q, l_q <= r_q <= N.
def func_2(p, value):
    p += n
    tree[ddd][p] = value
    i = p
    while i > 1:
        tree[ddd][i >> 1] = tree[ddd][i] + tree[ddd][i ^ 1]
        
        i >>= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `i` is 1, `tree[ddd][1]` contains the sum of `tree[ddd][2]` and `tree[ddd][3]`, `tree[ddd][0]` contains the sum of `tree[ddd][1]` and `tree[ddd][1]`, and so on for all iterations until `i` becomes 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `p` representing the number of queries and a list of strings `value`, where the first element is a string `S` followed by `Q` queries. It processes the queries to either change a character in `S` or perform a calculation that appears to involve a segment tree operation for counting distinct characters in a substring of `S`. However, it does not directly implement the character change or distinct character counting functionalities as described in the annotations. Instead, the function primarily updates a segment tree structure, which is incomplete without the actual handling of queries as stated. Therefore, the complete handling of the queries is missing.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: S is a string of lowercase English letters with length N (1 ≤ N ≤ 500000), l and r are integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ N.
def func_3(l, r):
    res = 0
    l += n
    r += n
    while l < r:
        if l & 1:
            res += tree[ddd][l]
            l += 1
        
        if r & 1:
            r -= 1
            res += tree[ddd][r]
        
        l >>= 1
        
        r >>= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `l` is equal to 0, `r` is equal to 0, `res` is the sum of values from `tree[ddd]` at indices corresponding to the original values of `l` and `r` during the iterations where `l` was odd or `r` was odd, and `S` remains a string of lowercase English letters with length `N`.
    return res
    #The program returns the sum of values from `tree[ddd]` at indices corresponding to the original values of `l` and `r` during the iterations where `l` was odd or `r` was odd.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters `l` and `r` and returns the sum of values from the `tree[ddd]` array at indices corresponding to the original values of `l` and `r` during the iterations where `l` or `r` are odd. It assumes that `l` and `r` are adjusted based on the value of `n`, which is not provided in the function, and sums values from `tree[ddd]` for both odd `l` and odd `r`, effectively covering a range defined by the original parameters. Edge cases include the potential for accessing out-of-bounds indices in `tree[ddd]` if `l` and `r` are not properly constrained.
