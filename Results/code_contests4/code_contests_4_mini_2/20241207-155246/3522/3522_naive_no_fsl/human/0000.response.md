Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains a critical flaw in how it processes the queries of Type 2, which count the number of different characters in a specified substring. 

### Potential Case Where the Program Fails:

1. **Issue with Type 2 Query**: 
   - The program uses a segment tree to query the number of different characters in a substring. However, the way it checks if a character is present in the range with `func_3(l, r + 1)` is incorrect. 
   - The `func_3` method is intended to return the count of a specific character in the range, but it is incorrectly used to check for any non-zero count across all characters without properly tracking distinct characters.
   - As a result, it will not give the correct count of unique characters. For example, if the substring has repeated characters, the count can be misleading.

2. **Example Input**:
   - Consider the initial string `S = "abc"`, and the query `2 1 3` which should return `3` (as there are three distinct characters: 'a', 'b', and 'c').
   - If you then perform a change query `1 2 d` (changing the second character to 'd'), the subsequent query `2 1 3` should return `3` again since 'a', 'd', and 'c' are distinct.
   - However, due to the flawed logic in checking distinct characters, the implementation may return an incorrect result.

### Conclusion:
Due to the inadequacy in counting distinct characters from the segment tree logic, the program does not fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description for all potential cases. Thus, the correctness of the program is determined to be **False**.
