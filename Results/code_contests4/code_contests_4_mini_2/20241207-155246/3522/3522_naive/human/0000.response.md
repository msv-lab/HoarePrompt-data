To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to break down the requirements and analyze the code.

### Problem Description:

1. **Type 1 Query**: Change the `i_q-th` character of `S` to `c_q`.
   - If the character at index `i_q` is already `c_q`, it should do nothing.
   
2. **Type 2 Query**: Count the number of different characters occurring in the substring from `l_q` to `r_q` (inclusive).

### Code Analysis:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the string and processes a set of queries.

2. **Data Structures**:
   - A segment tree (array `tree`) is created to maintain counts of characters.
   - The `arrs` 2D array keeps track of character occurrences across the string.

3. **Operations**:
   - `func_1` initializes the segment tree for a given character.
   - `func_2` updates the segment tree when a character is changed.
   - `func_3` retrieves the count of characters in a specified range.

4. **Query Processing**:
   - For Type 1 queries, the code correctly identifies if a change is necessary and updates the segment tree.
   - For Type 2 queries, the code counts distinct characters by iterating through the alphabet and checking the segment tree.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Segment Tree Initialization**:
   - The `func_1` and `func_2` functions are meant to initialize and update the segment tree, but the logic for updating the tree might not correctly account for character changes as it operates on counts rather than distinct character tracking directly.

2. **Distinct Count Logic**:
   - In the Type 2 query, it checks the counts for each character using `func_3(l, r + 1)`. However, the check `if func_3(l, r + 1) != 0` is made for each character, which doesn't guarantee that it accounts for distinct characters properly. This could lead to inaccurate results in scenarios where multiple characters have the same count.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not seem to handle cases where the string consists of repetitive characters effectively. For example, in a situation where `S = "aaaaaa"` and a Type 2 query requests the distinct characters between two indices, the expected output should be `1`, but the implementation may miscount.

### Example of Failure:
Consider the input:
```
6
aaaaaa
1
2 1 6
```
The expected output is `1` since there is only one distinct character ('a'). However, due to the implementation logic, it is likely to return an incorrect count if the segment tree does not correctly track the distinct counts.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, particularly in counting distinct characters and handling updates to the segment tree, the implementation does not fully satisfy the problem requirements. Therefore, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
