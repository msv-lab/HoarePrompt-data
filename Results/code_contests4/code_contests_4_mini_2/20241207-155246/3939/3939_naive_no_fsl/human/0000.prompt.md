You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a tetrahedron. Let's mark its vertices with letters A, B, C and D correspondingly.

<image>

An ant is standing in the vertex D of the tetrahedron. The ant is quite active and he wouldn't stay idle. At each moment of time he makes a step from one vertex to another one along some edge of the tetrahedron. The ant just can't stand on one place.

You do not have to do much to solve the problem: your task is to count the number of ways in which the ant can go from the initial vertex D to itself in exactly n steps. In other words, you are asked to find out the number of different cyclic paths with the length of n from vertex D to itself. As the number can be quite large, you should print it modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7). 

Input

The first line contains the only integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 107) — the required length of the cyclic path.

Output

Print the only integer — the required number of ways modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).

Note

The required paths in the first sample are: 

  * D - A - D
  * D - B - D
  * D - C - D
Program:
```
n = input()
memo = (0, 3)
MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
for i in range(n - 2):
    (x, y) = memo
    value = 2 * y + 3 * x
    memo = (y, value % MOD)
if n > 2:
    print(memo[1])
else:
    print(0 if n == 1 else 3)
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
