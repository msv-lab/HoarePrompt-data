To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze whether the program accurately counts the number of ways for the ant to return to vertex D in exactly `n` steps.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `n` from input, which represents the number of steps.
   - It correctly handles the case where `n` is between `1` and `10^7`.

2. **Base Cases**:
   - According to the problem description:
     - For `n = 1`, the output should be `0` (the ant cannot return to D).
     - For `n = 2`, the output should be `3` (the ant can return via three paths: D-A-D, D-B-D, D-C-D).
   - The program correctly handles these base cases with the following logic:
     - If `n == 1`, it prints `0`.
     - If `n == 2`, it prints `3`.

3. **Dynamic Programming Calculation**:
   - For `n > 2`, the program utilizes a dynamic programming approach:
     - It initializes `memo` with `(0, 3)`, which accurately reflects the paths for `n = 2`.
     - The loop iterates `n - 2` times to compute the number of paths for higher values of `n`.
     - The transition formula `value = 2 * y + 3 * x` correctly computes the number of paths to return to vertex D based on paths from other vertices (A, B, C) and the current vertex D.

4. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The program applies the modulo operation (`% MOD`) to handle large numbers, ensuring that results stay within the bounds specified in the problem.

5. **Final Output**:
   - After completing the loop, if `n > 2`, it prints `memo[1]`, which contains the number of valid paths returning to D after `n` steps.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem as described. It accurately handles base cases, computes the number of cyclic paths using a dynamic approach, and outputs the result modulo `1000000007`. 

Thus, the program meets all the requirements stated in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
