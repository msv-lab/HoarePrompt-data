`value` is assigned the result of the calculation `2 * y + 3 * x`. Given that `y` is 21 and `x` is 6, we can compute it as follows: 

```
value = 2 * 21 + 3 * 6
value = 42 + 18
value = 60
```

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be a string that converts to an integer greater than or equal to 5, `memo` is (6, 21), `MOD` is 1000000007, `i` is 2, `x` is 6, `y` is 21, `value` is 60.

Output State: **`n` must be a string that converts to an integer greater than or equal to 5, `memo` is (6, 21), `MOD` is 1000000007, `i` is 2, `x` is 6, `y` is 21, `value` is 60**.
