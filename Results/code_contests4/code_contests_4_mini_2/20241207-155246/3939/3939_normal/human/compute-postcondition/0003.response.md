According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `n`. Specifically, for the `range(n - 2)` to yield at least one iteration, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3. Since `n` is currently a string, it should be converted to an integer that meets this condition. Additionally, the variable `i` needs to be initialized at the start of the loop, which will be 0 for the first execution. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be converted to an integer that is at least 3, and `i` should be initialized to 0.

State: **`n` is a string that must be converted to an integer greater than or equal to 3, `memo` is (0, 3), `MOD` is 1000000007, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is at least 3**
