The value of `n` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts a user input as a string. The initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer, but this code will overwrite `n` with the string representation of the input. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` is now a string rather than a positive integer.

Output State: **`n` is a string**
