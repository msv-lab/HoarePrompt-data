`x` is assigned the value of the first element in `memo`, which is 0, and `y` is assigned the value of the second element in `memo`, which is 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string that must be converted to an integer greater than or equal to 3, `memo` is (0, 3), `MOD` is 1000000007, `i` is 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is a string that must be converted to an integer greater than or equal to 3, `memo` is (0, 3), `MOD` is 1000000007, `i` is 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 3**
