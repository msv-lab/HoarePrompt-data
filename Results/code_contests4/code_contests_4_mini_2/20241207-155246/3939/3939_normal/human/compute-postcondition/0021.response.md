The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates based on the defined constraints where `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^7. However, since there are no input parameters explicitly given to the function, we can conclude the following:

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates based on the internal logic, but it is constrained by the value of n being a positive integer within the specified range.**
