Postcondition: ***`n` is a string that must be converted to an integer greater than or equal to 3. If `n` is greater than 2, `memo[1]` is printed. Otherwise, if `n` is greater than 1, the result of the print statement is 3, while `memo` remains the final computed tuple after (n - 2) iterations, `MOD` is 1000000007, `i` is (n - 3), `x` is the second last value from memo, `y` is the last value from memo, and `value` is the last computed value.***
