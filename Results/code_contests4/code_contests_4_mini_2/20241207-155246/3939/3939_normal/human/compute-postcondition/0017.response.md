The code `print(memo[1])` outputs the second element of the tuple `memo`. Since `memo` is defined as the final computed tuple after (n - 2) iterations, we assume it has at least two elements (which it must have, given that `n` is greater than or equal to 3).

The value of `memo[1]` is directly printed, while other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `memo` is the final computed tuple after (n - 2) iterations, and `memo[1]` is printed.

Output State: **`memo` is the final computed tuple after (n - 2) iterations, and `memo[1]` is printed.**
