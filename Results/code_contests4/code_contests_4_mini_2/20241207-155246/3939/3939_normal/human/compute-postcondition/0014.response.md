`memo` is assigned the value of `y`, which is 21. Then, `value % MOD` is calculated, where `value` is 60 and `MOD` is 1000000007. The result of `60 % 1000000007` is 60, so `memo` will also take this value. The previous value of `memo` is overwritten, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be a string that converts to an integer greater than or equal to 5, `memo` is 60, `MOD` is 1000000007, `i` is 2, `x` is 6, `y` is 21, `value` is 60.

Output State: **`n` must be a string that converts to an integer greater than or equal to 5, `memo` is 60, `MOD` is 1000000007, `i` is 2, `x` is 6, `y` is 21, `value` is 60**
