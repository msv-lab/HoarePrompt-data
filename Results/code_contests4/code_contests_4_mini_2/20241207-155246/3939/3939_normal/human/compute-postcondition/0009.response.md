The variable `value` is assigned the result of the expression `2 * y + 3 * x`. Given that `y` is 6 and `x` is 3, we can calculate:

- `2 * y` = 2 * 6 = 12
- `3 * x` = 3 * 3 = 9
- Therefore, `value` = 12 + 9 = 21

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the Output State is: `n` is a string that must be converted to an integer greater than or equal to 3; `memo` is (3, 6); `MOD` is 1000000007; `i` is 1; `x` is 3; `y` is 6; `value` is 21.
