Functionality: ** The function reads a positive integer `n` from input, computes a sequence based on `n` using a memoization technique, and prints the result based on the value of `n`. If `n` is 1, it prints 0; if `n` is 2, it prints 3; for `n` greater than 2, it prints the second element of the final computed tuple `memo` after `n - 2` iterations of the sequence calculation. The function does not accept any parameters and is constrained by the input value being a positive integer. **
