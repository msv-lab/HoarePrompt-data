`memo` is assigned the value of `y`, which is 6. The second part of the assignment, `value % MOD`, computes the remainder of `value` (21) when divided by `MOD` (1000000007). Since 21 is less than 1000000007, `value % MOD` is simply 21. Therefore, after execution, `memo` will be assigned the tuple (6, 21). The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a string that must be converted to an integer greater than or equal to 3; `memo` is (6, 21); `MOD` is 1000000007; `i` is 1; `x` is 3; `y` is 6; `value` is 21**
