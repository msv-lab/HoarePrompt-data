Postcondition: ***`stack` contains `i`, where `i` is greater than the last element that was in `stack` before it became empty. If the length of `stack` is greater than 1, `ans` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the XOR of the last two elements in `stack`. If the length of `stack` is 1 or less, no changes are made to `ans`.***
