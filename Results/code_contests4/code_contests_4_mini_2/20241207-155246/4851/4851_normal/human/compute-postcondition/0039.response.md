The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `a`. `a` is a list of distinct positive integers, with a length `n` such that 1 < n ≤ 10^5, and each integer in the list satisfies 1 ≤ si ≤ 10^9. After executing the function body, if the length of the list `a` is less than 2, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the maximum XOR of the last two elements in the non-decreasing order stack formed from the list. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of distinct positive integers and return the maximum XOR of the last two elements of the list if it contains at least two elements; otherwise, it returns 0. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of distinct positive integers and returns the maximum XOR of the last two elements if the list has at least two elements; otherwise, it returns 0.**
