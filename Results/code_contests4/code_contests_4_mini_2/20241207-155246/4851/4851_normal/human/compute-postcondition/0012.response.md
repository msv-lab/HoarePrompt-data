Postcondition: ***`stack` contains the first element of `a`, `i` remains the first element of `a`, and `stack` is updated to include `i`. If the length of `stack` is greater than 1, `ans` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the last two elements of `stack`.***
