The code `stack.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the `stack`. Since `i` remains unchanged and the `stack` already contains elements that are greater than or equal to `i`, the new state of the `stack` will include the value of `i`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`stack` now contains the elements from the original state of `stack` that are greater than or equal to `i`, plus the value of `i`; `i` remains unchanged.**
