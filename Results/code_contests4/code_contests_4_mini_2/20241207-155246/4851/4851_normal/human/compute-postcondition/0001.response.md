According to the code, the loop will execute for each element in the list `a`. For the loop to be executed at least once, the list `a` must contain at least one distinct positive integer. The variable `i` will represent the current element in the list during each iteration. Since `n` is given as being greater than 1 and up to 100,000, it does not directly affect the execution of the loop but indicates the size of the input that could be relevant when analyzing the contents of `a`.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `a` must be a list containing at least 1 distinct positive integer.
- `i` is initialized to the first element of the list `a`.

State: **`a` is a list of distinct positive integers with at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `a`**
