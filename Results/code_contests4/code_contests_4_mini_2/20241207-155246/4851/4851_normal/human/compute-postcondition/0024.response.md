Postcondition: ***`stack` contains elements greater than or equal to `i`, and if the length of `stack` is greater than 1, `ans` is updated to the maximum of `ans` and the bitwise XOR of the last two elements in `stack`. If the length of `stack` is 1 or less, `ans` remains unchanged and `i` remains unchanged.***
