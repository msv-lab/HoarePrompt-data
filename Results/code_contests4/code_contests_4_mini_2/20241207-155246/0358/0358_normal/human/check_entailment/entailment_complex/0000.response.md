The provided program aims to process a log of warning messages and determine the first moment when the number of warnings in the last `n` seconds is at least `m`. Let's analyze the program step by step to verify its correctness against the problem description.

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads the first line for `n` and `m`, which are integers within the specified range.
   - It then reads the subsequent lines as log entries, which are guaranteed to be in the correct format.

2. **Log Entry Parsing**:
   - The program extracts the date and time from each log entry correctly.
   - It converts these into `datetime` objects for easy time comparison.

3. **Logic for Counting Warnings**:
   - The program iterates through each log entry and checks the timestamps of log entries within the last `n` seconds by maintaining a `last` index.
   - It calculates the time difference using `total_seconds()` and checks if the difference is greater than or equal to `n`.

4. **Condition Check**:
   - If the count of log entries within the last `n` seconds (determined by `len(logtime) - last`) is greater than or equal to `m`, it prints the timestamp of the current log entry.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the timestamp of the first log entry that meets the criteria or `-1` if no such entry exists.

### Evaluation:
- The program adheres to the requirements of the problem description. It correctly parses the log format, maintains a chronological order, and accurately computes the number of warnings within the specified time frame.
- It also correctly handles edge cases, such as when there are insufficient log entries to meet the required count `m`.

### Conclusion:
The program meets all conditions outlined in the problem description and handles the specified input correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is established.

Correctness: **True**
