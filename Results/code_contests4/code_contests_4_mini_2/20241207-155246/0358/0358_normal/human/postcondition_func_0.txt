The function processes a log stream of formatted strings, extracting timestamps and calculating the time difference between log entries. It checks if there are at least `m` log entries within a specified time delta `n` from the current entry. If this condition is met, it prints the timestamp of the current log entry. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return a value. It only prints output based on the conditions met during processing. If no valid logs meet the conditions, there may be no output. Additionally, it is important to note that if there are fewer than `m` entries in total, the condition will not be satisfied, and nothing will be printed.
