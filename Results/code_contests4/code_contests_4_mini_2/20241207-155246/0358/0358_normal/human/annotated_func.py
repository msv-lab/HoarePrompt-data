#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10000; the log stream consists of strings formatted as "2012-MM-DD HH:MM:SS:MESSAGE", where MESSAGE contains spaces, uppercase and lowercase English letters, and the characters "!", ".", ",", "?"; the log entries are chronological and valid.
def func():
    n, m = map(int, raw_input().split())
    log = sys.stdin.readlines()
    logtime = []
    last = 0
    for line in log:
        a = line.find(' ')
        
        year, month, day = map(int, line[:a].split('-'))
        
        b = line.rfind(':')
        
        hour, minute, second = map(int, line[a:b].split(':'))
        
        now = datetime.datetime(year, month, day, hour, minute, second)
        
        logtime.append(now)
        
        print(line[:b], last)
        
        for x in logtime[last:]:
            delta = int((now - x).total_seconds())
            print(delta)
            if delta >= n:
                last += 1
            else:
                break
        
        if len(logtime) - last >= m:
            print(line[:b])
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `logtime` contains all parsed timestamps from `log`, `last` is the number of entries in `logtime` with deltas greater than or equal to `n`, `hour`, `minute`, `second` are integers from the last processed `line`, and if the condition of `len(logtime) - last >= m` is met, the last processed `line` is printed; otherwise, no output from the loop's operations may occur if `log` is empty.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a log stream of formatted strings, extracting timestamps and calculating the time difference between log entries. It checks if there are at least `m` log entries within a specified time delta `n` from the current entry. If this condition is met, it prints the timestamp of the current log entry. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return a value. It only prints output based on the conditions met during processing. If no valid logs meet the conditions, there may be no output. Additionally, it is important to note that if there are fewer than `m` entries in total, the condition will not be satisfied, and nothing will be printed.
