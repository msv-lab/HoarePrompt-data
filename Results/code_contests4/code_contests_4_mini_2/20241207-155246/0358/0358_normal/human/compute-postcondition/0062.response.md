Output State: **`hour`, `minute`, `second` are integers from `line[a:b]`, `last` has been incremented, `logtime` must have at least `last + 1` elements, `x` is the next element in `logtime` starting from index `last`; `delta` is assigned the value of `int((now - x).total_seconds())`, and `last` is now incremented by 1.**
