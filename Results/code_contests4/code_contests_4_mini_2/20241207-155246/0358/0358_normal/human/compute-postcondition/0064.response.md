Postcondition: ***`hour`, `minute`, `second` are integers from `line[a:b]`, `last` is incremented, `logtime` has at least `last + 1` elements, `x` is the next element in `logtime` starting from index `last`, and `delta` is assigned the value of `int((now - x).total_seconds())`. If `delta` is greater than or equal to `n`, `last` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `delta` is printed and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
