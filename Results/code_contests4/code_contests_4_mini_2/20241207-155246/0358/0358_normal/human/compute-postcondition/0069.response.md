Postcondition: ***`hour`, `minute`, `second` are integers from `line[a:b]`; `last` is the number of elements in `logtime` that have a delta greater than or equal to `n`; `logtime` has at least `last` elements; if the loop did not execute, `last` remains unchanged. If the difference between the length of `logtime` and `last` is greater than or equal to `m`, then `print(line[:b])` outputs the slice of `line` from the start to index `b`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
