Postcondition: ***`hour`, `minute`, `second` are integers from `line[a:b]`. If `delta` is greater than or equal to `n`, `last` is incremented by 1, `logtime` must have at least `last + 1` elements, `delta` is assigned the value of `int((now - x).total_seconds())`, and `delta` is printed. Otherwise, `last` is incremented by 1, `logtime` must have at least `last + 1` elements, `delta` is assigned the value of `int((now - x).total_seconds())`, `delta` is printed, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
