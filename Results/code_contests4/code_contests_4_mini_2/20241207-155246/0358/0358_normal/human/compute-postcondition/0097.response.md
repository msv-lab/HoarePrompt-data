Postcondition: ***`hour`, `minute`, `second` are assigned values from `line[a:b]`, `logtime` contains entries beyond index `last + 1`, `last` is incremented by 1, and `delta` is assigned the value of `int((now - x).total_seconds())` and printed. If `delta` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program proceeds with the current state. Otherwise, the program also assigns `hour`, `minute`, `second` from `line[a:b]`, maintains `logtime` entries, increments `last`, assigns `delta`, prints `delta`, and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
