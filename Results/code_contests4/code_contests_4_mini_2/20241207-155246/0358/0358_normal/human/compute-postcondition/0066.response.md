Postcondition: ***`hour`, `minute`, `second` are integers from `line[a:b]`, `last` is the number of elements in `logtime` that have a delta greater than or equal to `n`, `logtime` has at least `last` elements, and if the loop did not execute, `last` remains unchanged. The difference between the length of `logtime` and `last` is greater than or equal to `m`.***
