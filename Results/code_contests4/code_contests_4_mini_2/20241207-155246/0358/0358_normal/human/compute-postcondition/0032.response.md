Output State: **`hour`, `minute`, `second` are integers assigned from `line[a:b]`; `delta` is the total seconds between `now` and `x` for each element in `logtime` starting from `last`; `last` is the count of elements in `logtime` that had a `delta` greater than or equal to `n`; if no elements satisfy this condition, `last` remains unchanged.**
