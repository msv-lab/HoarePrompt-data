The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `hour`, `minute`, `second` are integers from `line[a:b]`; `delta` is the integer value of the total seconds calculated from the difference between `now` and the element `x` at index `last` in `logtime`; `delta` is printed, and `delta` is less than `n`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
