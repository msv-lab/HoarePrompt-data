The value of `last` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `last` is unknown. The values of `delta`, `hour`, `minute`, and `second` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `delta` is assigned the value of the total seconds between `now` and `x`; `hour`, `minute`, and `second` remain unchanged; `last` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`delta` is assigned the value of the total seconds between `now` and `x`; `hour`, `minute`, and `second` remain unchanged; `last` is increased by 1.**
