The code snippet assigns values to `year`, `month`, and `day` by splitting a string obtained from `line[:a]` using the '-' character. The `map(int, ...)` function converts the split string parts into integers. The impact on the program is that `year`, `month`, and `day` will be set based on the values present in the substring `line[:a]`, which represents a date in the format "YYYY-MM-DD". However, without knowing the content of `line` and the value of `a`, we cannot determine the specific integer values assigned to `year`, `month`, and `day`. The variables `n`, `m`, `log`, `logtime`, and `last` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers, `log` is a list of lines with at least 1 line, `logtime` is an empty list, `last` is 0, `year`, `month`, and `day` are assigned integer values based on the substring `line[:a]` split by '-'**.
