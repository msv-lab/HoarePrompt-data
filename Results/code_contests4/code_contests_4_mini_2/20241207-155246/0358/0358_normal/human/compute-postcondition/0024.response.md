The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `delta` is assigned the value of the total seconds between `now` and `x`, and it is printed. The values of `hour`, `minute`, `second`, and `last` remain unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
