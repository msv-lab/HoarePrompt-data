The values of the variables `hour`, `minute`, and `second` do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `hour`, `minute`, `second` are integers assigned from `line[a:b]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
