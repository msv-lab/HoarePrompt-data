Postcondition: ***`delta` is the total seconds between `now` and `x`, and it is printed. If `delta` is greater than or equal to `n`, `last` is increased by 1. If `delta` is less than `n`, the values of `hour`, `minute`, `second`, and `last` remain unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
