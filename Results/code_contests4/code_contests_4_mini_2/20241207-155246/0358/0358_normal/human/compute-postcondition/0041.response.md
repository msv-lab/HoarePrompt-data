The code assigns values to `hour`, `minute`, and `second` by splitting the substring `line[a:b]` using ':' as a delimiter and converting the resulting strings to integers. The values of `hour`, `minute`, and `second` are based on the content of `line` from index `a` to `b`. The variables `year`, `month`, and `day` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `hour`, `minute`, `second` are integers assigned from `line[a:b]` split by ':'.

Output State: **`hour`, `minute`, `second` are integers assigned from `line[a:b]` split by ':'**
