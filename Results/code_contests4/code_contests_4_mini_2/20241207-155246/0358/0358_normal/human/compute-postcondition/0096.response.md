The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `hour`, `minute`, `second` are assigned values from `line[a:b]`; `logtime` contains entries beyond index `last + 1`; `last` is incremented by 1; `delta` is assigned the value of `int((now - x).total_seconds()) and `delta` is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
