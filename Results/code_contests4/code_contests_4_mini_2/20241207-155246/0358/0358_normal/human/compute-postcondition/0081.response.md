Postcondition: ***`hour`, `minute`, `second` are assigned values from `line[a:b]`; `logtime` contains entries beyond index `last`; `x` is the first entry in `logtime` at index `last + 1` (if `last` is less than the length of `logtime`); `delta` is assigned the value of `int((now - x).total_seconds())`, `delta` is printed, and `delta` is greater than or equal to `n`.***
