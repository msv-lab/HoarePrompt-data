In the given code, `n` and `m` are assigned values from `raw_input()`, which accepts a string from user input. The `map(int, ...)` function converts these string inputs into integers. The initial state indicates that both `n` and `m` are already integers within the range of 1 to 10000, so they will be reassigned based on user input. The values of `n` and `m` will change to whatever integers the user provides. 

Since the previous values are unknown, the output state will reflect the reassignment of `n` and `m`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are reassigned to the integers from the input values.**
