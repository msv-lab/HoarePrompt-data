Postcondition: ***`hour`, `minute`, `second` are assigned values from `line[a:b]`; `logtime` contains entries beyond index `last + 1`; `last` is incremented by 1; `delta` is the integer representing the total seconds between `now` and `x`; `delta` is printed. Regardless of whether `delta` is greater than or equal to `n`, the same assignments and operations occur, and in the case where `delta` is less than `n`, the program also breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
