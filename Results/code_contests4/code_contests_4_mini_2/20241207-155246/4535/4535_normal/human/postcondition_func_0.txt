The function accepts a positive integer `x` (where 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^100000) and returns the integer value of `x` with its digits reversed. It handles very large integers by converting them to a string, reversing the string, and converting it back to an integer. There are no edge cases related to the input constraints, as the function is designed to handle any positive integer within the specified range.
