Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `x`, and returns the sum of `x` and the result of another function `func_1(x)`. The actual behavior of the function depends on the implementation of `func_1`, which is not provided. There are no checks for the validity of `x` within the function itself, assuming `x` is always a positive integer as stated in the precondition. **
