#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^100000.
def func_1(x):
    return int(str(x)[::-1])
    #The program returns the integer value of x with its digits reversed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `x` (where 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^100000) and returns the integer value of `x` with its digits reversed. It handles very large integers by converting them to a string, reversing the string, and converting it back to an integer. There are no edge cases related to the input constraints, as the function is designed to handle any positive integer within the specified range.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer without leading zeroes, such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^100000.
def func_2(x):
    return x + func_1(x)
    #The program returns the value of x plus the result of func_1(x), where n is a positive integer without leading zeroes and x is defined based on the context of func_1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `x`, and returns the sum of `x` and the result of another function `func_1(x)`. The actual behavior of the function depends on the implementation of `func_1`, which is not provided. There are no checks for the validity of `x` within the function itself, assuming `x` is always a positive integer as stated in the precondition.
