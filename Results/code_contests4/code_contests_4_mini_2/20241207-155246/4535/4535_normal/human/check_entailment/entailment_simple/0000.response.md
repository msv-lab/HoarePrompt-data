The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` which reverses the digits of an integer, and `func_2` which sums an integer with its reversed version. However, the problem description requires a function that, given an integer \( n \), determines if there exists an integer \( a \) (without leading zeroes) such that \( a + ar = n \), where \( ar \) is the reverse of \( a \).

Let's analyze the functions in detail:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function takes an integer \( x \) and returns its reverse. This part is correct according to the problem description as it accurately reverses the digits of \( x \).

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function takes an integer \( x \) and returns the sum of \( x \) and its reverse (obtained by `func_1`).
   - However, the problem does not simply ask to compute the sum of a number and its reverse; it asks to find any number \( a \) such that \( a + ar = n \), meaning \( func_2 \) does not fulfill the requirement of finding \( a \) for a given \( n \).

The program is fundamentally flawed because:
- It does not attempt to find a valid \( a \) given \( n \). Instead, it is just returning a sum of \( x \) and its reverse. There is no mechanism to check against \( n \) or to derive \( a \) from \( n \).
- The output of `func_2` can only yield results based on the input \( x \), it does not validate if the result equals \( n \).

For example:
- If we input \( n = 11 \), the program does not check for possible values of \( a \) that satisfy \( a + ar = 11 \). Instead, it would require the caller to first know \( a \), which is not how the problem is structured.

Thus, the program does not align with the requirements stated in the problem description. It lacks the necessary logic to derive \( a \) based on \( n \), nor does it handle cases where such \( a \) does not exist.

In conclusion, the program does not fulfill the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**
