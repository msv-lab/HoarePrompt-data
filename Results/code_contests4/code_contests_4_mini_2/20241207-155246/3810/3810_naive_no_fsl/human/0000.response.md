To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the `func_19()` function, which handles the main computation for whether Alexey can pay the donation exactly using the specified denominations of coins.

### Problem Breakdown:
- For each university, we're given three integers: `n_i` (the amount to be paid), `l_i` (the minimum denomination of coins that can be used), and `r_i` (the maximum denomination of coins that can be used).
- The goal is to determine if it's possible to pay exactly `n_i` using coins within the range `[l_i, r_i]`.

### Key Logic:
1. **Multiples of Denominations**: To pay exactly `n_i`, we need to check if there exists some integer `k` such that:
   - `l_i * k <= n_i` (the lower bound)
   - `n_i <= r_i * k` (the upper bound)
   
   This translates into two inequalities:
   - `k >= n_i / r_i`
   - `k <= n_i / l_i`
   
   Therefore, the feasible `k` must satisfy:
   - `ceil(n_i / r_i) <= k <= floor(n_i / l_i)`

2. **Implementation**: The program uses a binary search approach to find a valid `k`. However, this approach might be unnecessarily complex and prone to error. 

### Edge Cases and Potential Issues:
- **Exact Coin Payment**: The program doesn't explicitly handle the case where `n_i` is exactly equal to `l_i` or `r_i`. If `n_i` is exactly equal to one of these and is not a multiple of the other, the program might fail.
- **Large Values**: The constraints allow extremely large values (up to `10^9`), and integer division or overflow issues could arise if not handled correctly.

### Testing with Examples:
1. **Example 1**: `n_i = 5`, `l_i = 2`, `r_i = 3`
   - Can pay with: 2 + 3 = 5 → Output should be "Yes".
   
2. **Example 2**: `n_i = 6`, `l_i = 4`, `r_i = 5`
   - Cannot pay exactly 6 with denominations 4 or 5 → Output should be "No".

3. **Edge Case**: `n_i = 4`, `l_i = 4`, `r_i = 4`
   - Can pay with: 4 → Output should be "Yes".

4. **Another Edge Case**: `n_i = 7`, `l_i = 5`, `r_i = 6`
   - Cannot pay exactly 7 → Output should be "No".

### Conclusion:
While the logic seems to mostly cover the requirements, the reliance on `low` and `high` with a binary search might introduce inaccuracies in edge cases. Specifically, the exact match scenarios and the integer division could cause logical flaws.

Thus, given that we can construct cases where the program may fail to give the correct answer, I conclude:

Correctness: **False** 

**Example of Failure**: For `n_i = 10`, `l_i = 3`, `r_i = 5`, the program may not find a valid `k` even though it's possible (3+3+3+1). Additionally, if `n_i` is not a multiple of `l_i` or `r_i`, it could lead to misleading results.
