The function accepts no parameters and returns the input provided by the user, which is expected to include information for a specified number of universities. However, it does not handle the input of multiple universities in a structured manner, nor does it validate the values to ensure they adhere to the specified constraints. It simply returns whatever input is given as a single string.
