The function `func_18` reads input from a file named 'input.txt', where it is expected to process multiple queries regarding donation amounts and coin denominations. However, the function does not perform any computation or return any results related to those queries; it merely redirects standard input and output. Therefore, it lacks the implementation to handle the actual logic of processing the donation amounts (`ni`) and coin denominations (`li`, `ri`). As a result, while it sets up the environment for input/output, it does not provide any meaningful output or return values based on the queries, rendering it incomplete in terms of functionality.
