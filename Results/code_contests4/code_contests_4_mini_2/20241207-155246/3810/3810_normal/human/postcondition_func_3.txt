The function accepts input values representing the attributes of universities, processes the input by splitting it into individual string representations, and returns a map object containing these string values. The function does not handle any potential edge cases related to input formatting or validation, such as empty input or non-integer values, and assumes the input will always be correctly formatted as positive integers.
