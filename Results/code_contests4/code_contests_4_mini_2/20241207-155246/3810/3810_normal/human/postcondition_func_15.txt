The function accepts an integer `x` (representing the number of universities, constrained to 1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) and a list `y` of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers. The function computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and the values in the first tuple of `y`, repeatedly updating `x` with the modulo of `x` by the elements of `y`, until `y` is empty. It then returns the last computed value of `x`. However, as the code currently stands, it lacks handling for the actual elements within the tuples of `y`, and thus, the function will not perform as expected with the provided input structure.
