The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of universities and returns False if `n` is less than or equal to 1, or if `n` is greater than 3 and divisible by either 2 or 3. It returns True if `n` is greater than 3 and not divisible by 2 or 3, or if `n` is 2 or 3. The function also checks for primality for numbers greater than 3 using a trial division method, returning True if `n` is prime and False if it is not.
