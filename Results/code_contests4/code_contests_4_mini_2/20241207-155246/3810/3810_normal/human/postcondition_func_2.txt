The function accepts no parameters and returns a map object containing integers parsed from a single input string. The integers represent values related to the parameters of a number of universities. Since the input is taken from the user, the function does not handle any potential input errors or invalid formats, and it does not specify how many integers to expect, relying instead on the user to provide the correct format.
