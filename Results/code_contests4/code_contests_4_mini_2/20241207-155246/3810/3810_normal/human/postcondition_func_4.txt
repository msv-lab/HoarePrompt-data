The function accepts no parameters and returns a list generated by `func_3()`, which processes the positive integers `ni`, `li`, and `ri` for `t` universities. Each entry in the list corresponds to the results of this processing. However, since the exact behavior and output of `func_3()` are not defined in the provided code, the specific contents of the returned list cannot be determined.
