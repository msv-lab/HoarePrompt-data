The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the total number of items and an integer `r`, which indicates the number of items to choose. It returns the number of ways to choose `r` items from `n` items using the formula n! / (r! * (n - r)!). However, it does not handle edge cases where `r` is greater than `n`, which would result in incorrect calculations or potentially an error, as the factorial of a negative number is not defined. Therefore, the function should ideally check if `r` is less than or equal to `n` before performing the calculation.
