The function accepts a positive integer `x` representing the number of universities and a list `y` of tuples. It returns `x` divided by the length of `y` if `x` is divisible by the length of `y`; otherwise, it returns `x` divided by the length of `y` plus 1. There is a potential error in the code as it uses `y` instead of `len(y)` in the division, which may lead to a TypeError if `y` is not an integer. The code does not handle cases where `y` is empty, which could also lead to a ZeroDivisionError.
