The function processes t queries where t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). Each query consists of three integers ni, li, and ri, where ni is a positive integer representing the donation amount (1 ≤ ni ≤ 10^9), and li and ri are integers representing the minimum and maximum coin denominations respectively (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 10^9).
