The function accepts three positive integer parameters `x`, `y`, and `p`, where `y` is less than or equal to `p`. It calculates the result of `(x^y) % p` using exponentiation by squaring. The function returns this computed value, which can be different from 1 depending on the values of `x`, `y`, and `p`. The function correctly handles the case where `y` is greater than 0 and performs calculations based on the binary representation of `y`. If `y` is 0, the result will always be 1 % p, which is 1.
