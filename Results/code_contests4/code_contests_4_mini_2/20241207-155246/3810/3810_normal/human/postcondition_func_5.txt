The function accepts no parameters and initializes a thread to execute the `main` function, which is intended to process multiple queries consisting of positive integers. However, it does not handle any return values or provide direct output; its primary role is to set up an environment for multi-threaded execution. The function lacks any error handling or checks for the execution of the `main` function.
