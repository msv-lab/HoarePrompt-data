The value of `low` is assigned to be 1. Since `low` is now explicitly set to this value, it changes from its previous state (where it was greater than `high`). The values of `high`, `f`, `n`, `l`, and `r` are not affected by this change. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is 1, `high` is greater than `low`, `f` is 1 indicating there exists a `mid`, and `n`, `l`, `r` retain their values from `func_3()`.

Output State: **`low` is 1, `high` is greater than `low`, `f` is 1 indicating there exists a `mid`, `n`, `l`, `r` retain their values from `func_3()`**
