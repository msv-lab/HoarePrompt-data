Postcondition: ***`low` can be either 750000001 or 500000001; `high` can be either 1000000000 or at least 500000001; `mid` can be either 875000000, 625000001, 750000000, or 500000001; `x` can be various values based on combinations of `low` and `mid`; if `y` is less than `n`, then `f` remains unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `y` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `low` can be either 750000001 or 500000001; `high` can be either 874999999, 625000000, 749999999, or 500000000; `mid` can be either 875000000, 625000001, 750000000, or 500000001; `x` can be various values based on combinations of `low` and `mid`; `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid`.***
