To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the provided information step by step.

According to the code, the loop will execute based on the return value of `func_1()`. At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `low` is greater than `high`, `n`, `l`, `r`, and `t` have their initial values, and `high` is less than or equal to 1000000000. This indicates that the loop may have executed based on some condition related to the return value of `func_1()`.

Since the loop relies on `func_1()` to determine how many times it will run, we must check if `func_1()` can return a value that allows the loop to execute again. If `func_1()` returns a value greater than the current iteration count, the loop will execute again.

However, since we do not have information about the current iteration count or the return value of `func_1()` from the previous iteration, we can only state that for the loop to execute again, `func_1()` must return a value greater than the number of iterations that have already been completed.

Given that `low` is greater than `high`, it seems likely that the loop may not execute again unless `func_1()` potentially returns a value that indicates more iterations are possible.

State: **`low` is greater than `high`, `n`, `l`, `r`, and `t` retain their initial values assigned from `func_3()`, `high` is less than or equal to 1000000000, for the loop to execute one more time `func_1()` must return a value greater than the current iteration count.**
