The value of `f` is assigned the value 1. The previous values of the other variables (`low`, `high`, `mid`, `x`, and `y`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is either 500000001 or 1; `high` is greater than or equal to 500000001; `mid` is either at least 250000001 or at least 500000001; `x` is assigned the value of `l * mid`; `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid`; `f` is 1.
