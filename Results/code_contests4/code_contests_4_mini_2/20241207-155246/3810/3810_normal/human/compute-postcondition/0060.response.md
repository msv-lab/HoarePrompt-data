The value of `high` is assigned the value of `mid - 1`. Given that `mid` is 500000000, `high` will be updated to 500000000 - 1, which equals 499999999. The values of the other variables, namely `low`, `n`, `l`, `r`, `f`, `y`, and their relationships, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is 1, `high` is 499999999, `n`, `l`, `r` retain their values from `func_3()`, `f` is 1, `mid` is 500000000, `y` is `r * 500000000`, and `y` is greater than or equal to `n`.

Output State: **`low` is 1, `high` is 499999999, `n`, `l`, `r` retain their values from `func_3()`, `f` is 1, `mid` is 500000000, `y` is `r * 500000000`, and `y` is greater than or equal to `n`.**
