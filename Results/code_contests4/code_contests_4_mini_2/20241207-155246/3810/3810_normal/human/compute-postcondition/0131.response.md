Postcondition: ***`low` is greater than `high`, if `f` is 1, indicating that a valid `mid` was found such that `l * mid <= n <= r * mid`, the function `func_20` is called with the argument 'Yes'. If `f` is 0, the function `func_20` is called with the argument 'No', while still maintaining that `high` is less than or equal to the initial value of `high` and `low` is greater than or equal to the initial value of `low` (1).***
