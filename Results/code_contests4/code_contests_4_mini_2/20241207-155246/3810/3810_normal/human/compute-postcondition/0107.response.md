`mid` is assigned the value of `(low + high) // 2`. The value of `low` can be either 500000001 or 1, and the value of `high` can be either 1000000000 or must be at least 500000001 for the loop to execute again. 

If `low` is 500000001 and `high` is 1000000000, then `mid` would be (500000001 + 1000000000) // 2 = 750000000. 
If `low` is 1 and `high` is 1000000000, then `mid` would be (1 + 1000000000) // 2 = 500000000.

Therefore, the possible values for `mid` can be either 750000000 or 500000000.

Output State: **`low` is either 500000001 or 1; `high` is either 1000000000 or at least 500000001; `mid` is either 750000000 or 500000000**
