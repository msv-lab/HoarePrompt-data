Postcondition: ***`low` can be either 750000001 or 500000001; `high` can be either 1000000000 or at least 500000001; `mid` can be either 750000000 or 500000000; `y` cannot be calculated due to undefined variable `r`; if `y` is less than `n`, then if `x` is less than or equal to `n` and `n` is less than or equal to `y`, `f` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `y` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `low` can be either 500000001 or 1; `high` can be either 749999999 or 499999999; `mid` can be either 750000000 or 500000000; `y` cannot be calculated due to undefined variable `r`; if `x` is less than or equal to `n` and `n` is less than or equal to `y`, `f` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
