The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer less than or equal to 1000; `n`, `l`, `r` are assigned values from `func_3(); low` is either 500000001 or 1; `high` is either 1000000000 or 499999999; `mid` is either 750000000, 500000000, or 250000000; `x` is `l * mid`; `y` is either `r * 750000000`, `r * 500000000`, or `r * 250000000`; `f` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
