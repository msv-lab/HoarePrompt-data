The value of `high` is assigned the value of `mid - 1`. The previous values of `mid` could be either 750000000 or 500000000, which means `high` could either be 749999999 or 499999999. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is either 500000001 or 1; `high` is either 749999999 or 499999999; `mid` is either 750000000 or 500000000; `y` cannot be calculated due to undefined variable `r`; if `x` is less than or equal to `n` and `n` is less than or equal to `y`, then `f` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`low` is either 500000001 or 1; `high` is either 749999999 or 499999999; `mid` is either 750000000 or 500000000; `y` cannot be calculated due to undefined variable `r`; if `x` is less than or equal to `n` and `n` is less than or equal to `y`, then `f` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
