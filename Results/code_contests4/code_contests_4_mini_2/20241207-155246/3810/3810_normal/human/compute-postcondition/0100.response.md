Postcondition: ***`low` is 1, `high` is 1000000000, `mid` is 500000000, `y` cannot be determined due to the undefined variable `r`, and if `x` is less than or equal to `n` and `n` is less than or equal to `y`, then `f` is assigned the value 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
