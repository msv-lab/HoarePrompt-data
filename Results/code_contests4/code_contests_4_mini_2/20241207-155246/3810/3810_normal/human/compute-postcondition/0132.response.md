Output State: **`low` is greater than `high`, `n`, `l`, `r`, and `t` retain their initial values assigned from `func_3()`, and `high` is less than or equal to 1000000000. `f` indicates whether there exists a `mid` such that `l * mid <= n <= r * mid` for each iteration, and `func_20` is called with 'Yes' or 'No' based on the value of `f` for each iteration.**
