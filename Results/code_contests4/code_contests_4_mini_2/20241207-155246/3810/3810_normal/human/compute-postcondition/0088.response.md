According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the output of `func_1()`. If `func_1()` returns a value greater than the number of times the loop has already executed, the loop can run again. At the end of the last iteration, `low` is greater than `high`, and `f` is 1, indicating that there exists a `mid` such that `l * mid <= n <= r * mid`. The values of `n`, `l`, and `r` retain their values from `func_3()`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `func_1()` must return a value greater than the current iteration count. If the loop has already executed `k` times, `func_1()` should return at least `k + 1`. 

Therefore, if the loop has executed `k` times and is currently executing the `k`-th iteration, we need to increment the iteration count by 1. Assuming the loop has executed `k` times, for the loop to execute one more time, `func_1()` must return a value greater than `k`.

State: **`low` is greater than `high`, `f` is 1 indicating that there exists a `mid` such that `l * mid <= n <= r * mid`, `n`, `l`, `r` retain their values from `func_3()`, for the loop to execute one more time `func_1()` must return a value greater than k, representing the number of times the loop has already executed.**
