Postcondition: ***`low` is either 500000001 or 1, `high` is either 1000000000 or 499999999, `n`, `l`, `r` retain their values from `func_3()`, `f` is set to 1, `mid` is 500000000, `y` is `r * 500000000`. If `y` is less than `n`, `x` is less than or equal to `n`, and `n` is less than or equal to `y` before breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `y` is greater than or equal to `n`.***
