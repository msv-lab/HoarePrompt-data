The variable `high` is assigned the value of `mid - 1`. Given that `mid` is 500000000, the new value of `high` will be 500000000 - 1 = 499999999. The values of the other variables (`low`, `y`, `x`, and `n`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is 1, `high` is 499999999, `mid` is 500000000, `y` cannot be determined due to the undefined variable `r`, `x` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` is less than or equal to `y`, and `y` is greater than or equal to `n`.

Output State: **`low` is 1, `high` is 499999999, `mid` is 500000000, `y` cannot be determined due to the undefined variable `r`, `x` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` is less than or equal to `y`, and `y` is greater than or equal to `n`.**
