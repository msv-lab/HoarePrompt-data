The function `func_19` does not accept any parameters. It processes a specified number of queries (`t`), where each query consists of three positive integers: `ni`, `li`, and `ri`. The function returns results based on the relationships and constraints of these integers. Specifically, `t` is a positive integer less than or equal to 1000, and for each query, `ni`, `li`, and `ri` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `ni`, `li`, `ri` ≤ 10^9 and `li` ≤ `ri`. The output of the function will depend on the logic applied to these queries, but the exact nature of the output is not specified in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters, processes a number of queries defined by a positive integer `t`, and returns results based on the constraints of the integers `ni`, `li`, and `ri` in each query.**
