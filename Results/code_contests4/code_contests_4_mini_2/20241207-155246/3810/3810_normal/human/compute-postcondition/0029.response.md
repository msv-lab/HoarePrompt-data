The variable `mid` is assigned the value of the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2. The value of `low` can be either `500000001` or `1`, and `high` can be either `1000000000` or `499999999`. Therefore, we can calculate the possible values for `mid`.

1. If `low` is `500000001` and `high` is `1000000000`, then:
   ```
   mid = (500000001 + 1000000000) // 2 = 750000000
   ```

2. If `low` is `500000001` and `high` is `499999999`, then:
   ```
   mid = (500000001 + 499999999) // 2 = 500000000
   ```

3. If `low` is `1` and `high` is `1000000000`, then:
   ```
   mid = (1 + 1000000000) // 2 = 500000000
   ```

4. If `low` is `1` and `high` is `499999999`, then:
   ```
   mid = (1 + 499999999) // 2 = 250000000
   ```

Thus, the possible values of `mid` based on the combinations of `low` and `high` are `750000000`, `500000000`, and `250000000`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer less than or equal to 1000; `n`, `l`, `r` are assigned values from `func_3(); low` is either 500000001 or 1; `high` is either 1000000000 or 499999999; `mid` is either 750000000, 500000000, or 250000000; `x` is `l * mid`; `y` is either `r * 750000000`, `r * 500000000`, or `r * 250000000`, and the loop to execute again requires `low` to be less than or equal to `high`.**
