Output State: **`t` is a positive integer less than or equal to 1000; `n`, `l`, `r` are assigned values from `func_3(); low` is either 500000001 or 1; `high` is now mid - 1; `mid` is either 750000000, 500000000, or 250000000; `x` is `l * mid`; `y` is either `r * 750000000`, `r * 500000000`, or `r * 250000000`. If `x` is less than or equal to `n` and `n` is less than or equal to `y`, then `f` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
