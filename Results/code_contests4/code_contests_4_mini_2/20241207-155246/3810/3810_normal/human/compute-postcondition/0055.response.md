The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is 1, `high` is 1000000000, `n`, `l`, `r` retain their values from `func_3()`, `f` is 1, `mid` is 500000000, `y` is `r * 500000000`, and `x` is less than or equal to `n` and `n` is less than or equal to `y` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
