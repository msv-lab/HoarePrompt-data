The variable `x` is assigned the value of `l * mid`. However, the variable `l` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the value of `x` based on the provided information. The values of `low`, `high`, and `mid` are not affecting the calculation for `x` since `l` is missing. Hence, the output state reflects that `x` cannot be calculated.

Output State: **`low` is either 500000001 or 1; `high` is either 1000000000 or at least 500000001; `mid` is either 750000000 or 500000000; `x` cannot be calculated due to undefined variable `l`.**
