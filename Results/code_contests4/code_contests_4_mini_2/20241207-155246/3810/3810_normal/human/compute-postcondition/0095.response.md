The variable `x` is assigned the value of `l * mid`. However, the variable `l` has not been defined in the initial state. As a result, we cannot determine the value of `x`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is 1, `high` is 1000000000, `mid` is 500000000, and the value of `x` cannot be determined due to the undefined variable `l`.

Output State: **`low` is 1, `high` is 1000000000, `mid` is 500000000, and the value of `x` cannot be determined due to the undefined variable `l`.**
