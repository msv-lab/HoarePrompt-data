The value of `f` is assigned 0, changing its previous value from 1 to 0. The variables `low`, `high`, `n`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged, as the code only affects `f`. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is 1, `high` is 1000000000, `f` is 0, `n`, `l`, `r` retain their values from `func_3()`. 

Output State: **`low` is 1, `high` is 1000000000, `f` is 0, `n`, `l`, `r` retain their values from `func_3()`**.
