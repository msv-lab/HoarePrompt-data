Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer less than or equal to 1000; if `y` is less than `n` and `x` is less than or equal to `n` and `n` is less than or equal to `y`, then `f` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `f` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
