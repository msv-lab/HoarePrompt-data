Postcondition: ***`low` is either 500000001 or 1; `high` is greater than or equal to 500000001; `mid` is either in the range of 250000001 to high or at least 500000001; `x` is undefined; `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid`, where `r` is undefined; if `x` is less than or equal to `n` and `n` is less than or equal to `y`, then `f` is set to 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
