The variable `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid`. However, the variable `r` is undefined, so we cannot determine the value of `y`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is 1, `high` is 1000000000, `mid` is 500000000, and `y` cannot be determined due to the undefined variable `r`.

Output State: **`low` is 1, `high` is 1000000000, `mid` is 500000000, and `y` cannot be determined due to the undefined variable `r`.**
