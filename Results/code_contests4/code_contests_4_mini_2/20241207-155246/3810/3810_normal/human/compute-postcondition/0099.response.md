The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is 1, `high` is 1000000000, `mid` is 500000000, `y` cannot be determined due to the undefined variable `r`, `x` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` is less than or equal to `y`, and `f` is assigned the value 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
