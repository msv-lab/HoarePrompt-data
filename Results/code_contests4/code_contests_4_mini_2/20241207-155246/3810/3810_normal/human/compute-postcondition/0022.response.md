Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `args` is a collection with at least `t` elements, `x` is the last element in `args`, `at_start` is False; `file` writes the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`, and the end character used for writing is either the default newline character or a specified value from `kwargs`; the `flush` operation is performed on `file` to ensure all buffered output is written out.**
