Postcondition: ***`low` is greater than `high`, `f` is 1 indicating that there exists a `mid` such that `l * mid <= n <= r * mid`, and `n`, `l`, `r` retain their values from `func_3()`, with `func_20` being called with the argument 'Yes'. If `f` is 0, indicating that there does not exist a `mid` such that `l * mid <= n <= r * mid`, then `n`, `l`, `r` still retain their values from `func_3()`, and `func_20` is called with the argument 'No'.***
