Output State: **`low` is either 500000001 or 1; `high` is greater than or equal to 500000001; `mid` is either at least 250000001 or at least 500000001; `x` is assigned the value of `l * mid`; `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid`; if `x` is less than or equal to `n` and `n` is less than or equal to `y`, then `f` is set to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; `high` is now `mid - 1`.**
