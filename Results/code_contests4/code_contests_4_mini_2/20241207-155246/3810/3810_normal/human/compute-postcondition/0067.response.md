The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is either 500000001 or 1; `high` is greater than or equal to 500000001; `mid` is either in the range of 250000001 to high or at least 500000001; `x` is undefined; `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid`, where `r` is undefined; `f` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
