The value of `high` is assigned to 1000000000. The previous value of `high` is not specified, but it is known to be greater than `low`, which is 1. The states of the other variables (`low`, `f`, `n`, `l`, `r`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is 1, `high` is 1000000000, `f` is 1, `n`, `l`, `r` retain their values from `func_3()`. 

Output State: **`low` is 1, `high` is 1000000000, `f` is 1, `n`, `l`, `r` retain their values from `func_3()`**
