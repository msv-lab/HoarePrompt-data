The variable `f` is assigned the value of `0`. The previous values of the affected variables `low`, `high`, `n`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is 1, `high` is 1000000000, `n`, `l`, `r` retain their values assigned from `func_3()`, and `f` is now 0.

Output State: **`low` is 1, `high` is 1000000000, `n`, `l`, `r` retain their values assigned from `func_3()`, and `f` is 0.**
