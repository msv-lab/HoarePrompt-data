The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the output. Since `x` is the second element in `args` and `at_start` is False, this operation will take place. The values of `t`, `args`, and `at_start` remain unchanged by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `args` is a collection with at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in `args`, `at_start` is False, and `file` writes the string representation of `x` to the output.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `args` is a collection with at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in `args`, `at_start` is False, and `file` writes the string representation of `x` to the output.**
