`mid` is assigned the value of `(low + high) // 2`. Given that `low` is 1 and `high` is 1000000000, the calculation is as follows: 

`mid = (1 + 1000000000) // 2` which results in `mid = 500000000`.

The other variables `n`, `l`, `r`, and `f` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is 1, `high` is 1000000000, `n`, `l`, `r` retain their values assigned from `func_3()`, `f` is 0, and `mid` is 500000000.

Output State: **`low` is 1, `high` is 1000000000, `n`, `l`, `r` retain their values assigned from `func_3()`, `f` is 0, and `mid` is 500000000.**
