The variable `x` is assigned the value of `l * mid`. The values of `l` and `mid` are not specified, but `mid` can be either 750000000, 500000000, or 250000000. Therefore, `x` will depend on the value of `l` multiplied by one of these three possible values of `mid`. The states of the other variables are not affected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer less than or equal to 1000; `n`, `l`, `r` are assigned values from `func_3(); low` is either 500000001 or 1; `high` is either 1000000000 or 499999999; `mid` is either 750000000, 500000000, or 250000000; `x` is `l * mid`; `y` is either `r * 750000000`, `r * 500000000`, or `r * 250000000`.**
