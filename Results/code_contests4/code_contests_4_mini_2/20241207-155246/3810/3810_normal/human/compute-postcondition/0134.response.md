Functionality: ** The function processes a number of queries defined by a positive integer `t`, where for each query it checks if there exists an integer `mid` such that `l * mid <= n <= r * mid`. If such a `mid` exists, it returns 'Yes'; otherwise, it returns 'No'. The function does not accept any parameters and relies on the values retrieved from other functions (`func_1` and `func_3`) for its operations. It may be subject to edge cases based on the values of `n`, `l`, and `r`, including scenarios where `n` is outside the bounds defined by `l` and `r`.**
