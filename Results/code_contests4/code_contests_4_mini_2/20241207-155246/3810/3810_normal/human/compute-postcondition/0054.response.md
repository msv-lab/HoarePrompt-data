The value of `f` is assigned the value `1`. The previous value of `f` was `0`, so now `f` is updated to `1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is 1, `high` is 1000000000, `n`, `l`, `r` retain their values from `func_3()`, `f` is 1, `mid` is 500000000, `y` is `r * 500000000`, and `x` is less than or equal to `n` and `n` is less than or equal to `y`.

Output State: **`low` is 1, `high` is 1000000000, `n`, `l`, `r` retain their values from `func_3()`, `f` is 1, `mid` is 500000000, `y` is `r * 500000000`, and `x` is less than or equal to `n` and `n` is less than or equal to `y.**
