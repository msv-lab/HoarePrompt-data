Postcondition: ***`low` is either 500000001 or 1; `high` is greater than or equal to 500000001; `mid` is either at least 250000001 or at least 500000001. If `y` is less than `n`, then `high` remains as it was, and if `x` is less than or equal to `n` and `n` is less than or equal to `y`, then `f` is set to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`, and if `x` is less than or equal to `n` and `n` is less than or equal to `y`, then `f` is set to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
