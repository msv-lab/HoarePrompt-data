Output State: **`low` is greater than `high`, `n`, `l`, `r` retain their initial values assigned from `func_3()`, `high` is less than or equal to 1000000000, for the loop to execute one more time `func_1()` must return a value greater than the current iteration count; `n`, `l`, `r` are now assigned the values returned by `func_3()`**.
