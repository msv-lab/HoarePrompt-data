The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is either 500000001 or 1; `high` is either 1000000000 or at least 500000001; `mid` is either 750000000 or 500000000; `y` cannot be calculated due to undefined variable `r`; `f` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
