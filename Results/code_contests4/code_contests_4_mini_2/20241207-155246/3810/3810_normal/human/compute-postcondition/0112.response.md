Postcondition: ***`low` is either 500000001 or 1; `high` is either 1000000000 or at least 500000001; `mid` is either 750000000 or 500000000; `y` cannot be calculated due to undefined variable `r`; if `x` is less than or equal to `n` and `n` is less than or equal to `y`, then `f` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
