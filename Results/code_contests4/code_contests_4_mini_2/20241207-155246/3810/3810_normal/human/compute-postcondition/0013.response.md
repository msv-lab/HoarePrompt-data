The variable `at_start` is assigned the value `False`, which means it remains unchanged since it was already `False`. Other variables such as `t`, `args`, and `x` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `args` is a collection with at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in `args`, and `at_start` is False.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `args` is a collection with at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in `args`, and `at_start` is False**.
