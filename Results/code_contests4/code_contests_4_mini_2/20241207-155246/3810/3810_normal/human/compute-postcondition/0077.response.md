The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is either 500000001 or 1; `high` is greater than or equal to 500000001; `mid` is either at least 250000001 or at least 500000001; `x` is assigned the value of `l * mid`; `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid`; `f` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
