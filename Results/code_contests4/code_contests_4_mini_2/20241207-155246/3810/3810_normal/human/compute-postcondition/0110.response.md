The variable `f` is assigned the value of 1. This assignment does not affect the values of the other variables, which remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is either 500000001 or 1; `high` is either 1000000000 or at least 500000001; `mid` is either 750000000 or 500000000; `y` cannot be calculated due to undefined variable `r`; `f` is 1.
