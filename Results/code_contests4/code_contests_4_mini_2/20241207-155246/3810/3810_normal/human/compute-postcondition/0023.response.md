Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `args` is a collection with at least `t` elements, `x` is the last element in `args`, `at_start` is False; `file` writes the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`, using either the default newline character or a specified value from `kwargs`, and if `flush` is True, the `flush` operation is performed on `file` to ensure all buffered output is written out.***
