The value of `low` is assigned the value of `mid + 1`. The previous value of `mid` can be at least 250000001 or at least 500000001, so the possible new values of `low` are at least 250000002 or at least 500000002. The states of `high`, `x`, `y`, `n`, and `f` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is either 500000002 or 2; `high` is greater than or equal to 500000001; `mid` is either at least 250000001 or at least 500000001; `x` is assigned the value of `l * mid`; `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid`; if `x` is less than or equal to `n` and `n` is less than or equal to `y`, then `f` is set to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`low` is either 500000002 or 2; `high` is greater than or equal to 500000001; `mid` is either at least 250000001 or at least 500000001; `x` is assigned the value of `l * mid`; `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid`; if `x` is less than or equal to `n` and `n` is less than or equal to `y`, then `f` is set to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
