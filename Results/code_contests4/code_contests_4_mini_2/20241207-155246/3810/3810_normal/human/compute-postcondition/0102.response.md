`low` is assigned the value `mid + 1`. Since `mid` is 500000000, `low` becomes 500000000 + 1, which is 500000001. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is 500000001, `high` is 1000000000, `mid` is 500000000, `y` cannot be determined due to the undefined variable `r`, `x` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` is less than or equal to `y`, and `y` is less than `n`.

Output State: **`low` is 500000001, `high` is 1000000000, `mid` is 500000000, `y` cannot be determined due to the undefined variable `r`, `x` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` is less than or equal to `y`, and `y` is less than `n`**.
