According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `low` and `high`. The loop can execute as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`. Right before the loop, `low` is 1 and `high` is 1000000000. Since `low` is less than `high`, the loop can execute without any modifications needed. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`low` is 1, `high` is 1000000000**
