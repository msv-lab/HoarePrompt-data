`mid` is assigned the value of `(low + high) // 2`. Given that `low` can be either 750000001 or 500000001, and `high` can be either 1000000000 or at least 500000001, we can calculate the possible values for `mid`.

1. If `low` is 750000001 and `high` is 1000000000:
   - `mid = (750000001 + 1000000000) // 2 = 1750000001 // 2 = 875000000`

2. If `low` is 750000001 and `high` is at least 500000001 (let's take the minimum, 500000001):
   - `mid = (750000001 + 500000001) // 2 = 1250000002 // 2 = 625000001`

3. If `low` is 500000001 and `high` is 1000000000:
   - `mid = (500000001 + 1000000000) // 2 = 1500000001 // 2 = 750000000`

4. If `low` is 500000001 and `high` is at least 500000001 (again taking the minimum, 500000001):
   - `mid = (500000001 + 500000001) // 2 = 1000000002 // 2 = 500000001`

Therefore, the possible values of `mid` based on the values of `low` and `high` are 875000000, 625000001, 750000000, and 500000001. 

Hence, the Output State is: `low` can be either 750000001 or 500000001; `high` can be either 1000000000 or at least 500000001; `mid` can be either 875000000, 625000001, 750000000, or 500000001.
Output State: **`low` can be either 750000001 or 500000001; `high` can be either 1000000000 or at least 500000001; `mid` can be either 875000000, 625000001, 750000000, or 500000001.**
