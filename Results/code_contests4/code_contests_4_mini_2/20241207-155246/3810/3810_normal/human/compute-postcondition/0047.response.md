The value of `high` is assigned the value `1000000000`. The previous state indicates that `high` was less than or equal to `1000000000`, so it is now set to exactly `1000000000`, but it does not change the condition that it was previously less than or equal to that value. The values of `low`, `n`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is 1, `high` is 1000000000, `n`, `l`, `r` retain their values assigned from `func_3()`.

Output State: **`low` is 1, `high` is 1000000000, `n`, `l`, `r` retain their values assigned from `func_3()`**
