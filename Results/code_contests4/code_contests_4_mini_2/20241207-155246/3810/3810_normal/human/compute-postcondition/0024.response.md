The function `func_20` does not accept any parameters directly. However, it operates based on the constraints provided: `t` is a positive integer representing the number of universities, and for each university, `ni`, `li`, and `ri` are positive integers where \(1 \leq ni, li, ri \leq 10^9\) and \(li \leq ri\). 

The function's output is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, based on the input constraints, we can conclude the following:

Functionality: **The function operates on a positive integer `t` representing the number of universities, and for each university it processes positive integers `ni`, `li`, and `ri` within the specified bounds. The exact return value or behavior of the function is not provided.**
