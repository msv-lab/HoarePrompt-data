The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` can be either 750000001 or 500000001; `high` can be either 1000000000 or at least 500000001; `mid` can be either 875000000, 625000001, 750000000, or 500000001; `x` can be various values based on combinations of `low` and `mid`; `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid`; `f` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
