In the provided code snippet, `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid`. However, the variable `r` is not defined in the initial state, which means we cannot calculate `y`. The values of `low`, `high`, and `mid` are not impacted by this operation since we cannot determine the result due to the undefined variable `r`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is either 500000001 or 1; `high` is either 1000000000 or at least 500000001; `mid` is either 750000000 or 500000000; `y` cannot be calculated due to undefined variable `r`.

Output State: **`low` is either 500000001 or 1; `high` is either 1000000000 or at least 500000001; `mid` is either 750000000 or 500000000; `y` cannot be calculated due to undefined variable `r`.**
