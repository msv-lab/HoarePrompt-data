The function accepts a variable number of arguments and prints their string representations to a specified output stream, separated by a specified separator. It also allows for customization of the end character and includes an option to flush the output stream after writing. The function does not directly handle or return any values related to the positive integers representing universities (`t`, `ni`, `li`, `ri`), as these are not explicitly defined as parameters or processed within the function.
