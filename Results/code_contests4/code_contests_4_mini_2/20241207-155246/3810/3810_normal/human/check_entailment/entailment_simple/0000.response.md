Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements laid out in the problem description. 

### Reasons for Incorrectness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program does not effectively parse and utilize the input values for `ni`, `li`, and `ri` during the actual donation checking process. While it contains functions that read input, it lacks proper integration to handle multiple queries and evaluate each query according to the constraints.

2. **Logic for Donation Calculation**: The program's logic in `func_19()` does not correctly determine if it is possible to gather a donation of exactly `ni` berubleys using coins of denominations between `li` and `ri`. The binary search approach does not evaluate if the exact amount can be formed with the denominations in the specified range, particularly because it improperly calculates bounds through `low`, `high`, and `mid` without directly checking combinations of values that could form `ni`.

3. **Output Handling**: The function `func_20()` is designed to print outputs but does not directly connect with the decision-making logic to print the correct results ('Yes' or 'No') based on the conditions stipulated in the problem.

4. **Redundant or Misleading Functions**: Several functions (like `func_9()`, `func_10()`, etc.) are either unnecessary or do not contribute to solving the problem as described. They introduce confusion and do not align with the required functionality, which should focus on checking if the exact donation can be formed.

### Conclusion:
The program does not meet the problem's requirements due to improper handling of input, incorrect logic for determining the feasibility of donations, and a lack of coherent output integration. As a result, it fails to provide a valid solution for all potential cases outlined in the problem description.
