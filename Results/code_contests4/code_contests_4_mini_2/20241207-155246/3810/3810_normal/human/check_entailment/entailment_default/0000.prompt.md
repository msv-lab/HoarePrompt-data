You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those output hints describes certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Alexey, a merry Berland entrant, got sick of the gray reality and he zealously wants to go to university. There are a lot of universities nowadays, so Alexey is getting lost in the diversity — he has not yet decided what profession he wants to get. At school, he had bad grades in all subjects, and it's only thanks to wealthy parents that he was able to obtain the graduation certificate.

The situation is complicated by the fact that each high education institution has the determined amount of voluntary donations, paid by the new students for admission — ni berubleys. He cannot pay more than ni, because then the difference between the paid amount and ni can be regarded as a bribe!

Each rector is wearing the distinctive uniform of his university. Therefore, the uniform's pockets cannot contain coins of denomination more than ri. The rector also does not carry coins of denomination less than li in his pocket — because if everyone pays him with so small coins, they gather a lot of weight and the pocket tears. Therefore, a donation can be paid only by coins of denomination x berubleys, where li ≤ x ≤ ri (Berland uses coins of any positive integer denomination). Alexey can use the coins of different denominations and he can use the coins of the same denomination any number of times. When Alexey was first confronted with such orders, he was puzzled because it turned out that not all universities can accept him! Alexey is very afraid of going into the army (even though he had long wanted to get the green uniform, but his dad says that the army bullies will beat his son and he cannot pay to ensure the boy's safety). So, Alexey wants to know for sure which universities he can enter so that he could quickly choose his alma mater.

Thanks to the parents, Alexey is not limited in money and we can assume that he has an unlimited number of coins of each type.

In other words, you are given t requests, each of them contains numbers ni, li, ri. For each query you need to answer, whether it is possible to gather the sum of exactly ni berubleys using only coins with an integer denomination from li to ri berubleys. You can use coins of different denominations. Coins of each denomination can be used any number of times.

Input

The first line contains the number of universities t, (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) Each of the next t lines contain three space-separated integers: ni, li, ri (1 ≤ ni, li, ri ≤ 109; li ≤ ri).

Output

For each query print on a single line: either "Yes", if Alexey can enter the university, or "No" otherwise.

Examples

Input

2
5 2 3
6 4 5


Output

Yes
No

Note

You can pay the donation to the first university with two coins: one of denomination 2 and one of denomination 3 berubleys. The donation to the second university cannot be paid.
Functions with output description for each function:
Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output decription for function1:  The function accepts user input and returns a positive integer representing the number of universities, with no validation to ensure the input is within the specified range (1 to 1000), which could lead to invalid values being accepted.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return input()
''' 

 Output decription for function2:  The function accepts no parameters and returns the input provided by the user, which is expected to include information for a specified number of universities. However, it does not handle the input of multiple universities in a structured manner, nor does it validate the values to ensure they adhere to the specified constraints. It simply returns whatever input is given as a single string.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().strip().split(' '))
''' 

 Output decription for function3:  The function accepts no parameters and returns a map object containing integers parsed from a single input string. The integers represent values related to the parameters of a number of universities. Since the input is taken from the user, the function does not handle any potential input errors or invalid formats, and it does not specify how many integers to expect, relying instead on the user to provide the correct format.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    return map(str, input().strip().split(' '))
''' 

 Output decription for function4:  The function accepts input values representing the attributes of universities, processes the input by splitting it into individual string representations, and returns a map object containing these string values. The function does not handle any potential edge cases related to input formatting or validation, such as empty input or non-integer values, and assumes the input will always be correctly formatted as positive integers.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return list(func_3())
''' 

 Output decription for function5:  The function accepts no parameters and returns a list generated by `func_3()`, which processes the positive integers `ni`, `li`, and `ri` for `t` universities. Each entry in the list corresponds to the results of this processing. However, since the exact behavior and output of `func_3()` are not defined in the provided code, the specific contents of the returned list cannot be determined.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1000000)
    threading.stack_size(1024000)
    thread = threading.Thread(target=main)
    thread.start()
''' 

 Output decription for function6:  The function accepts no parameters and initializes a thread to execute the `main` function, which is intended to process multiple queries consisting of positive integers. However, it does not handle any return values or provide direct output; its primary role is to set up an environment for multi-threaded execution. The function lacks any error handling or checks for the execution of the `main` function.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7(item):
    return item[1]
''' 

 Output decription for function7:  The function accepts a list of tuples `item`, where each tuple contains three integers. It returns the second tuple from the list (item[1]). If the list contains fewer than two tuples, attempting to access item[1] will result in an `IndexError`.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(l):
    return sorted(l, key=getKey, reverse=True)
''' 

 Output decription for function8:  The function accepts a list of tuples `l`, where each tuple contains three integers. It returns the list sorted in descending order based on a key defined by the `getKey` function. There are no checks for any edge cases regarding the contents of the tuples or the structure of the list.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9(n, m, num):
    return [[num for x in range(m)] for y in range(n)]
''' 

 Output decription for function9:  The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `m`, and a list of tuples `num`. It returns a matrix of size `n x m`, where each element is a reference to the same list of tuples `num`. This means that all entries in the matrix point to the same list, rather than creating distinct copies for each entry.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10(x):
    return x and (not x & x - 1)
''' 

 Output decription for function10:  The function accepts a list of tuples `x`, where each tuple contains three integers. It returns the list of tuples `x` along with a boolean value indicating whether `x` is empty or has a specific numeric representation based on the bitwise operation `not x & (x - 1)`. The expression evaluates to `True` if `x` is empty or if `x` is a power of two (which is not applicable here since `x` is a list of tuples and not a numeric value). However, the behavior of the bitwise operation may not yield a meaningful result in the context of a list, leading to potential misunderstandings about its output.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11(n):
    return bin(n).replace('0b', '')
''' 

 Output decription for function11:  The function accepts a list of tuples `n` and returns the binary representation of the entire list as a string, after removing the '0b' prefix. It does not return the binary representation of each integer within the tuples or handle any errors arising from unexpected input.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(n):
    return [int(i) for i in str(n)]
''' 

 Output decription for function12:  The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns a list of its digits, where each digit is represented as an integer. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities as the function correctly handles any positive integer input within the specified range.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(n, r):
    return factorial(n) // (factorial(r) * factorial(max(n - r, 1)))
''' 

 Output decription for function13:  The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the total number of items and an integer `r`, which indicates the number of items to choose. It returns the number of ways to choose `r` items from `n` items using the formula n! / (r! * (n - r)!). However, it does not handle edge cases where `r` is greater than `n`, which would result in incorrect calculations or potentially an error, as the factorial of a negative number is not defined. Therefore, the function should ideally check if `r` is less than or equal to `n` before performing the calculation.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14(x, y):
    if x % y == 0:
        return x // y
    else:
        return x // y + 1
''' 

 Output decription for function14:  The function accepts a positive integer `x` representing the number of universities and a list `y` of tuples. It returns `x` divided by the length of `y` if `x` is divisible by the length of `y`; otherwise, it returns `x` divided by the length of `y` plus 1. There is a potential error in the code as it uses `y` instead of `len(y)` in the division, which may lead to a TypeError if `y` is not an integer. The code does not handle cases where `y` is empty, which could also lead to a ZeroDivisionError.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15(x, y, p):
    res = 1
    x %= p
    while y > 0:
        if y & 1:
            res = res * x % p
        y = y >> 1
        x = x * x % p
    return res
''' 

 Output decription for function15:  The function accepts three positive integer parameters `x`, `y`, and `p`, where `y` is less than or equal to `p`. It calculates the result of `(x^y) % p` using exponentiation by squaring. The function returns this computed value, which can be different from 1 depending on the values of `x`, `y`, and `p`. The function correctly handles the case where `y` is greater than 0 and performs calculations based on the binary representation of `y`. If `y` is 0, the result will always be 1 % p, which is 1.
Function number 16 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_16(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
''' 

 Output decription for function16:  The function accepts an integer `x` (representing the number of universities, constrained to 1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) and a list `y` of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers. The function computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and the values in the first tuple of `y`, repeatedly updating `x` with the modulo of `x` by the elements of `y`, until `y` is empty. It then returns the last computed value of `x`. However, as the code currently stands, it lacks handling for the actual elements within the tuples of `y`, and thus, the function will not perform as expected with the provided input structure.
Function number 17 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_17(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i = i + 6
    return True
''' 

 Output decription for function17:  The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of universities and returns False if `n` is less than or equal to 1, or if `n` is greater than 3 and divisible by either 2 or 3. It returns True if `n` is greater than 3 and not divisible by 2 or 3, or if `n` is 2 or 3. The function also checks for primality for numbers greater than 3 using a trial division method, returning True if `n` is prime and False if it is not.
Function number 18 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_18():
    sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
    sys.stdout = open('output.txt', 'w')
''' 

 Output decription for function18:  The function `func_18` reads input from a file named 'input.txt', where it is expected to process multiple queries regarding donation amounts and coin denominations. However, the function does not perform any computation or return any results related to those queries; it merely redirects standard input and output. Therefore, it lacks the implementation to handle the actual logic of processing the donation amounts (`ni`) and coin denominations (`li`, `ri`). As a result, while it sets up the environment for input/output, it does not provide any meaningful output or return values based on the queries, rendering it incomplete in terms of functionality.
Function number 19 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_19():
    for _ in range(func_1()):
        (n, l, r) = func_3()
        low = 1
        high = 1000000000
        f = 0
        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            x = l * mid
            y = r * mid
            if x <= n and n <= y:
                f = 1
                break
            if y < n:
                low = mid + 1

        if f:
            func_20('Yes')
        else:
            func_20('No')
''' 

 Output decription for function19:  The function processes a number of queries defined by a positive integer `t`, where for each query it checks if there exists an integer `mid` such that `l * mid <= n <= r * mid`. If such a `mid` exists, it returns 'Yes'; otherwise, it returns 'No'. The function does not accept any parameters and relies on the values retrieved from other functions (`func_1` and `func_3`) for its operations. It may be subject to edge cases based on the values of `n`, `l`, and `r`, including scenarios where `n` is outside the bounds defined by `l` and `r`.

First I want you to try to see if the program (including all the functions) does what the description says. Look at only the code and the description and make an initial assesment.Try to think of any edge cases that the code might not be handling.

Then I want you to see if the output hints agree with the code. Sometimes the output hints hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the output hints says are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to make a more informed decision and detrmine if the code is correct or not.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code.
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
