To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we first need to analyze the requirements and the associated code.

**Problem Description Summary**:  
Alexey wants to know if he can gather exactly `ni` berubleys using coins of denominations ranging from `li` to `ri`. The function should return "Yes" if it's possible and "No" otherwise.

**Functions Overview**:
1. **func_1**: Reads the number of universities `t`.
2. **func_2**: Reads input without validation.
3. **func_3**: Reads and returns a list of integers from a single input string.
4. **func_4**: Similar to func_3, but returns strings instead.
5. **func_19**: Main logic function that checks if it is possible to gather `ni` berubleys using coins in the range `[li, ri]`.

**Key Logic in `func_19`**:
- The core logic of determining if `ni` can be formed using coin denominations between `li` and `ri` is implemented through a binary search on the multiplier `mid`. 
- The logic checks if there exists a `mid` such that `l * mid <= n <= r * mid`.

**Output Hints**:
The output hints suggest that the function checks for valid combinations of coins and provides the correct output based on whether the donation can be paid.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **When `li` equals `ri`**: If `li` equals `ri`, then Alexey can only use coins of a single denomination. If this denomination does not evenly divide `ni`, then the answer should be "No".
2. **When `ni` is less than `li`**: In this case, it's impossible to make the donation since the smallest coin is larger than the target amount.
3. **Large Values**: The ranges for `ni`, `li`, and `ri` can go up to `1e9`. The logic should still hold for these large values.

### Code Analysis:
The function `func_19` appears to implement the logic correctly for determining if a combination of coins can yield the required sum. However, it does not explicitly check if `ni` is less than `li` or if `li` equals `ri` to handle the cases where the only coin available cannot form `ni`.

### Conclusion:
The output hints accurately reflect the expected behavior of the code, but an edge case was identified where the logic does not explicitly check if `ni` is less than `li` or if `ni` can be formed using a single denomination when `li` equals `ri`. This indicates that there might be cases where the program fails to provide the correct answer.

Thus, the final determination is:
Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails for cases where `ni` is less than `li` or when there is only one denomination available (`li` equals `ri`) and `ni` is not a multiple of that denomination.
