To determine the correctness of the provided code against the problem description, let's analyze the requirements and the code's functionality.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires determining if Alexey can pay exactly `ni` berubleys using coins of denominations between `li` and `ri`. The critical aspect here is to check if there exists an integer `k` such that `li * k <= ni <= ri * k`, where `k` is a positive integer.

### Code Analysis
The relevant function for solving the core requirement is `func_19`, which processes the input and checks the specified condition using a binary search approach.

1. **Input Parsing**: The function retrieves the number of universities and their respective `ni`, `li`, and `ri` values using other functions (`func_1` and `func_3`).
  
2. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The function initializes `low` to 1 and `high` to 1,000,000,000.
   - It performs a binary search to find a valid `mid` such that `l * mid <= n <= r * mid`.
   - If such a `mid` is found, it sets a flag (`f`) to indicate success.

3. **Output**: Based on the flag `f`, it prints 'Yes' or 'No'.

### Edge Cases and Missing Logic
- The code does not directly handle cases where `ni` is less than `li` or greater than `ri` in a straightforward manner. For instance:
  - If `ni < li`, the answer should be 'No'.
  - If `ni > ri`, the answer should also be 'No'.

### Example Test Cases
Let's analyze some edge cases based on the problem description and examples provided:

1. **Example**: For `ni = 5`, `li = 2`, and `ri = 3`:
   - Possible coins: `2` and `3`.
   - Can use one `2` and one `3` to make `5`. Expected output: `Yes`.

2. **Example**: For `ni = 6`, `li = 4`, and `ri = 5`:
   - Possible coins: `4` and `5`.
   - Cannot form `6` with any combination of `4` and `5`. Expected output: `No`.

3. **Edge Case**: For `ni = 1`, `li = 2`, `ri = 3`:
   - Here `ni` is less than `li`. The expected output should be `No`, but the code may not handle this case directly.

### Conclusion
Due to the setup of the code, it fails to provide a comprehensive solution for all potential edge cases, particularly when `ni` is less than `li` or greater than `ri`. Hence, there are scenarios where the code will not give the correct output according to the problem description.

Therefore, the final assessment is:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not correctly handle cases where `ni` is less than `li` or greater than `ri`, leading to incorrect results in those scenarios.
