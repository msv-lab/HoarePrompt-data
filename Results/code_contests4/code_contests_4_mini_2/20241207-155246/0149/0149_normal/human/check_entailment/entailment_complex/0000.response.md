Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the solution as described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an even integer `n` (the size of the chessboard) and a list of distinct integers `p` (the positions of the chess pieces). This aligns with the problem description where `n` is guaranteed to be even and the positions are within the range.

2. **Position Adjustment**: The program adjusts the positions of the chess pieces from a 1-based index to a 0-based index by subtracting 1 from each position. This is essential for correct calculations in Python, which uses 0-based indexing.

3. **Movement Calculation**:
    - The program calculates two different sums:
        - `even`: This sum represents the total number of moves required to arrange all pieces to even indexed positions (0, 2, 4, ..., n-2).
        - `odd`: This sum represents the total number of moves required to arrange all pieces to odd indexed positions (1, 3, 5, ..., n-1).
    - The calculations are done using the absolute difference between the target positions and the current positions, which correctly reflects the number of moves needed for each piece to reach the desired target location.

4. **Optimal Moves**: The program then prints the minimum of the two sums, which effectively gives the least total movement required to rearrange the chess pieces to either all even or all odd positions. This meets the requirement of the problem to find the minimum number of moves to place all pieces in cells of the same color.

5. **Efficiency**: The algorithm runs in O(n) time complexity, which is efficient given the constraints (n can be at most 100).

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem as specified, and it handles all potential input cases as required. Thus, it meets the problem description fully.
