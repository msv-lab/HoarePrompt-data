To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step according to the requirements.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. We have a chessboard of size 1 Ã— n (n is even).
2. The chessboard is painted alternately with 'B' (black) and 'W' (white).
3. Pieces are placed on some of the cells, and the goal is to move all pieces to cells of the same color (either all to black or all to white) using the minimum number of moves.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads an integer `n` and a list `p` of positions where chess pieces are currently located.
2. **Position Adjustment**: The positions in `p` are adjusted to be zero-indexed (subtracting 1 from each position).
3. **Movement Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total number of moves required to move all pieces to even indexed positions (black cells).
   - It also calculates the total number of moves required to move all pieces to odd indexed positions (white cells).
4. **Output**: It prints the minimum of the two calculated move totals (`even` and `odd`).

### Key Considerations:
- The chessboard positions can be represented as follows:
  - Black positions: 0, 2, 4, ..., n-2 (even indices)
  - White positions: 1, 3, 5, ..., n-1 (odd indices)
- The calculation for `even` and `odd` uses the formula `abs(i * 2 - p[i])` for black and `abs(i * 2 + 1 - p[i])` for white. This correctly corresponds to the target positions for each color.

### Correctness Check:
1. **Even and Odd Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the required moves to align all pieces to either all black or all white positions.
2. **Distinct Positions Handling**: The given constraint ensures that all initial positions are distinct, which means the calculation logic will not run into issues of overlapping positions when calculating moves.
3. **Output**: The output is the minimum of the two calculated moves, which meets the requirement of finding the minimum moves needed.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly follows the problem description and handles all possible cases as outlined. It accurately computes the minimum number of moves required to align all chess pieces to either all black or all white cells.

Therefore, the final conclusion about the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
