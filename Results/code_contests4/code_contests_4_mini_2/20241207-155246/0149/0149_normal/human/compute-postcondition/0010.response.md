According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the expression `n / 2`. The loop will execute while `i` is less than `n / 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n / 2`. 

Since `i` is currently 1, we need to determine the condition for executing the loop one more time. This means `i` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration, making `i` equal to 2.

So for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 4, because that would mean `n / 2` is greater than 2. 

State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 4**
