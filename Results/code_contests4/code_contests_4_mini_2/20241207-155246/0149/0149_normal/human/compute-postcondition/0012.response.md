To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we analyze the impact step by step.

1. The variable `i` is currently 2.
2. The operation performed is `odd += abs(i * 2 + 1 - p[i])`.
3. The expression `i * 2 + 1` calculates to `2 * 2 + 1`, which equals `5`.
4. The variable `p[i]` refers to an element in the list `p` at index `i`, which is `p[2]`.
5. The absolute value function `abs()` will compute the difference between `5` and `p[2]`.
6. The result of `abs(5 - p[2])` will then be added to the existing value of `odd`.

Since we don't have the value of `p[2]` or the current value of `odd`, we cannot specify exact numeric outcomes. However, we can indicate that the operation involves updating `odd` based on the computed absolute difference.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`odd` is updated by adding the value `abs(5 - p[2])`**
