The value of `odd` is increased by `abs(i * 2 + 1 - p[i])`. The variable `i` is currently 1, so we need to calculate `abs(1 * 2 + 1 - p[1])`, which simplifies to `abs(2 + 1 - p[1])` or `abs(3 - p[1])`. The specific value of `p[1]` is not provided, but we know that `n` is an input integer between 2 and 100.

Since `odd` is being modified, the previous value of `odd` is not specified. Therefore, the output state reflects the changes made to the variables and the calculation involving `p[1]`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 100; `i` is 1; `even` is increased by `abs(2 - p[1]); odd is increased by abs(3 - p[1])**.
