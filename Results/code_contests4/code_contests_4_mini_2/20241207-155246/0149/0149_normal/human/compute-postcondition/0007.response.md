According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the calculated value of `n / 2`. Since `i` is currently 0 and `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, the loop can execute for `i` values starting from 0 up to `n / 2 - 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` will be 1. 

The condition for the loop to execute a second time is that `i` must be less than `n / 2`. Since `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `n / 2` will be a value between 1 and 50. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `n / 2` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 100; `i` is 1; for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 2**
