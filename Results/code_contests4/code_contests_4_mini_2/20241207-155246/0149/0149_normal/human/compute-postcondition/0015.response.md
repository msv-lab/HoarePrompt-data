The function `func` does not accept any parameters. After executing the function body, it processes the variable `n`, which is an even integer constrained by 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a variable `positions`, which is a list of distinct integers constrained by (1 ≤ pi ≤ n) representing the initial positions of the chess pieces. The function returns a value based on these constraints and relationships. 

However, without specific output cases or return points provided, we cannot fully describe the functionality. 

Therefore, based on the provided information, the functionality of the function func is to process an even integer `n` within the range of 2 to 100 and a list `positions` of distinct integers within the range of 1 to n, and return a result based on these parameters. 

Functionality: **The function processes an even integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of distinct integers positions (1 ≤ pi ≤ n) representing chess piece positions, returning a result based on these inputs.**
