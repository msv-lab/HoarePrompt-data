To analyze the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we first note the following:

1. The loop runs `n / 2` times. This means:
   - If `n` is even, the loop runs `n / 2` times.
   - If `n` is odd, the loop still runs `n // 2` times (integer division).

2. Inside the loop:
   - `even` is updated by adding `abs(i * 2 - p[i])`.
   - `odd` is updated by adding `abs(i * 2 + 1 - p[i])`.

After all iterations of the loop have finished executing:
- The final value of `even` will be the sum of all the contributions from each iteration where `i` varies from `0` to `n // 2 - 1`.
- The final value of `odd` will similarly be the sum of its contributions.

Given that `p` is a list of distinct integers each in the range from `1` to `n`, we can summarize that after executing the loop for all relevant iterations:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 100; `even` is the sum of `abs(i * 2 - p[i])` for `i` from 0 to `n // 2 - 1`; `odd` is the sum of `abs(i * 2 + 1 - p[i])` for `i` from 0 to `n // 2 - 1; `p` is a list of distinct integers (1 ≤ `pi` ≤ `n`).**
