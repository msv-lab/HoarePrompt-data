The list `p` is reassigned to a new list where each element is calculated as `(pi - 1)` for every element `pi` in the original list `p`. Since `p` contains integers created from the input, each element will be decreased by 1. The values of `n` and `positions` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the updated list `p` based on the transformations applied to its elements.

Output State: **`n` is assigned the value of an input integer between 2 and 100; `positions` remains unchanged as a list of distinct integers (1 ≤ `pi` ≤ `n`); `p` is updated to [(pi - 1) for pi in p]**
