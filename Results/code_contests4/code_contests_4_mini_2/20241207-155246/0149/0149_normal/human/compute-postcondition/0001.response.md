The variable `p` is assigned the value of a list created from the input line read from standard input. The `sys.stdin.readline().strip().split(' ')` reads a line of input, removes any leading or trailing whitespace, and splits the line into a list of strings based on spaces. The `map(int, ...)` then converts each string in that list to an integer. The variable `positions` remains unchanged, and `n` is still an input integer between 2 and 100.

Given that `positions` remains unchanged and `p` is initialized as a list of integers, the output state reflects the new assignment to `p`.

Output State: **`n` is assigned the value of an input integer between 2 and 100; `positions` remains unchanged as a list of distinct integers (1 â‰¤ `pi` â‰¤ `n`); `p` is a list of integers created from the input.**
