To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step-by-step.

### Problem Description:
We need to find the maximum number of positive common divisors of two integers A and B such that any two of the chosen divisors are coprime.

### Provided Program:
```python
input = raw_input

def func_1(n):
    if n == 1:
        return True
    for k in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % k == 0:
            return False
    return True

(A, B) = map(int, input().split(' '))
a = []
for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(A)) + 1):
    if A % i == 0:
        a.append(i)
        if i != A / i:
            a.append(A / i)

b = []
for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(B)) + 1):
    if B % i == 0:
        b.append(i)
        if i != B / i:
            b.append(B / i)

c = 0
for i in a:
    if i in b and func_1(i):
        c += 1

print(c)
```

### Key Points in the Code Analysis:
1. **Finding Divisors**: The code correctly finds all divisors of A and B by iterating from 1 to the square root of each number and checking if the current number divides A or B.

2. **Common Divisors**: The program checks for common divisors of A and B and stores them.

3. **Coprime Check**: The function `func_1` checks if a number is prime (which is not the same as checking for coprimeness). The requirement is that chosen divisors must be coprime, not necessarily prime.

4. **Counting Valid Divisors**: The program counts each common divisor that is prime, but this does not correctly implement the requirement of choosing coprime divisors. For example, if the common divisors include non-prime numbers that are not coprime, they would not be counted correctly.

### Counterexample:
Consider the inputs `A = 6` and `B = 15`. The common divisors are `1` and `3`. The chosen set should be `{1, 3}` which are coprime. However, if we take `A = 30` and `B = 45`, the common divisors are `1`, `3`, `5`, `15`. The maximum coprime set would only be `{1, 3, 5}`, and thus the count should be `3`, but the code checks for primality instead, which would miscount the valid coprime selections.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to correctly identify the maximum number of positive common divisors that can be chosen such that they are coprime, as it mistakenly checks for primality rather than coprimeness.

Correctness: **False**.
