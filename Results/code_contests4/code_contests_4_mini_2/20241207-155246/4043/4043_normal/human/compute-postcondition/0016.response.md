Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns True if `n` is a prime number by checking divisibility up to the square root of `n`. It returns False if `n` is 1 or if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. The function correctly identifies 1 as not prime and does not handle the case of negative integers or zero, as it assumes `n` is always a positive integer between 1 and \(10^{12}\). **
