According to the code, the loop continues to execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(n))`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3 and `n` is greater than or equal to 4, ensuring that `int(math.sqrt(n))` will also be at least 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `k` will become 4. We need to ensure that `k` is still less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(n))` for the loop to execute again. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `int(math.sqrt(n))` will be at least 2, and in this case, it could be greater than 4 depending on the exact value of `n`.

State: **`A` and `B` are positive integers, `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `k` is 4, and for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be such that `int(math.sqrt(n))` is greater than or equal to 4.**
