#State of the program right berfore the function call: A and B are positive integers such that 1 <= A, B <= 10^12.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 1) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *A and B are positive integers such that 1 <= A, B <= 10^12, and n is not equal to 1
    for k in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % k == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `A` and `B` are positive integers, `n` is greater than or equal to 4, and `k` is greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to `sqrt(n)`. If the loop completes without returning False, `n` is confirmed to be a prime number.
    return True
    #The program returns True, confirming that n is a prime number since the loop completed without returning False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns True if `n` is a prime number by checking divisibility up to the square root of `n`. It returns False if `n` is 1 or if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. The function correctly identifies 1 as not prime and does not handle the case of negative integers or zero, as it assumes `n` is always a positive integer between 1 and \(10^{12}\).
