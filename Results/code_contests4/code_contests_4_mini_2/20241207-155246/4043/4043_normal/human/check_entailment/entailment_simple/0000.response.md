Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. The problem description asks for a function that determines the maximum number of coprime common divisors of two positive integers A and B. However, the annotated program only checks if a single integer `n` is prime or not, returning `True` if it is prime and `False` otherwise.

Here are the reasons why the program does not meet the requirements:

1. **Scope of Functionality**: The problem requires finding common divisors of two integers A and B and determining how many of them can be chosen to be coprime. The program, however, does not take A and B as inputs at all; it only checks a single integer `n`.

2. **Missing Logic for Coprime Divisors**: Even if the function were to take two integers A and B, the logic to find common divisors and then determine which of those can be coprime is not present in the function. The program lacks any loops or checks to find common divisors of both integers.

3. **No Output for Required Result**: The problem specifies that the output should be the maximum number of coprime common divisors. The program, as it stands, does not output any count or result related to this requirement.

In summary, the annotated program is not designed to solve the problem as described. It fails to consider the necessary calculations and logic required to find coprime common divisors of two integers, making it incorrect.
