To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the code thoroughly.

### Problem Overview:
The task is to find the maximum number of positive common divisors of two integers A and B, such that any two chosen divisors are coprime.

### Code Analysis:
1. The code first calculates all divisors of A and B.
2. It then checks which divisors are common between A and B.
3. The function `func_1` is called to determine if a divisor is prime, which is a necessary condition for the divisor to be coprime with others.
4. Finally, it counts how many common divisors are prime and prints that count.

### Key Observations:
- The function `func_1` identifies prime numbers but incorrectly treats 1 as a prime, which is not accurate since prime numbers are defined as greater than 1.
- The count of common divisors is only based on prime divisors, which may not yield the maximum number of coprime divisors since the problem does not specify that only prime divisors can be chosen.
- The program does not account for pairs of coprime divisors when they are not prime. For example, if both 2 and 4 are common divisors, they are not coprime but could be counted together if the logic allowed it.

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints describe the behavior of the function `func_1`, stating that it correctly identifies prime numbers. However, they also mention that it does not handle the case of negative integers or zero, which is irrelevant here since the constraints specify that A and B are positive integers.

### Edge Cases:
- Consider A = 12 and B = 18:
  - Common divisors: 1, 2, 3, 6.
  - The maximum set of coprime common divisors could include 1, 2, and 3, totaling 3 (which the program correctly identifies).
- However, if A = 30 and B = 42:
  - Common divisors: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 30.
  - The program only counts prime common divisors, which misses the opportunity to consider other coprime combinations like 6 and 14.

### Conclusion:
The code does not adhere to the problem description as it fails to correctly count all coprime combinations of common divisors, focusing only on primes. Therefore, it does not fulfill the requirement of maximizing the count of coprime common divisors.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program incorrectly assumes that only prime common divisors can be counted, which does not align with the requirement to maximize the selection of coprime divisors.
