Correctness: **False**

The provided annotated program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. The problem requires a function that determines the maximum number of coprime common divisors of two integers A and B. However, the annotated program only checks if a single integer `n` is prime or not. 

Here are the key reasons why the program is incorrect:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is designed to check for primality of a single integer, rather than calculating the maximum number of coprime common divisors of two integers A and B, as required by the problem description.

2. **Lack of Input Handling**: The problem description specifies that the input consists of two integers A and B, but the function `func_1` only takes a single integer `n`. There is no mechanism in the provided code to handle two inputs or to calculate their common divisors.

3. **Missing Logic for Common Divisors**: The annotated program does not implement any logic to find common divisors of A and B or to check their coprimality. The task described in the problem involves finding common divisors of two numbers and ensuring that any selected divisors are coprime, which is not addressed by the current implementation.

4. **Output Requirement**: The expected output according to the problem description is the maximum number of coprime common divisors, but the function only returns a Boolean value indicating whether a single number is prime.

In summary, the annotated program does not align with the requirements set forth in the problem description. It fails to solve the problem of counting coprime common divisors of two integers, thus making it incorrect.
