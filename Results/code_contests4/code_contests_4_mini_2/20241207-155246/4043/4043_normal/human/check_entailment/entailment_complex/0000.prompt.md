You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Given are positive integers A and B.

Let us choose some number of positive common divisors of A and B.

Here, any two of the chosen divisors must be coprime.

At most, how many divisors can we choose?

Definition of common divisor

An integer d is said to be a common divisor of integers x and y when d divides both x and y.

Definition of being coprime

Integers x and y are said to be coprime when x and y have no positive common divisors other than 1.

Definition of dividing

An integer x is said to divide another integer y when there exists an integer \alpha such that y = \alpha x.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 1 \leq A, B \leq 10^{12}

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: A and B are positive integers such that 1 <= A, B <= 10^12.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 1) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *A and B are positive integers such that 1 <= A, B <= 10^12, and n is not equal to 1
    for k in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % k == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `A` and `B` are positive integers, `n` is greater than or equal to 4, and `k` is greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to `sqrt(n)`. If the loop completes without returning False, `n` is confirmed to be a prime number.
    return True
    #The program returns True, confirming that n is a prime number since the loop completed without returning False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns True if `n` is a prime number by checking divisibility up to the square root of `n`. It returns False if `n` is 1 or if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. The function correctly identifies 1 as not prime and does not handle the case of negative integers or zero, as it assumes `n` is always a positive integer between 1 and \(10^{12}\).
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
