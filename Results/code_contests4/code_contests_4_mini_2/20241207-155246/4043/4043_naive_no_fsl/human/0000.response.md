To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the logic based on the problem description and the provided code.

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find the maximum number of coprime common divisors of two integers A and B. A common divisor is a number that divides both A and B, and coprime numbers are those that share no common divisors other than 1.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` checks if a number `n` is prime.
   - The code collects all divisors of A and B.
   - It checks which common divisors are prime (using `func_1`) and counts them.

3. **Issues with the Code**:
   - The program only counts prime common divisors. However, the problem requests the maximum number of coprime common divisors, which doesn't limit the divisor choice to just primes. For example, for A = 12 and B = 18, the common divisors are 1, 2, 3, 6, and 9. The maximum set of coprime common divisors could be {1, 2, 3}, which totals to 3, but the program only counts the prime divisors (2 and 3 in this case), which results in an incorrect count.
   - The logic fails to consider combinations of common divisors that fulfill the coprimeness condition as required by the problem.

4. **Counterexample**:
   - For input `A = 12` and `B = 18`, the common divisors are 1, 2, 3, 6. The correct maximum number of coprime common divisors is 3 (e.g., {1, 2, 3}). However, the current implementation would only count 2 and 3, which would return 2 instead of the correct answer.

Based on this analysis, we conclude that the program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
