The function accepts a tuple `result` where the first element is a boolean indicating whether a certain condition is met, and the second element is an iterable (likely a list) containing elements to be printed. If the boolean is true, it prints 'YES' followed by all elements in the iterable. If the boolean is false, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any values or compute combinations of weights as suggested by the annotations.
