The function accepts a string `seq` representing weight availability (composed of '0's and '1's) and a list of positive integers `weights`. If `seq` is non-empty, it calculates the absolute difference between the sums of weights indicated by even and odd indices of `seq` and returns a list of weights that are greater than this difference and not equal to the last character of `seq`. If `seq` is empty or consists entirely of '0's, it returns the `weights` list unchanged.
