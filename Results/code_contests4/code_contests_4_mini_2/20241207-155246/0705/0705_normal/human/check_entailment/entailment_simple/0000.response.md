Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements laid out in the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Weight Placement Logic**: The program does not ensure that the weights placed on the scales alternate between the left and right pans in a manner that satisfies the condition of having one pan outweigh the other. Although there are functions that seem to handle weight selection, there is no clear implementation that guarantees that the weights will be placed alternately and that the left pan will always outweigh the right pan after each placement.

2. **Consecutive Weights Rule**: The program does not adequately enforce the rule that consecutive weights cannot be the same. While there is an attempt to check if the current weight is the same as the last one, the logic for maintaining the sequence and ensuring alternation is not robust.

3. **Handling of Input**: The program appears to misinterpret the input and does not accurately reflect the logic needed to determine if it is possible to select `m` weights under the given constraints. Specifically, functions like `func_2` and `func_3` seem to be designed to check conditions but do not effectively lead to a solution that adheres to the problem requirements.

4. **Output Requirements**: The output format as described in the problem (i.e., "YES" or "NO" followed by the weights if the answer is "YES") is not guaranteed to be produced correctly based on the current logic.

Due to these deficiencies, the program fails to meet the requirements set out in the problem description for all possible inputs. Therefore, it cannot be considered correct.
