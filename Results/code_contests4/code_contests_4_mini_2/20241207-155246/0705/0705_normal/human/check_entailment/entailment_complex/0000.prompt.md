You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Xenia has a set of weights and pan scales. Each weight has an integer weight from 1 to 10 kilos. Xenia is going to play with scales and weights a little. For this, she puts weights on the scalepans, one by one. The first weight goes on the left scalepan, the second weight goes on the right scalepan, the third one goes on the left scalepan, the fourth one goes on the right scalepan and so on. Xenia wants to put the total of m weights on the scalepans.

Simply putting weights on the scales is not interesting, so Xenia has set some rules. First, she does not put on the scales two consecutive weights of the same weight. That is, the weight that goes i-th should be different from the (i + 1)-th weight for any i (1 ≤ i < m). Second, every time Xenia puts a weight on some scalepan, she wants this scalepan to outweigh the other one. That is, the sum of the weights on the corresponding scalepan must be strictly greater than the sum on the other pan.

You are given all types of weights available for Xenia. You can assume that the girl has an infinite number of weights of each specified type. Your task is to help Xenia lay m weights on ​​the scales or to say that it can't be done.

Input

The first line contains a string consisting of exactly ten zeroes and ones: the i-th (i ≥ 1) character in the line equals "1" if Xenia has i kilo weights, otherwise the character equals "0". The second line contains integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000).

Output

In the first line print "YES", if there is a way to put m weights on the scales by all rules. Otherwise, print in the first line "NO". If you can put m weights on the scales, then print in the next line m integers — the weights' weights in the order you put them on the scales.

If there are multiple solutions, you can print any of them.

Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The first input is a string of exactly ten characters consisting of '0's and '1's, indicating the availability of weights from 1 to 10 kilos, and the second input is an integer m such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000.
def func_1(result):
    if result[0] :
        print('YES')
        for i in result[1]:
            print(i),
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: The input string is a string of exactly ten characters consisting of '0's and '1's, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 1000, `result[0]` is true, `result[1]` is an iterable containing all the elements that were in `result[1]`, and every element in `result[1]` has been printed.
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *The first input is a string of exactly ten characters consisting of '0's and '1's indicating the availability of weights from 1 to 10 kilos, and the second input is an integer m such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000. If `result[0]` is true, then `result[1]` contains all the elements that were in `result[1]`, and every element in `result[1]` has been printed. If `result[0]` is false, "NO" is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `result` where the first element is a boolean indicating whether a certain condition is met, and the second element is an iterable (likely a list) containing elements to be printed. If the boolean is true, it prints 'YES' followed by all elements in the iterable. If the boolean is false, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any values or compute combinations of weights as suggested by the annotations.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a string of exactly ten characters consisting of '0's and '1's, where the i-th character indicates the availability of i-kilo weights; w is an integer representing the number of weights to be placed (1 ≤ w ≤ 1000).
def func_2(l, w, m):
    if (len(l) == m) :
        return True, l
        #The program returns True and the string 'l' of exactly ten characters consisting of '0's and '1's, indicating the availability of i-kilo weights.
    else :
        i = 0
        for i in func_3(l, w):
            tmp = func_2(l + [i], w, m)
            
            if tmp[0]:
                return True, tmp[1]
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `l` is a string of exactly ten characters consisting of '0's and '1's; `w` is an integer (1 ≤ w ≤ 1000); `i` is in the range from 0 to 9; `tmp` is assigned the value returned by `func_2(l + [i], w, m)` during the last iteration, and the first element of `tmp` may be either True or False. If the loop executes with all values of `i` from 0 to 9, the function will return True with the second element of the result from `func_2(l + [i], w, m)` if any `tmp[0]` is True; otherwise, it may return None.
        return False,
        #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `l` of exactly ten characters consisting of '0's and '1's, an integer `w` between 1 and 1000, and an integer `m`. It returns True and the string `l` if the length of `l` is equal to `m`. Otherwise, it attempts to recursively call itself with modified parameters, and if any of those calls return True, it propagates that result back. If none of the recursive calls return True, it returns False. The function does not handle cases where `m` is greater than 10 or less than 1, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: seq is a string of length 10 consisting of '0's and '1's, where each character indicates the availability of weights from 1 to 10 kilos; weights is a positive integer m such that 1 <= m <= 1000.
def func_3(seq, weights):
    if seq :
        tmp = abs(sum(seq[0::2]) - sum(seq[1::2]))
        result = [i for i in weights if i > tmp and i != seq[-1]]
        return result
        #The program returns an empty list 'result'
    else :
        return weights
        #The program returns the positive integer m, which represents the total weight available considering the string `seq` is empty or consists entirely of '0's, indicating no weights are available. Therefore, the output is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `seq` representing weight availability (composed of '0's and '1's) and a list of positive integers `weights`. If `seq` is non-empty, it calculates the absolute difference between the sums of weights indicated by even and odd indices of `seq` and returns a list of weights that are greater than this difference and not equal to the last character of `seq`. If `seq` is empty or consists entirely of '0's, it returns the `weights` list unchanged.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: w is a string consisting of exactly ten characters, each being either '0' or '1', indicating the availability of weights from 1 to 10 kilos, followed by an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) representing the total number of weights to be placed on the scales.
def func_4(w):
    result = []
    for i in range(1, len(w) + 1):
        if w[i - 1] == '1':
            result.append(i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `w` is a string consisting of exactly ten characters, `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), `result` is a list containing the integers from 1 to 10 that correspond to the indices of '1's in the string `w`.
    return result
    #The program returns the list 'result' containing the indices of '1's in the string 'w', with each index corresponding to the positions of '1's in the 10-character string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `w` consisting of exactly ten characters, each being '0' or '1'. It returns a list of integers representing the positions (1-indexed) of the characters that are '1' in the string. If there are no '1's in the string, the function returns an empty list.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
