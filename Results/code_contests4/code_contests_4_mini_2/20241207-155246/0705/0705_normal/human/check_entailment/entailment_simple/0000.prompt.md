You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Xenia has a set of weights and pan scales. Each weight has an integer weight from 1 to 10 kilos. Xenia is going to play with scales and weights a little. For this, she puts weights on the scalepans, one by one. The first weight goes on the left scalepan, the second weight goes on the right scalepan, the third one goes on the left scalepan, the fourth one goes on the right scalepan and so on. Xenia wants to put the total of m weights on the scalepans.

Simply putting weights on the scales is not interesting, so Xenia has set some rules. First, she does not put on the scales two consecutive weights of the same weight. That is, the weight that goes i-th should be different from the (i + 1)-th weight for any i (1 ≤ i < m). Second, every time Xenia puts a weight on some scalepan, she wants this scalepan to outweigh the other one. That is, the sum of the weights on the corresponding scalepan must be strictly greater than the sum on the other pan.

You are given all types of weights available for Xenia. You can assume that the girl has an infinite number of weights of each specified type. Your task is to help Xenia lay m weights on ​​the scales or to say that it can't be done.

Input

The first line contains a string consisting of exactly ten zeroes and ones: the i-th (i ≥ 1) character in the line equals "1" if Xenia has i kilo weights, otherwise the character equals "0". The second line contains integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000).

Output

In the first line print "YES", if there is a way to put m weights on the scales by all rules. Otherwise, print in the first line "NO". If you can put m weights on the scales, then print in the next line m integers — the weights' weights in the order you put them on the scales.

If there are multiple solutions, you can print any of them.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The first input is a string of exactly ten characters consisting of '0's and '1's, indicating the availability of weights from 1 to 10 kilos, and the second input is an integer m such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000.
def func_1(result):
    if result[0] :
        print('YES')
        for i in result[1]:
            print(i),
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: The input string is a string of exactly ten characters consisting of '0's and '1's, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 1000, `result[0]` is true, `result[1]` is an iterable containing all the elements that were in `result[1]`, and every element in `result[1]` has been printed.
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *The first input is a string of exactly ten characters consisting of '0's and '1's indicating the availability of weights from 1 to 10 kilos, and the second input is an integer m such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000. If `result[0]` is true, then `result[1]` contains all the elements that were in `result[1]`, and every element in `result[1]` has been printed. If `result[0]` is false, "NO" is printed.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a string of exactly ten characters consisting of '0's and '1's, where the i-th character indicates the availability of i-kilo weights; w is an integer representing the number of weights to be placed (1 ≤ w ≤ 1000).
def func_2(l, w, m):
    if (len(l) == m) :
        return True, l
        #The program returns True and the string 'l' of exactly ten characters consisting of '0's and '1's, indicating the availability of i-kilo weights.
    else :
        i = 0
        for i in func_3(l, w):
            tmp = func_2(l + [i], w, m)
            
            if tmp[0]:
                return True, tmp[1]
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `l` is a string of exactly ten characters consisting of '0's and '1's; `w` is an integer (1 ≤ w ≤ 1000); `i` is in the range from 0 to 9; `tmp` is assigned the value returned by `func_2(l + [i], w, m)` during the last iteration, and the first element of `tmp` may be either True or False. If the loop executes with all values of `i` from 0 to 9, the function will return True with the second element of the result from `func_2(l + [i], w, m)` if any `tmp[0]` is True; otherwise, it may return None.
        return False,
        #The program returns False

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: seq is a string of length 10 consisting of '0's and '1's, where each character indicates the availability of weights from 1 to 10 kilos; weights is a positive integer m such that 1 <= m <= 1000.
def func_3(seq, weights):
    if seq :
        tmp = abs(sum(seq[0::2]) - sum(seq[1::2]))
        result = [i for i in weights if i > tmp and i != seq[-1]]
        return result
        #The program returns an empty list 'result'
    else :
        return weights
        #The program returns the positive integer m, which represents the total weight available considering the string `seq` is empty or consists entirely of '0's, indicating no weights are available. Therefore, the output is 0.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: w is a string consisting of exactly ten characters, each being either '0' or '1', indicating the availability of weights from 1 to 10 kilos, followed by an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) representing the total number of weights to be placed on the scales.
def func_4(w):
    result = []
    for i in range(1, len(w) + 1):
        if w[i - 1] == '1':
            result.append(i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `w` is a string consisting of exactly ten characters, `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), `result` is a list containing the integers from 1 to 10 that correspond to the indices of '1's in the string `w`.
    return result
    #The program returns the list 'result' containing the indices of '1's in the string 'w', with each index corresponding to the positions of '1's in the 10-character string.

The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
