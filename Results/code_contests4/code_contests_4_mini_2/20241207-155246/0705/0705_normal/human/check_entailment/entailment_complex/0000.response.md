Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements specified in the problem description. Specifically, it fails to ensure that the weights placed on the scales satisfy the condition of being strictly greater on one side compared to the other. 

For example, consider the following input:

```
0000000101
3
```

In this case, Xenia wants to place 3 weights. The only available weights are 8 and 10 kilos. However, valid arrangements such as [8, 10, 8] do not satisfy the required condition that the sum on one scale must be strictly greater than the sum on the other scale after every weight is placed. 

The annotations in the code also suggest that the functions do not properly handle the alternating placement of weights and the cumulative comparison needed to ensure one side outweighs the other. The logic in the functions appears to be incomplete, as they do not account for maintaining the required conditions throughout the process of placing `m` weights.

Thus, the program does not fulfill the problem's requirements for every potential case.
