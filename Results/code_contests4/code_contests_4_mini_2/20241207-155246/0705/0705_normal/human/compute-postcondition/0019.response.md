The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l`, `w`, and `m`. The parameter `l` is a string of exactly ten characters consisting of '0's and '1's, indicating the availability of i-kilo weights. The parameter `w` is an integer representing the number of weights to be placed, constrained to the range 1 ≤ w ≤ 1000. The parameter `m` is unspecified in the constraints. 

The function may return different outputs based on the following cases:

- **Case 1:** The function returns `True` and the string `l` which consists of ten characters of '0's and '1's.
- **Case 2:** The function returns `True` and the second element of `tmp`, which is derived from a previous call of `func_2` where the first element is `True`.
- **Case 3:** The function returns `True` and the second element of the result from `func_2(l + [1], w, m)`.
- **Case 4:** The function returns a tuple containing `True` and the second element of the list returned from `func_2`, where `l` is a string of exactly ten '0's and '1's, `w` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and `m` is set to 2.
- **Case 5:** The function returns `False`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a string `l` of ten characters consisting of '0's and '1's, an integer `w` representing the number of weights, and another parameter `m`, returning various outputs based on the internal conditions defined in the cases above. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters l (a string of ten '0's and '1's), w (an integer between 1 and 1000), and m (unspecified parameter), and returns various outputs based on defined cases, including True with the string l, elements from previous calls, or a tuple, or False.**
