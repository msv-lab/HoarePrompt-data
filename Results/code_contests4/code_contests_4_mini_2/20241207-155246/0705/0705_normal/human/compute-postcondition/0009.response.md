`result` is a list that already contains the integer 2 if `w[1]` equals '1', and `i` is currently 3. The code `result.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 3) to the list `result`. This action modifies the `result` list by adding an additional element to it. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of exactly ten characters, `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), `result` now contains either 2 and 3 if `w[1]` equals '1' or just 3 if it does not, `i` is 3.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of exactly ten characters, `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), `result` now contains either 2 and 3 if `w[1]` equals '1' or just 3 if it does not, `i` is 3**
