Output State: **`l` is a string of exactly ten characters consisting of '0's and '1's; `w` is an integer (1 ≤ w ≤ 1000); `i` is in the range from 0 to 9; `tmp` is assigned the value returned by `func_2(l + [i], w, m)` during the last iteration, and the first element of `tmp` may be either True or False. If the loop executes with all values of `i` from 0 to 9, the function will return True with the second element of the result from `func_2(l + [i], w, m)` if any `tmp[0]` is True; otherwise, it may return None.**
