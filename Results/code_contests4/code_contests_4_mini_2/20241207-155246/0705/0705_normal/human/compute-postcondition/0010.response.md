Postcondition: ***`w` is a string consisting of exactly ten characters, `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), if `w[2]` (which is `w[i - 1]`) equals '1', then `result` contains either 2 and 3; if `w[2]` does not equal '1', then `result` contains just 3. The value of `i` remains 3 throughout the execution.***
