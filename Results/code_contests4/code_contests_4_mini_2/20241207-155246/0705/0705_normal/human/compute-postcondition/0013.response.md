The function `func_4` accepts a parameter `w`. `w` is a string consisting of exactly ten characters, each being either '0' or '1'. After executing the function body, it returns a list `result` containing the indices of '1's in the string `w`, with each index corresponding to the positions of '1's in the 10-character string. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_4` is to accept a string `w` of ten characters representing the availability of weights and return a list of indices where '1's occur in that string. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `w` of exactly ten characters (each '0' or '1') and returns a list of indices corresponding to the positions of '1's in `w`.**
