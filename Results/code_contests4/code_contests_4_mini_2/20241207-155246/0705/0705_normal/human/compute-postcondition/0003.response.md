`result` is a list that is currently empty. The code `result.append(i)` adds the value of `i` (which is 1) to the `result` list. Therefore, after execution, `result` will contain one element: 1. The values of the other variables (`w`, `m`, and `i`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of exactly ten characters, `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), `result` is [1], `i` is 1**
