The code `result.append(i)` appends the current value of `i`, which is 2, to the `result` list. The variable `result`, which was initially empty, will now contain one element, which is 2. The values of `w`, `m`, and `i` remain unchanged by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of exactly ten characters, `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), `result` is now a list containing the integer 2, and `i` is 2.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of exactly ten characters, `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), `result` is now a list containing the integer 2, `i` is 2**
