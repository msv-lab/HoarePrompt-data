Postcondition: ***`cur` is incremented by the number of elements in `ds[nxt]`, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is incremented, `tov` includes all elements from `ds[nxt]` that were previously 0 in `arr`, `len(tov) > 0`, `nxt` is a valid index/key in `ds`, `ds[nxt]` is a non-empty iterable, `el` is the third element in `ds[nxt]`, and if `arr[el]` was previously 0, it is now assigned the value of `cur`, and `el` is added to `tov`. Otherwise, if `arr[el]` was not 0, the values of `cur`, `n`, `i`, `tov`, and `el` remain unchanged.***
