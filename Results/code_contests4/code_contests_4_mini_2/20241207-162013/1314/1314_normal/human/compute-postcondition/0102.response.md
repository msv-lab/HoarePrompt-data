According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the contents of `ds[nxt]`. The loop will continue to iterate over each element in `ds[nxt]`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2, and the loop has processed elements in `ds[nxt]`. 

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `ds[nxt]` must contain at least one more element that has not been processed yet. The variable `el` will take the next value from `ds[nxt]` in the next iteration. 

Thus, I need to adjust the following states:
- `el` should be set to the next element from `ds[nxt]` after the last processed element.
- The condition for the loop to execute again is that `ds[nxt]` must have more elements remaining to be iterated over.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `ds[nxt]` must have at least one more element, and `el` is the next element in `ds[nxt]`.**
