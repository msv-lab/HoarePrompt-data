The code assigns the value of `cur` to the array `arr` at the index specified by `el`. The variable `el` has been incremented to point to the next element in `ds[nxt]`, indicating that it is now referencing the next position in the array `arr`. The initial state indicates that `n` is greater than 2, and `tov` contains all unique elements from `ds[nxt]` plus `el`, but those states do not change with this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2; `tov` contains all unique elements from `ds[nxt]` plus `el`; `el` is incremented to point to the next element in `ds[nxt]`; `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`.**
