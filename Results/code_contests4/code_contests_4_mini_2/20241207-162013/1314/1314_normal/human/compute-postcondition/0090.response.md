The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown. The other variables, `n`, `arr`, `cur`, `tov`, `nxt`, and `ds`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` contains values assigned to `cur` at all indices that were previously 0, `cur` is the next value after the last assigned value, `tov` is empty, `nxt` is not applicable, `ds` has been completely processed for all elements that were in `tov`, and variable `i` is increased by 1.
