The code assigns the value of `cur` to the index `el` of the array `arr`. Since `arr[el]` is updated to `cur`, the previous value of `arr[el]` is overwritten. Other variables (`n`, `tov`, `nxt`, `ds`) remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `arr` has been updated at index `el`, `tov` includes `el`, `nxt` is updated to the last element of `tov`, `ds[nxt]` contains at least 3 elements, `el` is set to the third element in `ds[nxt]`, and `arr[el]` is now equal to `cur`.
