According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the contents of `ds[nxt]`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2, `el` is the next element in `ds[nxt]`, and `ds[nxt]` contains at least 2 elements. Since the loop uses `el` to iterate over the elements in `ds[nxt]`, the next value of `el` will be the next element in the `ds[nxt]` after the current one. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `el` must be updated to the next element in the list `ds[nxt]`. If `ds[nxt]` has at least 2 elements, then after one iteration `el` would change to the next element, and we would need to ensure that `ds[nxt]` still has at least one more element remaining for the loop to continue.

Thus, if the current `el` is the first element in `ds[nxt]`, for the loop to execute a second time, `el` should become the second element and `ds[nxt]` must contain at least 2 elements.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `el` is the next element in `ds[nxt]`, for the loop to execute a second time `ds[nxt]` must contain at least 3 elements, and `el` will be the second element in `ds[nxt]`.**
