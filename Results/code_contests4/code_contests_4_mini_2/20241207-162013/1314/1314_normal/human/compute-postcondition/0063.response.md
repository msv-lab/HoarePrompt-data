According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `ds[nxt]`. If `ds[nxt]` contains at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2, `arr` has been modified such that `arr[el]` is now equal to `cur`, and `tov` has one more element including `el`. This means that `nxt` was assigned the last element of `tov`, which indicates that `tov` has been updated.

For the loop to execute one more time, `ds[nxt]` must contain at least one additional element, and `el` must be updated to the next element in `ds[nxt]`. Therefore, we need to ensure that the state reflects that `el` is now pointing to the next element in `ds[nxt]`.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `arr` contains values assigned to `cur` at indices specified by `tov`, for the loop to execute one more time `ds[nxt]` must contain at least one more element, `el` is updated to the next element in `ds[nxt]`.**
