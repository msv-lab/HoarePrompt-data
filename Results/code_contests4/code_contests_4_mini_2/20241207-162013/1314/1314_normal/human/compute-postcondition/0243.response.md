The code `res.append(str(nxt) + ' ' + str(el))` appends a new string to the list `res`. The string is formed by converting the variable `nxt` to a string and concatenating it with a space and the string representation of `el`. The values of `nxt` and `el` are already defined in the initial state, so we will include their current values in the output. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `nxt` is a valid index for `dmain`, `dmain[nxt]` contains at least one more element to iterate over, `el` is now `next_el`, `el` is added to the set `vis`, `res` contains the string representation of `nxt` and `el` concatenated with a space, and `el` is added to the set `sv`.**
