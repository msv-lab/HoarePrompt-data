The code snippet `tov.add(el)` adds the value of `el` to the set `tov`. The value of `el` is known but is not specified in the initial state. The initial state indicates `n` is greater than 2, but `n` does not affect the operation of adding to the set. The array `arr` has been updated at index `el` with the value of `cur`, but this operation does not influence the `tov` set directly. Therefore, the output state reflects the addition of `el` to the set `tov` without any changes to `n` or `arr`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2; `el` has been added to the set `tov`.**
