The code initializes an empty set `sviaz`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is equal to `n`, `arr` contains values assigned to `cur` at all indices that were previously 0, `cur` is greater than `D`, `tov` is empty, `nxt` is not applicable, `ds` has been completely processed for all elements that were in `tov`, and all elements in `arr` corresponding to reachable indices from the original 0 entries have been assigned the same value of `cur`, and `sviaz` is an empty set.
