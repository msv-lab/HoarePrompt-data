The code `dmain[el].remove(nxt)` removes the element `nxt` from the list or collection at index `el` in the dictionary `dmain`. The previous state indicates that `nxt` is a valid index for `dmain`, and `dmain[nxt]` contains at least one more element to iterate over. Since `el` is now `next_el`, we assume `dmain[el]` is a valid collection that includes `nxt`, allowing its removal. Other variables like `i`, `vis`, `res`, and `sv` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `nxt` is a valid index for `dmain`, `dmain[nxt]` contains at least one more element to iterate over, `el` is now `next_el`, `vis` is updated with `el`, `res` contains the string representation of `nxt` and `el` concatenated with a space, `sv` is updated with `el`, and `nxt` is removed from `dmain[el]`.**
