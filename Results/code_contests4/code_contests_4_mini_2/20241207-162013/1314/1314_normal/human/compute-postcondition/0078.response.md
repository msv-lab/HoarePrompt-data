Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2; `arr` contains values assigned to `cur` at indices specified by `tov`. If `arr[el]` is 0, then `tov` now includes `el`, `nxt` is updated to the last element of `tov`, `ds[nxt]` contains at least 1 element, `el` is set to the first element in `ds[nxt]`, and `arr[el]` is now equal to `cur`.***
