The execution of the code snippet contains the command `exit()`, which immediately terminates the program. This means that no changes occur to the variables, and the program simply stops running. The state of the variables remains the same as in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `D` is an integer, `ds` is a defaultdict with sets containing pairs of integers except when both are 1, `dmain` is a defaultdict with sets containing all pairs of integers, `i` is equal to `m - 1` after the last iteration, and 'NO' is printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `D` is an integer, `ds` is a defaultdict with sets containing pairs of integers except when both are 1, `dmain` is a defaultdict with sets containing all pairs of integers, `i` is equal to `m - 1` after the last iteration, and 'NO' is printed.**
