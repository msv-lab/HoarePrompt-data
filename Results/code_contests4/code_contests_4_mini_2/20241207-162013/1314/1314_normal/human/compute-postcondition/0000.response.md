Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, `m` is an integer representing the number of edges in the graph, `D` is an integer representing the required degree of the first vertex, and the edges are defined by `m` pairs of integers (v_i, u_i). The standard input is redirected to read from a byte stream.**
