The variable `nxt` is assigned the value of the element that is removed from the set `tov` using the `pop()` method. The previous state indicates that `tov` contains the element `i`, so after executing `nxt = tov.pop()`, `nxt` will hold the value of `i`, and `tov` will no longer contain that element. The values of `n`, `arr[i]`, and `cur` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer and is greater than 2; `arr[i]` is assigned the value of `cur`; `cur` is increased by 1; `tov` contained element `i`, and `nxt` is assigned the value `i`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer and is greater than 2; `arr[i]` is assigned the value of `cur`; `cur` is increased by 1; `tov` contained element `i`; `nxt` is assigned the value `i`.**
