According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `ds[nxt]`. The loop iterates over each element in `ds[nxt]`, and since `ds[nxt]` has at least 2 elements, it can execute again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `el` is the second element of `ds[nxt]`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `el` must be updated to the third element of `ds[nxt]`, and the size of `ds[nxt]` must remain at least 3 elements.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `tov` has one more element after adding `el`, `ds[nxt]` has at least 3 elements, `el` is the third element of `ds[nxt]`**
