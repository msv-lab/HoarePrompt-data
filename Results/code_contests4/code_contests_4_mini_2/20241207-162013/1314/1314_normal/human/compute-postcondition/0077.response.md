The `tov` set is modified by adding the element `el` to it. The previous state of `tov` is not specified, but we know it contains indices where `arr` was previously 0. Adding `el` will expand the indices tracked by `tov`. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2; `arr` contains values assigned to `cur` at indices specified by `tov`; `tov` now includes `el`; `nxt` is the last element of `tov`; `ds[nxt]` contains at least 1 element; `el` is the first element in `ds[nxt]`; `arr[el]` is now equal to `cur`.**
