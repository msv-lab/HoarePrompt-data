The value of `arr[el]` is set to `cur`. Since `el` is an index where `arr` was previously 0, after this assignment, `arr[el]` will no longer be 0. The other variables (`n`, `tov`, `nxt`, `ds`, `cur`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2; `arr` contains values assigned to `cur` at indices specified by `tov`; `tov` contains all indices where `arr` was previously 0; `nxt` is the last element of `tov`; `ds[nxt]` contains at least 1 element; `el` is the first element in `ds[nxt]`; `arr[el]` is now equal to `cur`.
