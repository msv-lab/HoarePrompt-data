The value of `nxt` is removed from the list or set `dmain[el]`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `sv`, `vis`, `res`, and `dmain`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is equal to `n`, `nxt` is the last element of `sv` before popping, `dmain[nxt]` contains at least 2 elements, `el` is the next element in `dmain[nxt]`, and `dmain[el]` no longer contains `nxt`.
