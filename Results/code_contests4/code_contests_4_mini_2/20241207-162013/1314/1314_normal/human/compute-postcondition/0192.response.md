Postcondition: ***`cur` is incremented by the total number of elements in `ds[nxt]` that were previously 0 in `arr`; `n` is greater than 2; `i` is incremented by the same number; `tov` includes all elements from `ds[nxt]` that were previously 0 in `arr`, including the element `el`; `len(tov)` is greater than 0; `nxt` remains a valid index/key in `ds`; `el` is the next element in `ds[nxt]`; and `arr[el]` is updated to `cur`, which was previously 0.***
