Postcondition: ***`i` is equal to `n`, `nxt` is the last element of `sv`, `el` is the next element in `dmain[nxt]`, and if `el` is not in `vis`, then `sv` now contains `el`, `vis` now includes `el`, and `res` now includes the new string `str(nxt) + ' ' + str(el)`. If `el` is already in `vis`, no changes are made to `sv`, `vis`, or `res`.***
