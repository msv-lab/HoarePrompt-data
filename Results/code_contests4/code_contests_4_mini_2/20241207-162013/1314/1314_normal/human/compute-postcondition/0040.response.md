According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tov`. If `len(tov)` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `tov` is a set containing the element `i`, which means that `len(tov)` is 1, allowing the loop to execute. Since `tov` contains at least one element, the loop can execute the first time without any adjustments needed.

State: **`n` is an integer and is greater than 2; `arr[i]` is assigned the value of `cur`, `cur` is increased by 1, and `tov` is a set containing the element `i`**
