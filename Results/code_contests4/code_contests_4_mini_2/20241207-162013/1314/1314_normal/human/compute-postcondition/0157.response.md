According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the collection `ds[nxt]`. If `ds[nxt]` has more elements, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `cur` is incremented by 1, `i` is incremented by 1, and `tov` includes `el`. The variable `n` is greater than 2, `len(tov) > 0`, and `nxt` is a valid index/key in `ds`, where `ds[nxt]` is not empty.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to advance `el` to the next element in `ds[nxt]`. If `ds[nxt]` had at least one element at the previous iteration and now has more, then `el` will represent the next element in the iteration. 

Thus, if `el` was the last element in `ds[nxt]` during the last iteration, then for the loop to execute again, `ds[nxt]` must have at least one more element, and `el` should be the next index in that collection.

State: **`cur` is incremented by 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is incremented by 1, `tov` now includes `el`, `len(tov) > 0`, `nxt` is a valid index/key in `ds`, `ds[nxt]` has at least one more element, and `el` is the next valid index/key in `ds[nxt]`**.
