The `tov` variable, which is a set, has the element `el` added to it through the `add` method. The previous state of `tov` contained the element `i`. Since `el` is now added to `tov`, the elements it contains will include `i` and `el`. The values of `n`, `arr`, `cur`, `nxt`, and `ds` remain unchanged by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `arr[i]` is assigned the value of `cur`, `cur` is increased by 1, `tov` now contains elements `i` and `el`, `nxt` is assigned the value `i`, and `ds[nxt]` contains at least 1 element.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `arr[i]` is assigned the value of `cur`, `cur` is increased by 1, `tov` now contains elements `i` and `el`, `nxt` is assigned the value `i`, and `ds[nxt]` contains at least 1 element.**
