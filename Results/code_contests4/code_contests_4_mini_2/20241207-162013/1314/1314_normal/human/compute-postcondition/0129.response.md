According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the value of `nxt` and the contents of `ds[nxt]`. For the loop to execute, `ds[nxt]` must contain at least one element. Additionally, `tov` must still contain at least one element after popping one. Since `n` is greater than 2, it does not directly influence the execution of the loop in this context.

Thus, for the loop to execute the first time, `nxt` must refer to an index in `ds` where the list is not empty. Specifically, `nxt` should point to an element in `tov`, which contains unique elements from `ds`. 

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `tov` contains all unique elements from `ds[nxt]` after popping one element and must still contain at least one element, `nxt` is an element from `tov` such that `ds[nxt]` contains at least one element**.
