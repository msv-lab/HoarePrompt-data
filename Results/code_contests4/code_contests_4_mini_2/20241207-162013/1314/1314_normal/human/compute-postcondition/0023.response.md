The line `ds[f].add(s)` adds the value of `s` to the set associated with the key `f` in the defaultdict `ds`. The previous states of the affected variables are as follows: `ds` is a defaultdict with sets, `f` is an input integer, and `s` is an input integer. This operation modifies the contents of the set `ds[f]` by including `s` in it. Other variables (`n`, `m`, `D`, `i`, and `dmain[f]`) remain unchanged and unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 2, `D` is an integer, `ds` is a defaultdict with sets including `s` in `ds[f]`, `dmain[f]` includes `s`, `i` is 2, `s` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer**.
