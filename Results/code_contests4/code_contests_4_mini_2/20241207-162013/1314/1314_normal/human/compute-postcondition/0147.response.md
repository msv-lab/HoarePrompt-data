The variable `cur` is incremented by 1. The variable `n` is an integer greater than 2, and it is stated that the loop will execute again if `n` is greater than `i` after incrementing `i` by 1. However, the value of `cur` is not provided, so we can only state that it has changed. The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`cur` is incremented by 1; `n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is incremented by 1 for the loop condition.**
