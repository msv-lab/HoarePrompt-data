The `tov` set is updated to include the value `el` by executing the `tov.add(el)` statement. Since `tov` already includes `el`, if `el` is not already present in `tov`, it will now be added. However, the impact on the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `cur` is incremented by 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is incremented by 1, `tov` now includes `el`, `len(tov) > 0`, `nxt` is a valid index/key in `ds`, `ds[nxt]` has at least one more element, and `el` is the next valid index/key in `ds[nxt]`; `arr[el]` is now equal to the new value of `cur`, and `tov` has been updated to include `el`.

Output State: **`cur` is incremented by 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is incremented by 1, `tov` now includes `el`, `len(tov) > 0`, `nxt` is a valid index/key in `ds`, `ds[nxt]` has at least one more element, and `el` is the next valid index/key in `ds[nxt]`; `arr[el]` is now equal to the new value of `cur`, and `tov` has been updated to include `el`.**
