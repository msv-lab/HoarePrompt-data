Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 1, `D` is an integer, `ds` is a defaultdict with sets, `dmain[f]` includes `s`, `i` is 1, and both `s` and `f` are integers from input. If `s` is not equal to 1 and `f` is not equal to 1, then `ds` now contains `f` in the set associated with `s`, `dmain[f]` includes `s`, and `s` is added to the set associated with `f` in `ds`. If either `s` or `f` is equal to 1, no changes are made to `ds` or `dmain`.***
