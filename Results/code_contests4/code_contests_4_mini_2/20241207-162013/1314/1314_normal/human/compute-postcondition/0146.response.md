According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been increased by 1, and `n` is an integer greater than 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. If `i` was initially less than `n` before being incremented, then it must have been `i` is less than `n - 1`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than `i` after incrementing `i` by 1. 

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` is greater than `i` after incrementing `i` by 1**.
