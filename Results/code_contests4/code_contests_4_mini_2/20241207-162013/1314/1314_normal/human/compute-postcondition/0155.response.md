The statement `tov.add(el)` adds the value of `el` to the set `tov`. Since we know that `tov` contains at least the current value of `i` and `len(tov) > 0`, adding `el` to `tov` will change its contents by including `el`, but it does not affect the other variables directly. The state of `cur`, `n`, `i`, and other variables remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `cur` is incremented by 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is incremented by 1, `tov` now includes `el`, `len(tov) > 0`, `nxt` is a valid index/key in `ds`, `ds[nxt]` is not empty, and the element at index `el` in `arr` is updated to `cur`.

Output State: **`cur` is incremented by 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is incremented by 1, `tov` now includes `el`, `len(tov) > 0`, `nxt` is a valid index/key in `ds`, `ds[nxt]` is not empty, and the element at index `el` in `arr` is updated to `cur`.**
