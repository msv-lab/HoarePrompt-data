According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `ds[nxt]` list. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2, `tov` has one more element after adding `el`, `ds[nxt]` has at least 1 element, and `el` is the first element of `ds[nxt]`. To execute the loop one more time, `ds[nxt]` must have at least 2 elements remaining.

Since `el` is currently the first element of `ds[nxt]`, after the next iteration, `el` will take on the value of the second element in `ds[nxt]`, assuming it has at least 2 elements. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `el` will be updated to the second element of `ds[nxt]`, and `ds[nxt]` must have at least 2 elements.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `tov` has one more element after adding `el`, `ds[nxt]` has at least 2 elements, `el` is the second element of `ds[nxt]`, and if `arr[el]` is 0, then `arr[el]` is set to `cur`.**
