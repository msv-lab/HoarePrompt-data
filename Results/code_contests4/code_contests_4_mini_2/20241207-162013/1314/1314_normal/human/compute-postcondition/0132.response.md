The code `tov.add(el)` adds the value of `el` to the set `tov`. Since `tov` is a set, it will only contain unique elements, and adding `el` will not affect the uniqueness of the other elements already present in `tov`. 

Given the initial state specifies that `tov` contains all unique elements from `ds[nxt]` after popping one element and still contains at least one element, and it is not mentioned that `el` is already in `tov`, we can conclude that `el` will be successfully added to `tov`.

Therefore, the output state is:
`tov` now contains all unique elements from `ds[nxt]` plus `el`, and `tov` still contains at least one element.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2; `tov` now contains all unique elements from `ds[nxt]` plus `el`; `nxt` is an element from `tov` such that `ds[nxt]` contains at least one element; the element at index `el` in `arr` is now equal to `cur`.**
