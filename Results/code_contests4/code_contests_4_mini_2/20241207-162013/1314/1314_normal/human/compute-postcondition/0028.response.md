Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `D` is an integer, `ds` is a defaultdict with sets containing pairs of integers except when both are 1, `dmain` is a defaultdict with sets containing all pairs of integers, and `i` is equal to `m - 1` after the last iteration. The length of the set associated with the key 1 in `dmain` is less than `D`.***
