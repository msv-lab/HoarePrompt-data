Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `nxt` is a valid index for `dmain`, `dmain[nxt]` is not empty; `el` is not in `vis`, so `el` has been added to the set `sv`, and `el` is now added to the set `vis`; `res` contains the string representation of `nxt` and `el` concatenated with a space; `dmain[el]` no longer contains `nxt`.**
