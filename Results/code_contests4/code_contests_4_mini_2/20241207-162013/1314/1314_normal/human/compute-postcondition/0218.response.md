The code attempts to remove the element `el` from the list located at index `1` of the dictionary `dmain`. The initial state indicates that `dmain[el]` has already had `1` removed, which implies that `el` is not present in the list or that the list at `dmain[1]` is empty. Therefore, attempting to remove `el` will not alter the state of `dmain`. The variables `i` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `dmain[1]` remains unchanged and `el` is not removed.**
