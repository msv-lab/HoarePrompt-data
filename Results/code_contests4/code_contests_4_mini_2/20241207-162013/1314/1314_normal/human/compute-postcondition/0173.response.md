According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the iterable `ds[nxt]`. If `ds[nxt]` has more elements remaining to iterate through, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `el` is the first element in `ds[nxt]` that was processed, and since `tov` includes all elements from `ds[nxt]` that were previously 0 in `arr`, we know that after processing `el`, the next element in `ds[nxt]` is to be processed next.

Given that `cur` has been incremented by the number of elements in `ds[nxt]`, `i` is incremented, and `n` is still greater than 2, we need to determine the next state. 

Since `len(tov) > 0` indicates that there are elements that were previously 0 in `arr`, and `el` has already been processed, we need to adjust the state to reflect the next element in `ds[nxt]`.

Thus, for the loop to execute a second time, we need to ensure that `el` is now updated to the next element in `ds[nxt]`, and since `ds[nxt]` is a non-empty iterable, we must also ensure that it still has elements left.

State: **`cur` is incremented by the number of elements in `ds[nxt]`, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is incremented, `tov` includes all elements from `ds[nxt]` that were previously 0 in `arr`, `len(tov) > 0`, `nxt` is a valid index/key in `ds`, `ds[nxt]` is a non-empty iterable, `el` is the second element in `ds[nxt]`**.
