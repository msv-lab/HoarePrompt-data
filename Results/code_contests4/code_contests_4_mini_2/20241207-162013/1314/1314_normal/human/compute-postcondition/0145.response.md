The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown. The other variables, `n`, `arr`, `tov`, and `ds[nxt]`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 2; `arr` is updated with indices corresponding to elements in `ds[nxt]` that were originally 0 now set to `cur`; `tov` contains all unique elements from `ds[nxt]` that were processed; and variable `i` is increased by 1.
