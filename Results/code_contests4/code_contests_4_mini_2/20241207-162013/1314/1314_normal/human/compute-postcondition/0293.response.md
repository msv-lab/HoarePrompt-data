The code appends a string to the list `res`, where the string is a combination of the values of `nxt` and `el`. The values of `nxt` and `el` are already defined in the initial state. Since `nxt` is the last element of `sv` before popping, and `el` is the next element in `dmain[nxt]`, their specific values are being converted to strings and concatenated with a space in between. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `dmain`, `sv`, `vis`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `nxt` is the last element of `sv` before popping, `el` is the next element in `dmain[nxt]`, and `res` now includes the string representation of `nxt` and `el` concatenated together.**
