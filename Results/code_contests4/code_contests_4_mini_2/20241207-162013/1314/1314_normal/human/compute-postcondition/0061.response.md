`el` is added to `tov`, which modifies `tov` to include an additional element. The other variables such as `n`, `arr`, `cur`, `nxt`, and `ds[nxt]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `arr` contains values assigned to `cur` at indices specified by `tov`, `cur` is the next value after the last assigned value, `tov` now has one more element including `el`, `nxt` is assigned the last element of `tov`, and `ds[nxt]` contains at least one element processed during the loop, and the value of `arr` at index `el` is now equal to `cur`.
