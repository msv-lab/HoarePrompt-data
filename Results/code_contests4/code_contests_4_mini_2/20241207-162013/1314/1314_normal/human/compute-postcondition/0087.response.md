After analyzing the initial state, the loop code, and the output states provided after some iterations, we can derive the final output state after all iterations of the loop.

1. The loop iterates over each element in `ds[nxt]`, which contains elements to be processed.
2. For each element `el` in `ds[nxt]`, if `arr[el]` is 0, it assigns `cur` to `arr[el]` and adds `el` to `tov`.
3. The loop continues processing until all elements in `ds[nxt]` have been handled.

Given that `n` is greater than 2, `arr` contains values assigned to `cur` at indices specified by `tov`, and `tov` is updated to include any new indices where `arr[el]` was initially 0. 

Ultimately, the output state after all iterations of the loop will reflect that all applicable indices in `arr` have been assigned the value of `cur`, and any indices that were zero have been added to `tov`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2; `arr` contains values assigned to `cur` at all indices where `arr` was previously 0; `tov` contains no elements; `nxt` is not applicable; `ds[nxt]` has been completely processed.**
