The code appends a string representation of the variables `nxt` and `el` to the list `res`. The values of `nxt` and `el` are known from the initial state, with `nxt` being the last element of `sv` before popping and `el` being the next element in `dmain[nxt]`. Since `vis` now includes `el`, it confirms that `el` is a new addition to the visited elements.

The output will reflect the updated state of the `res` list after the append operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is equal to `n`, `nxt` is the last element of `sv`, `el` is the next element in `dmain[nxt]`, `sv` now contains `el`, `vis` now includes `el`, and `res` now includes the new string `str(nxt) + ' ' + str(el)`.

Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `nxt` is the last element of `sv`, `el` is the next element in `dmain[nxt]`, `sv` now contains `el`, `vis` now includes `el`, and `res` now includes the new string `str(nxt) + ' ' + str(el)`**.
