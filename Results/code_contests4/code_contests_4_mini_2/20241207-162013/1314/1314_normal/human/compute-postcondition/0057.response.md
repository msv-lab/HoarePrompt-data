The variable `nxt` is assigned the value of the last element popped from the list `tov`. This means that `tov` will lose its last element, and `nxt` will hold that value. The states of the other variables `n`, `arr`, `cur`, and `ds` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2; `arr` contains values assigned to `cur` at indices specified by `tov`; `cur` is the next value after the last assigned value; `tov` has one less element; `nxt` is assigned the last element of `tov`; and `ds[nxt]` contains all elements processed during the loop.
