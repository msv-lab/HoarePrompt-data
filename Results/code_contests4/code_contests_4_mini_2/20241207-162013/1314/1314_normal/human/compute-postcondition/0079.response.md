According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ds[nxt]`. The loop iterates over the elements in `ds[nxt]`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2, `tov` includes indices where `arr[el]` is 0, `nxt` is the last element of `tov`, `ds[nxt]` contains at least 1 element, `el` is set to the first element in `ds[nxt]`, and `arr[el]` is now equal to `cur`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `ds[nxt]` must contain at least 2 elements (so that `el` can be updated to the next element). After the current iteration, `el` is currently set to the first element in `ds[nxt]`, so in the next iteration, `el` must be updated to the second element in `ds[nxt]`.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `arr` contains values assigned to `cur` at indices specified by `tov`, `tov` includes `el`, `nxt` is updated to the last element of `tov`, `ds[nxt]` contains at least 2 elements, `el` is set to the second element in `ds[nxt]`, and `arr[el]` is now equal to `cur`.**
