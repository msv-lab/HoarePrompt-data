According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the contents of `ds[nxt]`. If `ds[nxt]` has at least one more element after the current one, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `ds[nxt]` must have had at least one more element, and `el` is currently the next element in `ds[nxt]`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `el` should be updated to the next element in `ds[nxt]`, which means the size of `ds[nxt]` must be at least one greater than what it was before the last iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `ds[nxt]` must have at least one more element, `el` is the next element in `ds[nxt]`, and for the loop to execute again `ds[nxt]` must have at least one more element after `el`.**
