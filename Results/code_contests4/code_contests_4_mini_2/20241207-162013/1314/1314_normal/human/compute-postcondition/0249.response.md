The code appends a new string to the list `res` that consists of the string representation of `nxt` and `el`, separated by a space. The variables `nxt` and `el` are already defined in the initial state, and `res` is modified to include this new string. Other variables such as `i`, `sv`, and `vis` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated state of `res` after appending the new string.

Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `nxt` is a valid index for `dmain`, `dmain[nxt]` contains at least one more element, `el` is the next element in `dmain[nxt]`, `vis` is updated with `el`, `res` contains the updated list with the new element appended, and `sv` is updated with `el`**.
