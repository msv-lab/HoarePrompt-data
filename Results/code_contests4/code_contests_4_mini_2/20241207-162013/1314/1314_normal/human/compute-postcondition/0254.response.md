The variable `nxt` is assigned the value popped from the list `sv`. Since `sv` contains all elements that were in `vis`, it is not empty, and thus a valid element is removed from `sv` and assigned to `nxt`. The previous values of `i`, `n`, `res`, and `dmain` are not directly affected by this operation. The state of `sv` will change as one of its elements is removed.

Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `nxt` is the last element of `sv` before popping, `dmain[nxt]` is empty, `res` contains the string representations of `nxt` and all unique `el` values that were added during the loop, `dmain[el]` no longer contains `nxt` for all `el` that were processed, and `sv` no longer contains the popped element.**
