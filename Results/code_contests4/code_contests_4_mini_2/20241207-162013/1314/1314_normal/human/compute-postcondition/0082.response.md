Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `arr` contains values assigned to `cur` at indices specified by `tov`, `tov` includes `el`, `nxt` is updated to the last element of `tov`, `ds[nxt]` contains at least 2 elements, `el` is set to the second element in `ds[nxt]`, and `arr[el]` is now equal to `cur`. If `arr[el]` is equal to 0, then `el` is added to `tov`.***
