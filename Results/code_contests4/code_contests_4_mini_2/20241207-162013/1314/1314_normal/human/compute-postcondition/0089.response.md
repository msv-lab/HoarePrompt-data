Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 2. If `arr[i]` is 0, then `arr` contains values assigned to `cur` at all indices that were previously 0, `cur` is the next value after the last assigned value, `tov` is empty, `nxt` is not applicable, and `ds` has been completely processed for all elements that were in `tov`.***
