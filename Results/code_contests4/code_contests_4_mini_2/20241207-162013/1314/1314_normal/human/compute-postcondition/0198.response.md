After the while loop completes all its iterations, the output state can be summarized as follows:

- `cur` is incremented by the total number of unique elements in `ds[nxt]` that were previously 0 in `arr`, reflecting all unique elements processed during the loop's execution.
- `n` remains an integer greater than 2, as it is not modified within the loop.
- `i` is incremented by the same total number of unique elements that were processed, indicating the number of new elements added.
- `tov` is empty because all elements have been processed and removed from the set during the loop.
- `nxt` does not have a defined value after the loop, as it was only relevant during the last execution of the loop.
- `arr` is updated such that `arr[el]` is equal to `cur` for all unique `el` that were added to `tov`, reflecting the final assignments made during the loop.

Output State: **`cur` is incremented by the total number of unique elements in `ds[nxt]` that were previously 0 in `arr`, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is incremented by the same total number, `tov` is empty, `nxt` is not defined, and `arr` is updated such that `arr[el]` is equal to `cur` for all unique `el` processed.**
