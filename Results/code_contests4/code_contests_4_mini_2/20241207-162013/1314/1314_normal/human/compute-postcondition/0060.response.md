The value of `arr` at index `el` is assigned the value of `cur`. Given that `cur` is the next value after the last assigned value, `arr[el]` will now hold this new value. Other variables in the state remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `arr` contains values assigned to `cur` at indices specified by `tov`, `cur` is the next value after the last assigned value, `tov` has one less element, `nxt` is assigned the last element of `tov`, `ds[nxt]` contains at least one element processed during the loop, and the value of `arr` at index `el` is now equal to `cur`.
