According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ds` structure and the value of `nxt`. For the loop to execute, `ds[nxt]` must contain at least one element. Given that `n` is greater than 2, `nxt` must be a valid index or key in `ds`, and the corresponding `ds[nxt]` must not be empty. 

Additionally, before the loop starts, `cur` has been incremented by 1, and `i` has also been incremented by 1, indicating that they are now at least 1 greater than their previous values. The state of `tov` must ensure that it contains at least the current value of `i`, as stated, and has elements to remove.

Assuming `nxt` is set to the last element removed from `tov`, we need to check that `tov` has elements for `nxt` to be valid. 

Thus, for the loop to execute:
- `tov` must have at least one element.
- `nxt` should correspond to a valid index/key in `ds` and `ds[nxt]` must not be empty.

State: **`cur` is incremented by 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is incremented by 1, `tov` contains at least the current value of `i`, `len(tov) > 0`, `nxt` is a valid index/key in `ds`, and `ds[nxt]` is not empty**
