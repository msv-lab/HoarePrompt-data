According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the structure of `ds[nxt]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `ds[nxt]` must contain at least one more element after the current `el`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `el` is the next valid index/key in `ds[nxt]`, and `ds[nxt]` has at least one more element. Since `el` has been used in the last iteration, we need to increment `el` to point to the next element in `ds[nxt]`.

Thus, the conditions that need to be adjusted are:
1. `el` must be updated to the next valid index/key in `ds[nxt]`.
2. `ds[nxt]` must contain at least one additional element after the current one, so the new value of `el` must be a valid index/key within `ds[nxt]`.

State: **`cur` is incremented by 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is incremented by 1, `tov` includes `el`, `len(tov) > 0`, `nxt` is a valid index/key in `ds`, `ds[nxt]` has at least one more element, and `el` is the next valid index/key in `ds[nxt]`; if `arr[el]` was 0, then `arr[el]` is now equal to the new value of `cur`, and `tov` has been updated to include the new `el`.**
