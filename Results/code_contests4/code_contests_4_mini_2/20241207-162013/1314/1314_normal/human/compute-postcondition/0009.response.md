The code `ds[f].add(s)` adds the integer `s` to the set associated with the key `f` in the dictionary `ds`. Since `ds` is updated to include `f` in the set at key `s`, the operation affects the state of `ds` by including `s` in the set of `ds[f]`. The variables `n`, `m`, `D`, `dmain`, and `i` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 0, `D` is an integer, `ds` is updated to include `f` with `s` added in the set at key `f`, `dmain` is a defaultdict with sets, `i` is 0; `s` and `f` are integers such that both `s` is not equal to 1 and `f` is not equal to 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 0, `D` is an integer, `ds` is updated to include `f` with `s` added in the set at key `f`, `dmain` is a defaultdict with sets, `i` is 0; `s` and `f` are integers such that both `s` is not equal to 1 and `f` is not equal to 1.**
