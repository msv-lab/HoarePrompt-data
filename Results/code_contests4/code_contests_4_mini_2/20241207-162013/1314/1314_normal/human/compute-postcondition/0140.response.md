The `add` method is called on the set `tov`, adding the element `el` to it. Since `tov` already contains all unique elements from `ds[nxt]` plus `el`, the operation will either add `el` if it is not already present, or leave `tov` unchanged if `el` is already in the set. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the status of the variables before and after the operation.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2; `tov` contains all unique elements from `ds[nxt]` plus `el`; `el` is the next element in `ds[nxt]`; `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`; `el` is added to `tov`.**
