According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the contents of the list `ds[nxt]`. If `ds[nxt]` has at least 3 elements, then the loop can execute again for the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `tov` includes `el`, and `el` is set to the second element in `ds[nxt]`. This means `nxt` must be updated to point to the next element in `ds[nxt]` for the loop to execute again. Since `ds[nxt]` contains at least 2 elements, `el` should be updated to the third element in `ds[nxt]` for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `arr` contains values assigned to `cur` at indices specified by `tov`, `tov` includes `el`, `nxt` is updated to the last element of `tov`, `ds[nxt]` contains at least 3 elements, `el` is set to the third element in `ds[nxt]`, and `arr[el]` is now equal to `cur`. If `arr[el]` is equal to 0, then `el` is added to `tov`.**
