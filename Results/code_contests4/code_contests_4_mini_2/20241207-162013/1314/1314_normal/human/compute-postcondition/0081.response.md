The `tov` set is updated by adding the value `el` to it. Since `el` is already defined and is part of the existing state, the operation will not affect the values of `n`, `arr`, `cur`, or `nxt`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of these variables along with the update of the `tov` set.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `arr` contains values assigned to `cur` at indices specified by `tov`, `tov` includes `el`, `nxt` is updated to the last element of `tov`, `ds[nxt]` contains at least 2 elements, `el` is set to the second element in `ds[nxt]`, `arr[el]` is now equal to `cur`, and `el` is added to `tov`.**
