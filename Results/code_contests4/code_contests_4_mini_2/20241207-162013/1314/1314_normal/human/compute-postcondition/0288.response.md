Postcondition: ***`i` is equal to `n`, `nxt` is the last element of `sv` before popping, `dmain[nxt]` contains at least 2 elements, and `el` is the next element in `dmain[nxt]`. If `el` is not in `vis`, then `el` is added to the sets `sv` and `vis`, and `res` is updated to include the string representation of `nxt` and `el`.***
