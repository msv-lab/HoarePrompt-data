The statement `tov = {i}` creates a set named `tov` containing the single element `i`. The variable `i` is not defined in the initial state provided, nor is there any indication of its value. Since `cur` is mentioned to be increased by 1, it doesn't affect the definition of `tov`. Thus, the output state includes the unchanged variables and indicates the creation of the set.

Output State: **`n` is an integer and is greater than 2, `arr` is an array of integers, `cur` is increased by 1, and `tov` is a set containing the element `i`.**
