According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `el` and the iterable `ite`. If `el` is less than the length of `ite`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n`, implying that `el` is `n` or beyond the length of `ite`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `el` must be increased by 1, and `ite` must have at least one more element.

State: **`i` is equal to `n`, for the loop to execute one more time `ite` must have at least `n + 1` elements, and `el` must be `n + 1`**.
