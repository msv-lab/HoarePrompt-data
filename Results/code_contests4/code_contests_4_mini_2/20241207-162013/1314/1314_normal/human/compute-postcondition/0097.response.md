According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `nxt` and the data structure `ds`. The loop will execute if `nxt` is a valid index for the `ds` and if `ds[nxt]` contains at least one element. Given that `n` is greater than 2 and `len(tov)` is greater than 0, it implies that `nxt` has been assigned a value that corresponds to a valid index in `ds`.

To ensure the loop executes for the first time, we need to verify that `ds[nxt]` is not empty. Therefore, the state must ensure that `nxt` is a valid index for `ds` and that `ds[nxt]` contains at least one element.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `cur` has been increased by 1, `arr[i]` is updated with the new value of `cur`, `nxt` is assigned the value of the last element of `tov` which is popped from the list, `len(tov)` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute the first time `ds[nxt]` must contain at least 1 element.**
