The code `dmain[el].remove(nxt)` attempts to remove the value `nxt` from the list stored at index `el` in the dictionary `dmain`. This operation affects the contents of `dmain` but does not alter any of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `vis`, `res`, `sv`). 

The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged, so the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `nxt` is a valid index for `dmain`, `dmain[nxt]` contains at least one more element, `el` is the next element in `dmain[nxt]`, and `dmain[el]` no longer contains `nxt`.**
