The value of `cur` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `cur` is unknown. The states of the other variables, `n` and `i`, are not affected, but the condition for the loop to execute again depends on `n` being greater than `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than `i`; `cur` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than `i`; `cur` is increased by 1**
