According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ds[nxt]` list. If the list has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2, and `nxt` is assigned the value `i`, which indicates it points to the current index in `ds`. The loop iterates over `ds[nxt]`, and the current element being processed is `el`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `ds[nxt]` must contain at least one more element than it did in the last iteration. Since `el` represents the current element within `ds[nxt]`, if there was at least one element before, `el` is currently pointing to that element. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `el` should point to the next element in `ds[nxt]`. The index `el` must be increased by 1.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `el` is the next element in `ds[nxt]`, and `ds[nxt]` must contain at least 2 elements.**
