The operation `tov.add(el)` adds the value of `el` to the set `tov`. The previous values indicate that `tov` has at least one element since `len(tov)` is greater than 0. Other variables, such as `n`, `cur`, `arr`, `nxt`, and `ds`, are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state includes the updated state of `tov` reflecting the addition of `el`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `cur` has been increased by 1, `arr[i]` is updated with the new value of `cur`, `nxt` is assigned the value of the last element of `tov` which is popped from the list, `len(tov)` is greater than 0, `ds[nxt]` contains at least 1 element, the element at index `el` of `arr` is equal to 0; `arr[el]` is now equal to `cur`, and `el` has been added to `tov`.**
