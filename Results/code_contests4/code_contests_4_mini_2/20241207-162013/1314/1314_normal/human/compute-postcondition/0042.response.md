According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ds` array. The loop will execute if there is at least one element in `ds[nxt]`. Since `nxt` is assigned the value of `i`, we need to ensure that `ds[i]` contains at least one element for the loop to run. The values of `n`, `cur`, and `tov` do not directly affect the execution of the loop, but we must also note that `n` is greater than 2.

For the loop to execute for the first time, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `nxt` is the index `i`, which is within the bounds of the `ds` structure, and that `ds[nxt]` (i.e., `ds[i]`) is not empty.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `arr[i]` is assigned the value of `cur`, `cur` is increased by 1, `tov` contained element `i`, `nxt` is assigned the value `i`, for the loop to execute the first time `ds[nxt]` contains at least 1 element**
