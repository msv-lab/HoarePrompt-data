The code assigns a set containing the current value of `i` to the variable `tov`. The variable `cur` is incremented by 1, and `i` is also incremented by 1 for the loop condition, but since the code only affects `tov`, the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `tov` now contains the current value of `i`, but we do not know the specific value of `i` as it is incremented.

Output State: **`cur` is incremented by 1; `n` is an integer greater than 2; `i` is incremented by 1; `tov` is a set containing the current value of `i`.**
