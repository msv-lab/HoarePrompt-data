Postcondition: ***`i` is equal to `n`, `nxt` is a valid index for `dmain`, `dmain[nxt]` contains at least one more element to iterate over, and `el` is now `next_el`. If `el` is not in `vis`, then `el` is added to the set `vis`, `res` contains the string representation of `nxt` and `el` concatenated with a space, and `el` is also added to the set `sv`.***
