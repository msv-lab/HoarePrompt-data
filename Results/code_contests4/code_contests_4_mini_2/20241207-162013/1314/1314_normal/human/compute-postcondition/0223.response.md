To analyze the provided Python code snippet based on the initial state:

1. The initial state indicates that `el` is equal to `n + 1`. Thus, we know the value of `el` directly depends on the value of `n`.
2. The code line `dmain[1].remove(el)` attempts to remove the value of `el` from the list located at index `1` of the dictionary or list `dmain`.
3. We need to consider that `el` is `n + 1`, and since `dmain[el]` is mentioned, it implies that `dmain` is a structure containing at least `el` elements, meaning it can handle indexes up to `n + 1`.

However, the operation `dmain[1].remove(el)` will only affect `dmain[1]`, removing `el` (which is `n + 1`) from that specific list. The other variables `i`, `n`, and `ite` are not impacted by this operation.

Therefore, the output state will be:
Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `ite` must have at least `n + 1` elements, `el` is `n + 1`, and `el` is removed from `dmain[1]`.**
