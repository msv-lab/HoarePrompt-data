Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 0, `D` is an integer, `ds` is a defaultdict with sets, `dmain` is a defaultdict with sets, `i` is 0; `s` and `f` are integers such that if `s` is not equal to 1 and `f` is not equal to 1, then `ds` is updated to include `f` with `s` added in the set at key `f`.***
