Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 2, `D` is an integer, `ds` is a defaultdict with sets including `s` in `ds[f]`, `dmain[f]` includes `s`, `i` is 2, `s` is an input integer, and `f` is an input integer. If both `s` and `f` are not equal to 1, then `s` is added to the set `ds[f]` and `dmain[f]` includes `s`.***
