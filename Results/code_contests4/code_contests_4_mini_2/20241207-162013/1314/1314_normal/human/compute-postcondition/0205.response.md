Postcondition: ***`i` is equal to `n`, `arr` contains values assigned to `cur` at all indices that were previously 0, `cur` is greater than `D`, `tov` is empty, `nxt` is not applicable, `ds` has been completely processed for all elements that were in `tov`, and all elements in `arr` corresponding to reachable indices from the original 0 entries have been assigned the same value of `cur`. The program execution has been terminated.***
