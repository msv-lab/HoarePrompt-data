The operation `tov.add(el)` adds the value of `el` to the `tov` set. The previous state indicates that `el` has been updated to the next element in `ds[nxt]`, but we do not have the specific value of `el`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2; `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`; `tov` now includes the value of `el`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2; `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`; `tov` now includes the value of `el`.**
