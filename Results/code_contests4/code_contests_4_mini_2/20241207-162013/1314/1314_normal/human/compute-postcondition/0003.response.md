`ds` is assigned a new instance of `defaultdict` with `set` as the default factory. This means that `ds` will be a dictionary where each key will have a default value of an empty set if the key does not already exist. The values of `n`, `m`, and `D` remain unchanged and are still assigned from the input. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, and `D` are integers assigned from the input line; `ds` is a defaultdict with sets as default values.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `D` are integers assigned from the input line; `ds` is a defaultdict with sets as default values.**
