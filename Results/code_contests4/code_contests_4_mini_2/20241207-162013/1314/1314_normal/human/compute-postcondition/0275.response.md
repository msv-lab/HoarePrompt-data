According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `sv`. If `sv` has a length greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n`, which suggests that the loop's condition involving `sv` must still hold true for another iteration. The state indicates that `sv` contains all unique `el` values added during the loop, but we do not know if it currently has any elements left, as we only know its length is non-zero.

Since `sv` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that the condition `len(sv)` is greater than 0. Thus, we can assume that the previous state of `sv` must have included at least one unique `el` value after the last iteration.

State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `nxt` is the last element of `sv` before popping, `dmain[nxt]` is empty, `res` contains all pairs of `nxt` and unique `el` values processed, `dmain[el]` no longer contains `nxt` for all processed `el`, `sv` must contain at least one unique `el` value for the loop to execute again, and `vis` contains all unique `el` values that were seen.**
