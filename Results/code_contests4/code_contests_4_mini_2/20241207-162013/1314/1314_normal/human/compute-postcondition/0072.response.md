According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tov`. If `tov` has a length greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `len(tov)` is non-zero since it is being used in the loop condition. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for `tov` to ensure the loop executes one more time. 

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `arr` contains values assigned to `cur` at indices specified by `tov`, `tov` contains all indices where `arr` was previously 0, `nxt` is assigned the last element of `tov`, and `ds[nxt]` contains all elements processed during the loop**
