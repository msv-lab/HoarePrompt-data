The code `dmain[s].add(f)` adds the value of `f` to the set corresponding to the key `s` in the `dmain` defaultdict. The previous values of `s` and `f` are not specifically given, but it is noted that `s` and `f` are integers, and `dmain` is a defaultdict that can hold sets.

Since `s` is not equal to 1 and `f` is not equal to 1, this operation will update `dmain` to include `f` in the set at the key `s`. The values of `n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, and `i` are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 0, `D` is an integer, `ds` is a defaultdict with sets, `dmain[s]` now includes `f` in its set, and `i` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 0, `D` is an integer, `ds` is a defaultdict with sets, `dmain[s]` now includes `f` in its set, `i` is 0**
