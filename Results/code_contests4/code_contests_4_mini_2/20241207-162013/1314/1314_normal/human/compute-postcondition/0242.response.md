The `add` method is called on the set `vis` to include the element `el`. The value of `el` is equal to `next_el`, which is already established in the initial state. The addition of `el` to the set `vis` updates the set by including `el` if it was not already present. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is equal to `n`, `nxt` is a valid index for `dmain`, `dmain[nxt]` contains at least one more element to iterate over, `el` is now `next_el`, `el` is added to the set `vis`, and `res` contains the string representation of `nxt` and `el` concatenated with a space; `el` is added to the set `sv`.
