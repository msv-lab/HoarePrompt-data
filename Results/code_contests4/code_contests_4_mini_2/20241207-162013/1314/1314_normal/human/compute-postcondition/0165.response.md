Output State: **`cur` is incremented by the number of elements in `ds[nxt]` where `arr[el]` was 0, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is incremented by the same number of elements, `tov` includes all elements from `ds[nxt]` that were previously 0 in `arr`, `len(tov) > 0`, `nxt` remains a valid index/key in `ds`, and `arr` is updated such that `arr[el]` is equal to `cur` for all `el` added to `tov`.**
