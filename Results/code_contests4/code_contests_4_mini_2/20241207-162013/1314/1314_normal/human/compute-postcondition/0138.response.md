According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements in `ds[nxt]`. For the loop to execute again, `el` must take on the next value from `ds[nxt]`. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is greater than 2, and `tov` contains all unique elements from `ds[nxt]` plus `el`. 

Since `el` is currently the last processed element from `ds[nxt]`, to execute the loop a second time, `el` must be updated to the next element in `ds[nxt]`. If `ds[nxt]` has `k` elements, for the loop to execute again, `el` needs to be updated to the next index, which will be `el + 1`. 

Therefore, if `el` was the last index processed in `ds[nxt]`, for the loop to execute again, `el` needs to be less than `k`. Given that `n` is greater than 2, `ds[nxt]` must have more than 2 elements.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `tov` contains all unique elements from `ds[nxt]` plus `el`, `el` is the next element in `ds[nxt]`, for the loop to execute again `el` must be less than the length of `ds[nxt]`.**
