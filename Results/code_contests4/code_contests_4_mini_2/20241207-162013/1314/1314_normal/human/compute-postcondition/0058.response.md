According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the contents of `ds[nxt]`. If `ds[nxt]` contains at least one element, the loop can execute. Given that `n` is greater than 2, we know that the program is set up correctly for the loop to potentially execute. However, we need to ensure that `nxt` correctly references a valid index in `ds` and that `ds[nxt]` is not empty. 

Since `tov` has one less element, we must confirm that `nxt` is valid and points to a populated part of `ds`. If `ds[nxt]` is empty, the loop will not execute. Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need to adjust our state to reflect that `ds[nxt]` contains at least one element.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `arr` contains values assigned to `cur` at indices specified by `tov`, `cur` is the next value after the last assigned value, `tov` has one less element, `nxt` is assigned the last element of `tov`, `ds[nxt]` contains at least one element processed during the loop.**
