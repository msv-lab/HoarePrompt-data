The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, it operates based on the following constraints:

- `n`: an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, constrained to the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 200000.
- `m`: an integer representing the number of edges in the graph, constrained to the range n - 1 ≤ m ≤ min(200000, (n(n-1))/(2)).
- `D`: an integer representing the required degree of the first vertex, constrained to the range 1 ≤ D < n.
- The edges are defined by `m` pairs of integers (v_i, u_i) where 1 ≤ v_i, u_i ≤ n and v_i ≠ u_i, ensuring no self-loops or multiple edges exist.

The output of the function is not explicitly stated in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function cannot be fully described without additional context regarding its return values or operations.

Functionality: **The function operates on parameters n, m, D, and a set of edges defined by pairs of integers, but does not explicitly return any value. Further context is needed to specify the output.**
