The code `tov.add(el)` adds the element `el` to the set `tov`. Since `el` is the first element in `ds[nxt]`, and `len(tov) > 0` indicates that `tov` already contains elements, the addition of `el` will either increase the size of `tov` if `el` was not already present or leave its size unchanged if `el` was already in `tov`. The other variables and their states are not directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **`cur` is incremented by the number of elements in `ds[nxt]`, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is incremented, `tov` includes all elements from `ds[nxt]` that were previously 0 in `arr`, `len(tov) > 0`, `nxt` is a valid index/key in `ds`, `ds[nxt]` is a non-empty iterable, `el` is the first element in `ds[nxt]`, and now `arr[el]` is set to `cur`, and `el` is added to `tov`.**
