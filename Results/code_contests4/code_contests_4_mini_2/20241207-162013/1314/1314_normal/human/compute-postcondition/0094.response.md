The value of `cur` is assigned to `arr[i]`, where `cur` has been increased by 1. The variable `i` is an element of the set `tov`, which determines the index in `arr` where `cur` will be stored. The previous values of `n` and `cur` do not affect this assignment directly, but we know that `cur` is now greater than its previous value due to the increment, and `arr` is updated at index `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 2; `cur` has been increased by 1; `arr[i]` is updated with the new value of `cur`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2; `cur` has been increased by 1; `arr[i]` is updated with the new value of `cur.**
