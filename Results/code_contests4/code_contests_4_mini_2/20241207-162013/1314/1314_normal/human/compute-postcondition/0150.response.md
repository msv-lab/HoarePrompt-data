According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `tov`, specifically whether it contains any elements. The loop will execute as long as the length of `tov` is greater than 0. 

Right before the loop, `tov` is a set containing the current value of `i`. Since `i` has been incremented by 1, `tov` must contain that value for the loop to execute. However, we also need to ensure that `tov` is not empty.

Since `n` is an integer greater than 2, it doesn't directly affect the execution of the loop unless it influences the size of `tov`. The only required adjustment is to ensure that `tov` includes at least one element.

To ensure that `tov` is not empty, we need to have `i` added to `tov` or some other element included at the point right before the loop starts. 

State: **`cur` is incremented by 1; `n` is an integer greater than 2; `i` is incremented by 1; for the loop to execute the first time, `tov` must contain at least the current value of `i`, ensuring `len(tov) > 0`.**
