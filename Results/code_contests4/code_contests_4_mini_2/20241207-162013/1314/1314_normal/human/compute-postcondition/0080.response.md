The code `arr[el] = cur` assigns the value of `cur` to the index `el` of the array `arr`. The previous states indicate that `cur` has been assigned values from `arr` at indices specified by `tov`, and `el` is the second element in `ds[nxt]`. The assignment will change the value at `arr[el]` to `cur`, but the values of `n`, `tov`, `nxt`, and `ds` remain unaffected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `arr` contains values assigned to `cur` at indices specified by `tov`, `tov` includes `el`, `nxt` is updated to the last element of `tov`, `ds[nxt]` contains at least 2 elements, `el` is set to the second element in `ds[nxt]`, `arr[el]` is now equal to `cur`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `arr` contains values assigned to `cur` at indices specified by `tov`, `tov` includes `el`, `nxt` is updated to the last element of `tov`, `ds[nxt]` contains at least 2 elements, `el` is set to the second element in `ds[nxt]`, `arr[el]` is now equal to `cur`.**
