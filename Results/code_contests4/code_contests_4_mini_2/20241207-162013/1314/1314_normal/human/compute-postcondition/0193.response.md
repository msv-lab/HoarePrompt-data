According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in `ds[nxt]`. Since `len(tov)` is greater than 0, it indicates that there are elements in `ds[nxt]` that have not yet been processed by the loop. At the end of the last iteration, `el` is the next element in `ds[nxt]`, and `arr[el]` has been updated to `cur`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `el` must be updated to the next unprocessed element in `ds[nxt]`, and the length of `ds[nxt]` must be greater than the current index `i`. The variable `i` has been incremented by the number of elements in `ds[nxt]` that were previously 0 in `arr`, so it reflects the number of processed elements.

Thus, if `n` is greater than 2, `i` is incremented by the total number of elements that were previously 0 in `arr`, and `cur` is updated accordingly.

State: **`cur` is incremented by the total number of elements in `ds[nxt]` that were previously 0 in `arr`, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is incremented by the same number, `tov` includes all elements from `ds[nxt]` that were previously 0 in `arr`, including the element `el`; `len(tov)` must be greater than the current index `i`, `nxt` remains a valid index/key in `ds`, `el` is the next unprocessed element in `ds[nxt]`, and `arr[el]` will be updated to `cur`.**
