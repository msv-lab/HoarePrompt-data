According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the `ds[nxt]` structure. The loop will execute if `ds[nxt]` contains at least one element. Given that `len(tov) > 0`, it indicates that there are elements in `ds[nxt]` that were previously 0 in `arr`, meaning `ds[nxt]` is expected to hold those elements. 

Before the loop starts, the relevant states are:
- `cur` is the sum of the elements that were previously 0 in `arr`, indicating that it has been incremented accordingly.
- `n` is an integer greater than 2, which does not affect the loop execution directly.
- `i` is incremented by the same number of elements as `cur`, but this increment is not directly relevant for the loop execution itself.
- `tov` must contain the elements that are to be processed in the loop.
- `nxt` must remain a valid index/key in `ds`, which it does as stated.

For the loop to execute at least once, `ds[nxt]` must not be empty. Since `tov` is populated by elements from `ds[nxt]`, it implies that `ds[nxt]` has at least one element to iterate over.

Thus, for the loop to execute:
- `ds[nxt]` must be non-empty, indicating that there are elements to iterate over.
- `el` will take on the value of the first element in `ds[nxt]` during the first iteration.

State: **`cur` is incremented by the number of elements in `ds[nxt]`, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is incremented, `tov` includes all elements from `ds[nxt]` that were previously 0 in `arr`, `len(tov) > 0`, `nxt` is a valid index/key in `ds`, for the loop to execute the first time `ds[nxt]` is a non-empty iterable, and `el` is the first element in `ds[nxt]`.**
