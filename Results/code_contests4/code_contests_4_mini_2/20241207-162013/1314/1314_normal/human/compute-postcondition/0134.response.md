According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the contents of `ds[nxt]`. If `ds[nxt]` contains more elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2, `tov` contains all unique elements from `ds[nxt]` plus `el`, and the element at index `el` in `arr` has been updated to `cur`. 

Since we are currently iterating over `ds[nxt]`, for the loop to be executed one more time, `ds[nxt]` must contain at least one more element beyond what has already been processed. This implies that the loop will execute again for the next element in `ds[nxt]`. Therefore, `el` must be incremented by 1 (to point to the next element in `ds[nxt]`), and `nxt` must remain the same since it is the same element from `tov`.

State: **`n` is greater than 2; `tov` contains all unique elements from `ds[nxt]` plus `el`; `el` is incremented to point to the next element in `ds[nxt]`.**
