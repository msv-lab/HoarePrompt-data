Postcondition: ***`cur` is incremented by 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is incremented by 1, `tov` now includes `el`, `len(tov) > 0`, `nxt` is a valid index/key in `ds`, `ds[nxt]` has at least one more element, and `el` is the next valid index/key in `ds[nxt]`; if `arr[el]` was 0, then `arr[el]` is now equal to the new value of `cur`, and `tov` has been updated to include `el`.***
