The `tov` variable is assigned a set containing the current value of `i`. The initial state indicates that `n` is an integer greater than 2 and that the loop will execute again if `n` is greater than `i`. The value of `cur` has been increased by 1, but this does not directly affect the creation of the set. The output state will reflect that `tov` now contains the value of `i`, while the values of `n` and `cur` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2; `cur` is increased by 1; `tov` is a set containing `i`.**
