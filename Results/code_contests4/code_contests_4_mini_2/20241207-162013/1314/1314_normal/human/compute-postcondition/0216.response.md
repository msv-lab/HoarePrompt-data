The code `sviaz.add(arr[el])` adds the element at index `el` of the array `arr` to the set `sviaz`. Since `i` is equal to `n`, it indicates that the loop is currently executing. The previous state does not affect the `sviaz` or `arr`, and we are assuming that `el` is a valid index for `arr`.

Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `sviaz` has an additional element from `arr[el]`**
