Postcondition: ***`cur` is incremented by 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is incremented by 1, `tov` now includes `el`, `len(tov) > 0`, `nxt` is a valid index/key in `ds`, `ds[nxt]` is not empty, and the element at index `el` in `arr` is updated to `cur` if the element at index `el` in `arr` was previously 0.***
