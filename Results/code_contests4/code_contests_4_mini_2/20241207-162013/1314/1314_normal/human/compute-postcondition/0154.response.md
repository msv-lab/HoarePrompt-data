The value at index `el` in the array `arr` is assigned the value of `cur`. Since `cur` has been incremented by 1, the previous value of `cur` is now one less than its current state. The state of other variables remains unchanged, but we now know that `arr[el]` will be updated to the current value of `cur`. Therefore, the Output State is: `cur` is incremented by 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is incremented by 1, `tov` contains at least the current value of `i`, `len(tov) > 0`, `nxt` is a valid index/key in `ds`, `ds[nxt]` is not empty, and the element at index `el` in `arr` is updated to `cur`.

Output State: **`cur` is incremented by 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is incremented by 1, `tov` contains at least the current value of `i`, `len(tov) > 0`, `nxt` is a valid index/key in `ds`, `ds[nxt]` is not empty, and the element at index `el` in `arr` is updated to `cur`.**
