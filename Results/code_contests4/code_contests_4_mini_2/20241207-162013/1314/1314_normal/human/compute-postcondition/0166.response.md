According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tov`. If `len(tov)` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `len(tov) > 0`, which indicates that there are still elements in `tov` for the loop to process. 

Since the loop can execute one more time based on the current state of `tov`, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to proceed. All other states are consistent with the requirements for the loop to execute again.

State: **`cur` is incremented by the number of elements in `ds[nxt]` where `arr[el]` was 0, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is incremented by the same number of elements, `tov` includes all elements from `ds[nxt]` that were previously 0 in `arr`, `len(tov) > 0`, `nxt` remains a valid index/key in `ds`, and `arr` is updated such that `arr[el]` is equal to `cur` for all `el` added to `tov`**.
