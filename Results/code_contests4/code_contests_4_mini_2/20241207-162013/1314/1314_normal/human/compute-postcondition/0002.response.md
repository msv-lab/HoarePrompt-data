The values of `n`, `m`, and `D` are assigned from the input, which provides three integers separated by spaces. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `D` are overwritten by the values read from the input. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `D` are integers assigned from the input line.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `D` are integers assigned from the input line.**
