According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ds[nxt]`. The loop iterates over the elements in `ds[nxt]`, so `ds[nxt]` must not be empty for the loop to execute. Given that `n` is an integer greater than 2, we need to ensure that `nxt` is a valid index and that `ds[nxt]` has at least one element. 

Since `arr` contains updated values where each index corresponding to elements in `ds[nxt]` that were originally 0 is now set to `cur`, it implies that there is a possibility that `ds[nxt]` could contain elements as long as it is not empty. 

To execute the loop for the first time, we need `nxt` to be a valid index and `ds[nxt]` to contain at least one element. The value of `el` will be the first element in `ds[nxt]`. 

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `tov` has one less element after popping `nxt`, for the loop to execute the first time `ds[nxt]` has at least 1 element, and `el` is the first element of `ds[nxt]`**
