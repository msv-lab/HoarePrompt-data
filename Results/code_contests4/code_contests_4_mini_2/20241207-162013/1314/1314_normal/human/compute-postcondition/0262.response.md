According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the contents of `dmain[nxt]`. The loop iterates over the elements in `dmain[nxt]`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n`, `nxt` is the last element of `sv` before popping, `dmain[nxt]` contains at least 1 element, and `el` is in `vis`. Since `nxt` is now removed from `dmain[nxt]`, we need to check the updated state of `dmain[nxt]` for the next iteration.

For the loop to execute one more time, `dmain[nxt]` must still contain at least one element after the current iteration. Since `dmain[nxt]` had at least one element before the iteration, we can assume it contained more than one element, and we need to adjust `el` to the next element in `dmain[nxt]`.

State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `nxt` is the last element of `sv` before popping, `dmain[nxt]` must still contain at least 1 element for the loop to execute one more time, and `el` is the next element in `dmain[nxt]`**.
