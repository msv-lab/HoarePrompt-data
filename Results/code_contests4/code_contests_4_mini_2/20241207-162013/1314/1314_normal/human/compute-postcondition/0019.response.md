The code `dmain[f].add(s)` adds the value `s` to the set associated with the key `f` in the dictionary `dmain`. The variables `n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, and `i` are not affected by this operation. The state of `dmain` is updated to include `s` in the set for `f`. Therefore, the Output State reflects the previous values of the variables and notes the change in `dmain`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 1, `D` is an integer, `ds` is a defaultdict with sets, `dmain[f]` includes `s`, `i` is 1, and `s` is added to the set associated with `f` in `dmain.**
