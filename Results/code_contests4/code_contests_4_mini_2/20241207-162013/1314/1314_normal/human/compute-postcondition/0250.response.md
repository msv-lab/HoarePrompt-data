Postcondition: ***`i` is equal to `n`, `nxt` is a valid index for `dmain`, `dmain[nxt]` contains at least one more element, and `el` is the next element in `dmain[nxt]`. If `el` is not in `vis`, then `vis` is updated with `el`, `res` contains the updated list with the new element appended, and `sv` is updated with `el`. If `el` is already in `vis`, then the values of `vis`, `res`, and `sv` remain unchanged.***
