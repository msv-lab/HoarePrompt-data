The code assigns the value of `cur` to the element at index `el` in the list or array `arr`. The value of `cur` has been incremented by 1, so it now holds a value greater than its previous state. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `cur` is incremented by 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is incremented by 1, `tov` now includes `el`, `len(tov) > 0`, `nxt` is a valid index/key in `ds`, `ds[nxt]` has at least one more element, and `el` is the next valid index/key in `ds[nxt]`; `arr[el]` is now equal to the new value of `cur`.

Output State: **`cur` is incremented by 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is incremented by 1, `tov` now includes `el`, `len(tov) > 0`, `nxt` is a valid index/key in `ds`, `ds[nxt]` has at least one more element, and `el` is the next valid index/key in `ds[nxt]`; `arr[el]` is now equal to the new value of `cur`.**
