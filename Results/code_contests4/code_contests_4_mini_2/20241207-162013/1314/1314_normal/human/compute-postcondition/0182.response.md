According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `tov`. If `len(tov)` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that `len(tov)` is greater than 0, indicating that there are still elements in `tov`.

Since the loop can execute again based on the current state, no adjustments are necessary for the variables related to `tov`. 

State: **`cur` is incremented by the total number of elements in `ds[nxt]` that were previously 0 in `arr`, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is incremented by the same number, `tov` includes all elements from `ds[nxt]` that were previously 0 in `arr`, `len(tov)` is greater than 0, `nxt` remains a valid index/key in `ds`, `arr` is updated such that `arr[el]` is equal to `cur` for all `el` added to `tov`**
