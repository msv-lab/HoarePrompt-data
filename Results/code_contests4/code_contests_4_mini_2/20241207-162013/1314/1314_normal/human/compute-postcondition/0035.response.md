To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the condition `i < n`.

1. **Current Values**: Right before the loop, we have `i` is 2 and `n` is an integer. 
2. **Condition for Execution**: For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `i < n` must be true. 
3. **Evaluating Current States**: Since `i` is currently 2, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute. The current state of `n` as an integer does not guarantee this condition is met.
4. **Adjustments Needed**: We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 2. 

Therefore, the necessary adjustment is that `n` should be at least 3. 

State: **`n` is an integer, for the loop to execute the first time then n must be greater than 2**
