The value of `cur` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `cur` is unknown. The other variables (`n` and `arr`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer and is greater than 2, `arr` is an array of integers, and `cur` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer and is greater than 2, `arr` is an array of integers, and `cur` is increased by 1**
