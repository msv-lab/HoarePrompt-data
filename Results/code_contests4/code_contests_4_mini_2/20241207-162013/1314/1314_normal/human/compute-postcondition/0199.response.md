Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 2. If `arr[i]` is 0, then `cur` is incremented by the total number of unique elements in `ds[nxt]` that were previously 0 in `arr`, `i` is incremented by the same total, `tov` is empty, `nxt` is not defined, and `arr` is updated such that `arr[el]` is equal to `cur` for all unique `el` processed.***
