The `exit()` command is called, which terminates the program execution immediately. The values of the variables remain unchanged since there are no modifications made to them before the exit. Therefore, the output state includes the existing values of all variables and indicates that the program execution has been terminated.

Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `arr` contains values assigned to `cur` at all indices that were previously 0, `cur` is greater than `D`, `tov` is empty, `nxt` is not applicable, `ds` has been completely processed for all elements that were in `tov`, and all elements in `arr` corresponding to reachable indices from the original 0 entries have been assigned the same value of `cur`; program execution has been terminated.**
