The code assigns the value of `cur` to the index `el` in the array `arr`. The value of `el` is determined as the second element in `ds[nxt]`, and since `cur` was already incremented by the number of elements in `ds[nxt]`, that value is now set in `arr` at the index `el`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `cur` is incremented by the number of elements in `ds[nxt]`, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is incremented, `tov` includes all elements from `ds[nxt]` that were previously 0 in `arr`, `len(tov) > 0`, `nxt` is a valid index/key in `ds`, `ds[nxt]` is a non-empty iterable, `el` is the second element in `ds[nxt]`, and `arr[el]` is now equal to `cur`.

Output State: **`cur` is incremented by the number of elements in `ds[nxt]`, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is incremented, `tov` includes all elements from `ds[nxt]` that were previously 0 in `arr`, `len(tov) > 0`, `nxt` is a valid index/key in `ds`, `ds[nxt]` is a non-empty iterable, `el` is the second element in `ds[nxt]`, and `arr[el]` is now equal to `cur.**
