The value of `el` is added to the set `tov`. The initial state indicates that `tov` includes `el`, so after executing the code, `el` will remain in `tov` with no change in size since it was already present. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `arr` has been updated at index `el`, `tov` includes `el`, `nxt` is updated to the last element of `tov`, `ds[nxt]` contains at least 3 elements, `el` is set to the third element in `ds[nxt]`, and `arr[el]` is now equal to `cur`, and `el` is added to `tov` (but `tov` remains unchanged in size).
