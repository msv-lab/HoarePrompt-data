The code `tov.add(el)` adds the value of `el` to the set `tov`. Since `tov` already has one more element after adding `el`, the addition of `el` will update `tov` to include this new element. The previous values of the affected variables will remain unchanged aside from `tov`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2; `tov` now includes `el`; `ds[nxt]` has at least 3 elements; `el` is the third element of `ds[nxt]`; `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2; `tov` now includes `el`; `ds[nxt]` has at least 3 elements; `el` is the third element of `ds[nxt]`; `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`.**
