The statement `ds[s].add(f)` adds the integer value of `f` to the set associated with the key `s` in the defaultdict `ds`. The values of `s` and `f` are both integers, and `ds` can hold sets of integers. Other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 2, `D` is an integer, `ds` is a defaultdict with sets, `dmain[f]` includes `s`, `i` is 2, `s` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, and `f` has been added to the set `ds[s]`.**
