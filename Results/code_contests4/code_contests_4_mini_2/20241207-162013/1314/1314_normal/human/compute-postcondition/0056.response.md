According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tov`. If `tov` has a length greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, it is given that `len(tov)` is greater than 0 since `tov` contains all elements that had `arr[el]` equal to 0. Therefore, the loop can execute one more time without any adjustments needed to the states.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `arr` contains values assigned to `cur` at indices specified by `tov`, `cur` is the next value after the last assigned value, `tov` contains all elements that had `arr[el]` equal to 0, `nxt` is assigned the value `i`, and `ds[nxt]` contains all elements processed during the loop.**
