You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for modifying the program state so that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed. You will be provided with the program state right before the loop, which you need to modify. You will also see the `while` loop statement. If it is a `while True` loop or if the loop can certainly execute one time, please simply repeat the program state right before the loop. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State right before the while loop: `total` is 10, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer.
```
while i < n:
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?


Example Answer:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer. `n` beinng an integer does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0**

Example 2:
State right before the while loop: `total` is 0, students is 2 less than its initial value.
```
while students >=1 :
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?


Example Answer:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable students.  If students is greater than or equal to 1, the loop can execute . Rigtht before the loop, students is 2 less than its initial value, So for the loop to  executed the first time time the initial value of students needed to have been equal or greater than 3 and students currently must be greater than 1.
State: **`total` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time then students is 2 less than its initial value and students currently is greater or equal to 1**


Your Task:
State right before the while loop: `i` is equal to `n`, `arr` contains values assigned to `cur` at all indices that were previously 0, `cur` is greater than `D`, `tov` is empty, `nxt` is not applicable, `ds` has been completely processed for all elements that were in `tov`, all elements in `arr` corresponding to reachable indices from the original 0 entries have been assigned the same value of `cur`, `sviaz` contains all unique values from `arr` that were encountered during the loop, `dmain[1]` contains only those elements which were not equal to `arr[el]` for any `el` that was in `ite`, `sv` now contains the value 1, `vis` is now {1}, and `res` is assigned the list containing the string 'YES'.
```
while len(sv):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?
