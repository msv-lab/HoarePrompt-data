Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `arr` contains values assigned to `cur` at indices specified by `tov`. If the value of `arr` at index `el` is 0, then `tov` has one more element including `el`, `nxt` is assigned the last element of `tov`, and `ds[nxt]` contains at least one element processed during the loop, with `arr[el]` now equal to `cur`.***
