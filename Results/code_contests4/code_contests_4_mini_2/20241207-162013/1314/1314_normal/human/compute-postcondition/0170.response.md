The code assigns the value of `cur` to the position `arr[el]`. Since `el` is the first element in `ds[nxt]`, and `arr[el]` is currently 0, it will now be updated to the value of `cur`. The previous states of the other variables are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`cur` is incremented by the number of elements in `ds[nxt]`, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is incremented, `tov` includes all elements from `ds[nxt]` that were previously 0 in `arr`, `len(tov) > 0`, `nxt` is a valid index/key in `ds`, `ds[nxt]` is a non-empty iterable, `el` is the first element in `ds[nxt]`, and now `arr[el]` is set to `cur`.**
