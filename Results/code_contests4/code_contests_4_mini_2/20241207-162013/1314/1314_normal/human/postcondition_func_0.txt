The function accepts integers `n`, `m`, and `D`, along with a list of edges represented by pairs of integers. It checks if vertex 1 has at least `D` connections; if not, it outputs 'NO'. It then verifies if the number of connected components (excluding vertex 1) exceeds `D`, again outputting 'NO' if this is the case. Finally, the function constructs and prints the connections in a specific format if the conditions are met. The function does not return a value but prints results directly to standard output.
