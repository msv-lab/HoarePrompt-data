To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze whether it correctly finds a spanning tree with the specified degree for vertex 1, or determines that no such tree exists.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads integers `n`, `m`, and `D`, which represent the number of vertices, the number of edges, and the required degree of the first vertex, respectively.
   - It then reads `m` pairs of integers representing the edges of the graph.

2. **Graph Representation**:
   - The program uses two dictionaries (`ds` and `dmain`) to represent the graph. `ds` holds edges excluding those connected to vertex 1, while `dmain` holds all edges.

3. **Degree Check**:
   - The first check is to see if the degree of vertex 1 (i.e., the length of `dmain[1]`) is less than `D`. If it is, the program correctly prints "NO" since it's not possible to fulfill the requirement.

4. **Connected Component Check**:
   - The program uses a modified BFS/DFS approach to identify reachable vertices and assigns them a component number in `arr`. It counts the number of unique components (`cur`).
   - If `cur` (the number of unique components) is greater than `D`, it correctly prints "NO" because it's impossible to connect all components while maintaining the degree condition.

5. **Spanning Tree Construction**:
   - The program attempts to construct a spanning tree starting from vertex 1. It maintains a set of visited vertices (`vis`) and a stack of vertices to explore (`sv`).
   - For each vertex processed, it adds edges to the result list `res` while ensuring that edges do not connect vertices already included in the spanning tree.

6. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program outputs "YES" followed by the edges of the spanning tree.

### Correctness Evaluation:

- The program correctly checks for the necessary conditions (degree of vertex 1, connected components) before proceeding to construct a spanning tree.
- It adheres to the limits of the problem, ensuring that the degree of vertex 1 is exactly `D` if possible and that all edges belong to the original set of edges provided.
- By maintaining a set of visited vertices and only connecting unvisited vertices, it constructs a valid spanning tree if one exists.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- If the graph is sparse or highly connected, the program still follows the logic to ensure that the degree condition on vertex 1 is met.
- If there are not enough edges to fulfill the degree requirement for vertex 1, it correctly outputs "NO".

### Conclusion:
Given that the program correctly implements the necessary checks and constructs a valid spanning tree when possible, it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
