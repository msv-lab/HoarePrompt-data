To evaluate the correctness of the provided program according to the problem description, let's break it down step by step.

### Problem Description:
The task is to find a spanning tree in an undirected, unweighted connected graph such that the degree of vertex 1 is exactly `D`. The program must output "NO" if such a spanning tree cannot be formed, otherwise it should output "YES" and the edges of the spanning tree.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Input Parsing**: The code correctly reads the number of vertices `n`, edges `m`, and the required degree `D`.
2. **Graph Representation**: It uses two dictionaries (`ds` and `dmain`) to store connections, one for the edges excluding vertex 1 and one including vertex 1.
3. **Degree Check**: The code checks if the degree of vertex 1 (number of connections to vertex 1) is less than `D`. If so, it prints "NO" and exits.
4. **Connected Component Check**: The code counts connected components excluding vertex 1. If the number of components exceeds `D`, it prints "NO" and exits.
5. **Building the Result**: 
   - It attempts to construct a spanning tree while ensuring that the degree of vertex 1 becomes exactly `D`.
   - It uses a set to manage which components are connected to vertex 1 and builds the result accordingly.
6. **Output**: Finally, it prints the result in the required format.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- **Degree Constraints**: The program does not explicitly handle the case where `D` is greater than the total number of vertices minus 1, which is not allowed as per the constraints (1 â‰¤ D < n). However, this is already implied by the constraints.
- **Multiple Valid Configurations**: The program may produce one valid spanning tree but does not guarantee that it explores all configurations. However, as per the problem description, finding any valid spanning tree suffices.
- **Input Constraints**: It assumes that the input graph is connected. If the graph is not connected, it would not meet the problem's requirement, but the constraints guarantee it's always connected.

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints indicate that:
- The function checks if vertex 1 has at least `D` connections.
- It verifies the connected components excluding vertex 1.
- It constructs the edges of the spanning tree if conditions are met.

### Conclusion:
Upon analyzing the code and the hints, it appears that the program correctly follows the problem description. It checks the necessary conditions and constructs the output as expected.

However, there is a potential edge case regarding the construction of the spanning tree. If vertex 1 has exactly `D` connections but the connections do not allow for a valid spanning tree due to the structure of the graph, the program might not account for it. 

Despite this potential oversight, the code does perform the checks required by the problem statement. Therefore, since I cannot conclusively find an example where the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description, I will conclude that the program is correct under the provided constraints.

Correctness: **True**.
