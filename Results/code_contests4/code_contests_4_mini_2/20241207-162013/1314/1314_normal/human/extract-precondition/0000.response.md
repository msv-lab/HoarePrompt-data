Precondition: **n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph (2 ≤ n ≤ 200000), m is an integer representing the number of edges in the graph (n - 1 ≤ m ≤ min(200000, (n(n-1))/(2))), D is an integer representing the required degree of the first vertex (1 ≤ D < n), and the edges are defined by m pairs of integers (v_i, u_i) where 1 ≤ v_i, u_i ≤ n and v_i ≠ u_i, ensuring no self-loops or multiple edges exist.**
