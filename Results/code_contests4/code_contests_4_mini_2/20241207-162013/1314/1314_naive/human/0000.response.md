To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the code and identify any potential edge cases or scenarios where it may not produce the expected output.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to find a spanning tree in an undirected graph such that the degree of vertex 1 is exactly D. The code must correctly handle the following cases:
1. If vertex 1 has fewer edges than D, it should return "NO".
2. If the number of vertices connected to vertex 1 is sufficient to meet the degree D, it should attempt to construct such a spanning tree.
3. It should ensure that the constructed spanning tree is valid and doesn't exceed the degree of vertex 1.

### Code Analysis
1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of vertices (n), edges (m), and the required degree (D). It builds adjacency lists for the graph.
2. **Degree Check**: It checks if vertex 1 has enough edges to potentially achieve degree D.
3. **Graph Traversal**: The code uses a loop to ensure that all vertices are reachable while respecting the degree constraints for vertex 1.
4. **Spanning Tree Construction**: It constructs the spanning tree using a depth-first search-like approach while ensuring vertex 1 maintains its degree D.

### Potential Edge Cases
1. **Insufficient Edges**: If vertex 1 has exactly D edges but there are not enough vertices to connect, the tree cannot be completed.
2. **Degree Matching**: If the number of edges connected to vertex 1 is more than D, it might still be necessary to ensure that the spanning tree constructed only uses D edges.

### Example Case Where It Might Fail
Consider the following graph:
```
4 3 3
1 2
2 3
3 4
```
In this case:
- The graph has 4 vertices and 3 edges.
- The required degree for vertex 1 is 3, but vertex 1 is only connected to vertex 2. Thus, it cannot have a degree of 3.

Expected Output: "NO"
Actual Output from the provided code: "NO" (correct output)

### Further Case
Consider a case where the edges are:
```
5 4 2
1 2
1 3
2 4
3 5
```
In this case:
- Vertex 1 has degree 2, and it can connect to vertices 2 and 3.
- The spanning tree can be constructed correctly like:
```
1 2
1 3
2 4
```
Expected Output: "YES" with the appropriate edges.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the program and considering various cases, the program seems to handle the requirements correctly. It checks for sufficient edges, constructs the spanning tree while ensuring the degree constraints, and produces the correct output in the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**.
