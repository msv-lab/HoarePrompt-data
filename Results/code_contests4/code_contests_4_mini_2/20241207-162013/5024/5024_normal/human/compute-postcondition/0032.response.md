The value of `res` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `n_moves`. Since `n_moves` is either less than 0 or greater than or equal to 0, and its value depends on the conditions elaborated in the initial state, the specific value of `n_moves` is taken into account. However, the exact values of `res` and `n_moves` are not explicitly provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects that `res` is now the maximum value between its previous state and `n_moves`.

Output State: **`res` is updated to the maximum value between its previous value and `n_moves`**
