According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `end` list. If the `end` list has more than 1 element, the loop will execute again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `index` is 0, and `val` is the first value in `end`. To execute the loop one more time, `index` needs to be increased by 1, which means it should become 1, and `val` should be the second value in `end`. 

State: **`start_m` is a dictionary mapping each unique value in `start` to its index; `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000); `start` is a list of integers with at least n elements; `end` is a list with at least 2 elements; `index` is 1; `val` is the second value in `end`; `end_m[val]` is assigned the value of `index`, which is 1.**
