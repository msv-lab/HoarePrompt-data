The variable `n_moves` is assigned the value `n - i1`. The previous value of `i1` is known, and `n` is also known. Therefore, `n_moves` is calculated based on these values. The values of other variables are not directly affected by this assignment. 

The output state will reflect the updated value of `n_moves` while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`start_m` is a dictionary with at least one entry remaining; `res` is the maximum value between its previous value and `n_moves`; `v1` is the next key in `start_m`; `i1` is the corresponding value in `start_m` for `v1`; `i2` is assigned the value of `end_m[v1]; n_moves` is updated as `n - i1**
