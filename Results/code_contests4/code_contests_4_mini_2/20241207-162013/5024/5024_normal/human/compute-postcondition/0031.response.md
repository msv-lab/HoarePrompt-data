Postcondition: ***`start_m` is a dictionary with at least one entry remaining; `res` is the maximum value between its previous value and `n_moves`. If `n_moves` is less than 0, then `n_moves` is updated as `i2 - i1`, where `i2` is assigned the value of `end_m[v1]`; otherwise, `n_moves` is updated as `n - i1`.***
