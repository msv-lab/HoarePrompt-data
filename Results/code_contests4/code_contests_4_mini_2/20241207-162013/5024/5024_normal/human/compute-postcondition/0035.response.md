Output State: **`res` is updated to the maximum value between its previous value and `n_moves`, `start_m` has at least one more item for the loop to execute a second time, `i1` will be the next corresponding value in the iteration, `i2` is assigned the value of `end_m[v1]`, and `n_moves` is calculated as `i2 - i1`.**
