According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `end` list. If `index` is less than the length of `end`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `index` is 1 and `val` is the second value in `end`. Since `end` has at least 2 elements, for the loop to execute one more time, `index` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. Additionally, `val` would then be the third value in `end`.

State: **`start_m` is a dictionary mapping each unique value in `start` to its index; `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000); `start` is a list of integers with at least n elements; `end` is a list with at least 3 elements; `index` is 2; `val` is the third value in `end`; `end_m[val]` is assigned the value of `index`, which is 2.**
