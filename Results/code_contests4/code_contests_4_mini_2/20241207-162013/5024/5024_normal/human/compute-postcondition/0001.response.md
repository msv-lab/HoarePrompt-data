The variable `start` is assigned a list of integers created by splitting the input line from `sys.stdin.readline()` and converting each split string to an integer. The specific values of the elements in `start` depend on the input provided, but the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000); `start` is a list of integers from input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000); `start` is a list of integers from input.**
