Postcondition: ***`res` is updated to the maximum value between its previous value and `n_moves`. If `n_moves` is less than 0, then `n_moves` is updated to `n - i1` after being calculated as `i2 - i1`, where `i2` is assigned the value of `end_m[v1]` and `i1` will be the next corresponding value in the iteration. Furthermore, `start_m` has at least one more item for the loop to execute a second time.***
