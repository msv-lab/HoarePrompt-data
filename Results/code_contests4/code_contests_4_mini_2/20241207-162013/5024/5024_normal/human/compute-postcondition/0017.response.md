The code assigns the value of `index`, which is 2, to the key `val` in the dictionary `end_m`. The previous state of `end_m[val]` is unknown, but it now holds the value 2. Other variables are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`start_m` is a dictionary mapping each unique value in `start` to its index; `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000); `start` is a list of integers with at least n elements; `end` is a list with at least 3 elements; `index` is 2; `val` is the third value in `end`; `end_m[val]` is assigned the value of 2.**
