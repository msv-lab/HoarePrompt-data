The code initializes `start_m` as an empty dictionary. This does not affect the values of `n`, `start`, or `end`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000); `start` is a list of integers from input; `end` is a list of integers obtained from input; `start_m` is an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000); `start` is a list of integers from input; `end` is a list of integers obtained from input; `start_m` is an empty dictionary.**
