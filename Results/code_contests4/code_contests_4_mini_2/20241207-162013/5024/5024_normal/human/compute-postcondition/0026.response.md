Output State: **`start_m` is a dictionary with at least one entry; `res` is the maximum value between its previous value and `n_moves`; `v1` is the first key in `start_m`; `i1` is the corresponding value in `start_m` for `v1`; `i2` is the value of `end_m[v1]`; `n_moves` is calculated as `i2 - i1` and updated if less than 0.**
