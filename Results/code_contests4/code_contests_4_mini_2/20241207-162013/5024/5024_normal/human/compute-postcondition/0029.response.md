The value of `n_moves` is assigned the result of `i2 - i1`. The previous values of `i2` (from `end_m[v1]`) and `i1` (from `start_m[v1]`) are used to calculate `n_moves`. Depending on these values, `n_moves` could be positive, negative, or zero. The output state will reflect the changes. 

Output State: **`start_m` is a dictionary with at least one entry remaining; `res` is the maximum value between its previous value and `n_moves`; `v1` is the next key in `start_m`; `i1` is the corresponding value in `start_m` for `v1`; `i2` is assigned the value of `end_m[v1]`; `n_moves` is updated as `i2 - i1`.**
