The provided program attempts to calculate the number of moves required to convert one permutation into another using the rules specified in the problem description. However, upon reviewing the logic of the program, it becomes clear that it does not correctly implement the solution as required.

Here's why the program is incorrect:

1. **Misinterpretation of Moves**: The program calculates the difference in indices between the two permutations to determine the number of moves. However, it only keeps track of the maximum number of moves found (`res = max(res, n_moves)`), which does not accurately reflect the total number of moves needed to transform the first permutation into the second. The problem states that each move consists of removing the last number and inserting it back, and the program does not calculate how many such moves are actually needed to achieve the transformation.

2. **Circular Nature Not Handled Correctly**: The logic of adjusting for circular movement (`if n_moves < 0: n_moves = n - i1`) is flawed in the context of the problem. The moves should be counted based on how many elements are already in place in the target order rather than the maximum displacement of any single element.

3. **Output Incorrect**: The output `print(res)` simply prints the maximum number of moves calculated, which does not correspond to the minimum moves needed to convert the entire permutation as stated in the problem description.

To illustrate, consider the input:
```
5
1 5 2 3 4
1 2 3 4 5
```
The expected output is `3`, but the program might not reach this conclusion due to its flawed logic in calculating moves.

Given these points, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
