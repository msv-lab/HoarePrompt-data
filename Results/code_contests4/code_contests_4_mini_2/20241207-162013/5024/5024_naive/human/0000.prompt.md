You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Happy PMP is freshman and he is learning about algorithmic problems. He enjoys playing algorithmic games a lot.

One of the seniors gave Happy PMP a nice game. He is given two permutations of numbers 1 through n and is asked to convert the first one to the second. In one move he can remove the last number from the permutation of numbers and inserts it back in an arbitrary position. He can either insert last number between any two consecutive numbers, or he can place it at the beginning of the permutation.

Happy PMP has an algorithm that solves the problem. But it is not fast enough. He wants to know the minimum number of moves to convert the first permutation to the second. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·105) — the quantity of the numbers in the both given permutations. 

Next line contains n space-separated integers — the first permutation. Each number between 1 to n will appear in the permutation exactly once. 

Next line describe the second permutation in the same format.

Output

Print a single integer denoting the minimum number of moves required to convert the first permutation to the second.

Examples

Input

3
3 2 1
1 2 3


Output

2


Input

5
1 2 3 4 5
1 5 2 3 4


Output

1


Input

5
1 5 2 3 4
1 2 3 4 5


Output

3

Note

In the first sample, he removes number 1 from end of the list and places it at the beginning. After that he takes number 2 and places it between 1 and 3.

In the second sample, he removes number 5 and inserts it after 1.

In the third sample, the sequence of changes are like this: 

  * 1 5 2 3 4 
  * 1 4 5 2 3 
  * 1 3 4 5 2 
  * 1 2 3 4 5 

So he needs three moves.
Program:
```
n = int(sys.stdin.readline())
start = [int(x) for x in sys.stdin.readline().split()]
end = [int(x) for x in sys.stdin.readline().split()]
start_m = {}
for (index, val) in enumerate(start):
    start_m[val] = index
end_m = {}
for (index, val) in enumerate(end):
    end_m[val] = index
res = 0
for (v1, i1) in start_m.items():
    i2 = end_m[v1]
    n_moves = i2 - i1
    if n_moves < 0:
        n_moves = n - i1
    res = max(res, n_moves)
print(res)
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
