To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the problem description and the logic implemented in the code.

### Problem Description:
The problem states that there are `n` east to west paths and `n` north to south paths, resulting in `n^2` intersections. We need to count the number of ways to place 5 benches on these intersections, ensuring that each bench is placed on a different path (i.e., no two benches can be on the same east to west or north to south path).

### Analyzing the Program:
The program includes a function `func_1` which calculates the number of ways to choose 5 paths from `n` paths without replacement and without regard to the order. The logic appears to be trying to calculate combinations, but it does so in a convoluted way. 

The main line in the program:
```python
x = n * (n - 4) * (n - 3) * (n - 2) * (n - 1) * func_1(n, 5)
```
is questionable. The combination for placing 5 benches should be calculated as choosing 5 distinct paths from `n`, which can be represented as:
\[ C(n, 5) = \frac{n!}{5!(n-5)!} \]

However, the implementation does not correctly represent this formula. 

### Potential Issues:
1. **Incorrect Combinatorial Logic**: The way the program calculates combinations (using the `func_1`) is not standard and could lead to incorrect results.
2. **Division Issues**: The division `r / s` in `func_1` could lead to float results which may not be appropriate since we need the count of ways as an integer.
3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where `n < 5` properly since the problem states `5 ≤ n ≤ 100`.

### Example Case:
If we take `n = 5`, we expect the output to be `120`, which is correct. However, if we test with `n = 6`, the output should be:
\[ C(6, 5) = 6 \]
The program should give the correct output for this case, but we cannot be sure of its correctness due to the potential miscalculations.

Taking all of this into consideration, we can conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not implement the combinatorial logic correctly and could yield incorrect results for cases where `n > 5`.
