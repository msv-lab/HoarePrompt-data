To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze the problem description and the code provided.

The problem states that we need to count the number of ways to place five benches on the intersections of `n` east-west and `n` north-south paths. The benches must be placed such that each is on a unique intersection, and no path can have more than one bench. 

The number of intersections is `n^2`, and we need to select 5 intersections from these. The mathematical formulation to select `k` items from `n` items is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!). Therefore, for our case, we need to calculate C(n^2, 5) to find the number of ways to place the benches.

Now, let's analyze the program:

1. The function `func_1(n, a)` appears to compute a factorial-like operation but is not explicitly calculating combinations correctly.
2. The main calculation `x = n * (n - 4) * (n - 3) * (n - 2) * (n - 1) * func_1(n, 5)` does not correspond to the correct combination formula, as it seems to be multiplying `n` by decreasing values rather than calculating the actual combinatorial selection.
3. The formula `n * (n - 4) * (n - 3) * (n - 2) * (n - 1)` does not correctly compute the selection of 5 intersections from `n^2`, which is what is required to find the number of ways to arrange the benches.

For example, consider the input `n = 5`:
- The total intersections would be `5^2 = 25`.
- The correct number of ways to choose 5 intersections from 25 is C(25, 5), which is computed as 25! / (5! * (25 - 5)!) = 53130.
- The program outputs `120` for this case, which is incorrect.

Since the program does not implement the correct logic to calculate the number of ways to place the benches, we can conclude that there are cases where the program does not work as expected.

Correctness: **False**
