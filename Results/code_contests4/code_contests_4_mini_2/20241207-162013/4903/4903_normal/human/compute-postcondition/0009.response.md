According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the variable `a`. If `i` is less than `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. Since `n` is an integer such that 5 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, we don't have a specific value for `a`, but it must be at least 1 for the loop to execute again. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `a` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 5 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `p` is `n - 1`, `r` is equal to `n`, `s` is 1, `g` is 2, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `a` must be greater than 1**
