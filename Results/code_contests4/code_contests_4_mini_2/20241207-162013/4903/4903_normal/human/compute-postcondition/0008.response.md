`g` is incremented by 1, and since the initial value of `g` is 1, after execution, `g` becomes 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 5 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `p` is `n - 1`, `r` is equal to `n`, `s` is 1, `g` is 2, `i` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 5 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `p` is `n - 1`, `r` is equal to `n`, `s` is 1, `g` is 2, `i` is 0**
