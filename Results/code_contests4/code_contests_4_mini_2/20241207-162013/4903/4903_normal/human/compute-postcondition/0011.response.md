The value of `p` is decremented by 1, and since `p` was previously defined as `n - 1`, the new value of `p` will be `n - 2`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 5 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `p` is `n - 2`; `r` is `n * (n - 1)`; `s` is 1; `g` is 2; `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 5 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `p` is `n - 2`; `r` is `n * (n - 1)`; `s` is 1; `g` is 2; `i` is 1**
