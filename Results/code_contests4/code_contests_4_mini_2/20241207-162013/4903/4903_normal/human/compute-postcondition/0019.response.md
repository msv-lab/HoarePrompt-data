To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we need to analyze how the variables change during the loop execution. 

The loop iterates `a` times, where `a` is not defined in the initial state. However, since `p` starts at `n` and decrements by 1 with each iteration, `p` will reach `n - a` after `a` iterations. The value of `r` is calculated as the product of all values from `n` down to `n - a + 1`, which is equal to `n! / (n - a)!`. The variable `s` accumulates the sum of the first `a` integers, which can be calculated using the formula for the sum of the first `a` integers: `s = a * (a + 1) / 2`. The variable `g` starts at 1 and increments by 1 with each iteration, resulting in `g` being equal to `a + 1` after all iterations.

Therefore, the final state of the variables after the loop executes `a` times can be summarized as follows:

- `p` is `n - a`
- `r` is `n! / (n - a)!` (which is the product of the integers from `n` down to `n - a + 1`)
- `s` is `a * (a + 1) / 2`
- `g` is `a + 1`

Assuming that `a` is set such that the loop executes fully, we can summarize the output state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 5 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `p` is `n - a`; `r` is equal to `n! / (n - a)!`; `s` is `a * (a + 1) / 2;` `g` is `a + 1`.**
