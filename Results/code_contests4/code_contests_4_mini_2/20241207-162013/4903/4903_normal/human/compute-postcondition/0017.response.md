The value of `s` is assigned the result of `s * g`. Initially, `s` is 2 and `g` is 3, so after execution, `s` becomes `2 * 3`, which equals 6. The other variables (`n`, `p`, `r`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 5 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `p` is `n - 3`; `r` is `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2)`; `s` is 6; `g` is 3; `i` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 5 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `p` is `n - 3`; `r` is `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2)`; `s` is 6; `g` is 3; `i` is 2**
