The value of `r` is updated to `r * p`. The current value of `p` is equal to `n`, which is an integer between 5 and 100. Since `r` is initially 1, after the execution, `r` will be equal to `1 * n`, which is `n`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 5 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `p` is equal to `n`, `r` is equal to `n`, `s` is 1, `g` is 1, `i` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 5 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `p` is equal to `n`, `r` is equal to `n`, `s` is 1, `g` is 1, `i` is 0**
