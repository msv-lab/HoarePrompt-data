The value of `s` is updated by multiplying it with `g`. Given that `s` is initially 1 and `g` is also 1, the calculation results in `s` remaining 1. The other variables (`n`, `p`, `r`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 5 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `p` is `n - 1`, `r` is equal to `n`, `s` is 1, `g` is 1, `i` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 5 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `p` is `n - 1`, `r` is equal to `n`, `s` is 1, `g` is 1, `i` is 0**
