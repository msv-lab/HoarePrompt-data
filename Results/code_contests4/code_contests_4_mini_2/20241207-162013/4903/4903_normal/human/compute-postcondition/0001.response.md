`s` is assigned the value of 1. The values of the other variables (`n` and `r`) remain unchanged since they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 5 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `r` is 1, and `s` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 5 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `r` is 1, `s` is 1**
