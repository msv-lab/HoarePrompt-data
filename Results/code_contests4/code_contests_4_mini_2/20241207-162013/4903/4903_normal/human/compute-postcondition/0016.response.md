The value of `p` is decremented by 1. Since `p` is initially `n - 2`, after the operation, `p` will be `n - 3`. The values of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 5 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `p` is `n - 3`; `r` is `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2)`; `s` is 2; `g` is 3; `i` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 5 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `p` is `n - 3`; `r` is `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2)`; `s` is 2; `g` is 3; `i` is 2**
