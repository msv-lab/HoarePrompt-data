`p` is assigned the value of `n`. The value of `n` can be any integer such that 5 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, so `p` will take on any value in that range as well. The states of the other variables `r` and `s` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 5 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `p` is equal to `n`; `r` is 1; `s` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 5 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `p` is equal to `n`; `r` is 1; `s` is 1**
