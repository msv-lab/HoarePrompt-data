`p` is decremented by 1. Since `p` is initially equal to `n`, the new value of `p` will be `n - 1`. The values of `n`, `r`, `s`, `g`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 5 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `p` is `n - 1`, `r` is equal to `n`, `s` is 1, `g` is 1, `i` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 5 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `p` is `n - 1`, `r` is equal to `n`, `s` is 1, `g` is 1, `i` is 0**
