The value of `g` is incremented by 1. Since `g` is initially 3, after the execution, `g` will be 4. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 5 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `p` is `n - 3`; `r` is `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2)`; `s` is 6; `g` is 4; `i` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 5 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `p` is `n - 3`; `r` is `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2)`; `s` is 6; `g` is 4; `i` is 2**
