`g` is assigned the value 1, which does not affect any other variables. The values of `n`, `p`, `r`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 5 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `p` is equal to `n`; `r` is 1; `s` is 1; `g` is 1.  
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 5 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `p` is equal to `n`; `r` is 1; `s` is 1; `g` is 1**
