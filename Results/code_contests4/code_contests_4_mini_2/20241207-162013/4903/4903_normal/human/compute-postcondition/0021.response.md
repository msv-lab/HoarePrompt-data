The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that 5 ≤ n ≤ 100, while the parameter `a` is not used in the function. The function computes the value of `r` as n! / (n - a)! and `s` as a * (a + 1) / 2, and then returns the value of r divided by s. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept an integer `n` within the specified range and a parameter `a` that is not used, and return the result of the division of a specific calculation involving factorials and another arithmetic operation. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer parameter n (where 5 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a parameter a (which is not used), and returns the value of r divided by s, where r is n! / (n - a)! and s is a * (a + 1) / 2.**
