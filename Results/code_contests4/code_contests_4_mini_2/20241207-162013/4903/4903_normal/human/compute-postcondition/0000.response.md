The variable `r` is assigned the value `1`. The variable `n` remains unchanged, and `a` is not affected since it is not used in the function. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 5 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `r` is 1, and `a` is not used in the function.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 5 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `r` is 1, and `a` is not used in the function.**
