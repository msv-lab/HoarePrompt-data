The value of `g` is incremented by 1, and since `g` is initially 2, after execution, `g` becomes 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 5 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `p` is `n - 2`; `r` is `n * (n - 1)`; `s` is 2; `g` is 3; `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 5 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `p` is `n - 2`; `r` is `n * (n - 1)`; `s` is 2; `g` is 3; `i` is 1**
