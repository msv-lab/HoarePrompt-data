According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the range defined by `a`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `a`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` becomes 2. To execute again, `a` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 5 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `p` is `n - 2`; `r` is `n * (n - 1)`; `s` is 2; `g` is 3; `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `a` must be greater than 2**
