To determine the output state after executing the provided code, let's analyze the impact step by step.

1. The variable `r` is assigned the value of `r * p`.
2. The initial state indicates:
   - `n` is an integer such that 5 ≤ `n` ≤ 100.
   - `p` is `n - 1`.
   - `r` is equal to `n`.
3. Therefore, substituting for `p`:
   - `p = n - 1`
   - `r = n`
4. After the operation `r = r * p`, we calculate:
   - `r = n * (n - 1)`
5. Other variables `s`, `g`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Thus, the new value of `r` becomes `n * (n - 1)`, while `p`, `s`, `g`, and `i` retain their values.

The output state reflects the relationship and changes among the variables:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 5 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `p` is `n - 1`; `r` is `n * (n - 1)`; `s` is 1; `g` is 2; `i` is 1**
