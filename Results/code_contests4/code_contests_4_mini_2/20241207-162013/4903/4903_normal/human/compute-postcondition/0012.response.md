`s` is assigned the value `s * g`. The previous value of `s` is 1 and `g` is 2, so after execution, `s` will be 1 * 2 = 2. The states of the other variables (`n`, `p`, `r`, `i`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 5 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `p` is `n - 2`; `r` is `n * (n - 1)`; `s` is 2; `g` is 2; `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 5 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `p` is `n - 2`; `r` is `n * (n - 1)`; `s` is 2; `g` is 2; `i` is 1**
