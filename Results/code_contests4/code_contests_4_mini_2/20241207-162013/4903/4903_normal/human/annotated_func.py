#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 5 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a is not used in the function.
def func_1(n, a):
    r = 1
    s = 1
    p = n
    g = 1
    for i in range(a):
        r = r * p
        
        p -= 1
        
        s = s * g
        
        g += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 5 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `p` is `n - a`; `r` is equal to `n! / (n - a)!`; `s` is `a * (a + 1) / 2;` `g` is `a + 1`.
    return r / s
    #The program returns the value of r divided by s, where r is the result of n! / (n - a)! and s is a * (a + 1) / 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` (where 5 ≤ n ≤ 100) and an integer `a`, and calculates the value of `r / s`, where `r` is the product of `n` down to `n-a+1` (equivalent to `n! / (n - a)!`), and `s` is the sum of the first `a` integers (which is `a * (a + 1) / 2`). The parameter `a` is used in the loop to determine how many terms to multiply for `r` but does not have any constraints in the code, which could lead to unexpected behavior if `a` is not within a reasonable range. The function does not handle cases where `a` is greater than `n`, which would result in `r` being computed with a negative range, leading to incorrect outputs.
