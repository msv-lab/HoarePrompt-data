Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the number of ways to place five benches on the intersections of paths, as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Function Parameters**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `n` and `a`, but the problem description only specifies `n`, the number of paths. The value of `a` (number of benches) is hardcoded as 5 in the problem description but is not specified in the function's parameters.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Counting**: The logic implemented in the function appears to be calculating the permutations of placing `a` benches on `n` intersections without ensuring that each bench is placed on a different path. The formula used in the return statement, `r / s`, does not directly correspond to the combinatorial problem of selecting 5 intersections from `n*n`, which is the actual requirement.

3. **Output Value**: The output of the function does not match the expected output of 120 for the input of `n = 5`. The problem states that there are 120 ways to place the benches, which is derived from the combinatorial selection of 5 paths from 25 intersections (5 east-west and 5 north-south), but the function does not implement this logic correctly.

In summary, the program fails to implement the correct combinatorial counting needed to solve the problem as specified in the description, leading to an incorrect result.
