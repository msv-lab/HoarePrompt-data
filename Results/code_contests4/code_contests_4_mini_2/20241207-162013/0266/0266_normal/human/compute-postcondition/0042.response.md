Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `first` is updated to `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`, `last` is updated to `ord(s[-1]) - ord('a')`, `dyn[first][last]` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `len(s)`, `s` is an input string. If `dyn[j][first]` is greater than 0, then `dyn[0][last]` is updated to `dyn[0][first] + len(s)`.***
