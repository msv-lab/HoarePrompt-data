The value of `dyn[j][last]` is assigned the result of `dyn[j][first] + len(s)`. The previous values are: `j` is 3, `last` is updated to `ord(s[-1]) - ord('a')`, and `first` is updated to `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`. 

Since `dyn[j][last]` is being updated, we need the previous value of `dyn[j][first]` and the length of `s`. The value of `len(s)` is known but not specified. 

Thus, the output state indicates that `dyn[3][last]` is updated based on the previous values of `dyn` and the length of `s`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `first` is updated to `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`, `last` is updated to `ord(s[-1]) - ord('a')`, `dyn[3][last]` is updated to `dyn[3][first] + len(s)`**
