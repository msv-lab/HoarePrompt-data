According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Since `i` is initialized at 0 and increments with each iteration, it will start at 0 during the first execution of the loop. Thus, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` will be 0 during the first iteration.

State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
