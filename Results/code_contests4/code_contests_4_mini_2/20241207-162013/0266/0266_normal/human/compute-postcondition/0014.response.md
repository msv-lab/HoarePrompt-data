According to the code, the loop iterates over a range of 26, which corresponds to the letters of the alphabet. The variable `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be 2. Since the loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than 26, and given that `n` is an input integer greater than 0, there are no conditions imposed by `n` on the loop execution itself.

Thus, the relevant states to adjust for the next iteration of the loop are:
- `j` should be updated to 2.

The values of `n`, `first`, `last`, and `s` do not need to be changed since they don't affect the execution of the loop but are relevant to the loop's body.

State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is an input string, `first` is calculated as `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`, `last` is calculated as `ord(s[-1]) - ord('a')`, and `j` is 2.**
