The value of `dyn[j][last]` is assigned the result of `dyn[j][first] + len(s)`. In this case, the initial values of `first` and `last` are derived from the string `s`, which provides their respective integer indices. Since `len(s)` gives the length of the string, the exact value of `len(s)` will affect the outcome.

However, the specific values of `dyn`, `first`, `last`, and `len(s)` are not provided. Therefore, we acknowledge that the assignment updates the `dyn` array at position `[j][last]` with the computed value from `dyn[j][first] + len(s)`, but we cannot determine the exact values.

The output state indicates that the `dyn` array has been updated but does not provide the final values due to the lack of specifics.

Output State: **`dyn[j][last]` is updated to `dyn[j][first] + len(s)`**
