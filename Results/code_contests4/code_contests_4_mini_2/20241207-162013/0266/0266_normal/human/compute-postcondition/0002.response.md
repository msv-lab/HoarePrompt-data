The code initializes a two-dimensional list `dyn` with 26 rows and 26 columns, filled with zeros. This operation does not affect the values of `n` or `__author__`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `__author__` is set to 'Rikishi', and `dyn` is a 26x26 matrix filled with zeros.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `__author__` is set to 'Rikishi', `dyn` is a 26x26 matrix filled with zeros**
