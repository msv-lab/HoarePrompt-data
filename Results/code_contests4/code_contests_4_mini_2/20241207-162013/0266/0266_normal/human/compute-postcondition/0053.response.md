The code `print(ans)` outputs the value of `ans`, which is the maximum length from the diagonal of the matrix `dyn`. The value of `n` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer; `ans` is the maximum length from the diagonal of the matrix `dyn`, and `ans` has been printed.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `ans` is the maximum length from the diagonal of the matrix `dyn`, and `ans` has been printed.**
