According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than 26. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, which means the loop has executed for the first time. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 1. The loop will execute again as long as `j` is less than 26.

State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `first` is derived from the first character of `s`, `last` is `ord(s[-1]) - ord('a')`, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than 26.**
