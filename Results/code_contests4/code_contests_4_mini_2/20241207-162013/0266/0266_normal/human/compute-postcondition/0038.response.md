The variable `last` is assigned the value `ord(s[-1]) - ord('a')`, which calculates the position of the last character of the string `s` in the alphabet (0-indexed). The previous value of `last` is not provided, but it will be updated according to the last character of the input string `s`. The values of `n`, `i`, `first`, and `dyn[first][last]` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `first` is updated to `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`, `last` is updated to `ord(s[-1]) - ord('a')`, `dyn[first][last]` remains updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `len(s)`, `s` is an input string**.
