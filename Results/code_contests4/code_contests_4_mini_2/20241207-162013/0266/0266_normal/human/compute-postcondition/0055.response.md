Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of non-empty strings, followed by `n` strings consisting of lowercase Latin letters (with a maximum length of 10 characters each). It constructs a 26x26 matrix to track the maximum lengths of strings that start and end with each letter. After processing all strings, it calculates and prints the maximum length of a string that starts and ends with the same letter. The function does not handle cases where `n` is zero or negative, as it assumes `n` is always a positive integer within the specified range. **
