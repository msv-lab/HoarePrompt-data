Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `first` is derived from the first character of `s`, `last` is `ord(s[-1]) - ord('a')`, and `j` is 1, with `j` being less than 26. If `dyn[j][first]` is greater than 0, then `dyn[j][last]` is updated to `dyn[j][first] + len(s)`. If `dyn[j][first]` is not greater than 0, no changes are made to `dyn[j][last]`.***
