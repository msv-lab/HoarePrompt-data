Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is an input string, `first` is calculated as `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`, `last` is calculated as `ord(s[-1]) - ord('a')`, and `j` is 1. If `dyn[j][first]` is greater than 0, then `dyn[j][last]` is updated to `dyn[j][first] + len(s)`.***
