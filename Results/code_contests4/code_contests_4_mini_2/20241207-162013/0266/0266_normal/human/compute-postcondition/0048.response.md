Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `first` is updated to `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`, `last` is updated to `ord(s[-1]) - ord('a')`, and for the loop to execute a third time `j` must be 3. If `dyn[j][first]` is greater than 0, then `dyn[j][last]` is updated to `dyn[j][first] + len(s)`. If `dyn[j][first]` is not greater than 0, there are no changes to `dyn[j][last]`.***
