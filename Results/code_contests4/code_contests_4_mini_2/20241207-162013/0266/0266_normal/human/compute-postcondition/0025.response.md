The variable `dyn[j][last]` is assigned the value of `dyn[j][first] + len(s)`. The previous value of `dyn[j][first]` is known to be greater than 0, and `len(s)` represents the length of the string `s`. Therefore, `dyn[j][last]` will be updated to a value that is the sum of a positive number and the length of `s`. This does not affect the other variables directly.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `first` is derived from the first character of `s`, `last` is `ord(s[-1]) - ord('a')`, `j` is 0, and `dyn[j][last]` is updated to `dyn[j][first] + len(s)`**
