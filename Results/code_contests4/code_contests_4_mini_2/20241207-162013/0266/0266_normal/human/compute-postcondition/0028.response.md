The code `dyn[j][last] = dyn[j][first] + len(s)` updates the `dyn` array at the index `[j][last]`. The value assigned to this index is the sum of the value at `dyn[j][first]` and the length of the string `s`. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0 (not directly used in this operation).
- `i` is 1 (not directly used in this operation).
- `first` is derived from the first character of `s` (indicates the index to be used for `dyn`).
- `last` is computed as `ord(s[-1]) - ord('a')` (this gives the index corresponding to the last character of `s`).
- `j` is 1 and must be less than 26 for the loop to execute a second time.

The lengths of `s` and the contents of `dyn` at indices `[j][first]` and `[j][last]` are crucial for determining the outputs but remain unspecified based on the prompt. Therefore, the output state reflects the action taken without specific values.

Output State: **`dyn[j][last]` is updated to `dyn[j][first] + len(s)`**
