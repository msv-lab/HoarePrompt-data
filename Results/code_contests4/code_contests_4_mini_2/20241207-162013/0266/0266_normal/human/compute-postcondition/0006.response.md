The variable `last` is assigned the value `ord(s[-1]) - ord('a')`, where `s[-1]` represents the last character of the string `s`. The previous values of the affected variables are `s` (an input string) and `first` (calculated as `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`). The variable `last` will hold the ordinal value of the last character of `s`, adjusted by subtracting the ordinal value of 'a'. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is an input string, `first` is calculated as `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`, and `last` is calculated as `ord(s[-1]) - ord('a')`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is an input string, `first` is calculated as `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`, `last` is calculated as `ord(s[-1]) - ord('a')`**.
