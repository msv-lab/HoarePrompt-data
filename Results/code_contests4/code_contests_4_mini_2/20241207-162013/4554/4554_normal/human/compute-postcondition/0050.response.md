Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 13845, `i` is 2, and `count` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is odd, `count` is incremented, and if `count` is even, `b` includes the value of `a[2]`. If `count` is odd, `a[2]` is updated to `a[2] / 2`, and `b` includes the updated value of `a[2]`.***
