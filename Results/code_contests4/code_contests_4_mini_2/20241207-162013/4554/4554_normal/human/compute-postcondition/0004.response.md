The variable `a` has not been initialized in the initial state, but we can assume it is a list since the `append` method is being used. The value of `x` is taken as an input integer. The `append` method adds `x` to the end of the list `a`. The previous values of `n` and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 13845; `i` is 0; `a` is a list containing the input integer `x`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 13845; `i` is 0; `a` is a list containing the input integer `x`.**
