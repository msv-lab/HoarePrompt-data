Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 13845, `i` is 0, `a` is a list containing `n` input integers, `b` contains the original `a[0]` and the value of `a[0] / 2` if `a[0]` is even, and `count` is an odd integer (specifically 1). Furthermore, `count` is not even, as it is an odd integer.***
