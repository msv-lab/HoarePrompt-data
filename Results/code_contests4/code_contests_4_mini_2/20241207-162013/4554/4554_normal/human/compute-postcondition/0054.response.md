Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 13845) as input, followed by `n` integers `a_i` (where -336 ≤ a_i ≤ 1164) that sum to 0. It processes the integers such that even integers are halved and odd integers are halved with adjustments based on their count (adding 1 for every second odd integer). The modified integers are collected in a list `b`, which is then printed. The function does not return any values but outputs the list `b` directly. **
