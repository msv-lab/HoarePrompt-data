According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the integer `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. Given that `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 13845, the loop can execute again if `n` is greater than 1. 

Since `i` is incremented by 1 with each iteration of the loop, before the next iteration, `i` will become 2. For the loop to execute for the second time, `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 13845, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
