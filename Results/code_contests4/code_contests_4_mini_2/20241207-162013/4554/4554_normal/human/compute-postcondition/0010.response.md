The code `a.append(x)` adds the value of `x` to the list `a`. Since `a` is not defined in the initial state, we can assume it is an empty list at the beginning. The value of `x` is an input integer, which will be appended to list `a`. Other variables do not change. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 13845, `i` is 2, `x` is an input integer, `a` is now a list containing the input integer `x`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 13845, `i` is 2, `x` is an input integer, `a` is now a list containing the input integer `x`.**
