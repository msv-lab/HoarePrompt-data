The statement `b.append(a[i] / 2)` modifies the list `b` by appending the value of `a[i] / 2`. The variable `i` is 2, so we need the value of `a[2]` to compute this. However, since the initial state does not provide the value of `a`, we cannot determine the exact result of `a[i] / 2`. 

Thus, the output state reflects that the value of `b` is being modified but does not provide a specific numerical outcome. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 13845, `i` is 2, and `b` is modified by appending `a[i] / 2`.**
