According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 13845. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 1. After this iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 2.

Thus, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 13845, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
