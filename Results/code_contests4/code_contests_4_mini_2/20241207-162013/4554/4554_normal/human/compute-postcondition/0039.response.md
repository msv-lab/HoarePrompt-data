Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 13845; `i` is 1; if `a[i]` is odd, `count` is incremented by 1. If `count` is odd, `a[1]` is updated to `a[1] / 2 + 1` and the updated value is appended to `b`. If `count` is even, no changes are made to `a` or `b`. If `a[i]` is even, `b` appends the value of `a[1] / 2`. If `a[i]` is odd, there is no action taken on `b`.***
