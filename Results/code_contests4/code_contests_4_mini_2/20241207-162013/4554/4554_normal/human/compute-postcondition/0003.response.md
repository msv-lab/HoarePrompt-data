The value of `x` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 13845; `i` is 0; `x` is an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 13845; `i` is 0; `x` is an input integer**
