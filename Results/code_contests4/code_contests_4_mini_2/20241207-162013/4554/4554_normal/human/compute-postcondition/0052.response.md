The code `print(b)` outputs the value of `b`. The initial state indicates that `b` contains modified values of all elements from `a` based on their parity, but we do not know the specific contents of `b` or `a` as they are not provided. The output only shows the value of `b`.

Output State: **`b` is the modified values of all elements from `a` based on their parity.**
