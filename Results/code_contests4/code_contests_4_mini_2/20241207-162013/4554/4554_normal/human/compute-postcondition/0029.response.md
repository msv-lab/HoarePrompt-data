According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, which means the loop has executed for the first time, and for it to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. Thus, `i` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration. 

Since `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 13845, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must still be greater than 1. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 13845, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**.
