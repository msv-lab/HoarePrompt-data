To assess the correctness of the program against the problem description, let's analyze the provided code.

The problem requires finding a "very beautiful number" that:
1. Is strictly positive
2. Does not contain leading zeroes
3. Has a length of exactly `p` decimal digits
4. If the last digit is moved to the front, the new number is exactly `x` times the original number
5. Among all such numbers, the minimal possible should be returned.

Now, let's analyze the program step-by-step:

1. **Function `func_1(p, x)`**:
   - It attempts to find valid numbers that meet the conditions mentioned above.
   - It iterates `i` from 1 to 9 (the possible last digits).
   - For each digit `i`, it constructs a number of length `p` and checks if moving the last digit to the front satisfies the multiplication condition.
   - If a valid number is found, it is collected in the list `c`.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - It reads `p` and `x`.
   - It has a specific case for `x == 5` and when `p % 42 == 0`, it utilizes `func_1` to construct a number of length 42 and repeats it to achieve length `p`.
   - It also checks numbers of lengths from 1 to 999 to find a valid number, and if found, checks if it can be repeated to give length `p`.
   - If no valid number is found that meets the conditions, it returns "Impossible".

### Potential Issues:
1. **Leading Zeroes**: The program tries to ensure no leading zeroes exist by checking the first character of the resultant number. However, if `p` is 1, it directly checks for impossibility when `x` is 2. But it does not account for other single-digit cases appropriately.
2. **Handling of `x` values**: The program may not cover all scenarios where `x` values from 1 to 9 could yield valid numbers of different lengths. The loop for lengths from 1 to 999 may not sufficiently address the full range or the specific conditions required for larger lengths.
3. **Edge Cases**: The check for `Impossible` may not encompass all cases where a number cannot be formed, especially for larger values of `p` when `x` is not 5.

### Example Case:
- Input: `p = 1`, `x = 3`
- The output should be `Impossible` since a single digit cannot be multiplied by 3 and remain the same single digit. The function might handle some cases but may not account for all.

### Conclusion:
Due to the potential oversight of edge cases, especially for single-digit values and the inability to generalize across all possible `x` values, the program may not meet the requirements consistently.

Thus, the program is deemed incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
