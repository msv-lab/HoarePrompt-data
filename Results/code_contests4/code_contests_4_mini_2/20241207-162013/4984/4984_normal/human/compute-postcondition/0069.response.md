The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `p` and `x`. The parameter `p` is a positive integer that represents the length of the desired number in decimal digits (with a constraint of 1 ≤ p ≤ 10^6), and `x` is a positive integer representing the multiplication factor (with a constraint of 1 ≤ x ≤ 9). 

After executing the function body, the function behaves as follows:

- Case 1: If the collection 'c' is non-empty and its first element 'r' has a first character that is not '0', the function returns 'r'.
- Case 2: If the collection 'c' has at least two elements, the function returns the second element in the collection 'c', which is 'r'.
- Case 3: If the collection 'c' has at least three elements, the function returns the third element 'r' from the list 'c'.
- Case 4: If none of the above cases are satisfied, the function returns an empty string ''.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two parameters `p` and `x`, and based on the conditions of the collection 'c', return specific elements from 'c' or an empty string if no conditions are satisfied. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, p and x, and returns a specific element from the collection 'c' based on the defined cases or an empty string if no cases are satisfied.**
