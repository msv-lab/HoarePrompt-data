To analyze the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the provided information and the loop's behavior. The initial state indicates that `p` is a positive integer and `x` is a positive integer that is not equal to 5 and where `p` is not divisible by 42.

From the loop code:

1. The loop iterates with `i` ranging from 1 to 999 (the range of `xrange(1, 1000)`).
2. Inside the loop, `s` is assigned the result of `func_1(i, x)`.
3. If `s` evaluates to `None` (or any falsy value), it continues to the next iteration.
4. `l` is assigned the length of `s` if it is not `None`.
5. If `p` is divisible by `l`, it writes `s` repeated `p / l` times to the output. Otherwise, it writes 'Impossible'.

Considering the output states provided:
- After the first iteration, the program does not return any value, indicating that the loop likely does not produce output in this case.
- In the second iteration, `i` is 999, and `s` is `None`, suggesting that `func_1(999, x)` did not return a valid result.
- In the third iteration, `i` is 1000, and `func_1(1000, x)` is called, but `x` is indicated as an undefined variable.

Since the loop may not find any valid `s` across its iterations (especially given that `x` is not defined in the third iteration), it is likely that the loop ends without producing any valid output.

Thus, if the loop does not execute (or if it executes but does not produce any valid output), the following state can be inferred:

Output State: **`p` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer not equal to 5, `s` is None, `i` has iterated up to 1000 but no valid output was produced.**
