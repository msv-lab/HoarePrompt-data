According to the code, the loop will continue to execute while `i` is within the range specified by `xrange(1, 1000)`, which means `i` must be less than 1000. At the end of the last iteration, `i` must be 1 less than the loop's upper limit, which is 999. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1000, and the loop will no longer execute since `i` is not less than 1000.

State: **The program does not return any value as the return statement is empty, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than 1000, and `i` is now 999.**
