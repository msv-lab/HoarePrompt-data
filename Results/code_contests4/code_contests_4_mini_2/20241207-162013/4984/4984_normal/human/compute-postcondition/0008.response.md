The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer not equal to 5 or `p` is not divisible by 42, `i` is 1; `s` is the result of func_1(1, x), and `s` is false (not true) and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
