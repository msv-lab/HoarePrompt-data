The code appends a string representation of the list `a`, which has been converted to strings and joined together, to the list `c`. The previous values of the variables `a` and `c` are not specified, but `a` is reversed and `c` is assumed to be a list. The other variables (`p`, `b`, `s`, `j`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`p` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `p` ≤ 10^6), `a` is reversed, `b` is equal to `i`, `s` is equal to 0, `j` is equal to `p`, and `c` has a new element which is the joined string of the elements in `a`.**
