According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the limit `p`. If `j` is less than `p`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `p` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `p` ≤ 10^6). For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `p` must be greater than 1.

State: **`p` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `p` ≤ 10^6), `a` contains the value of `b`, `b` is assigned the value of `i`, `s` is updated from 0, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `p` must be greater than 1**
