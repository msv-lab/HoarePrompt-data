The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters directly as indicated by `def func_2():`. However, it works with two variables: `p`, which is a positive integer representing the length of the number in decimal digits (1 ≤ p ≤ 10^6), and `x`, which is a positive integer representing the multiplication factor (1 ≤ x ≤ 9). 

After executing the function body, the function has the following cases for return values:

- **Case 1**: If `p` is a positive integer divisible by 42, the function returns the result of `func_1(42, 5)` multiplied by `(p / 42)`.

- **Case 2**: If `p` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer not equal to 5, and a variable `s` is None while `i` has iterated up to 1000 without producing a valid output, the function returns a specific result based on this condition.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to return a value based on the conditions of `p` and `x`, specifically handling cases involving divisibility by 42 and iteration limits with respect to these variables.

Functionality: **The function evaluates conditions based on the parameters p and x, returning a multiplied result if p is divisible by 42, and handling situations where x is not equal to 5 with no valid output after 1000 iterations.**
