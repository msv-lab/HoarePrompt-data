The code `a.append(b)` appends the current value of `b` to the list `a`. Since `b` is assigned the value of `i` and `a` contains the value of `b` appended, it means that `b` will be added to `a`. The previous values of the affected variables are not altered; only the list `a` is updated to include the value of `b`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `p` ≤ 10^6), `a` now contains an additional value from `b`, `b` is still assigned the value of `i`, `s` is updated from 0, `j` is 2; for the loop to execute a second time `p` must be greater than 2.

Output State: **`p` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `p` ≤ 10^6), `a` now contains an additional value from `b`, `b` is still assigned the value of `i`, `s` is updated from 0, `j` is 2; for the loop to execute a second time `p` must be greater than 2.**
