The value of `b` is assigned the value of `i`, and `a` is a list that will now have `b` appended to it. Since `a` contains the value of `b`, after execution, `b` is added to the list `a`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `p` ≤ 10^6), `a` contains the value of `b` appended, `b` is assigned the value of `i`, `s` is updated from 0, `j` is 1, and for the loop to execute a second time `p` must be greater than 1.

Output State: **`p` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `p` ≤ 10^6), `a` contains the value of `b` appended, `b` is assigned the value of `i`, `s` is updated from 0, `j` is 1, and for the loop to execute a second time `p` must be greater than 1.**
