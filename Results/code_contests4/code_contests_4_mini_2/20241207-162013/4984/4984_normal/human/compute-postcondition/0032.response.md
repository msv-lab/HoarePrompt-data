After analyzing the given loop and understanding how the variables change through each iteration, we can summarize the final output state after all iterations have executed. 

The loop iterates `p` times, where on each iteration, the value of `b` is appended to the list `a`, and the values of `s` and `b` are updated based on the formula provided. Since `p` is a positive integer (at least 1), the loop will execute `p` times.

As a result, by the end of the loop:
- The list `a` will contain `p` elements, all of which represent the values of `b` computed during each iteration.
- The final value of `b` will be the last computed value after `p` iterations.
- The value of `s` will also hold the last computed value after all iterations.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop will be:

Output State: **`p` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `p` ≤ 10^6), `a` is a list containing `p` values, `b` is the last computed value after `p` iterations, `s` is the last computed value after `p` iterations.**
