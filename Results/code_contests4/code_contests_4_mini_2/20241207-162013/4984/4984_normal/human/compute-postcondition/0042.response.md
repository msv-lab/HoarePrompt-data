`a` is an empty list, and `b` is assigned the value of `i`. The code `a.append(b)` adds the value of `b` to the list `a`. Since `a` was empty before this operation, after execution, `a` will contain one element which is the value of `b`. The values of `p`, `s`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `p` ≤ 10^6), `a` contains the value of `b`, `b` is assigned the value of `i`, `s` is 0, `j` is 0.

Output State: **`p` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `p` ≤ 10^6), `a` contains the value of `b`, `b` is assigned the value of `i`, `s` is 0, `j` is 0**
