The list `a` is reversed in place. The values of `p`, `b`, and `s` remain unchanged as the operation only affects the order of elements in the list `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `p` ≤ 10^6), `a` is the reversed list containing `p` values, `b` is equal to `i`, and `s` is equal to 0.

Output State: **`p` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `p` ≤ 10^6), `a` is the reversed list containing `p` values, `b` is equal to `i`, and `s` is equal to 0**.
