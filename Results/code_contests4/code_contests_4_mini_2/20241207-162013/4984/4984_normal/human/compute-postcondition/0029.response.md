According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `p`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than `p`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `p` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^6. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `p` must be greater than 2.

State: **`p` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `p` ≤ 10^6), `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `p` must be greater than 2**
