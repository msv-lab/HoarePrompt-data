According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the limit `p`. Since `j` is currently 1 and `p` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `p` ≤ 10^6), for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `p`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 2, and `p` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`p` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `p` ≤ 10^6), `a` contains the value of `b` appended, `b` is assigned the value of `i`, `s` is updated from 0, `j` is 2; for the loop to execute a second time `p` must be greater than 2**
