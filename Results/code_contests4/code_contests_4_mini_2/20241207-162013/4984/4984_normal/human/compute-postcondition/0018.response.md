The function `func_1(i, x)` is called with `i` set to 999 and `x` being some value that is not specified. The result of this function call is assigned to `s`. However, since there is no return statement in the function, it is implied that the function does not return a value. This means that the state of `s` after the execution of the line will be that it holds a value of `None` (the default return value for functions in Python that do not explicitly return anything). The values of `i` and `x` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 999, `x` is unchanged, and `s` is None as the function does not return any value.
Output State: **`i` is 999, `x` is unchanged, `s` is None**
