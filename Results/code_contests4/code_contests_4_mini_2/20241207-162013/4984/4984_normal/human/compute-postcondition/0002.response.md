To analyze the code provided, let's break down the components step by step:

1. `func_1(42, 5)` is a function call where `42` is passed as the first argument and `5` as the second argument. The specific output of this function is not given, but it will yield some value which we will denote as `result_func_1`.

2. The multiplication factor `x` is given as `5`.

3. The variable `p` is a positive integer that is divisible by `42`. Since it is divisible by `42`, `p` can take values like `42, 84, 126, ...` and so on.

4. The expression `p / 42` will evaluate to the integer result of dividing `p` by `42`. This means if `p` is `42`, the result is `1`; if `p` is `84`, the result is `2`, and so on.

The overall expression to evaluate is:
```
stdout.write(func_1(42, 5) * (p / 42))
```

Assuming `func_1(42, 5)` returns some value `result_func_1`, the final output will depend on the value of `p / 42`.

So, the output state will summarize the relationships established:
- `x` is `5`
- `p` is a positive integer divisible by `42`
- The output of `func_1(42, 5)` will be multiplied by `p / 42`.

However, since we do not know the exact value returned by `func_1`, we can't provide a numerical output, but we can specify the relationships.

Output State: **`x` is 5, `p` is a positive integer divisible by 42, and the output of `func_1(42, 5)` is multiplied by (p / 42)**.
