The code writes 'Impossible' to the standard output and does not alter any variable values. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged, but the program indicates that a certain condition was not met (likely involving `p`, `x`, or `l`). Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer not equal to 5 or `p` is not divisible by 42, `i` is 1; `s` is the result of func_1(1, x); `l` is the length of `s`; `p` is not divisible by `l`, and 'Impossible' has been written to stdout.
