The code `a.append(b)` adds the value of `b` to the list `a`. The initial state indicates that `p` is a positive integer and `j` is 1, but the value of `b` and the current state of list `a` are not specified. Therefore, the output state will reflect the action taken without altering the values of `p` and `j`, as they are not directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **`p` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `p` ≤ 10^6), `j` is 1, and `b` is appended to list `a`.**
