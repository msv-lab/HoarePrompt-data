According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 1000. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 999. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 1000. Since the loop continues as long as `i` is less than 1000, it will not execute again after this iteration.

State: **`i` is 1000, for the loop to execute again `i` must be less than 1000**
