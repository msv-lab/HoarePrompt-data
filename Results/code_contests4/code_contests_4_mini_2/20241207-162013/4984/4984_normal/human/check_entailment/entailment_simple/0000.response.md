Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases. Here are the issues identified:

1. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program contains a specific case for when `x` is 5 and `p` is divisible by 42. In this case, it only handles the specific scenario of `p` being a multiple of 42, returning a result based on `func_1(42, 5)`. This does not cover all possible values of `p` and `x` and can lead to incorrect outputs or "Impossible" messages when valid results exist.

2. **Output for Invalid Cases**: The program returns "Impossible" when it can't find a valid number based on its logic. However, it doesn't properly handle cases where valid numbers may exist but aren't found within the bounded iterations (up to 1000 in `func_2`). This may lead to premature conclusions of impossibility based on the limited search.

3. **Improper Loop Range**: In `func_2`, the loop iterates from `1` to `1000`, which could miss valid numbers that require more digits or that are not found within this constrained range. The problem description allows for `p` up to `10^6`, and searching only up to 1000 is insufficient to guarantee all possibilities are considered.

4. **Output Format**: The program uses `stdout.write` for output, which is acceptable but can lead to confusion. It should ensure that it handles the output correctly to match the expected output format of either a valid number or "Impossible".

These points collectively indicate that the program does not guarantee a correct solution for all valid inputs as specified in the problem description. As such, the program cannot be deemed correct.
