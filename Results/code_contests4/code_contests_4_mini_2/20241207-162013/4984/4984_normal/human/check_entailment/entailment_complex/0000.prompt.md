You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Teacher thinks that we make a lot of progress. Now we are even allowed to use decimal notation instead of counting sticks. After the test the teacher promised to show us a "very beautiful number". But the problem is, he's left his paper with the number in the teachers' office.

The teacher remembers that the "very beautiful number" was strictly positive, didn't contain any leading zeroes, had the length of exactly p decimal digits, and if we move the last digit of the number to the beginning, it grows exactly x times. Besides, the teacher is sure that among all such numbers the "very beautiful number" is minimal possible.

The teachers' office isn't near and the teacher isn't young. But we've passed the test and we deserved the right to see the "very beautiful number". Help to restore the justice, find the "very beautiful number" for us!

Input

The single line contains integers p, x (1 ≤ p ≤ 106, 1 ≤ x ≤ 9).

Output

If the teacher's made a mistake and such number doesn't exist, then print on a single line "Impossible" (without the quotes). Otherwise, print the "very beautiful number" without leading zeroes.

Examples

Input

6 5


Output

142857

Input

1 2


Output

Impossible


Input

6 4


Output

102564

Note

Sample 1: 142857·5 = 714285.

Sample 2: The number that consists of a single digit cannot stay what it is when multiplied by 2, thus, the answer to the test sample is "Impossible".
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: p is a positive integer representing the length of the desired number in decimal digits (1 ≤ p ≤ 10^6), and x is a positive integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 9) which represents the multiplication factor.
def func_1(p, x):
    c = []
    for i in xrange(1, 10):
        s = 0
        
        b = i
        
        a = []
        
        for j in xrange(p):
            a.append(b)
            s, b = divmod(b * x + s, 10)
        
        if b == i and s == 0:
            a.reverse()
            c.append(''.join(map(str, a)))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `p` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `p` ≤ 10^6), `x` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `x` ≤ 9), `c` is a list containing the joined string representations of the reversed lists `a` for all values of `i` from 1 to 9 where `b` equals `i` and `s` is 0 after processing.
    c.sort()
    for r in c:
        if r[0] != '0':
            return r
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `p` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `s` is 0, `c` is a collection where all elements start with '0', and the loop will not return any element from `c`.
    return ''
    #The program returns an empty string ''
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers, `p` (representing the length of the desired number in decimal digits) and `x` (a multiplication factor), and generates a list of numbers based on specific criteria. It returns the smallest valid number formed by digits from 1 to 9 that meets the criteria, or an empty string if no such number exists. The criteria require that the last digit of the number matches the starting digit and that the sum of the digits processed is zero. The function does not handle cases where inputs are out of the specified range, but it ensures that the returned number does not start with '0'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: p is a positive integer representing the length of the number in decimal digits (1 ≤ p ≤ 10^6), and x is a positive integer representing the multiplication factor (1 ≤ x ≤ 9).
def func_2():
    p, x = map(int, raw_input().split())
    if (x == 5 and p % 42 == 0) :
        stdout.write(func_1(42, 5) * (p / 42))
        return
        #The program returns the result of func_1(42, 5) multiplied by (p / 42), where p is a positive integer divisible by 42.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`p` is a positive integer representing the length of the number in decimal digits; `x` is a positive integer representing the multiplication factor. `x` is not equal to 5 or `p` is not divisible by 42.
    for i in xrange(1, 1000):
        s = func_1(i, x)
        
        if not s:
            continue
        
        l = len(s)
        
        if p % l == 0:
            stdout.write(s * (p / l))
        else:
            stdout.write('Impossible')
        
        return
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `p` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer not equal to 5, `s` is None, `i` has iterated up to 1000 but no valid output was produced.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers, `p` (the length of the number in decimal digits) and `x` (a multiplication factor). If `x` is 5 and `p` is divisible by 42, it returns the result of `func_1(42, 5)` multiplied by `(p / 42)`. If `x` is not 5, it iterates from 1 to 999, calling `func_1(i, x)` for each `i`. If a non-None result `s` is obtained and `p` is divisible by the length of `s`, it outputs `s` repeated `(p / l)` times. If no valid output is produced after 1000 iterations, it returns 'Impossible'. The function does not handle the case where `p` is 0 or negative, which could lead to unexpected behavior.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
