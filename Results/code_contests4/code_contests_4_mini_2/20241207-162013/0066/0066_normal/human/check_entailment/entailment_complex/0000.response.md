Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The function accepts a string `s` that consists of characters '*' (platforms) and '.' (pits), which corresponds to the representation of the level in the problem description.

2. **Loop Structure**: The outer loop iterates through possible jump lengths `j` starting from `1` up to `len(s) - 1`. The inner loop iterates through each possible starting index `i` for the platforms.

3. **Jump Sequence Check**: For each combination of starting index `i` and jump length `j`, the program checks if the positions `i`, `i + j`, `i + 2 * j`, `i + 3 * j`, and `i + 4 * j` are all platforms (`'*'`). This directly checks for the existence of a sequence of five platforms with equal intervals, as required by the problem.

4. **Boundary Condition**: The condition `i + 4 * j < len(s)` ensures that we do not exceed the bounds of the string `s` when checking for the fifth platform. This prevents index errors.

5. **Return Values**: The function returns `True` if such a sequence is found, and `False` if no sequences meet the criteria after all possible checks are completed. This aligns with the requirement to determine if the level is "good".

Overall, the function correctly checks for sequences of five platforms that can be jumped through with equal intervals, thus fulfilling the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program can be affirmed.
