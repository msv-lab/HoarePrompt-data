#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) consisting of characters '*' and '.' where '*' represents a platform and '.' represents a pit.
def func_1(s):
    for j in xrange(1, len(s)):
        for i in xrange(len(s)):
            if i + 4 * j < len(s) and s[i] == s[i + j] == s[i + 2 * j] == s[i + 3 * j
                ] == s[i + 4 * j] == '*':
                return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string of length `n`, `j` is `len(s) - 1`, `i` is `len(s)`; no sequence of five consecutive '*' characters found.
    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` consisting of characters '*' and '.', and checks for any sequence of five '*' characters at specific indexed positions in the string. It returns True if such a sequence is found, otherwise it returns False. The function iterates through the string using two nested loops to check conditions based on the index offsets. The function does not handle cases where the string is shorter than 5 characters for certain checks, but it will return False if no sequence is found by the end of the loops.
