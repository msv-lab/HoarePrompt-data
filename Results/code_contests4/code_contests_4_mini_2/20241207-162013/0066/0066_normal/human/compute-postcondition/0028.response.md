Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length greater than 5, `j` is 3, `i` is 2 for the loop to execute the third time. The value of `(i + 4 * j)` is greater than or equal to the length of `s`, or at least one of the characters `s[i]`, `s[i + j]`, `s[i + 2 * j]`, `s[i + 3 * j]`, or `s[i + 4 * j]` is not equal to `'*'`.***
