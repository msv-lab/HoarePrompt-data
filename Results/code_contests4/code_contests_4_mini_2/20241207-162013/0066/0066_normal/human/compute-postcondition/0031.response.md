Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length greater than 15, `j` is 3, and `i` is 3. If `i + 4 * j` is less than the length of `s` and the characters `s[i]`, `s[i + j]`, `s[i + 2 * j]`, `s[i + 3 * j]`, and `s[i + 4 * j]` are all equal to `'*'`, the function returns True. Otherwise, there is no return value from the program.***
