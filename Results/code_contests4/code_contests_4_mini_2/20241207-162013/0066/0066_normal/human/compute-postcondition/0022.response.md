Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length greater than 5 and `i` is less than `len(s) - 1`. If the condition `i + 4 * j < len(s)` holds true and `s[i]`, `s[i + j]`, `s[i + 2 * j]`, `s[i + 3 * j]`, and `s[i + 4 * j]` are all equal to '*', the program returns True. Otherwise, the program does not return any value.***
