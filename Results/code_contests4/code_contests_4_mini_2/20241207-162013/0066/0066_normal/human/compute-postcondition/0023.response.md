Output State: **`s` is a string of length greater than 5, `j` is 2, `i` is less than `len(s)`, and if there exists any index `i` such that the characters at indices `i`, `i + j`, `i + 2 * j`, `i + 3 * j`, and `i + 4 * j` are all equal to '*', the program returns True; otherwise, there is no return value from the loop.**
