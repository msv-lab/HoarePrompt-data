According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than the length of the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `s` is a string of length greater than 5. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 2. 

We also know that the loop will continue to execute as long as the length of `s` is greater than `i + 4 * j`, or the characters at indices `i`, `i + j`, `i + 2 * j`, `i + 3 * j`, and `i + 4 * j` are not all equal to '*'. 

Since `j` is 2 and the current value of `i` is 1, after the increment, the new indices will be:
- `i`: 2
- `i + j`: 4
- `i + 2 * j`: 6
- `i + 3 * j`: 8
- `i + 4 * j`: 10

For the loop to execute a second time, the length of `s` must still be greater than 2 + 8 = 10, or the characters at the new indices must not all be equal to '*'.

State: **`s` is a string of length greater than 5, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time the length of `s` must be greater than 10 or the characters at indices 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 must not all be equal to '*'**
