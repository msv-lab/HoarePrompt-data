Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length `n` (where `n > 5`), `j` is 1, and `i` is 1. If the condition `i + 4 * j < len(s)` holds true and the characters at positions `i`, `i + j`, `i + 2 * j`, `i + 3 * j`, and `i + 4 * j` in the string `s` are all equal to '*', the function returns True. Otherwise, there is no specific return value.***
