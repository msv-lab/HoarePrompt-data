Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length greater than 15, `j` is 3, `i` is 4, and if `i + 4 * j` is less than the length of `s` and the characters at positions `i`, `i + j`, `i + 2 * j`, `i + 3 * j`, and `i + 4 * j` are all equal to '*', the function returns True. Otherwise, the function does not return a value.***
