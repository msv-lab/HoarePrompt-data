According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the length of the string `s`. The loop starts at `j = 1` and runs until `j` is less than `len(s)`. For the loop to execute at least once, the length of the string `s` must be greater than 1 (i.e., `len(s) > 1`). 

Additionally, at the start of the loop, we need to specify the initial value of `j`. Since `j` starts at 1, we can set it to that value.

State: **`s` is a string of length n (n > 1), `j` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time**
