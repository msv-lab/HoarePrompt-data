Output State: **`s` is a string of length greater than 5, `j` is 3, `i` is equal to `len(s)`, and if the loop executed fully without returning True, then none of the sequences of characters `s[i]`, `s[i + j]`, `s[i + 2 * j]`, `s[i + 3 * j]`, or `s[i + 4 * j]` were all equal to `'*'` for any valid `i`.**
