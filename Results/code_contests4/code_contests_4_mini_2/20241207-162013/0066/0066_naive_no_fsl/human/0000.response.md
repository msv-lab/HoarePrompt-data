Correctness: **False**

The provided program fails to correctly check for the conditions specified in the problem description. Specifically, consider the following input case:

Input:
```
10
*****..***
```

In this case, the program should identify that there are five consecutive platforms (indices 0 to 4) from which it can jump with a jump length of 1 (0, 1, 2, 3, 4). However, the program would incorrectly check for jump lengths starting from index 0 and will not find a valid sequence because it is only checking the first few possible jump lengths and may miss valid sequences later in the string due to the order of iteration.

The logic inside the `func_1` function is flawed because it checks for increasing jump lengths starting from every possible index but does not ensure that it checks all potential jump lengths uniformly across the entire string. Also, if there are valid sequences at the end of the string, the way it checks for `i + 4 * j` might skip valid jump sequences that do not start from the very beginning of the string.

Thus, the program does not handle cases where valid sequences exist but are not caught due to the way jumps are checked. Hence, the program is incorrect.
