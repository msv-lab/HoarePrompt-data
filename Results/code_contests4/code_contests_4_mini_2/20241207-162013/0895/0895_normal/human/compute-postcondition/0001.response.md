The variable `c` is assigned the value of `a[0] * 60 + a[1]`, where `a` contains two integers from the input. The specific values of `a[0]` and `a[1]` are not provided, but they are integers. Therefore, `c` will be calculated as the total number of minutes represented by the two integers in `a`. The values of `h_1`, `m_1`, `h_2`, and `m_2` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`h_1`, `m_1`, `h_2`, and `m_2` are integers; `c` is calculated as `a[0] * 60 + a[1]`**
