The variable `c` is updated by adding the value `a[0] * 60 + a[1]` to its previous value. The values of `a[0]` and `a[1]` are derived from the input, where they represent the hours and minutes respectively, split by ':'. The previous value of `c` is unknown, but we can say that it will increase by the total number of minutes represented by `a`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `h_1`, `m_1`, `h_2`, and `m_2` are integers; `c` is updated with the addition of `a[0] * 60 + a[1]` to its previous value.
Output State: **`h_1`, `m_1`, `h_2`, and `m_2` are integers; `c` is updated with the addition of `a[0] * 60 + a[1]` to its previous value.**
