The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly in its signature, but it operates based on the provided constraints that involve four integers: `h_1`, `m_1`, `h_2`, and `m_2`. These integers represent hours and minutes, with specific conditions that they must satisfy, including being within the valid ranges for hours (0 to 23) and minutes (0 to 59). 

The function calculates the duration of a contest based on these inputs. The output is determined by the following cases:

Case_1: If the contest lasts an even number of minutes and is less than two minutes, the function returns an error message indicating that the contest duration is invalid.

Case_2: If the contest lasts an even number of minutes and is two minutes or more, the function returns the total duration of the contest in minutes.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to evaluate the duration of a contest defined by the time indicated by `h_1:m_1` and `h_2:m_2`, returning either an error message for invalid durations or the total duration in minutes for valid cases.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but evaluates the duration of a contest based on four integers (h_1, m_1, h_2, m_2) representing start and end times. It returns an error message for invalid durations or the total duration in minutes if valid.**
