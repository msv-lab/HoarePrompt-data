Postcondition: ***`h_1`, `m_1`, `h_2`, and `m_2` are integers; `c` is half of its previous value; if the length of `d[1]` was 1, then `d[1]` is modified to be '0' + the original value of `d[1]`, resulting in a length of 2; `d[0]` is modified to be '0' + `d[0]` if its length was 1, and the length of `d[1]` is now 2.***
