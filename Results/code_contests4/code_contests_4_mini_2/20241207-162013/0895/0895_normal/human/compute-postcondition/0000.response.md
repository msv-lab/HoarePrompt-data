The line of code takes input in the format of "h:m" (hours and minutes) and splits it into two integers, which are then assigned to `a`. The previous values of `h_1`, `m_1`, `h_2`, and `m_2` are not directly affected by this code, as it introduces a new variable `a`. The output state reflects that `a` contains two integers derived from the input.

Output State: **`h_1`, `m_1`, `h_2`, and `m_2` are integers; `a` contains two integers from the input.**
