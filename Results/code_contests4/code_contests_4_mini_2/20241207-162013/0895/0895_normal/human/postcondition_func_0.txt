The function accepts no parameters and reads two time inputs in the format "hh:mm" representing the start and end times of a contest. It calculates the average time by converting these times into minutes, dividing by two, and then converting the result back into "hh:mm" format. It ensures that both hours and minutes are formatted as two digits. The function does not validate the inputs for correctness (e.g., the end time being after the start time), nor does it handle any potential errors related to input formatting. It returns the average time in the correct format but lacks error handling for invalid durations.
