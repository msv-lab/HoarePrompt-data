Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here are the issues:

1. **Input Handling and State Initialization**: The program reads the two time inputs using `raw_input()` but does not properly handle the input as intended. It uses `map(int, raw_input().split(':'))`, which does not work as expected because `map()` returns a map object in Python 3, and the program does not convert it to a list before accessing elements. Thus, `a[0]` and `a[1]` will lead to an error.

2. **Calculation of Midpoint**: The program calculates the midpoint by summing the total minutes of both times and dividing by 2. However, it does not take into account that the total minutes should be split into two separate components: hours and minutes. The direct conversion back to hours and minutes can lead to incorrect results if the total minutes exceed a full day (which is not a concern here since the contest lasts within a single day).

3. **Formatting the Output**: The program attempts to format the output as two digits by checking the length of the strings representing hours and minutes. However, the string manipulation is flawed. It checks `len(d[0])` and `len(d[1])` but does not ensure that `d[0]` and `d[1]` are always two characters long. This can cause incorrect formatting in certain cases.

4. **Error Handling**: The annotations mention a lack of error handling for invalid durations, which includes the check that the end time is actually greater than the start time. Although the problem guarantees that the contest lasts at least two minutes, not checking for the chronological order of the times introduces potential logical flaws.

Overall, the program fails to correctly implement the logic needed to compute the midpoint of the contest time as specified in the problem description, thus it is not correct.
