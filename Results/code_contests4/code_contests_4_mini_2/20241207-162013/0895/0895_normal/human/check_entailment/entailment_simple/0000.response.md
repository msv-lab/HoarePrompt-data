Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` to read input, which is correct in Python 2 but not valid in Python 3. If the program were intended for Python 3, it should use `input()` instead.

2. **Calculation of Midpoint**: The program incorrectly calculates the midpoint of the contest. Specifically, it adds the two times (in minutes) together and then divides by 2. This approach will yield the correct total minutes but does not account for the timing correctly. The midpoint should be calculated using the start time and end time rather than simply averaging the total minutes.

3. **Time Conversion Logic**: The program does not correctly convert the total minutes back to hours and minutes after calculating the midpoint. The `divmod(c, 60)` function call is appropriate, but the way the time is calculated and displayed does not ensure that the hours and minutes are in the correct format.

4. **Output Formatting**: While the program attempts to ensure that the output is two digits by prepending a zero if necessary, it does not guarantee that the output is formatted correctly according to the requirements of the problem description, which explicitly states that the output should be in the format `hh:mm`.

A correct implementation would need to calculate the midpoint as follows:
- Convert both times to minutes since midnight.
- Find the midpoint in minutes.
- Convert the midpoint back to hours and minutes.
- Format the output correctly as `hh:mm`.

Overall, the logic implemented in the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, particularly in how the midpoint is calculated and how the output is formatted.
