The provided program attempts to calculate the midpoint of a contest based on its start and end times. Let's break down the program to see if it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` to read two lines of input. It expects the input format to be "hh:mm", which is correct.

2. **Time Calculation**:
   - The program converts the first time (h1:m1) into total minutes since midnight.
   - It does the same for the second time (h2:m2).
   - It then sums these two total minutes and divides by 2 to find the midpoint in total minutes.

3. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program uses `divmod(c, 60)` to convert the total minutes back into hours and minutes.
   - It checks the length of the hour and minute strings and prepends a '0' if they are single digits. However, `len(d[0])` and `len(d[1])` will not work as intended since `d[0]` and `d[1]` are actually tuples returned from `divmod`, not strings.

4. **Potential Issue**:
   - The program does not correctly format the output because of the way it checks the lengths of `d[0]` and `d[1]`. Since `d` contains integers (not strings), the check will always be false, and thus, the output will be incorrect. For example, if the midpoint is 02:05, it will output "2:5" instead of "02:05".

Now, let's consider a test case to illustrate the problem:

- **Test Case**: 
  - Input: 
    ```
    01:02
    03:02
    ```
  - Expected Output: 
    ```
    02:02
    ```
  - Actual Output (due to formatting issue): 
    ```
    2:2
    ```

This shows that the program does not fulfill the requirement to print each number as exactly two digits.

Correctness: **False**.
