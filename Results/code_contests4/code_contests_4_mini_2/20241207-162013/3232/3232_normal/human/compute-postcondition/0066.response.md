Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute one more time regardless of the program state. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states.

State: **`m` is 86400, `dp[n]` is the cumulative sum of `dp[0]` to `dp[n-1]`, maximum value of `dp` is at least `dp[m]`, and the maximum value of `dp` is printed.**
