The value of `dp[i + 1]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i]`. Since `i` is 1, this means `dp[2]` is updated to `dp[2] + dp[1]`. The initial values of the list `dp` are all set to 0, so `dp[1]` is 0. Therefore, `dp[2]` remains 0 after the operation. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`m` is 86400, `n` is 0, `dp` is a list of size 86401 with all elements set to 0, `i` is 1, and `dp[2]` is 0**.
