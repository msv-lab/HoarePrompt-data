The code takes the input string `d`, splits it by the colon `':'`, and then maps the resulting string values to integers, assigning them to variables `e` and `f`. The variable `d` will no longer hold the original string but will instead contain the first part of the split. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not directly affected by this operation. However, it is important to note that `d` will now be an integer value, while `e` and `f` will hold the integer values of the remaining parts of the split string. 

The previous values of `d` (as a string) and the resulting values of `e` and `f` after conversion are not specified. Thus, the output state reflects the assignment of new integer values to `e` and `f`.

Output State: **`m` is 86400, `n` is greater than 0, `dp` is a list of size 86401 with all elements set to 0, maximum value of `dp` is 0; `d` is now an integer, `e` and `f` are integers derived from splitting the input string `d` by ':'**.
