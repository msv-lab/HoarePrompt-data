In the given code, the variables `d`, `e`, and `f` are assigned values derived from the string `d`, which is expected to be in the format "hh:mm:ss". The `split(':')` method breaks the string `d` into components based on the colon delimiter. The `map(int, ...)` function converts these string components into integers. 

Since `d` is not explicitly given in the initial state, we assume it was previously defined elsewhere in the program to contain a string that can be split into three parts. The values of `e` and `f` will depend on the contents of `d`.

Thus, the output state will reflect that `d` has been split and its components converted to integers, resulting in `e` and `f` being assigned these integer values. The other variables `m`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is 86400, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the user input string, `b` and `c` are integers derived from `a`, `d`, `e`, and `f` are integers derived from splitting `d`.**
