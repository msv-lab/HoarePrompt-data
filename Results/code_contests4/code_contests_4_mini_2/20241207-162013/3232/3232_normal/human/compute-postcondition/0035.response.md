The code `n = int(raw_input())` assigns the value of `n` to be the integer value of the input received from `raw_input()`. The previous value of `n` was 0, but since `raw_input()` accepts a user input, `n` will now hold a new integer value provided by the user. The values of `m` and `dp` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is 86400, `n` is an input integer, `dp` is a list of size 86401 with all elements set to 0; the maximum value of `dp` is 0**
