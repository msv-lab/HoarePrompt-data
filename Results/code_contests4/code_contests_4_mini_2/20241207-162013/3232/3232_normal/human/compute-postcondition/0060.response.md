According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the limit set by `m`. Since `i` is currently 0 and `m` is 86400, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and for the loop to execute a second time, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, after the next iteration, `i` will be 1, and for the loop to continue executing, it must be that `m` is greater than 1.

State: **`m` is 86400, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be greater than 1**
