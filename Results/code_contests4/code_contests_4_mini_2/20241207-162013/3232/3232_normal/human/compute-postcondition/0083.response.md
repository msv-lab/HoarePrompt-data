According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than `_`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again. Therefore, after the next iteration, `_` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. For the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`m` is 86400; `dp[a * 3600 + b * 60 + c]` is increased by 1; `n` must be greater than 2; `_` is 2; `d`, `e`, `f` are integers parsed from input; `dp[d * 3600 + e * 60 + f]` is decreased by 1.**
