The value of `dp[i + 1]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i]`. The variable `i` is currently 1, so the operation affects `dp[2]`, which will be updated with the current value of `dp[1]`. The initial state indicates that `m` is 86400 and `i` is 1, but the actual values of `dp` are not provided. Therefore, the output state reflects the increment operation without specific values for `dp`.

Output State: **`m` is 86400, `i` is 1; `dp[2]` is incremented by `dp[1]`.**
