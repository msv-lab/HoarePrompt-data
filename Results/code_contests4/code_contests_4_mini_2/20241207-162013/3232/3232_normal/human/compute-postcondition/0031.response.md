`dp[i + 1]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i]` to it. Here, `i` is 2, and `dp[2]` is 0. Therefore, `dp[3]` will be updated from its current value of 0 by adding `dp[2]`, which is also 0. This means that `dp[3]` will remain 0 after the operation. The values of `m`, `n`, `i`, and other elements of the `dp` list are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is 86400, `n` is 0, `i` is 2, `dp[2]` is 0, and `dp[3]` is 0.

Output State: **`m` is 86400, `n` is 0, `i` is 2, `dp[2]` is 0, and `dp[3]` is 0**
