The variables `a` and `d` are assigned the values from `raw_input().split()`, which takes input and splits it into two separate values. The previous values of `m`, `dp`, `n`, and `_` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `m` is 86400; `dp` is modified with the value at index `d * 3600 + e * 60 + f` decreased by 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `_` is 1; `a` is the first input value; `d` is the second input value.
