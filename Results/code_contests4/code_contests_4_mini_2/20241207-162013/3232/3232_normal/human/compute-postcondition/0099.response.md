The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It processes multiple datasets, each beginning with an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10000), followed by `n` lines that each contain two timestamps representing departure and arrival times of trains in the format hh:mm:ss. The function continues to process datasets until it encounters `n = 0`, which signifies the end of the datasets and is not included in the processing. The output of the function is not specified in the provided information, so we focus on the input structure. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to handle multiple datasets of train departure and arrival timestamps based on the specified format and constraints.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple datasets of train departure and arrival timestamps until it encounters a dataset starting with n = 0, which indicates the end of input.**
