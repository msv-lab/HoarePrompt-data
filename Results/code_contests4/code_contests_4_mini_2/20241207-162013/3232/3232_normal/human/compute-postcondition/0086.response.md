The code assigns values to `d`, `e`, and `f` by splitting the string `d` using `':'` as a delimiter and mapping the results to integers. The initial parsing of `d`, `e`, and `f` is based on the input string `d`. Other variables like `m`, `dp[a * 3600 + b * 60 + c]`, `n`, and `_` remain unchanged in this step. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated values of `d`, `e`, and `f` after the parsing.

Output State: **`m` is 86400; `dp[a * 3600 + b * 60 + c]` is increased by 1; `n` must be greater than 2; `_` is 2; `d`, `e`, `f` are integers parsed from input string `d`.**
