The value of `dp[i + 1]` is updated by adding `dp[i]` to it. Initially, `i` is 0, so `dp[i]` refers to `dp[0]`, which is 0 (since all elements of `dp` are initialized to 0). Therefore, `dp[1]` will become `dp[1] + 0`, which means `dp[1]` remains 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`m` is 86400, `n` is 0, `dp` is a list of size 86401 with all elements set to 0, and `dp[1]` remains 0**.
