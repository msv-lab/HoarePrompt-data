The loop iterates `m` times, and during each iteration, it updates the `dp` array such that each `dp[i + 1]` accumulates the value of `dp[i]`. After the completion of the loop, `dp[n]` will contain the sum of all previous `dp` values from `dp[0]` to `dp[n-1]`, effectively resulting in a cumulative sum pattern.

If `n` is less than or equal to `m`, the final output state will reflect that `dp[n]` is equal to the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp`. If `n` is greater than `m`, the loop will still only execute `m` times, and `dp[n]` will be based on the values accumulated up to `m`.

Output State: **`m` is 86400, `dp[n]` is the cumulative sum of `dp[0]` to `dp[n-1]`, maximum value of `dp` is at least `dp[m]`.**
