The value of `dp[i + 1]` is incremented by `dp[i]`. We do not have the specific value of `dp[i]`, but we know that `i` is currently 2. Therefore, `dp[3]` is updated by adding whatever value `dp[2]` holds. The values of `m` and `i` remain unchanged, and the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is 86400, `i` is 2, and `dp[3]` is updated by adding `dp[2]`.

Output State: **`m` is 86400, `i` is 2, and `dp[3]` is updated by adding `dp[2]`**.
