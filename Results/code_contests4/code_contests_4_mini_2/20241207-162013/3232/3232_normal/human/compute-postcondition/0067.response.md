`n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `m` is 86400, `dp[n]` is the cumulative sum of `dp[0]` to `dp[n-1]`, maximum value of `dp` is at least `dp[m]`, and the maximum value of `dp` is printed; `n` is an input integer.
