The value of `dp[d * 3600 + e * 60 + f]` is decreased by 1. The variable `m` remains unchanged at 86400, and the previous values of `d`, `e`, and `f` are integers parsed from the input string. The value of `n` is greater than 2, and `_` is 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is 86400; `dp[d * 3600 + e * 60 + f]` is decreased by 1; `n` is greater than 2; `_` is 2; and `d`, `e`, `f` are integers parsed from input string `d`.

Output State: **`m` is 86400; `dp[d * 3600 + e * 60 + f]` is decreased by 1; `n` is greater than 2; `_` is 2; `d`, `e`, `f` are integers parsed from input string `d`.**
