The code initializes a list `dp` with a size of `m + 1`, where `m` is 86400. This means `dp` will be a list with 86401 elements, all set to 0. The state of `n` is not affected by this operation, and since there is a conditional statement regarding `n`, it remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is 86400, `n` is equal to 0; `dp` is initialized as a list of size 86401 with all elements set to 0.

Output State: **`m` is 86400, `n` is equal to 0; `dp` is initialized as a list of size 86401 with all elements set to 0.**
