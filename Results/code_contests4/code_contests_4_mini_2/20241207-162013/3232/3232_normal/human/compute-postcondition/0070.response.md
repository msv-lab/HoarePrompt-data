The code initializes the list `dp` with a size of `m + 1`, where `m` is 86400. This means `dp` will contain 86401 elements, all initially set to 0. The previous values of `dp` are not provided, but since we are creating a new list, the previous state is irrelevant here. The other variables mentioned in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is 86400; `dp` is a list of 86401 zeros**
