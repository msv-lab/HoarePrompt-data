The code `dp[i + 1] += dp[i]` indicates that the value at index `i + 1` of the list `dp` is being incremented by the value at index `i`. Given the initial state where `m` is 86400 and `i` is 2, we can infer that since `m` is greater than 2, the loop is executing for the second time. However, we do not have the value of `dp[i]` or the initial state of the `dp` list.

Thus, the output state will reflect that the operation is performed but does not specify the exact values due to the unknown state of `dp`. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is 86400, `i` is 2, and `dp[i + 1]` is updated by adding `dp[i]`.

Output State: **`m` is 86400, `i` is 2, and `dp[i + 1]` is updated by adding `dp[i]`.**
