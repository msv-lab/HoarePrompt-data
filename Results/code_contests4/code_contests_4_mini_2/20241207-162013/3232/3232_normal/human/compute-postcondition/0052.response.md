The code takes input from the user and splits it into two variables `a` and `d`. The initial state of `m` is 86400, and the only affected variables are `a` and `d`, which will be assigned the values entered by the user. The previous values of `m` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is 86400, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `d` is an input string.

Output State: **`m` is 86400, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `d` is an input string**
