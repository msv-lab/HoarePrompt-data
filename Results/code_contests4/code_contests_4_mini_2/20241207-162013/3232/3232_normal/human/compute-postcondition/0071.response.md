According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `m` is set to 86400, which does not affect the execution of the loop directly, and `dp` being a list of 86401 zeros is also not a factor in determining if the loop will execute.

At the end of the last iteration, the loop variable `_` will represent the number of iterations completed, starting from 0. Therefore, before the loop starts, to ensure it runs at least once, `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **`m` is 86400, `dp` is a list of 86401 zeros, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, and `_` is 0**
