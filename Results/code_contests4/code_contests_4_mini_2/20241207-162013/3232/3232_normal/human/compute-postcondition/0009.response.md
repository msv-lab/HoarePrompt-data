`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values that are derived from splitting the string `a` by the colon (`:`) and mapping each part to an integer. The variable `a` holds a user input string that is expected to be in the format "hour:minute:second". The values of `b` and `c` are determined by this input. The state of `m` and `n` remains unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`m` is 86400, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the user input string, `b` and `c` are integers derived from `a` by splitting on ':'**
