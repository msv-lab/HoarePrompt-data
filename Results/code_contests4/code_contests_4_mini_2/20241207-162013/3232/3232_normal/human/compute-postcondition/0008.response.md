The code `a, d = raw_input().split()` takes input from the user, splitting the input string into two parts and assigning them to variables `a` and `d`. The values of `m` and `n` are not affected by this operation. The variable `_` is not affected either since it is only assigned a value when `n` is 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is 86400, `n` is greater than 0, `a` and `d` are assigned values from user input.

Output State: **`m` is 86400, `n` is greater than 0, `a` and `d` are assigned values from user input**.
