According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. Since `m` is 86400, the loop can execute for `i` ranging from 0 to 86399, which means it has a valid range and will execute 86400 times. The values for `n` and `_` do not directly affect the execution of the loop. Thus, before the loop starts, `i` should be initialized to 0, as that is the starting value for the loop.

State: **`m` is 86400, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time**
