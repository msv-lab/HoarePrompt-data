The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is 86400, `n` is an input integer, `dp` is a list of size 86401 with all elements set to 0; the maximum value of `dp` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
