The value of `dp[i + 1]` is increased by `dp[i]`. Since `i` is 0, this means `dp[1]` will be updated to include the value of `dp[0]`. The variable `m` and the maximum value of `dp` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is 86400, `i` is 0, and `dp[1]` is increased by `dp[0]`.

Output State: **`m` is 86400, `i` is 0, and `dp[1]` is increased by `dp[0]**
