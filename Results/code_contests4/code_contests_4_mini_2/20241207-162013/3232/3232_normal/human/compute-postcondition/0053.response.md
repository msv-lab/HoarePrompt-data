The code splits the input string `a` on the colon `:` and maps the resulting substrings to integers, assigning them to `a`, `b`, and `c`. The previous value of `a` is an input string, which will be converted into three integer values. The values of `m` and `n` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is 86400, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is now an integer, `b` is now an integer, `c` is now an integer.

Output State: **`m` is 86400, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is now an integer, `b` is now an integer, `c` is now an integer**
