The list `dp` is reassigned to be a new list of size `m + 1`, which is `86400 + 1 = 86401`, with all elements set to 0. The previous value of `dp` was a list of size 86401, also filled with 0s, so the content remains the same. Other variables are not affected, and the condition regarding `n` does not change due to this operation.

Output State: **`m` is 86400, `n` is an input integer, `dp` is a list of size 86401 with all elements set to 0, and the maximum value of `dp` is 0.**
