According to the code, the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will continue executing indefinitely unless it is explicitly terminated by an external condition or a break statement within the loop. Since there are no conditions that would prevent the loop from executing again, it is guaranteed that the loop can execute one more time regardless of the current state.

State: **`m` is 86400, `n` is 0, `dp` is a list of size 86401 with all elements set to 0; the maximum value of `dp` is 0**.
