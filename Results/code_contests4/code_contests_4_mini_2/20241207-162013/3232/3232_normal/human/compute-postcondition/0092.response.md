According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `m` is 86400. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1. For the loop to execute a second time, `m` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`m` is 86400, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be greater than 1**
