Functionality: ** The function accepts multiple datasets of train departure and arrival timestamps, counting the maximum number of overlapping trains at any given time during the day. It processes each dataset until it encounters a dataset starting with `n = 0`, which indicates the end of input. For each dataset, it calculates and prints the maximum number of overlapping trains based on the provided timestamps. The function handles timestamps correctly and ensures that the maximum overlap is calculated accurately, but it does not return any values; it only prints the results. **
