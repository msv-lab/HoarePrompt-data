The input consists of multiple datasets, where each dataset begins with an integer n (1 <= n <= 10000) followed by n lines containing two timestamps (hh:mm:ss) representing the departure and arrival times of each train. Each timestamp is in the format hh:mm:ss with 0 ≤ hh < 24, 0 ≤ mm < 60, and 0 ≤ ss < 60. The dataset ends with n = 0, which is not included in the datasets.
