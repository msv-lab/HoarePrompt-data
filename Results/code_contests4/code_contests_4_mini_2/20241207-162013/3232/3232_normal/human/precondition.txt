The input consists of multiple datasets where each dataset starts with an integer n (1 <= n <= 10,000) followed by n lines, each containing two timestamps in the format hh:mm:ss representing the departure and arrival times of trains at Osaki Station. Each timestamp's hour (hh) is in the range 0 ≤ hh < 24, minutes (mm) are in the range 0 ≤ mm < 60, and seconds (ss) are in the range 0 ≤ ss < 60. The end of input is indicated by n = 0, which is not included in the datasets.
