The value of `q` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts an input as a string. The previous values of `l` and `p` remain unchanged, and `q` is now a string, regardless of its previous state. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is an input string, `p` is a string from input, `q` is an input string.

Output State: **`l` is an input string, `p` is a string from input, `q` is an input string**
