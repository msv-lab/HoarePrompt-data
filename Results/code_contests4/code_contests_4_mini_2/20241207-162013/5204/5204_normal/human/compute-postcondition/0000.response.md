The variable `l` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts an input and assigns it to `l`. The initial integer representation of `l` is no longer valid since it now holds a string value from the input. The values of `p` and `q` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`l` is an input string; `p` is an integer representing the speed of Harry's magic spell; `q` is an integer representing the speed of You-Know-Who's magic spell.**
