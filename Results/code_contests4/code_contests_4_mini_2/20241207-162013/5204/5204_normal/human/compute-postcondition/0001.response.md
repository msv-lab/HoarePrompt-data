The variable `p` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts an input string. The initial state indicates that `p` is an integer representing the speed of Harry's magic spell, but since `input()` returns a string, `p` will now hold a string value instead of an integer. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`l` is an input string; `p` is a string from input; `q` is an integer representing the speed of You-Know-Who's magic spell.**
