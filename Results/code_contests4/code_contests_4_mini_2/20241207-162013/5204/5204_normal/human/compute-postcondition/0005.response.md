The function `func` accepts three integer inputs: `l`, `p`, and `q`, which represent the length of a corridor, the speed of Harry's magic spell, and the speed of You-Know-Who's magic spell, respectively. The function calculates the time it takes for Harry's spell to reach the end of the corridor based on the speeds of both spells. However, the function does not return any meaningful results or comparisons between the two spells, as it only prints a mathematical operation instead.

The function's logic does not match the annotations, which claim that it returns "Harry wins" if `p` is greater than or equal to `q`, and "You-Know-Who wins" otherwise. In actuality, the function does not include any conditional checks or return statements to determine the outcome of the competition between the two spells.

Functionality: ** The function accepts integer inputs `l`, `p`, and `q`, performs a calculation involving the lengths and speeds but does not return any results or indicate a winner between Harry and You-Know-Who. **
