To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze if it accurately calculates the distance from Harry's position to the place of the second meeting of the spell impulses.

The program takes the following inputs:
- The length of the corridor `l`
- The speed of Harry's spell `p`
- The speed of Voldemort's spell `q`

The program computes the distance from Harry's position to the second meeting point of the spells using the formula:

```python
print(float(l) / (p + q)) * p
```

### Understanding the Program Logic
1. The first meeting point of the spells occurs when the two spells collide after traveling towards each other.
2. The formula for the first meeting point is `distance = (p / (p + q)) * l`, which gives the distance from Harry's position to their first meeting.
3. After the first meeting, both spells return to their casters and then are reflected back towards each other.
4. The second meeting point is the same as the first meeting point since both spells have the same speeds and travel the same distances after being reflected.

Thus, the distance to the second meeting point is also given by the same formula. The program effectively calculates this distance.

### Testing Potential Edge Cases
Let's test a few edge cases:
1. When `l = 1`, `p = 1`, and `q = 1`: 
   - The expected output is `0.5` (both spells meet in the middle).
   - The program calculates `1 / (1 + 1) * 1 = 0.5` which is correct.
   
2. When `l = 1000`, `p = 500`, and `q = 500`:
   - The expected output is `500` (they meet in the middle).
   - The program calculates `1000 / (500 + 500) * 500 = 500` which is correct.

3. When `l = 100`, `p = 100`, and `q = 1`:
   - The expected output should be `99.00990099009901` (Harry's spell travels much faster).
   - The program calculates `100 / (100 + 1) * 100 = 99.00990099009901` which is correct.

In all of these cases, the program's output matches the expected results based on the problem description.

### Conclusion
Since I cannot find any input case where the program fails to meet the problem requirements, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
