To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the code and the problem description step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
1. Harry and You-Know-Who are at opposite ends of a corridor of length `l`.
2. Harry's spell moves at speed `p` and Voldemort's at speed `q`.
3. The spells collide, turn around, and return to their respective casters.
4. They will collide again after reflecting. We need to find the distance from Harry's position to the point of their second meeting.

### Required Calculation:
The distance from Harry to the second meeting point can be calculated based on the ratio of the speeds of the spells. Specifically, when they first meet, the distance traveled by Harry's spell is proportional to its speed. The second meeting point is essentially determined by the distances traveled during both the first and the second journey of the spells.

### Program Code:
```python
l = input()
p = input()
q = input()
print(float(l) / (p + q)) * p
```

### Code Analysis:
1. The program takes inputs for `l`, `p`, and `q`, but it does not convert the inputs into integers or floats correctly before performing calculations.
2. The expression `float(l) / (p + q)` tries to divide `float(l)` by `(p + q)`, but since `p` and `q` are still strings at this point, this will raise a TypeError.
3. The program intends to compute the distance to the second meeting point but fails to correctly parse the input data.

### Example Case Where It Fails:
1. If we input:
   ```
   100
   50
   50
   ```
   The program will throw an error because it tries to add the string values of `p` and `q` without converting them to integers or floats, leading to a TypeError.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle the input correctly, which will lead to a failure for any input provided. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
