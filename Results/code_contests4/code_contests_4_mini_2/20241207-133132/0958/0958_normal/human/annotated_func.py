#State of the program right berfore the function call: k is an integer in the range 1 to 5, and the 4x4 panel is a list of strings where each string consists of 4 characters, each character being a digit from '1' to '9' or a period ('.').
def func():
    n = input()
    c = [0] * 10
    for i in range(4):
        for j in list(raw_input()):
            if j != '.':
                c[int(j)] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `k` is an integer in the range 1 to 5, `n` is a non-empty string, `c` is a list of 10 integers representing the counts of each digit (0-9) found in the input across all iterations, `i` is the total number of characters in the input that are not equal to '.', and `j` is the last character processed from the input that is not equal to '.' (if any).
    print['NO', 'YES'][max(c) <= n * 2]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and reads a number from input followed by four lines of input containing characters that are either digits '1' to '9' or periods ('.'). It counts the occurrences of each digit in the input and checks if the maximum count of any digit is less than or equal to double the input number. If this condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. Note that there is no validation for the input number or the digits being in the specified range, which could lead to errors with invalid inputs.
