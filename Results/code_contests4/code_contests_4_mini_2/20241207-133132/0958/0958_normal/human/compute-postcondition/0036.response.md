Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer in the range 1 to 5, `n` is a non-empty string, and `c` is a list of 10 integers. If `j` is not equal to '.', then `c[int(j)]` is incremented by 1, and for the loop to execute again, `j` must be the next character in `n` while the current index is less than the length of `n`.***
