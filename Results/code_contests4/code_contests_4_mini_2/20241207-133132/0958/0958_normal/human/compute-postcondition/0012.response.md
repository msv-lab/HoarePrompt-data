Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer in the range 1 to 5, `n` is a non-empty string, `c` has one index incremented by 1, `i` is 2, and `j` is the integer value of the third character of `n`, provided that `j` is not equal to '.'. If `j` is not equal to '.', the conditions of `k`, `n`, `c`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.***
