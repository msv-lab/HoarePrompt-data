Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer in the range 1 to 5, `n` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, and `c` is the updated list after incrementing the count at the index `int(j)` (where `j` is the second character of `n`), if `j` is not equal to '.'; otherwise, the state of `c` remains unchanged.***
