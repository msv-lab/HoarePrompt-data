Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer in the range 1 to 5, `n` is a non-empty string, `c` is a list of 10 integers representing the counts of each digit found in `n`. If `j` is not equal to '.', the value at index `int(j)` in the list `c` is incremented by 1, `i` is set to 0, and `j` remains as the first character of the new input (not equal to '.').***
