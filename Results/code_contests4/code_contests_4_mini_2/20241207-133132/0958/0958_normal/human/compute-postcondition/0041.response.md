Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and reads a number from input followed by four lines of input containing characters that are either digits '1' to '9' or periods ('.'). It counts the occurrences of each digit in the input and checks if the maximum count of any digit is less than or equal to double the input number. If this condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. Note that there is no validation for the input number or the digits being in the specified range, which could lead to errors with invalid inputs. **
