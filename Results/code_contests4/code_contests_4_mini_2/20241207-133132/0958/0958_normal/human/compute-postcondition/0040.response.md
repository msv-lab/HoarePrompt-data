The function `func` accepts two parameters: `k` and `panel`. The parameter `k` is an integer that must be in the range 1 to 5. The parameter `panel` is a list of strings, where each string consists of 4 characters, and each character is either a digit from '1' to '9' or a period ('.'). 

The function does not explicitly return a value in the provided constraints and output information. Therefore, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `k` in the range 1 to 5 and a list of strings `panel` consisting of 4-character strings made up of digits '1' to '9' or periods ('.').**
