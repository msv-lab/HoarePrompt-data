Correctness: **False**.

The program is supposed to identify whether a photograph has been rearranged or not based on the given input format. However, it simply outputs a predetermined list of "YES" and "NO" responses without analyzing the actual images or their properties. 

A potential case where the program fails is if the actual input (images) contain rearranged and non-rearranged photographs that do not match the provided output. For instance, if a photograph that was not rearranged is labeled as "YES" in the output, it would be incorrect. Since the program does not process the images or perform any checks based on the problem description, it cannot guarantee correctness for all cases, leading to a failure in meeting the requirements outlined.

Thus, the program does not satisfy the conditions set by the problem description, and therefore, its correctness is false.
