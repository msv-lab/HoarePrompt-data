Correctness: **False**

The provided program simply outputs a predefined list of answers without any logic to determine whether the photographs have been rearranged or not. This means that regardless of the actual content of the photographs in the input, the program will produce the same output every time.

For instance, consider a case where the photograph is entirely unaltered, meaning the top and bottom halves are in their original positions. The expected output for such a case should be "NO". However, if this photograph corresponds to a position in the predefined output list that says "YES", the program will incorrectly state that the photograph has been rearranged.

Since the program does not compute or analyze the images as required by the problem statement, it will fail for many inputs, particularly those that do not match the predefined answers. Therefore, the program does not work as expected for every potential case, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
