The function processes a series of questions about photographs, where each question consists of an integer indicating the number of photographs, followed by the dimensions (height and width) of each photograph and their respective pixel brightness values. It outputs a series of 'YES' or 'NO' answers, likely indicating whether each photograph meets certain criteria, although the specific criteria are not detailed in the provided code or annotations. The function does not return any values or handle potential errors related to the input format, such as incorrect dimensions or pixel values.
