The function processes a sequence of questions where each question consists of an integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 220), followed by q photographs, each with two integers h and w (1 ≤ h, w ≤ 600) representing the height and width of the photograph, respectively, followed by h lines of w space-separated integers (0 ≤ aij < 256) representing the pixel brightness values in the photograph. It is guaranteed that h is even.
