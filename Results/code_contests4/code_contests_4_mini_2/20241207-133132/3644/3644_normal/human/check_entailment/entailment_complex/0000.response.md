Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not implement the required logic to determine whether the photographs have been rearranged or not based on the problem description. Instead, the function simply outputs a predetermined list of 'YES' and 'NO' responses without processing any input or evaluating the photographs according to the specified criteria.

The problem description requires the program to:

1. Read a number of questions (photographs) and their dimensions.
2. Analyze the pixel data of each photograph to determine if the top half has been swapped with the bottom half.
3. Output 'YES' if the photograph has been rearranged and 'NO' if it has not.

However, the annotated program does not contain any logic to read the actual pixel data or to check for rearrangement. It lacks the necessary computations and conditions to verify the rearrangement of the photographs. The function only returns a fixed sequence of results without relation to the input photographs.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, which leads to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
