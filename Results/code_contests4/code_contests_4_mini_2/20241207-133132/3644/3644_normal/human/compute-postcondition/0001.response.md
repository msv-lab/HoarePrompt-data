The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it processes a sequence of questions, each consisting of an integer `q` followed by `q` photographs. Each photograph is defined by two integers `h` and `w`, which represent the height and width of the photograph, respectively. Following these integers, there are `h` lines of `w` space-separated integers that represent the pixel brightness values in the photograph. It is guaranteed that `h` is even. 

The output of the function is not explicitly defined in the provided constraints, but it likely involves processing the photographs and producing results based on their pixel brightness values. 

Functionality: **The function processes a sequence of questions regarding photographs, where each question includes an integer followed by multiple photographs defined by their dimensions and pixel brightness values.**
