Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the maximum number of trees that can be felled according to the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Counting Logic**: The program counts trees based on whether they can be seen or not, which does not align with the requirement to count the maximum number of trees that can be cut down. The logic in the loop is flawed as it does not appropriately account for the trees that can be felled to the left or right based on the conditions of their positions and heights.

2. **Boundary Conditions**: The loop iterates from `1` to `len(p) - 1`, which means it does not consider the first and the last trees correctly. The first tree can always be felled to the left if it has sufficient height, and the last tree can always be felled to the right. The implementation should account for these possibilities.

3. **Missing Cases**: The program does not handle cases where trees could potentially fall into the space occupied by the next tree if they are not cut down. The logic for checking if a tree can fall to the left or right is not comprehensive. It only checks if the current tree can fall left based on the previous tree's position and height, and if it can fall right based on the next tree's position.

4. **Improper Initialization**: The variable `cont` is initialized to `2` when `n` is greater than `1`, which is misleading. The count should start from `1` for the first tree and be incremented based on valid conditions for felling subsequent trees.

Due to these issues, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description, leading to an inaccurate count of the maximum number of trees that can be felled. Therefore, the conclusion is that the program is incorrect.
