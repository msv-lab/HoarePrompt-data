Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` which is not available in Python 3. It should use `input()` instead. This would lead to a runtime error in a Python 3 environment.

2. **Logic for Counting Trees**: The loop intended to count how many trees can be cut down contains logic flaws. Specifically:
   - The loop starts from `1` and goes to `len(p) - 1`. This means it skips the first tree and does not consider it for felling, even though it can always fall left if there are no other trees before it.
   - The condition `if p[i] - h[i] > pivout:` checks if the current tree can be felled to the left. However, `pivout` is only updated when a tree is felled, which may not correctly represent the last position occupied by previously felled trees.
   - The logic does not correctly account for the case where the last tree can be felled to the right, as it only checks conditions for trees in-between the first and last.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not handle the case when there is only one tree correctly. The initialization of `cont` to `2` when `n > 1` is incorrect; it should start with `1` for the first tree and not count it twice.

Overall, the program's approach to count the maximum number of trees that can be felled does not cover all necessary conditions and edge cases outlined in the problem description. For example, when there are only two trees, it doesn't properly evaluate the possibility of felling both trees. 

Due to these issues, the program does not adhere to the problem requirements, thus rendering it incorrect.
