According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1. Additionally, since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration, `i` will become 2 for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**.
