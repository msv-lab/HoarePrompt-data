Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer. If `n` is equal to 1, then `i` is set to 1, `p` and `h` each contain 1 integer, `pivout` is the first element of `p`, and `cont` is initialized to 1. If `n` is greater than 1, then `i` is set to `n`, `p` contains `n` integers, `h` contains `n` integers, `pivout` is the first element of `p`, and `cont` is set to 2.***
