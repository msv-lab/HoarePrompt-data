The code assigns the value `2` to the variable `cont`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed, so the output state reflects the new assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer larger than 1, `i` is `n`, `p` contains `n` integers, `h` contains `n` integers, `pivout` is the first element of `p`, and `cont` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer larger than 1, `i` is `n`, `p` contains `n` integers, `h` contains `n` integers, `pivout` is the first element of `p`, `cont` is 2**
