After all iterations of the loop have finished, the following output state can be determined:

The loop iterates `n` times, collecting pairs of integers from user input and appending them to the lists `p` and `h`. After `n` iterations, `p` will contain `n` integers, the first elements of each input pair, and `h` will contain `n` integers, the second elements of each input pair. The variable `i` will be equal to `n` after the last iteration.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `p` contains `n` integers from the first elements of the input pairs, `h` contains `n` integers from the second elements of the input pairs.**
