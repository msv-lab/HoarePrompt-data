Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n`, `p` contains `n` integers, `h` contains `n` integers, `pivout` is updated to `p[i] + h[i]`, `cont` is 3, the difference between `p[i]` and `h[i]` is less than or equal to the previous `pivout`, and the sum of `p[i]` and `h[i]` is less than `p[i + 1]`.**
