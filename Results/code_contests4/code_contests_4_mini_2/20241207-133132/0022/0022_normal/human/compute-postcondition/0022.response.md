To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the conditions provided along with the for loop statement.

1. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `len(p) - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, the expression `len(p) - 1` must be greater than 1. This implies that `len(p)` must be at least 2. 

2. The value of `i` before the loop starts depends on the value of `n`:
   - If `n` is equal to 1, then `i` is set to 1, and `p` and `h` each contain 1 integer. Thus, `len(p)` would be 1, which means `len(p) - 1` is 0, and the loop will not execute.
   - If `n` is greater than 1, then `i` is set to `n`, and `p` contains `n` integers. Hence, `len(p)` would be equal to `n`, which is greater than 1, allowing the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the necessary states to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` should be initialized to `n` (which is valid since `n` is greater than 1).
- `pivout` is still valid as `pivout` is set to the first element of `p`.
- `cont` is set to 2.

Thus, the final state can be articulated as follows:

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n`, `p` contains `n` integers, `h` contains `n` integers, `pivout` is the first element of `p`, `cont` is 2**
