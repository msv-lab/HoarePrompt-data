Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n`, representing the number of trees, and processes pairs of integers (xi, hi) that represent the position and height of each tree respectively. It counts and prints the number of trees that can be "seen" based on specific conditions regarding their heights and positions. If there is only one tree, it counts it as visible; otherwise, it checks if a tree is either not obstructed by the previous tree or if it can be seen beyond the height of the previous trees. The function does not handle any input validation or edge cases explicitly, such as when `n` is less than 1, but it assumes `n` will always be within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000).**
