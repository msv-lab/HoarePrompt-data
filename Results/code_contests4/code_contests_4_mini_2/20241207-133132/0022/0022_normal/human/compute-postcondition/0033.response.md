Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n`, `p` contains `n` integers, `h` contains `n` integers. If the difference between `p[i]` and `h[i]` is greater than `pivout`, then `cont` is set to 3 and the difference between `p[i]` and `h[i]` is greater than the previous `pivout`. Otherwise, if the sum of `p[i]` and `h[i]` is less than `p[i + 1]`, then `pivout` is updated to `p[i] + h[i]`, `cont` is set to 3, and the difference between `p[i]` and `h[i]` is less than or equal to the previous `pivout`. If this condition is not met, `pivout` is assigned the value of `p[i]`, `cont` remains 2, the difference between `p[i]` and `h[i]` is less than or equal to `pivout`, and the sum of `p[i]` and `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `p[i + 1]`.***
