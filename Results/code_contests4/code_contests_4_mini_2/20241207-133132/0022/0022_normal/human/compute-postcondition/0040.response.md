Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n`, if the sum of the last elements of `p` and `h` is less than `p[i + 1]`, then `pivout` is the sum of `p[i]` and `h[i]` and `cont` is increased by 1, with the loop unable to execute again. Otherwise, `pivout` is assigned the value of `p[n]`, but this may lead to an index error or undefined behavior if `p` is zero-indexed, and the loop cannot execute again.***
