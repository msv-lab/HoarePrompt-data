The value of `cont` is incremented by 1, and since its previous value was 2, after execution, `cont` becomes 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n`, `p` contains `n` integers, `h` contains `n` integers, `pivout` is the first element of `p`, `cont` is 3, the difference between `p[i]` and `h[i]` is less than or equal to `pivout`, and the sum of `p[i]` and `h[i]` is less than `p[i + 1]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n`, `p` contains `n` integers, `h` contains `n` integers, `pivout` is the first element of `p`, `cont` is 3, the difference between `p[i]` and `h[i]` is less than or equal to `pivout`, and the sum of `p[i]` and `h[i]` is less than `p[i + 1]`.**
