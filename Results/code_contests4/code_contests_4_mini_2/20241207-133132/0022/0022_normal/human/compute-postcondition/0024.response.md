The value of `cont` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cont` is 2, so after execution, `cont` becomes 3. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `p`, `h`, and `pivout`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n`, `p` contains `n` integers, `h` contains `n` integers, `pivout` is the first element of `p`, `cont` is 3, and the difference between `p[i]` and `h[i]` is greater than `pivout`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n`, `p` contains `n` integers, `h` contains `n` integers, `pivout` is the first element of `p`, `cont` is 3, and the difference between `p[i]` and `h[i]` is greater than `pivout`.**
