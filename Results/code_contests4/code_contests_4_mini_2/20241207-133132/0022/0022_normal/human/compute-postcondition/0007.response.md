According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, after this iteration, `i` will become 1. 

Since `n` is a positive integer, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
