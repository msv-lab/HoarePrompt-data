The code appends the first element of the list `e` to the list `p`. Since `e` is assigned the result of mapping `int` over the input split into a list of strings, `e[0]` is the first integer from that input. The values of `n`, `i`, and `h` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `p` contains the first integer from input, `h` is an empty list, and `e` is a list of integers derived from input. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `p` contains the first integer from input, `h` is an empty list, `e` is a list of integers derived from input**.
