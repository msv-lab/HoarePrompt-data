Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n`, `p` and `h` each contain `n` integers. If `p[i] - h[i]` is greater than `pivout`, `cont` is increased by 1, and `pivout` is assigned the value of `p[n]`. If not, and if the sum of the last elements of `p` and `h` is less than `p[i + 1]`, then `pivout` is the sum of `p[i]` and `h[i]`, and `cont` is increased by 1; otherwise, `pivout` is assigned the value of `p[n]`, but this may lead to an index error or undefined behavior, with the loop unable to execute again in all cases.***
