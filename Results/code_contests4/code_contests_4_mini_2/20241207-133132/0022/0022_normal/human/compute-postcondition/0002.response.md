The variable `h` is assigned an empty list. The previous values of `n` and `p` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `p` is an empty list, `h` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `p` is an empty list, `h` is an empty list**
