According to the code, the loop iterates over the range of indices from 1 to `len(p) - 1`. The variable `i` at the end of the last iteration is `n`, which means it is currently at the last valid index if `n` equals `len(p) - 1`. 

However, since the loop is defined to iterate with `i` ranging from 1 to `len(p) - 2`, if `i` is `n`, it indicates that the loop cannot execute again because the next value of `i` would be `n + 1`, which is out of bounds for the loop's range. 

For the loop to potentially execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(p) - 1`. In this case, if `i` is `n`, it implies that `n` must be at least `len(p) - 1`, which means it can't increment further without exceeding the bounds of the range.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n`, for the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be less than `len(p) - 1`**.
