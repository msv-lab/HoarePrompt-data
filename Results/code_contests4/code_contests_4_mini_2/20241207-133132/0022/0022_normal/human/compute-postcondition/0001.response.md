The code initializes an empty list `p`. Since `n` is a positive integer and is not affected by this operation, it retains its value. The output state reflects that `p` is now an empty list while `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `p` is an empty list**
