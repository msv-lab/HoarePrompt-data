Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n`, if `p[i] - h[i]` is greater than `pivout`, then `cont` is increased by 1 and `pivout` is assigned the value of `p[n]`. Otherwise, if `p[i] + h[i]` is less than `p[i + 1]`, `cont` is increased by 1 and `pivout` is assigned the value `p[n] + h[n]`; otherwise, `pivout` is assigned the value `p[n]`.***
