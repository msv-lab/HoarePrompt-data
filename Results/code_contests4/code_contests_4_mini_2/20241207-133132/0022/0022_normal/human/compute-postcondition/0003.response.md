According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1. The variable `i` will start at 0 during the first iteration of the loop. The lists `p` and `h` being empty does not affect the execution of the loop itself but may affect the operations within the loop body. 

For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be initialized to 0, and since `n` is guaranteed to be at least 1 based on the provided state, we can conclude that the loop will execute.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `p` is an empty list, `h` is an empty list**
