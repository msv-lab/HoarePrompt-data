The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as it is defined without any input parameters. Instead, it operates on an implicit dataset defined by the constraints that there are `n` trees represented by pairs of integers `(xi, hi)`, where `xi` is a distinct integer representing the position of the tree and `hi` is a positive integer representing the height of the tree.

The function's output is based on these trees, and it processes the data according to the specified constraints. 

Functionality: **The function processes an implicit dataset of `n` trees, represented by pairs of integers (xi, hi), and returns a result based on the characteristics of these trees.**
