The variable `cont` is incremented by 1. The other variables `n`, `i`, `p`, and `h` remain unchanged, and since `i` has reached its limit, the loop cannot execute again. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n`, `p` contains `n` integers, `h` contains `n` integers; `cont` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n`, `p` contains `n` integers, `h` contains `n` integers; `cont` is increased by 1.**
