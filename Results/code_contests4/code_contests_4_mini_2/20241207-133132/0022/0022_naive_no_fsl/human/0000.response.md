Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all edge cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic in the loop that processes the trees has flaws that prevent it from correctly counting the maximum number of trees that can be felled.

Here are the key issues:

1. **Initial Count**: The program initializes `cont` to 2 if there are more than one tree, and this is incorrect. The first tree can always be felled to the left, making the initial count 1, and only incrementing based on subsequent trees.

2. **Loop Logic**: The loop iterates from the second tree to the second-to-last tree with `for i in range(1, len(p) - 1):`. This means the first and last trees are not fully considered. The last tree can also be felled to the right as long as it doesn't interfere with the previously processed tree, but this logic is missing.

3. **Incorrect Conditions**: When checking if a tree can be felled, it should not only check against the previous tree but also the next tree properly. The current condition `elif p[i] + h[i] < p[i + 1]:` does not account for the case when the tree can be felled to the right without overlapping with the next tree.

4. **Handling the Last Tree**: The last tree is never checked for the possibility of being felled to the right. The code should also include a check for this scenario after the loop.

To illustrate a failing case:

Consider the input:
```
3
1 2
2 2
3 2
```

The expected output is `3` because:
- The first tree can be felled to the left.
- The second tree can be felled to the right.
- The third tree can be felled to the right as well.

However, the program would incorrectly output `2` because it does not properly account for the last tree being felled.

Thus, due to these logical errors in handling the trees, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem statement for all potential cases.
