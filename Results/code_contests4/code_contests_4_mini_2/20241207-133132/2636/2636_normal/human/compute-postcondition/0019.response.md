The function `func` accepts three parameters: `C1`, `C2`, and `C3`. `C1` and `C2` are integers from 1 to 10 representing the numbers on your two cards, and `C3` is an integer from 1 to 10 representing the number on your opponent's face card. The total of `C1` and `C2` must be less than or equal to 20. The function returns different outputs based on the values of `C1`, `C2`, and `C3`. 

Case 1: If the total of `C1` and `C2` is greater than 20, the function returns an error message indicating that the total cannot exceed 20. 

Case 2: If the total of `C1` and `C2` is less than or equal to 20, the function compares the total of `C1` and `C2` with `C3`. If the total is greater than `C3`, the function returns "win"; if it is less than `C3`, it returns "lose"; if it is equal to `C3`, it returns "draw".

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept three integers `C1`, `C2`, and `C3`, check if the total of `C1` and `C2` exceeds 20, and based on the comparison with `C3`, return the result of the game as "win", "lose", or "draw". 

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters C1, C2, and C3, checks if the total of C1 and C2 exceeds 20, and returns an error message if it does. If not, it compares the total with C3 and returns "win" if the total is greater, "lose" if it is less, or "draw" if they are equal.**
