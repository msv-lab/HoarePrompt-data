According to the code, the loop iterates over the lines of input from `stdin`. For the loop to execute, it is essential that there is at least one line of input available. The conditions regarding the card values (`C1`, `C2`, and `C3`) are important for the logic of the program, but they do not directly affect the execution of the loop itself.

Thus, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute:
1. Ensure that there is at least one line of input in `stdin`.
2. The total of `C1` and `C2` must be less than or equal to 20.

However, since the loop can execute regardless of the specific values of `C1`, `C2`, and `C3`, as long as they are valid integers, the key state adjustment is the presence of input.

State: **`C1` is an integer from 1 to 10, `C2` is an integer from 1 to 10, `C3` is an integer from 1 to 10, for the loop to execute there must be at least one line of input in stdin, and the total of C1 and C2 must be less than or equal to 20.**
