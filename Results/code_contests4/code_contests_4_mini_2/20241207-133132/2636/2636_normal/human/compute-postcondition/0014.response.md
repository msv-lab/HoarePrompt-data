To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the initial state.

The code snippet is:
```
cards = [i for i in range(1, 11) if i not in c]
```

1. The variable `cards` is being assigned a new list created through a list comprehension.
2. The list comprehension iterates over the range of integers from 1 to 10 (inclusive).
3. For each integer `i` in this range, it checks if `i` is not present in the list `c`.
4. The integers that satisfy this condition (i.e., those not in `c`) will be included in the new list assigned to `cards`.

Assuming `c` is a list of integers that contains some values from the range 1 to 10, the output state will reflect the current values of the variables based on the integers that remain after filtering out the values present in `c`.

Therefore, the output state will include the updated `cards` list, which contains the integers from 1 to 10 excluding those in `c`.

Output State: **`C1` is an integer from 1 to 10, `C2` is an integer from 1 to 10, `C3` is an integer from 1 to 10; `c1c2` is the sum of `C1` and `C2` (ranging from 2 to 20); `cards` is a list of integers from 1 to 10 excluding `C1`, `C2`, `C3`, and any integers in `c`.**
