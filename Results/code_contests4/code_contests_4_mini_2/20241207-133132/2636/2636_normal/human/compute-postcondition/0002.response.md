The list `cards` is created using a list comprehension that includes integers from 1 to 10, excluding any integers that are present in the list `c`. The values of `C1`, `C2`, and `C3` are not directly affected, but they inform the possible values in `c`. The output state will reflect the remaining integers in `cards` after filtering out those in `c`.

Output State: **`C1` is an integer from 1 to 10, `C2` is an integer from 1 to 10, `C3` is an integer from 1 to 10; `cards` is a list of integers from 1 to 10 excluding those in `c`.**
