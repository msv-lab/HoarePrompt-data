Output State: **`C1` is an integer from 1 to 10, `C2` is an integer from 1 to 10, `C3` is an integer from 1 to 10; `c1c2` is the sum of `C1` and `C2` (ranging from 2 to 20); `cards` is a list of integers from 1 to 10 excluding `C1`, `C2`, and `C3`; `e` is the total count of elements in `cards` such that `i + c1c2 <= 20` for all iterations; the result is 'YES' if `e` > 3, otherwise 'NO'.**
