The function processes input lines containing three integers representing two player cards (C1 and C2) and one opponent's face card (C3). It checks if the sum of C1 and C2 exceeds 20 and does not return any error message for that case. It then counts how many remaining cards (not including C1, C2, and C3) can be added to the sum of C1 and C2 without exceeding 20. If more than three such cards exist, it outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO". The function does not return win/lose/draw messages based on comparisons with C3 as stated in the annotations.
