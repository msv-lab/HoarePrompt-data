The function accepts an integer `x`, representing the number of test cases, and a list `y` of tuples containing three integers each. It calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the integer `x` and the last non-zero value of `y`, which is derived from the tuple elements. If `y` is empty, the function will result in an error due to the lack of valid input for calculations.
