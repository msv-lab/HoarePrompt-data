The function `func_6` initializes a thread to execute the `main` function, setting up a recursion limit and stack size suitable for handling a large number of test cases. However, it does not directly accept any parameters itself, nor does it perform any operations on the parameters `t`, `a`, `b`, or `c` as mentioned in the annotations. The main functionality and logic that processes these parameters must be implemented in the `main` function, which is not provided. Therefore, the annotations about accepting parameters and their constraints are misleading, as this function only starts a thread without handling those inputs.
