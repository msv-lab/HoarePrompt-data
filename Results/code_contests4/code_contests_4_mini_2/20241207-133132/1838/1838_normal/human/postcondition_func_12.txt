The function accepts an integer `n`, representing the number of test cases, and a list `r` of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers. It calculates and returns the value of the combination formula for choosing `r` segments from `n` test cases. However, the function does not properly handle the input `r`, which should represent the number of segments but is treated as if it were a single integer. The code will raise an error if `r` is a list of tuples instead of an integer. Thus, it lacks the functionality to correctly process the number of ways to choose segments based on the provided tuples.
