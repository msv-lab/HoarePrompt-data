The function processes up to 1000 test cases, where for each test case, it retrieves three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, and subsequently calls another function `func_20` with the parameter `c + 1`. The function does not return any values directly. Instead, it performs operations based on the values of `c` from each test case. The actual behavior and output of `func_20` are not specified in the provided code.
