The function accepts an integer `x` representing the number of test cases and a tuple `y` containing three integers (a, b, c) representing lengths of fence segments. It returns the integer result of `x` divided by the sum of the elements in `y`. If `x` is divisible by the sum of the elements in `y`, it returns the quotient; otherwise, it returns the quotient plus one. The function does not handle cases where the sum of `y` is zero, which could lead to a division by zero error.
