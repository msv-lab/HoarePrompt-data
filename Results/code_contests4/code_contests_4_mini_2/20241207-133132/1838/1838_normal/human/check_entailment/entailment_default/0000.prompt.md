You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those output hints describes certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Yura is tasked to build a closed fence in shape of an arbitrary non-degenerate simple quadrilateral. He's already got three straight fence segments with known lengths a, b, and c. Now he needs to find out some possible integer length d of the fourth straight fence segment so that he can build the fence using these four segments. In other words, the fence should have a quadrilateral shape with side lengths equal to a, b, c, and d. Help Yura, find any possible length of the fourth side.

A non-degenerate simple quadrilateral is such a quadrilateral that no three of its corners lie on the same line, and it does not cross itself.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t — the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). The next t lines describe the test cases.

Each line contains three integers a, b, and c — the lengths of the three fence segments (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9).

Output

For each test case print a single integer d — the length of the fourth fence segment that is suitable for building the fence. If there are multiple answers, print any. We can show that an answer always exists.

Example

Input


2
1 2 3
12 34 56


Output


4
42

Note

We can build a quadrilateral with sides 1, 2, 3, 4.

We can build a quadrilateral with sides 12, 34, 56, 42.
Functions with output description for each function:
Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output decription for function1:  The function accepts no parameters and returns a positive integer input provided by the user. It does not handle any validation for the input and will raise an error if the input is not a valid integer.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return input()
''' 

 Output decription for function2:  The function accepts input values for test cases, where the first input is a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by sets of three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case, representing the lengths of three fence segments. The function returns the input as a string, but it does not validate the input or parse it into separate values, which may lead to issues in processing the data further.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().strip().split(' '))
''' 

 Output decription for function3:  The function accepts no parameters and returns an iterator that yields integers parsed from a single line of input, which is expected to contain three space-separated values, `a`, `b`, and `c`, all of which must be integers in the range of 1 to 10^9. There is no error handling for invalid input formats or values outside the specified range.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    return map(str, input().strip().split(' '))
''' 

 Output decription for function4:  The function accepts space-separated input of integers a, b, and c, and returns a map object containing their string representations. It does not perform input validation or error handling for cases where the input does not meet the expected format.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return list(func_3())
''' 

 Output decription for function5:  The function accepts no parameters and returns a list generated by the function `func_3()`. The values for `a`, `b`, and `c` are expected to be integers within the range of 1 to 10^9 for each test case, and `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000. However, the function does not handle or validate these inputs, so it relies on the assumption that the inputs are provided correctly by the calling context.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1000000)
    threading.stack_size(1024000)
    thread = threading.Thread(target=main)
    thread.start()
''' 

 Output decription for function6:  The function `func_6` initializes a thread to execute the `main` function, setting up a recursion limit and stack size suitable for handling a large number of test cases. However, it does not directly accept any parameters itself, nor does it perform any operations on the parameters `t`, `a`, `b`, or `c` as mentioned in the annotations. The main functionality and logic that processes these parameters must be implemented in the `main` function, which is not provided. Therefore, the annotations about accepting parameters and their constraints are misleading, as this function only starts a thread without handling those inputs.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7(item):
    return item[1]
''' 

 Output decription for function7:  The function accepts a list of tuples, each containing three integers a, b, and c, and returns the second tuple from the list. If the list contains fewer than two tuples, it may result in an IndexError, as the function attempts to access the second element without checking the list's length.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(l):
    return sorted(l, key=getKey, reverse=True)
''' 

 Output decription for function8:  The function accepts a list of tuples `l`, where each tuple contains three integers. It returns the list sorted in descending order based on a key defined by the `getKey` function. The function does not handle cases where `l` is empty, but it will simply return an empty list in that case.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9(n, m, num):
    return [[num for x in range(m)] for y in range(n)]
''' 

 Output decription for function9:  The function accepts an integer `n`, an integer `m`, and a list of tuples `num`, and returns a list containing `n` lists, each with `m` identical tuples copied from the original list `num`. Each tuple contains three integers (a, b, c).
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10(x):
    return x and (not x & x - 1)
''' 

 Output decription for function10:  The function accepts a list of tuples `x`, where each tuple contains three integers. It returns a boolean value indicating whether `x` is not empty and if it has only one element (i.e., if `x` is a power of two). If `x` is empty, it evaluates to `False`. The function does not return the list of tuples `x` as the annotations suggest.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11(n):
    return bin(n).replace('0b', '')
''' 

 Output decription for function11:  The function accepts a positive integer `n`, representing the number of test cases, and returns the binary representation of `n` as a string, without the '0b' prefix. The function does not perform any validation on the input to check if `n` is within the specified bounds (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), so it will return the binary representation for any positive integer value of `n` supplied.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(n):
    return [int(i) for i in str(n)]
''' 

 Output decription for function12:  The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns a list of integers representing the digits of `n`. It does not process any test cases or any values associated with them; it simply converts the digits of `n` into a list.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(n, r):
    return factorial(n) // (factorial(r) * factorial(max(n - r, 1)))
''' 

 Output decription for function13:  The function accepts an integer `n`, representing the number of test cases, and a list `r` of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers. It calculates and returns the value of the combination formula for choosing `r` segments from `n` test cases. However, the function does not properly handle the input `r`, which should represent the number of segments but is treated as if it were a single integer. The code will raise an error if `r` is a list of tuples instead of an integer. Thus, it lacks the functionality to correctly process the number of ways to choose segments based on the provided tuples.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14(x, y):
    if x % y == 0:
        return x // y
    else:
        return x // y + 1
''' 

 Output decription for function14:  The function accepts an integer `x` representing the number of test cases and a tuple `y` containing three integers (a, b, c) representing lengths of fence segments. It returns the integer result of `x` divided by the sum of the elements in `y`. If `x` is divisible by the sum of the elements in `y`, it returns the quotient; otherwise, it returns the quotient plus one. The function does not handle cases where the sum of `y` is zero, which could lead to a division by zero error.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15(x, y, p):
    res = 1
    x %= p
    while y > 0:
        if y & 1:
            res = res * x % p
        y = y >> 1
        x = x * x % p
    return res
''' 

 Output decription for function15:  The function accepts three parameters: two integers `x` and `y`, and a positive integer `p`. It computes the modular exponentiation of `x` raised to the power of `y` modulo `p`, returning the result. The function effectively handles the computation even when `y` is initially zero, resulting in the function returning 1 since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. The final output is the computed value of `res`, which reflects this modular exponentiation.
Function number 16 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_16(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
''' 

 Output decription for function16:  The function accepts an integer `x`, representing the number of test cases, and a list `y` of tuples containing three integers each. It calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the integer `x` and the last non-zero value of `y`, which is derived from the tuple elements. If `y` is empty, the function will result in an error due to the lack of valid input for calculations.
Function number 17 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_17(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i = i + 6
    return True
''' 

 Output decription for function17:  The function accepts a positive integer `n`, which represents the number of test cases. It returns `False` if `n` is less than or equal to 1, or if `n` is either divisible by 2 or 3. If `n` is greater than 3 and not divisible by these numbers, it checks if `n` is a prime number using trial division up to the square root of `n`. If no divisors are found, it returns `True`, indicating that `n` is prime. Therefore, the function effectively determines the primality of `n` for specific conditions and returns a boolean result based on those evaluations.
Function number 18 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_18():
    sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
    sys.stdout = open('output.txt', 'w')
''' 

 Output decription for function18:  The function `func_18` does not accept any parameters. It reads input from a file named 'input.txt' and writes output to a file named 'output.txt'. The function processes multiple test cases involving three integers, but the specific logic for handling these test cases is not provided in the code snippet. As such, the complete functionality regarding how the integers are processed and what results are generated is unclear and requires additional implementation.
Function number 19 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_19():
    for _ in range(func_1()):
        (a, b, c) = func_3()
        func_20(c + 1)
''' 

 Output decription for function19:  The function processes up to 1000 test cases, where for each test case, it retrieves three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, and subsequently calls another function `func_20` with the parameter `c + 1`. The function does not return any values directly. Instead, it performs operations based on the values of `c` from each test case. The actual behavior and output of `func_20` are not specified in the provided code.

First I want you to try to see if the program (including all the functions) does what the description says. Look at only the code and the description and make an initial assesment.Try to think of any edge cases that the code might not be handling.

Then I want you to see if the output hints agree with the code. Sometimes the output hints hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the output hints says are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to make a more informed decision and detrmine if the code is correct or not.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code.
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
