The function accepts three parameters: two integers `x` and `y`, and a positive integer `p`. It computes the modular exponentiation of `x` raised to the power of `y` modulo `p`, returning the result. The function effectively handles the computation even when `y` is initially zero, resulting in the function returning 1 since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. The final output is the computed value of `res`, which reflects this modular exponentiation.
