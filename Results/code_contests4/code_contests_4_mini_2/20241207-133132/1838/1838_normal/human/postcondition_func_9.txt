The function accepts a list of tuples `x`, where each tuple contains three integers. It returns a boolean value indicating whether `x` is not empty and if it has only one element (i.e., if `x` is a power of two). If `x` is empty, it evaluates to `False`. The function does not return the list of tuples `x` as the annotations suggest.
