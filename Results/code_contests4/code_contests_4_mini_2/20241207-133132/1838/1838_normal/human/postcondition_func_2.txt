The function accepts no parameters and returns an iterator that yields integers parsed from a single line of input, which is expected to contain three space-separated values, `a`, `b`, and `c`, all of which must be integers in the range of 1 to 10^9. There is no error handling for invalid input formats or values outside the specified range.
