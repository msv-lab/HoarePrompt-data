The function `func_18` does not accept any parameters. It reads input from a file named 'input.txt' and writes output to a file named 'output.txt'. The function processes multiple test cases involving three integers, but the specific logic for handling these test cases is not provided in the code snippet. As such, the complete functionality regarding how the integers are processed and what results are generated is unclear and requires additional implementation.
