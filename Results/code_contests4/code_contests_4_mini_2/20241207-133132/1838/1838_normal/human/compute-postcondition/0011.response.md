Postcondition: ***`sep` is assigned a value from `kwargs`, `file` is assigned a value from `kwargs`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least 2 elements, and `x` is the second element in `args`. If `at_start` is False, then the value of `sep` is written to `file` using `file.write(sep)`.***
