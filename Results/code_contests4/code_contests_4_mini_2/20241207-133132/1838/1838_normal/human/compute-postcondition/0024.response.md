The function `func_20` does not accept any parameters directly as it is defined without any input parameters. However, it operates on a given number of test cases `t`, where each test case consists of three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. These integers represent the lengths of three fence segments, with the constraints that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and each of `a`, `b`, and `c` is an integer between 1 and 10^9.

The output of the function is determined based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case. The function will likely evaluate whether the three lengths can form a valid triangle (based on the triangle inequality theorem) and return results accordingly.

Functionality: **The function processes a number of test cases where each case consists of three integers representing fence segment lengths, and likely returns results based on whether these lengths can form a valid triangle.**
