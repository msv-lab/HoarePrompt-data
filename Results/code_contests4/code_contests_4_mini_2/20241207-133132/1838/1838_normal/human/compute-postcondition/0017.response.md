Output State: **`sep` is assigned a value from `kwargs`, `file` is assigned a value from `kwargs`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in `args`, and since `at_start` is False, `file` has written `sep`; `file` has now written `str(x)`.**
