Postcondition: ***`sep` is assigned a value from `kwargs`, `file` is assigned a value from `kwargs`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable, `file` has written the string representation of each element in `args` separated by `sep`, `kwargs` has the key `'end'` removed. If the key `'flush'` is popped from `kwargs` with a value of True, then `file.flush()` is called, ensuring that all buffered output is written to the file.***
