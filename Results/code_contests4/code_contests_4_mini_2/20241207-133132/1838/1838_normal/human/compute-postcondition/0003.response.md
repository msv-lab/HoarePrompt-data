According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `args`. If `args` is not empty (i.e., it has at least one element), the loop will execute. The current states of `sep`, `file`, and `at_start` do not impact the execution of the loop directly, but we need to ensure that `args` has elements.

So for the loop to be executed the first time, `args` must be a non-empty iterable. When the loop starts, we can assume `x` will take the first value from `args`.

State: **`sep` is assigned a value from `kwargs`, `file` is assigned a value from `kwargs`, `at_start` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `args` is a non-empty iterable and `x` is the first element in `args`**
