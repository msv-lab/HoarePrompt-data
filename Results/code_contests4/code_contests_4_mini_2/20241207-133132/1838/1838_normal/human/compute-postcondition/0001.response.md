The variables `sep` and `file` are assigned values from the `kwargs` dictionary, where `sep` defaults to a space character (' ') and `file` defaults to `sys.stdout`. The previous values of `sep` and `file` depend on the contents of `kwargs`, which are not explicitly provided. However, since the initial state does not specify `kwargs`, we cannot determine their values or whether they exist. Therefore, the output state focuses on the assignment process and defaults.

Output State: **`sep` is assigned a value from `kwargs`, defaulting to ' '; `file` is assigned a value from `kwargs`, defaulting to sys.stdout**.
