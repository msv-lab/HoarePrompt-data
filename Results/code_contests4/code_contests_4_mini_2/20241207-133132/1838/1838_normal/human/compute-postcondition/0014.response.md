According to the code, the loop will execute for each element in `args`. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is the second element in `args`, and `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least 2 elements. Since the loop iterates over `args`, for it to execute one more time, `x` needs to be updated to the next element in `args`. 

If `args` has at least 3 elements, the next iteration will update `x` to the third element in `args`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `args` must have at least 3 elements, and `x` will be the third element.

State: **`sep` is assigned a value from `kwargs`, `file` is assigned a value from `kwargs`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in `args`**
