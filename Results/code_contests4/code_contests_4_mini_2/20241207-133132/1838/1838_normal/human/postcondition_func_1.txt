The function accepts input values for test cases, where the first input is a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by sets of three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case, representing the lengths of three fence segments. The function returns the input as a string, but it does not validate the input or parse it into separate values, which may lead to issues in processing the data further.
