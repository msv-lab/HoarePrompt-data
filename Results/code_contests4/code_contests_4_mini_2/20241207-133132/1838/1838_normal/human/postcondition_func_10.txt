The function accepts a positive integer `n`, representing the number of test cases, and returns the binary representation of `n` as a string, without the '0b' prefix. The function does not perform any validation on the input to check if `n` is within the specified bounds (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), so it will return the binary representation for any positive integer value of `n` supplied.
