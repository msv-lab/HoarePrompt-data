The function accepts no parameters and returns a list generated by the function `func_3()`. The values for `a`, `b`, and `c` are expected to be integers within the range of 1 to 10^9 for each test case, and `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000. However, the function does not handle or validate these inputs, so it relies on the assumption that the inputs are provided correctly by the calling context.
