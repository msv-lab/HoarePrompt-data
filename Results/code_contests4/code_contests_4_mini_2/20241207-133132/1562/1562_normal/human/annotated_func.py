#State of the program right berfore the function call: y is a list of 12 strings, each containing 12 characters '0' or '1', representing the terrain with '1' for land and '0' for sea.
def func_1(y, x):
    if (0 <= y <= 11 and 0 <= x <= 11) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`y` is a list of 12 strings, each containing 12 characters '0' or '1', representing the terrain with '1' for land and '0' for sea. The values of `y` are such that either `y` is less than 0 or greater than 11, or `x` is less than 0 or greater than 11.
    return False
    #The program returns False, indicating that the values of 'y' and 'x' are outside the valid range of 0 to 11.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `y`, which contains 12 strings of '0' and '1', and an integer `x`. It returns True if `x` is within the range of 0 to 11, inclusive, and returns False if `x` is outside this range. The function does not utilize or validate the contents of the list `y`, so its actual state is irrelevant to the function's output.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: y is a non-negative integer representing the number of rows in the plan view (always 12), x is a non-negative integer representing the number of columns in the plan view (always 12), and the input consists of multiple datasets where each dataset is a 12x12 grid of integers (0s and 1s) representing the terrain, with 1 indicating land (black square) and 0 indicating sea (white square). The total number of datasets does not exceed 20.
def func_2(y, x):
    if (g[y][x] == '0') :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0, indicating that the terrain at position g[y][x] is sea (white square)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`y` is a non-negative integer representing the number of rows in the plan view (always 12), `x` is a non-negative integer representing the number of columns in the plan view (always 12), and the input consists of multiple datasets where each dataset is a 12x12 grid of integers (0s and 1s) representing the terrain. The total number of datasets does not exceed 20. The element at position `g[y][x]` is 1, indicating land (black square).
    g[y][x] = '0'
    for i in xrange(4):
        nexty = y + dy[i]
        
        nextx = x + dx[i]
        
        if not func_1(nexty, nextx):
            continue
        
        if visited[nexty][nextx] == 0 and g[nexty][nextx] == '1':
            visited[nexty][nextx] = 1
            func_2(nexty, nextx)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `y` is 12, `x` is 12, `i` is 4, `visited` contains the updated visitation status based on the conditions checked during the loop execution, and `g` remains unchanged as '0' indicating water.
    return 1
    #The program returns the value 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two non-negative integers, `y` and `x`, representing coordinates in a 12x12 grid of integers (0s and 1s). It returns 0 if the terrain at position `g[y][x]` is sea (indicated by 0) and returns 1 if the terrain at that position is land (indicated by 1). Additionally, the function appears to traverse adjacent land cells recursively but does not indicate this in the output; thus, the return value of 1 only confirms that the starting position is land, not the total area of connected land.
