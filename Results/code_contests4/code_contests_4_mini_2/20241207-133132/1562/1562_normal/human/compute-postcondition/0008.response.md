The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `y` is 12, `x` is 12, `i` is 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.  
Output State: **`y` is 12, `x` is 12, `i` is 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
