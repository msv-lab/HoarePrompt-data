In the provided code snippet, `nexty` is assigned the value of `y + dy[i]`. However, the value of `dy[i]` is not specified in the initial state or given context. Without knowing what `dy[i]` is, we cannot determine the specific numerical result for `nexty`. The value of `y` is given as 12, and `i` is 0, but we need the value of `dy[0]` to compute `nexty`.

Since we cannot derive a specific numerical value for `nexty` without knowing `dy[0]`, we can only state that `nexty` will depend on the unknown value `dy[0]`.

Thus, the Output State is: `y` is 12, `x` is 12, `i` is 0; `nexty` is dependent on the value of `dy[0]`.

Output State: **`y` is 12, `x` is 12, `i` is 0; `nexty` is dependent on the value of `dy[0]**
