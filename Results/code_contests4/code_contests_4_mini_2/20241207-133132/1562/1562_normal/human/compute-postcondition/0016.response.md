The variable `nextx` is assigned the value of `x + dx[i]`. The value of `x` is `12`, and since `dx[i]` is unknown, we cannot determine the exact value of `nextx`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `y` is 12, `x` is 12, `i` is 1, `nexty` is 12 + dy[1], and `nextx` is 12 + dx[i] (where dx[i] is unknown).

Output State: **`y` is 12, `x` is 12, `i` is 1, `nexty` is 12 + dy[1], `nextx` is 12 + dx[i] (where dx[i] is unknown)**
