The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `y` and `x`. Both `y` and `x` are non-negative integers, with `y` representing the number of rows in the plan view (always 12) and `x` representing the number of columns in the plan view (also always 12). After executing the function body, if the terrain at position `g[y][x]` is sea (represented by 0), the function returns 0. If the terrain at that position is land (represented by 1), the function returns 1. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept the coordinates `y` and `x` and return 0 if the terrain is sea (0), and return 1 if the terrain is land (1).

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters y and x, and returns 0 if the terrain at position g[y][x] is sea (0), and returns 1 if the terrain at position g[y][x] is land (1).**
