Postcondition: ***`y` is a non-negative integer representing the number of rows in the plan view (always 12), `x` is a non-negative integer representing the number of columns in the plan view (always 12), and the input consists of multiple datasets where each dataset is a 12x12 grid of integers (0s and 1s) representing the terrain. In the current dataset, the value at position `g[y][x]` is '0', indicating that the terrain at this position is sea (white square). The total number of datasets does not exceed 20.***
