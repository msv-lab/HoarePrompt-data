According to the code, the for loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 4. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and it will be incremented by 1 after each iteration. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased to 1.

The condition for the loop to execute again does not depend on the values of `visited`, `g`, `y`, or `x`. Therefore, the state regarding `visited[nexty][nextx]` and `g[nexty][nextx]` does not need to be modified for the loop to run again; it only needs to be checked during the loop execution.

State: **`y` is 12, `x` is 12, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than 4**
