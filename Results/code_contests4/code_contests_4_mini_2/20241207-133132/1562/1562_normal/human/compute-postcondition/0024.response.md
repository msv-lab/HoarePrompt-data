The value of `nextx` is assigned the value of `x + dx[i]`. The previous value of `x` is 12, and `i` is 2, but the value of `dx[i]` is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `nextx`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the Output State is: `y` is 12, `x` is 12, `i` is 2, and `nextx` is 12 + dx[2] (value of `dx[2]` is unknown).

Output State: **`y` is 12, `x` is 12, `i` is 2, `nextx` is 12 + dx[2] (value of `dx[2]` is unknown)**.
