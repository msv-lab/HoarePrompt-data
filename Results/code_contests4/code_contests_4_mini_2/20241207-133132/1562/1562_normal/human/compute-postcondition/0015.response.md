`nexty` is assigned the value `y + dy[i]`. The previous value of `y` is 12, and `dy[i]` corresponds to the value at index `i`, which is 1. However, the value of `dy` is unknown, so we cannot determine the exact value of `nexty`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `y` is 12, `x` is 12, `i` is 1, and `nexty` is 12 + dy[1] (where dy[1] is unknown).

Output State: **`y` is 12, `x` is 12, `i` is 1, and `nexty` is 12 + dy[1] (where dy[1] is unknown)**
