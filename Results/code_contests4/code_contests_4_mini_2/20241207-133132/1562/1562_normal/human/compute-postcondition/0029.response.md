Postcondition: ***`y` is 12, `x` is 12, `i` is 2, `nextx` is 12 + dx[2]. If `visited[nexty][nextx]` is 0 and `g[nexty][nextx]` is '1', then `visited[nexty][nextx]` is set to 1 and `func_2` is called with parameters `nexty` and `nextx`. If the condition is not met, no changes are made to `visited` or the call to `func_2`.***
