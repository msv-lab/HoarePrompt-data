`nexty` is assigned the value `y + dy[i]`. The value of `y` is 12, and `dy[i]` depends on the array `dy` at index `i`, which is 2. Since the initial state does not provide the value of `dy`, we cannot determine the exact value of `nexty`. Therefore, the output state reflects the known values and acknowledges the dependence on the unknown `dy[i]`. 

Output State: **`y` is 12, `x` is 12, `i` is 2; `nexty` is 12 + dy[2]**
