The value of `nexty` is assigned the value `12 + dy[1]` and the value of `nextx` is assigned the value `12 + dx[i]`, where `i` is 1. The specific values of `dy[1]` and `dx[1]` are not provided, so we cannot determine the specific values of `nexty` and `nextx`. The variable `visited[nexty][nextx]` is then set to 1, indicating that the position `(nexty, nextx)` has been visited. Other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `y` is 12, `x` is 12, `i` is 1, `visited[nexty][nextx]` is set to 1, and the specific values of `nexty` and `nextx` are unknown due to the absence of `dy` and `dx` values.

Output State: **`y` is 12, `x` is 12, `i` is 1, `visited[nexty][nextx]` is set to 1, `nexty` and `nextx` are unknown.**
