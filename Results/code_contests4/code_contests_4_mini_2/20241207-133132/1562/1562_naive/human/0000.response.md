To assess the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the implementation step by step.

### Problem Description Summary:
The task is to count the number of islands in a grid where:
- 1 represents land (black square) and 0 represents water (white square).
- An island is defined as a group of connected 1s (land squares) that are connected vertically or horizontally.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Function Definitions**:
   - `func_1(y, x)`: This function checks if the coordinates `(y, x)` are within the bounds of the grid (0 to 11).
   - `func_2(y, x)`: This function performs a depth-first search (DFS) to mark all connected land squares (1s) starting from a given square. It also increments the island count.

2. **DFS Logic**:
   - The DFS marks the current square as visited (changes '1' to '0'), effectively sinking the island and preventing counting it again.
   - It checks all four directions (up, down, left, right) for connected land squares.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The program reads multiple datasets of 12x12 grids and counts islands for each grid.
   - It initializes a `visited` matrix to track which squares have been processed.

### Edge Cases:
- The program does not handle invalid inputs or grids smaller than 12x12. However, the problem specifies that each dataset is guaranteed to be 12x12.
- It uses `xrange`, which is a Python 2 feature. This may lead to compatibility issues in Python 3, but the problem does not specify the version.

### Potential Issues:
- If the input contains a grid with only water (0s), the program should correctly return 0 islands. The algorithm does this correctly.
- If the grid is completely filled with land (1s), it should count it as one island. The algorithm also handles this correctly.
- The program uses `raw_input()`, which is not available in Python 3 and should be replaced with `input()`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic for counting islands based on the problem description. It successfully traverses the grid and counts distinct islands while handling different configurations of land and water squares.

**Correctness: True**. 
The program meets the requirements of the problem description, and I could not find any example where the program does not work as expected.
