Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains a few issues that could lead to incorrect results. 

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` without any checks for empty lines or the end of input, which could cause it to fail or behave unexpectedly if the input format is not strictly adhered to.

2. **Output Format**: The program prints the count of islands but does not handle the case where multiple datasets are separated by a blank line correctly. If a dataset is empty (like if all squares are white), it would still count and could lead to confusion.

3. **Visited Logic**: The `visited` array is not initialized correctly; there is no check to ensure that the function does not count the same island multiple times once it has been visited.

4. **Boundary Conditions**: The logic in `func_1` for checking the boundaries could lead to an out-of-bounds access if not handled properly. The function is designed to return `True` for valid indices, but the way it is used could still lead to errors if `nexty` or `nextx` are out of range and an attempt to access `g[nexty][nextx]` is made.

5. **Data Type Mismatch**: The program expects the input data to be strings ('0' and '1'), but it should ideally process integers (0 and 1) since the problem description suggests the input consists of 0s and 1s.

For example, if we input a dataset consisting entirely of '0's (all white squares), the program would still attempt to count islands, which should return 0. However, due to how it handles the `visited` array and the recursive function calls, it might incorrectly return a count of islands.

Thus, due to these potential issues, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description in all potential cases.
