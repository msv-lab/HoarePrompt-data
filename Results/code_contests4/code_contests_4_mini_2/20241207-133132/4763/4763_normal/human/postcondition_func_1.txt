The function accepts an integer `n` and returns a list of length `n` where each index contains the smallest prime divisor of that index (with indices that are prime marked as 1). The function effectively computes the smallest prime divisors for each integer from 1 to `n`, where indices greater than 1 that are prime will hold the value 1, while composite indices will hold their smallest prime divisor.
