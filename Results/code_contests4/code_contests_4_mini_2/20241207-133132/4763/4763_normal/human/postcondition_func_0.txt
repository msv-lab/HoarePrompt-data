The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns a set of all its divisors. This includes both the divisor `i` and its complementary divisor `n // i` for each valid divisor `i` found from 1 to the square root of `n`. The function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 1, as it is assumed to be a positive integer.
