According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of `arr`. If `i` is less than `len(arr)`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 element, and `i` is currently at an index that is valid for this list. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1.

Therefore, if `i` is less than `len(arr) - 1`, the loop will continue to execute. If `i` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`, the next iteration will attempt to access `arr[i + 1]`, which is out of bounds, and thus the loop cannot execute again.

To summarize, if the loop is to execute a second time, `i` will become `i + 1`, and `arr` must still have at least `i + 1` elements. 

State: **`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 element, `i` is incremented to `i + 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than `len(arr)`**.
