Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 element. If `arr[i]` is not equal to `'?'`, all elements at indices `j` (where `j` is in the range from `i` to `len(arr)` with step `k`) that were equal to `'?'` are updated to be equal to `arr[i]`. If any element at those indices was not equal to `arr[i]` and not equal to `'?'`, the function would return False, indicating that the conditions for the execution of the loop were met. Otherwise, if `arr[i]` is equal to `'?'`, `vis` is a set containing all distinct elements from `arr` at the indices starting from `i` and incrementing by `k`, excluding any elements that are equal to `'?'`. If `vis` contains only one distinct element, all elements in `arr` starting from index `i` at every `k`-th position are updated to the value of `put`, with `j` being equal to or exceeding `len(arr)` after all iterations, and the size of the set `vis` is not equal to 2.***
