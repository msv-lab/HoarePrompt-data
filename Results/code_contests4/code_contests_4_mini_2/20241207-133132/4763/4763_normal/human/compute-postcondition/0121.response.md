According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j`, `len(arr)`, and the step `k`. The loop starts at `j = i` and increments `j` by `k` on each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 1 element, and `j` is currently equal to `i`, which is less than `len(arr)` for the loop to execute. 

To execute the loop one more time, `j` will be increased by `k`, so the new value of `j` will be `j + k`. For the loop to execute a second time, `j` must still be less than `len(arr)`.

State: **`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 element; if `arr[j]` is not equal to '?', then `vis` now contains `arr[j]` in addition to its previous elements, `j` is `i + k`, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than `len(arr)`**
