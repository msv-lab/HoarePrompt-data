You have been assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for analyzing the program's state after the for loop. The initial state of the code has already been provided. Additionally, you can see how the state changes after the loop executes a few times. The initial state includes the values and relationships of the variables before the program execution. The output state should include the values and relationships of the variables after all the iterations of the for loop have executed. Similar to the initial state, avoid explaining how the program operates; focus solely on the variable values and their interrelations. 
You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**
I am giving you two examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
Example 1: 

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `factorial` is 1.
Code of the loop:
```
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    factorial *= i
```
Output state after the loop executes 1 times:  `factorial` is `1`, 'i' is 1 , n is at least 1.
Output state after the loop executes 2 times: `factorial` is 2, 'i' is 2 , n is at least 2.
Output state after the loop executes 3 times: `factorial` is 6 , 'i' is 3 , n is at least 3.

Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example as hints but  mostly from the loop code, determine the loop's output state.

Example Answer 1:
If n is greater than 0 the loop will execute at least once and factorial will contain the factorial of n and i will be n. If n is 0  then the loop wont execute and factorial will remain 1 which is indeed the factorial for 0.
Therefore, the output state of the loop is that `factorial` is the factorial of `n`
Output State: **``n` is a non negative  integer, `factorial` is the factorial of 'n'**

Example 2: 

Initial State:  `total` is 0,'students_num' is 0, students is a list of students.
Code of the loop:
```
for student in students:
    total += student
    students_num += 1
```
Output State after the loop executes 1 times:  `total` is equal to the first student, 'students_num' is 1, students is a list with at least one student, student is the first student in the list.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `total` is equal to the first student plus the second student, 'students_num' is 2, students is a list with at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `total` is equal to the first student plus the second student plus the third student, 'students_num' is 3, students is a list with at least 3 students, student is the third student in the list.


Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example as hints but  mostly from the loop code, determine the loop's output state.

Example Answer 2:
The loop calculates the sum of a list students and stores it in total and the number of students in students_num. The loop will be executed at least once if students is a list with at least one student. If the list is empty the loop does not execute and total and students_num are 0.
Output State: **total is equal to the sum of all students, students_num is the number of students, students is a list of students.**

Your Task:

Initial State: arr is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two elements: an integer n (the length of the string) and an even integer k (2 ≤ k ≤ n), and a string s (|s| = n) composed only of characters '0', '1', and '?'. The total length of all strings across test cases does not exceed 300,000.
Code of the loop:
```
for i in range(len(arr)):
    if arr[i] != '?':
        for j in range(i, len(arr), k):
            if arr[j] != arr[i] and arr[j] != '?':
                return False
            if arr[j] == '?':
                arr[j] = arr[i]
    else:
        vis = set([])
        for j in range(i, len(arr), k):
            if arr[j] != '?':
                vis.add(arr[j])
        if len(vis) == 2:
            return False
        if len(vis) == 1:
            put = list(vis)[0]
            for j in range(i, len(arr), k):
                arr[j] = put

```
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: *`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 element. If `arr[i]` is not equal to '?', then all elements equal to '?' in `arr` are replaced by `arr[i]`, and if any element in `arr` (other than those replaced) does not equal `arr[i]` and is not '?', the function returns False. If `arr[i]` is equal to '?', then `vis` contains the elements of `arr` that are not equal to '?', `k` remains a positive integer, and the length of `vis` is not equal to 2. If `vis` contains exactly one element, then all elements of `arr` at indices that are multiples of `k` are replaced with `put`, where `put` is the first element of `vis`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 element. If `arr[i]` is not equal to '?', any element `arr[j]` that was equal to '?' is updated to `arr[i]`. If any `arr[j]` was not equal to `arr[i]` and not equal to '?', the function returns False. If all `arr[j]` are equal to `arr[i]` or were '?', the function does not return anything (None). If `arr[i]` is equal to '?', `vis` contains all unique elements from `arr` that are not equal to '?', and the number of unique elements in `vis` is not equal to 2. If there is only one unique element in `vis`, then all elements from index `i` to `len(arr)-1` with a step of `k` are set to `put`, where `put` is the first (and only) element of `vis`. Otherwise, the list remains unmodified.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 element. If `arr[i]` is not equal to `'?'`, all elements at indices `j` (where `j` is in the range from `i` to `len(arr)` with step `k`) that were equal to `'?'` are updated to be equal to `arr[i]`. If any element at those indices was not equal to `arr[i]` and not equal to `'?'`, the function would return False, indicating that the conditions for the execution of the loop were met. Otherwise, if `arr[i]` is equal to `'?'`, `vis` is a set containing all distinct elements from `arr` at the indices starting from `i` and incrementing by `k`, excluding any elements that are equal to `'?'`. If `vis` contains only one distinct element, all elements in `arr` starting from index `i` at every `k`-th position are updated to the value of `put`, with `j` being equal to or exceeding `len(arr)` after all iterations, and the size of the set `vis` is not equal to 2.


Now, please think step by step. Use the results from the output states for the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example to help you , but mostly focus on the loop code to determine the loop's output state after ALL THE ITERATIONS OF THE LOOP HAVE FINISHED. Try to understand what  will be the values of the variables after it executes. In the case the loop doesnot execute, what will be the values of the variables.
Use the fomrat Output State: **the output state you calculate**
