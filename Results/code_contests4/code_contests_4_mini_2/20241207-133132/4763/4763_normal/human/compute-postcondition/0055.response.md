According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the indices `j` and the length of the `arr`. The loop starts from index `i` and continues until it reaches the length of `arr`, incrementing by `k` each time. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `i` (the starting index), and since `arr` has at least 1 element, `len(arr)` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `len(arr)`.

If `j` is equal to `i`, then after the next iteration, `j` will be updated to `i + k`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `len(arr)` must be greater than `i + k`.

State: **`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 element, for the loop to execute a second time `len(arr)` must be greater than `i + k`.**
