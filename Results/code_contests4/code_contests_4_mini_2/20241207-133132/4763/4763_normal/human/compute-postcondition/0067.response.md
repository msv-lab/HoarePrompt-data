The variable `vis` is assigned an empty set. The previous values of `arr` and `i` remain unchanged, with `i` already incremented to `i + 1` and `arr[i]` being equal to '?'. Therefore, the output state is: `arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 element, `i` is incremented to `i + 1`, `arr[i]` is equal to '?', and `vis` is an empty set.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 element, `i` is incremented to `i + 1`, `arr[i]` is equal to '?', and `vis` is an empty set.**
