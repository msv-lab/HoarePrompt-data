According to the code, the loop iterates over the indices of `arr` starting from `i` and goes up to `len(arr)` in steps of `k`. For the loop to execute again, the index `j` must be less than `len(arr)`. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 1 element, and `j` is currently equal to `i`. 

To prepare for the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by `k`. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be less than `len(arr)`. The new value of `j` will be `i + k`.

State: **`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 element, `j` is `i + k`, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than `len(arr)`**
