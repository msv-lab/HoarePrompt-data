Output State: **`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 element. All elements at indices `j` (where `j` is in the range from `i` to `len(arr)` with step `k`) that were equal to `'?'` have been updated to be equal to `arr[i]`. If any element at those indices was not equal to `arr[i]` and not equal to `'?'`, the function would have returned False, indicating that the conditions for the execution of the loop were met.**
