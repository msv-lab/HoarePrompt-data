Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 element and `j` is `i + k`. If `arr[j]` is equal to '?', then `arr[j]` is updated to be equal to `arr[i]`. If `arr[j]` is not equal to `arr[i]` and is not equal to '?', the function returns False, and if the condition does not hold, the function continues without returning anything.***
