The values of `x` and `y` are reassigned. The variable `x` takes the value of `y`, which is a non-empty list of tuples. The variable `y` is assigned the value of `x % y`, where `x` is now the list of tuples and `y` is the original integer representing the number of test cases. Since `x` is a list and `y` is an integer, the modulo operation `x % y` is not valid and would normally cause an error in execution. However, assuming the operation is handled somehow, the output state would reflect the new assignments.

Therefore, we conclude:
- `x` is now the non-empty list of tuples (previously `y`).
- `y` is the result of attempting to calculate `x % y`, which is undefined in standard Python operations, but we will note that it was attempted.

Output State: **`x` is now a non-empty list of tuples; `y` is the result of `x % y`, which is undefined.**
