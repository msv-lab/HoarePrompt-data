According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `arr`, and `k`. The loop will execute if `i` is less than `len(arr)`, and it starts from `i` and increments by `k` each iteration. Given that `arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 element, `len(arr)` is at least 1. Since `i` is already incremented to `i + 1`, for the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be less than `len(arr)`. If `i` is equal to or greater than `len(arr)`, the loop will not execute.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to set `i` to a value that is less than `len(arr)`. Thus, for the loop to be executed, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `i` is less than `len(arr)`, and we also need to specify that `j` will start from `i`.

State: **`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 element, `i` is less than `len(arr)`, `j` is `i`**
