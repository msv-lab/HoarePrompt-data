The assignment `arr[j] = put` assigns the value of `put` to the element at index `j` in the list `arr`. The variable `put` holds the only element in `vis`, which contains distinct elements from `arr` starting from index `i`, excluding '?'. Since the loop is executed a second time, we know that `j` is less than `len(arr)`.

Therefore, the output state will reflect that the element at index `j` in `arr` has been updated to the value of `put`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is updated at index `j` to the value of `put`; `i` is less than `len(arr)`; `j` is `i + 2k`; `vis` contains distinct elements from `arr` starting from `i` excluding '?'; `put` is the only element in `vis`.**
