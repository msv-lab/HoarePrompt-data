The value of `x` is assigned the second element from the `args` iterable, and it is converted to a string using `str(x)`. Then, `file.write(str(x))` writes this string representation of `x` to the `file`. The previous values of `sep`, `file`, `at_start`, and `args` remain unaffected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is assigned from `kwargs` or defaults to ' '; `file` is assigned from `kwargs` or defaults to `sys.stdout`; `at_start` is False; `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least 2 elements; `x` is the second element in `args`, and `file` now contains the string representation of `x`.
