According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j`, which starts from `i` and increments by `k` in each iteration until it reaches the length of `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `j` is also 0 (since it starts at `i`). The loop will execute again as long as `j` is less than the length of `arr`.

Since `j` starts at `i` (which is 0), it will be incremented by `k` (a positive integer) for the next iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `len(arr)` after the increment.

Thus, after the current iteration, `j` will be updated to `0 + k`. We need to ensure that `0 + k` is still less than `len(arr)` for the loop to execute again. 

State: **`arr` has its first element replaced with `put`, `i` is 0, `vis` contains elements of `arr` that are not equal to '?', `k` remains a positive integer, `put` is the first element of `vis`, and for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than `len(arr)` after being incremented by `k`**
