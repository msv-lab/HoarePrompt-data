The variable `put` is assigned the first element of the `vis` list, which contains all unique elements from `arr` that are not equal to '?'. Since the number of unique elements in `vis` is equal to 1, this means `put` will take the value of that single unique element. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 element, `i` is a valid index less than `len(arr)`, `vis` contains all unique elements from `arr` that are not equal to '?', `j` is equal to `len(arr)`, the number of unique elements in `vis` is 1, and `put` is the first (and only) element of `vis`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 element, `i` is a valid index less than `len(arr)`, `vis` contains all unique elements from `arr` that are not equal to '?', `j` is equal to `len(arr)`, the number of unique elements in `vis` is 1, and `put` is the first (and only) element of `vis`.**
