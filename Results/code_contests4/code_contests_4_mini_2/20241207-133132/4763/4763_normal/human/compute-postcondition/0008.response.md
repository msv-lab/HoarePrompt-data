The function `func_6` accepts two parameters: `x` and `y`. The parameter `x` is an integer representing the number of test cases, constrained to a value between 1 and 10,000. The parameter `y` is a list of tuples, where each tuple consists of an integer `n` (with constraints 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 300,000, with `k` being even) and a string `s` of length `n` composed only of the characters '0', '1', and '?'. The total sum of the integers `n` across all test cases does not exceed 300,000. The function returns the last non-empty list of tuples `x` before `y` becomes empty or zero. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `x` representing the number of test cases and a list of tuples `y`, returning the last non-empty list of tuples `x` before `y` becomes empty or zero.**
