According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i`, `len(arr)`, and `k`. The loop starts at index `i` and iterates up to `len(arr)` in steps of `k`. For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be less than `len(arr)`.

Given that `arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 element, `len(arr)` is at least 1. Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `len(arr)`. Since `arr[i]` is equal to '?', it indicates that `i` is currently pointing at an index within the bounds of the array, which is necessary for the loop to execute.

For the loop to execute for the first time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `i` must be less than `len(arr)`.
- `j` is initialized to `i`.

Thus, the state can be summarized as follows:

State: **`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 element, `i` is incremented to a valid index less than `len(arr)`, `arr[i]` is equal to '?', `vis` is an empty set, `j` is initialized to `i`**
