According to the code, the loop executes based on the range defined by `j`, starting from `i` and going up to `len(arr)` with a step of `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `i`, which is a valid index less than `len(arr)`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by `k`. Since the current value of `j` is `i`, the next value of `j` will be `i + k`. The loop can execute again if `j` (which will be `i + k`) is still less than `len(arr)`. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `i + k` must be less than `len(arr)`.

State: **`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 element, `i` is a valid index less than `len(arr)`, `vis` contains all unique elements from `arr` that are not equal to '?', `j` is now equal to `i + k`, and for the loop to execute a second time `i + k` must be less than `len(arr)`**
