According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the length of `arr`. The loop iterates starting from `i` (which is 0) and increments by `k` until it reaches the length of `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `arr` has at least 1 element, meaning `len(arr)` is at least 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `len(arr)`. Since `j` starts at `i` (which is 0) and is incremented by `k`, the value of `j` for the next iteration will be `i + k`, which is `0 + k`. 

To ensure that the loop can execute a second time, `j` (which is `k` after increment) must be less than `len(arr)`, and since `k` is a positive integer, we have the requirement that `k` must be less than `len(arr)`.

State: **`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, the element at index `i` of `arr` is equal to '?', `vis` contains the element `arr[j]` if `arr[j]` is not equal to '?', `k` is a positive integer, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than `len(arr)` and `j` will be equal to `k`.**
