According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `i`, `k`, and the length of `arr`. The loop will execute again as long as `j` is less than `len(arr)`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i + k`. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to increase `j` by `k`, so `j` will become `i + 2k`. 

Additionally, `arr` must have enough elements to accommodate `j`. Since `j` is now `i + 2k`, the length of `arr` must be greater than `i + k`.

State: **`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 element, `j` is `i + 2k`, for the loop to execute one more time the length of `arr` must be greater than `i + 2k`**.
