Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 element. If `arr[i]` is not equal to '?', then all elements equal to '?' in `arr` are replaced by `arr[i]`, and if any element in `arr` (other than those replaced) does not equal `arr[i]` and is not '?', the function returns False. If `arr[i]` is equal to '?', then `vis` contains the elements of `arr` that are not equal to '?', `k` remains a positive integer, and the length of `vis` is not equal to 2. If `vis` contains exactly one element, then all elements of `arr` at indices that are multiples of `k` are replaced with `put`, where `put` is the first element of `vis`.***
