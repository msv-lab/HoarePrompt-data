According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be greater than 1. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, after the last iteration, `i` will become 2.

State: **`arr` is a list of tuples, `dic` is updated based on `arr[0]`, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be greater than 2**
