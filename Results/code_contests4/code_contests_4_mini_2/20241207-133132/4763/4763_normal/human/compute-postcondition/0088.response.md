According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j`, `i`, `k`, and the length of `arr`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than `len(arr)`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` was updated to `i + k`, which is still less than `len(arr)`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by `k`. Therefore, the updated value of `j` will be `i + 2k`, and the condition for the loop to execute again is that `i + 2k` must still be less than `len(arr)`.

State: **`arr` has been updated at index `j` with the value `put`, where `j` is equal to `i + k`, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than `len(arr)` and `j` will be updated to `i + 2k`.**
