According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i`, `len(arr)`, and `k`. Since `arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 element, `len(arr)` is at least 1. The variable `i` must be less than `len(arr)` for the loop to execute at least once.

Given that `i` is incremented to `i + 1`, it indicates that `i` has already been increased by 1 before the loop begins. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `i + 1` must still be less than `len(arr)`. 

Thus, the state should reflect that `j` will start at `i`, and the loop can execute if `i` is less than `len(arr) - 1`. Additionally, `j` will need to be set to `i` for the first iteration of the loop.

State: **`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 element, `i` is such that `i` is less than `len(arr) - 1`, `j` is `i`, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than `len(arr)`**
