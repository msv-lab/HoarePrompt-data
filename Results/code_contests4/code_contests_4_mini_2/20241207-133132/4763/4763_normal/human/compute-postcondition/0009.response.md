Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `x` representing the number of test cases and a list `y` of tuples containing an integer and a string. It performs a series of modulo operations until `y` becomes empty, and returns the last non-empty value of `x`, which is not a list of tuples as suggested by the annotations, but rather the initial integer value passed as `x`. The function does not utilize the list of tuples `y` in any meaningful way in terms of processing the tuples, nor does it check the contents of the tuples. Hence, its actual functionality does not align with the annotations provided. **
