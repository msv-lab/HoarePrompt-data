Postcondition: ***`sep` is assigned from `kwargs` or defaults to ' '; `file` is assigned from `kwargs` or defaults to `sys.stdout`; `at_start` is False; `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least 2 elements; `x` is the second element in `args`; if `at_start` is False, then `file.write(sep)` writes `sep` to the file.***
