According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. For the loop to execute at least once, `k` must be greater than 0. The current state indicates that `arr` is a list of tuples and `dic` has been initialized correctly. However, we need to ensure that `k` is set appropriately to allow for the loop execution. 

Thus, for the loop to execute for the first time, `k` needs to be greater than 0, and `i` should be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`arr` is a list of tuples, `dic` is initialized with '1': 0, '0': 0, '?': 0, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
