According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the length of `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `i`, and `i` is less than `len(arr)`, which means the loop can execute again as long as `j` remains less than `len(arr)`.

Since `j` is initially set to `i`, in the next iteration of the loop, `j` will be incremented by `k`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must remain less than `len(arr)`, and this means that `i + k` must also be less than `len(arr)`.

Thus, after executing the current iteration, the new value of `j` will be `i + k`. 

State: **`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 element; `i` is less than `len(arr)`; `j` is `i + k`; `vis` contains distinct elements from `arr` starting from `i` excluding '?'; `put` is the only element in `vis`; `arr[j]` is assigned the value of `put`.**
