Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of tuples, `dic` contains the counts of each unique element in `arr`, including the counts of '1', '0', and '?', `k` is the length of `arr`. The count of '1' in `dic` is not equal to the count of '0', and the count of '?' in `dic` is not equal to the absolute difference between the count of '1' and the count of '0'.***
