According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `j`, `i`, `k`, and the length of `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is a valid index less than `len(arr)`, and `j` is updated to `j + k` if `arr[j]` is not equal to '?'. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `len(arr)`. Since `j` is updated to `j + k`, we need to ensure that `j + k` is still less than `len(arr)` after the last iteration. Therefore, if `j` was the last value used in the loop, it needs to be adjusted to `j + k`.

If the loop executed with `j`, the next value of `j` for the next iteration will be `j + k`. 

State: **`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 element; `i` is a valid index less than `len(arr)`; for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `len(arr) - k`, and `j` is updated to `j + k`.**
