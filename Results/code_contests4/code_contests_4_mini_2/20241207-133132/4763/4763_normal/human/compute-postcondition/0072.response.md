According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `i`, and `len(arr)`. The loop is set to iterate starting from index `i` and increments `j` by `k` each time until it is less than `len(arr)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is a valid index less than `len(arr)`, and `j` is also a valid index determined by the previous iteration.

To execute the loop one more time, we need to increment `j` by `k`. Since `j` remains unchanged if `arr[j]` is equal to '?', we need to consider the next valid index after `j` that is reached by adding `k`. The loop can only continue executing if the new value of `j` is still less than `len(arr)`.

Thus, if `j` is currently valid, the new value of `j` will be `j + k`. The loop will execute again if `j + k` is still less than `len(arr)`.

State: **`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 element, `i` is a valid index less than `len(arr)`, `vis` contains the element at index `j` of `arr` if `arr[j]` is not equal to '?', `j` is updated to `j + k` and for the loop to execute one more time, `j + k` must be less than `len(arr)`**
