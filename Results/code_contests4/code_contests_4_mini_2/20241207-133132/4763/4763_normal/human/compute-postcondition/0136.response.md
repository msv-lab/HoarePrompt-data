Output State: **`arr` is a list of tuples with all elements starting from index `i` updated to the value of `put` at every `k`-th position, `i` is less than `len(arr)`, `vis` contains distinct elements from `arr` starting from `i` excluding '?', `put` is the only element in `vis`, `j` is equal to or exceeds `len(arr)` after all iterations.**
