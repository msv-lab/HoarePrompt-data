According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and the length of `arr`. The loop starts at index `i` and increments by `k` with each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at least `i` and is incremented by `k` for the next iteration. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than the length of `arr`. 

Given that `arr` has at least 1 element, `j` is currently `i`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be updated to `i + k`. 

State: **`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 element, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be at least `i + k` and less than `len(arr)`**
