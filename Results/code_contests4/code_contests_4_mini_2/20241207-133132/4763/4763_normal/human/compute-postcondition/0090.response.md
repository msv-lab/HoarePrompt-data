Output State: **`arr` is a list of tuples where all elements at indices from `i` to `len(arr)-1` with a step of `k` are equal to `put`, `i` is a valid index less than `len(arr)`, `vis` contains all unique elements from `arr` that are not equal to '?', and the number of unique elements in `vis` is 1, with `put` being the first (and only) element of `vis`.**
