According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y`. If `y` is a non-empty list, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `y` is a list of tuples, which implies there are test cases to process. For the loop to execute at least once, `y` must contain at least one tuple.

State: **`x` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `y` is a non-empty list of tuples**
