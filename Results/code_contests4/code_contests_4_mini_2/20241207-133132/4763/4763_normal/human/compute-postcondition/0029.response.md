According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the index `j` and the length of the list `arr`. The loop starts iterating from index `i` and increases `j` by `k` in each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, meaning the loop started from the first element of `arr`. The variable `j` is equal to `k`, which indicates the next index to check in the next iteration.

Since `arr` has at least 1 element and `j` is equal to `k`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than the length of `arr`. Therefore, `j` should be increased by `k` to move to the next index, resulting in `j` being `2k` for the next check.

State: **`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `j` is equal to `2k`, for the loop to execute a second time `len(arr)` must be greater than `2k`.**
