The code `vis.add(arr[j])` adds the element at index `j` of `arr` to the set `vis`. Given the initial state, `j` is initialized to `i`, and `arr[i]` is equal to '?', but since the element at index `j` is not equal to '?', we can conclude that `j` points to a valid element in `arr`. The set `vis`, which is empty initially, will now include that valid element.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `vis` now contains the element at index `j` of `arr`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 element, `i` is a valid index less than `len(arr)`, `vis` now contains the element at index `j` of `arr`, `j` is unchanged.**
