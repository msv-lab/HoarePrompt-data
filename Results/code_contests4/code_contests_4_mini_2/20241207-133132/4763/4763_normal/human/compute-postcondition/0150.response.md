Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of tuples, `dic` contains the counts of each unique element in `arr`, including the counts of '1', '0', and '?', and `k` is the length of `arr`. The counts of '1' and '0' are equal, and the count of '?' is equal to the absolute difference between the counts of '1' and '0'.***
