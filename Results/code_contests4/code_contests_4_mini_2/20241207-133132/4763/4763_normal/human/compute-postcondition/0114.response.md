According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i`, `len(arr)`, and `k`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(arr)`. Since `arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 element, `len(arr)` is at least 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `len(arr)`.

Given that `i` is incremented to `i + 1`, we need to ensure that the new value of `i` (which is `i + 1`) is still less than `len(arr)`. This means that `i` should be less than `len(arr) - 1` before the loop starts. 

Additionally, since the loop variable `j` starts at `i` and increments by `k`, we need to ensure `k` is a positive integer to avoid an infinite loop or skipping elements.

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:
- For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `len(arr)`, which means `i` should be at most `len(arr) - 1`.
- `j` will start at the incremented value of `i`, which is now `i + 1`.

State: **`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 element, `i` is at most `len(arr) - 1`, `vis` is set to an empty set, `j` starts at `i + 1`, and `k` is a positive integer**.
