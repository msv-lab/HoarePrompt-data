The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it processes multiple test cases which include an integer `t`, representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it handles an integer `n`, which is the length of the string, an even integer `k`, and a string `s` of characters '0', '1', and '?'. The function returns results based on the conditions set for these inputs.

Due to the structure of the outputs described, we can outline the functionality as follows:

Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases where each test case consists of an integer `n`, an even integer `k`, and a string `s`. It returns results based on the evaluations of the string `s` according to the specified conditions.**
