Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 element. If `arr[j]` is equal to '?', then `arr[j]` is assigned the value of `arr[i]`, ensuring that `arr[j]` equals `arr[i]`. If `arr[j]` is not equal to `arr[i]` and `arr[j]` is not equal to '?', the function returns False, otherwise, there is no return value from the function.***
