Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `vis` contains the elements of `arr` that are not equal to '?', `k` remains a positive integer, and the length of `vis` is not equal to 2. If `vis` contains exactly one element, then all elements of `arr` at indices that are multiples of `k` are replaced with `put`, where `put` is the first element of `vis`.***
