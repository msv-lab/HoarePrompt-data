According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j`, `i`, and the length of `arr`. The loop starts with `j` initialized to `i`, and it increments `j` by `k` in each iteration. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `len(arr)`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at most `len(arr) - 1`, which means `j` is equal to `i + 1` at the end of the iteration. Since `arr` has at least one element, `len(arr)` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `len(arr)`. Currently, `j` is `i + 1`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` should be `i + 1 + k`, and `j` must be less than `len(arr)`.

State: **`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 element; `i` is at most `len(arr) - 1`; `vis` is a set containing the element `arr[j]`; `j` is `i + 1 + k`; `k` is a positive integer; for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `len(arr)`**
