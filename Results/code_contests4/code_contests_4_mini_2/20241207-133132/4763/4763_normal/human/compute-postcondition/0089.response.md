The value at index `j` of the array `arr` is updated with the value `put`. The variable `j` is equal to `i + k`, and since `j` must be less than `len(arr)` for the loop to execute a second time, it indicates that the previous condition was satisfied. After this assignment, the state of `arr` at index `j` will be `put`, but the values of `i`, `k`, and `len(arr)` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` has been updated at index `j` with the value `put`, where `j` is equal to `i + k`, and the values of `i`, `k`, and `len(arr)` remain the same.

Output State: **`arr` has been updated at index `j` with the value `put`, where `j` is equal to `i + k`, and the values of `i`, `k`, and `len(arr)` remain the same.**
