The code attempts to increment the value in the dictionary `dic` at the key corresponding to the tuple `arr[i]`. The initial value of `dic` is `{'1': 0, '0': 0, '?': 0}`. Since `i` is 0, the program will access `arr[0]`, which is the first tuple in the list `arr`. The value of `arr[i]` will determine which key in `dic` is incremented.

Assuming `arr[i]` corresponds to one of the keys in `dic` ('1', '0', or '?'), the respective count in `dic` will be incremented by 1. The states of `arr` and `i` are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State will reflect the updated value in `dic`, along with the current states of the other variables.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of tuples, `dic` is updated based on `arr[0]`, `i` is 0**
