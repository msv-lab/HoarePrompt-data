Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of tuples `arr`, where each tuple contains a length integer, an even integer `k`, and a string `s` composed of characters '0', '1', and '?'. It checks for conflicts in the values at regular intervals defined by `k`, replacing '?' with consistent values based on the existing '0' and '1' values. The function returns False if there are any conflicts, such as finding two different non-'?' values in the same segment or if the counts of '1', '0', and '?' do not satisfy specific criteria. It returns True if the conditions regarding the counts of '1', '0', and '?' are satisfied, meaning the number of '?' must equal the absolute difference between the counts of '1' and '0'.**
