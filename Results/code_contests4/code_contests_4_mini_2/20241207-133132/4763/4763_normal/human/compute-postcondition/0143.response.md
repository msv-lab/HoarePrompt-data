According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be greater than 0. In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1.

State: **`arr` is a list of tuples, `dic` is updated based on `arr[0]`, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be greater than 1**
