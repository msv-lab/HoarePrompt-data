The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `k`. The parameter `arr` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` (the length of the string) and an even integer `k` (2 ≤ k ≤ n), along with a string `s` (|s| = n) composed only of characters '0', '1', and '?'. The parameter `k` is an even integer. After executing the function body, the function has multiple cases for returning values. 

1. In Cases 1 through 13, the function consistently returns `False`, indicating various conditions within the process that are not met.
2. In Case 14, the function returns `True`, suggesting that a specific set of conditions regarding the counts of '1', '0', and '?' in the list of tuples `arr` are satisfied.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept a list of tuples `arr` and an even integer `k`, and return `False` for numerous conditions while returning `True` only when certain criteria regarding the counts of '1', '0', and '?' are met.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of tuples `arr` and an even integer `k`, and returns `False` for various conditions while returning `True` when specific criteria regarding the counts of '1', '0', and '?' in `arr` are satisfied.**
