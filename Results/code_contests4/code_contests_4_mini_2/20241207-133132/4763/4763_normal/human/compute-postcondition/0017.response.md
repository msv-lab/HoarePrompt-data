The value of `at_start` is assigned `False`, and this does not affect any other variables. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `sep` is assigned from `kwargs` or defaults to ' '; `file` is assigned from `kwargs` or defaults to `sys.stdout`; `at_start` is False; `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least 3 elements; `x` is the third element in `args`; the string representation of `x` is written to `file`, followed by `sep`.
