Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 element; `i` is at most `len(arr) - 1`; `vis` is a set containing all distinct elements from `arr` at the indices starting from `i` and incrementing by `k`, excluding any elements that are equal to '?'; `j` has reached or exceeded `len(arr)` after all iterations. If `vis` contains only one distinct element, all elements in `arr` starting from index `i` at every `k`-th position are updated to the value of `put`, with `j` being equal to or exceeding `len(arr)` after all iterations. The size of the set `vis` is not equal to 2.***
