According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i`, `len(arr)`, and `k`. The loop will execute as long as `j` starts from `i` and increments by `k` until it reaches the length of `arr`. Given that `arr` has at least 1 element, `len(arr)` is at least 1, and `i` is initially 0, the loop can execute.

At the start of the loop, `j` will take the value of `i`, which is 0. Since `len(arr)` is at least 1, the loop can execute at least once. The variable `put` is set to the first element of `vis`, which corresponds to the first element of `arr` that is not equal to '?'.

State: **`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `vis` contains the elements of `arr` that are not equal to '?', `k` remains a positive integer, the length of `vis` is equal to 1, `put` is the first element of `vis`, and for the loop to execute the first time, `j` is 0.**
