Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 element, and `j` is `i + 2k`. If `arr[j]` is equal to '?', then `arr[j]` is assigned the value of `arr[i]`. If `arr[j]` is not equal to `arr[i]` and `arr[j]` is not equal to '?', the program returns False, indicating that the condition for the loop to execute one more time is not met.***
