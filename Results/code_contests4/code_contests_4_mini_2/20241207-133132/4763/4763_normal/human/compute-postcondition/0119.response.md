The code `vis.add(arr[j])` adds the element `arr[j]` to the set `vis`. The variable `j` is defined as `i + 1 + k`, where `k` is a positive integer, and it is ensured that `j` is less than `len(arr)` for the loop to execute again. The initial state indicates that `arr` contains at least one element and `i` is within the bounds of the array.

Since `j` is calculated based on `i` and `k`, and `vis` is initially a set containing the element `arr[j]`, the operation will add that specific element to the set `vis`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 element; `i` is at most `len(arr) - 1`; `vis` now contains `arr[j]` in addition to its previous elements.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 element; `i` is at most `len(arr) - 1`; `vis` now contains `arr[j]` in addition to its previous elements.**
