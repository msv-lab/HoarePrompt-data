Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 element. If `arr[i]` is not equal to '?', any element `arr[j]` that was equal to '?' is updated to `arr[i]`. If any `arr[j]` was not equal to `arr[i]` and not equal to '?', the function returns False. If all `arr[j]` are equal to `arr[i]` or were '?', the function does not return anything (None). If `arr[i]` is equal to '?', `vis` contains all unique elements from `arr` that are not equal to '?', and the number of unique elements in `vis` is not equal to 2. If there is only one unique element in `vis`, then all elements from index `i` to `len(arr)-1` with a step of `k` are set to `put`, where `put` is the first (and only) element of `vis`. Otherwise, the list remains unmodified.***
