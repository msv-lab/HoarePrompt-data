Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 element. If `arr[j]` is equal to `'?'`, then `arr[j]` is updated to be equal to `arr[i]`. If `arr[j]` is not equal to `'?'`, the state of `arr` remains unchanged, with `arr[j]` still being equal to `arr[i]` or `arr[j]` being equal to `'?'`.***
