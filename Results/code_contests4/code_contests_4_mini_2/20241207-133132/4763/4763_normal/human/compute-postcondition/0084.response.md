According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variables `i`, `len(arr)`, and `k`. The loop will execute as long as `j` (which starts at `i`) is less than `len(arr)`. 

Given the state before the loop:
- `arr` is a list with at least 1 element.
- `i` is a valid index less than `len(arr)`, meaning `i` is at least 0 and less than the length of `arr`.
- `j` is initialized to `len(arr)`, which means it will not allow the loop to execute since `j` will start at `len(arr)` and the loop condition checks if `j < len(arr)`.
- In order for the loop to execute, `j` should start at `i`, which is guaranteed to be less than `len(arr)`.

Thus, the only adjustment needed is for `j` to equal `i` at the start of the loop.

State: **`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 element, `i` is a valid index less than `len(arr)`, `vis` contains all unique elements from `arr` that are not equal to '?', `j` is now equal to `i`, the number of unique elements in `vis` is 1, and `put` is the first (and only) element of `vis`**
