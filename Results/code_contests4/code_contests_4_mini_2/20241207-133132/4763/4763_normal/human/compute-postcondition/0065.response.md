Output State: **`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 element. If any `arr[j]` was equal to '?', it has been updated to equal `arr[i]`. If any `arr[j]` was not equal to `arr[i]` and not equal to '?', then the function has returned False. If all `arr[j]` are equal to `arr[i]` or were '?', the function does not return anything (None).**
