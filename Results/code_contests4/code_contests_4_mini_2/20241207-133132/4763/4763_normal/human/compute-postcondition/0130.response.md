According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i`, `len(arr)`, and `k`. 

1. The loop starts at index `i` and ends before `len(arr)`, incrementing by `k`. 
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be less than `len(arr)`.
3. Given that `j` has reached or exceeded `len(arr)` after all iterations, it suggests that `j` would not be at a valid starting point for the loop unless `i` is less than `len(arr)`.
4. Since `arr` has at least one element, `len(arr)` is at least 1, so `i` must be in the range `[0, len(arr)-1]` for the loop to execute.

Thus, for the loop to execute for the first time:
- `i` must be such that it is less than `len(arr)`.
- The variable `j` should be set to `i`, as the loop starts with `j` initialized at `i`.

State: **`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 element, `i` is less than `len(arr)`, `j` is `i`, `vis` contains distinct elements from `arr` starting from `i` excluding '?' and `put` is the only element in `vis`**.
