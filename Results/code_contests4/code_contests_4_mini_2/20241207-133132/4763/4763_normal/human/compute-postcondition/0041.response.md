The code assigns the value of `put` to the `j`-th index of `arr`. Since `j` is equal to `k`, the `k`-th element of `arr` is now replaced with `put`. The previous values of `arr`, `put`, and `j` are not specified, but we know that `arr` has its first element replaced with `put`, and `put` is the first element of `vis`. Therefore, the output state is: `arr` has its first element replaced with `put`, `i` is 0, `vis` contains elements of `arr` that are not equal to '?', `k` remains a positive integer, `put` is the first element of `vis`, and `arr[k]` is now `put`.

Output State: **`arr` has its first element replaced with `put`, `i` is 0, `vis` contains elements of `arr` that are not equal to '?', `k` remains a positive integer, `put` is the first element of `vis`, and `arr[k]` is now `put`.**
