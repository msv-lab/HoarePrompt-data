Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 element. If `arr[j]` is equal to '?', then `arr[j]` is set to equal `arr[i]`. If `arr[j]` is not equal to `arr[i]` and is not equal to '?', the function returns False. If `arr[j]` is equal to `arr[i]` or `arr[j]` is equal to '?', the function does not return anything (None).***
