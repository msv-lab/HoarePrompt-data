Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 element, `i` is a valid index less than `len(arr)`, `vis` contains all unique elements from `arr` that are not equal to '?', `j` is equal to `len(arr)`, and the number of unique elements in `vis` is not equal to 2. If the number of unique elements in `vis` is 1, then all elements at indices from `i` to `len(arr)-1` with a step of `k` are set to `put`, where `put` is the first (and only) element of `vis`. Otherwise, the program execution does not modify the list.***
