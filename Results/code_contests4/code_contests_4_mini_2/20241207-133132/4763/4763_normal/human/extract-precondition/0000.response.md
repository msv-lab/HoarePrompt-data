Precondition: **x is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^4), y is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer n (2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, k is even) and a string s (|s| = n) consisting only of the characters '0', '1', and '?'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.**
