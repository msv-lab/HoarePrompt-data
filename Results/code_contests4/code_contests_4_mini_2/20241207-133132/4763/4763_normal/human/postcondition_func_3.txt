The function processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k` followed by a string `s` of length `n`. It evaluates the string by invoking `func_3(arr, k)` and returns 'YES' if the evaluation is true and 'NO' if it is false, for each test case. The function does not return any values directly; instead, it calls `func_5` to output the results.
