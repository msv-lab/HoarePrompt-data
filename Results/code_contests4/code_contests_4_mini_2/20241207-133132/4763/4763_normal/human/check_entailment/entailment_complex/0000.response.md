Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle all edge cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, one potential failure case is when the input string contains a mix of characters including '?' placeholders that could lead to a situation where it is impossible to create a k-balanced bitstring.

For example, consider the test case:
```
4 4
0?1?
```
In this case, the substring of size 4 must have an equal number of 0s and 1s. The '?' can be replaced by either 0 or 1, but regardless of the replacement, it would not be possible to satisfy the balanced condition since the existing 0s and 1s already introduce an imbalance.

The function `func_3` attempts to replace '?' but does not ensure that all substrings of size `k` are checked for the balance condition after the replacements. Therefore, it may incorrectly return `True` for strings that cannot be made k-balanced.

Additionally, the annotations and logic in the code do not adequately account for checking all possible configurations of '?' replacements across all relevant substrings defined by `k`. Thus, it can produce incorrect results for certain inputs, leading to the conclusion that the program does not satisfy the requirements for every potential case outlined in the problem description.
