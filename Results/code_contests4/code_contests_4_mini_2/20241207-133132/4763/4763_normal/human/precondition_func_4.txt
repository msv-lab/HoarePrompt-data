t is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, n is an integer (2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, k is even) representing the length of the string, k is an even integer, and s is a string of length n that consists only of characters 0, 1, and ?. The total length of all strings across test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.
