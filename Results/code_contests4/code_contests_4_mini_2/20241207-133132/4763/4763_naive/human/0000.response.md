To assess the correctness of the provided program, we will analyze its logic against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
We need to determine if we can replace every '?' in a given bitstring so that every substring of size `k` contains an equal number of '0's and '1's.

### Program Analysis:
1. The program reads multiple test cases.
2. Each test case consists of:
   - An integer `n` (length of string) and `k` (size of balanced substring).
   - A string `s` of length `n` containing '0', '1', and '?'.
3. The program processes the string using the function `func_3` to check if it's possible to replace '?' and maintain the k-balanced condition.

### Potential Issues:
- The program checks every character and attempts to replace '?' with either '0' or '1', considering the k-th positions.
- A significant issue arises when there are conflicting replacements. For instance, if there are '0's and '1's at different positions that need to be reconciled across their k positions, it might lead to an inconsistency.

### Test Cases:
Let's consider a problematic scenario:
- Input: `4 2` followed by `1??1`
  - Possible valid replacements for the '?' are '0' or '1'.
  - If we replace `?` with '0', we get `1001`, which is not k-balanced.
  - If we replace `?` with '1', we get `1111`, which is k-balanced.
- The program logic might fail to explore all combinations effectively, leading to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
While the program aims to handle replacements correctly, it does not account for all conflicting replacements that may occur in the substring checks. Given the above analysis, the program will likely fail in scenarios where conflicting replacements are necessary.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program may incorrectly return "YES" for cases where it is not possible to achieve a k-balanced bitstring due to conflicting character placements.
