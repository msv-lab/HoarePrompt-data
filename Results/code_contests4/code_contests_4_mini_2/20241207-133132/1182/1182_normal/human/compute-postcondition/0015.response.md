The code `al.append(alp[k])` appends the character at index `k` of the string `alp` to the list `al`. Given that `k` is 1, the character at index 1 of `alp` (which is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz') is 'b'. Therefore, 'b' will be added to the list `al`, which initially contains only ['a'].

After this operation, `al` will be updated to ['a', 'b']. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `b` is now a NumPy array containing all characters of `a`, `k` is 1, `alp` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `al` is now ['a', 'b'], for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be less than 26**.
