The value of `k` is 0, so `alp[k]` corresponds to the first character of `alp`, which is 'a'. The `append` method adds this character to the list `al`. The previous values of the affected variables are unchanged other than the addition of the character to the list `al`. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `b` is now a NumPy array containing all characters of `a`, `k` is equal to 0, `alp` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `al` is now ['a'].

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `b` is now a NumPy array containing all characters of `a`, `k` is equal to 0, `alp` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `al` is now ['a']**.
