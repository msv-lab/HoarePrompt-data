The code `res.append(np.where(b == aa))` appends the indices of occurrences of the string `aa` (which is 'b') in the NumPy array `b` (which contains all characters of `s`) to the list `res`. 

The impact of this code is:

1. The `np.where(b == aa)` function will return the indices where the elements of `b` are equal to `aa` (i.e., 'b').
2. These indices will be appended to the list `res`.

Assuming `s` consists of lowercase English letters and `b` is derived from `s`, the output will reflect the indices of 'b' in the string `s`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters; `b` is a NumPy array containing all characters of `s`; `k` is equal to 26; `alp` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `al` is a list containing all lowercase English letters; `aa` is 'b'; `res` is updated to include the indices of 'b' in `b`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters; `b` is a NumPy array containing all characters of `s`; `k` is equal to 26; `alp` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `al` is a list containing all lowercase English letters; `aa` is 'b'; `res` is updated to include the indices of 'b' in `b`.**
