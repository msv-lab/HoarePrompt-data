According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `res`. The loop will execute if `res` contains at least one index, which means its length must be greater than 0. 

Currently, the state indicates that `s` is a string, `b` is an array of characters from `s`, `k` is 26, `alp` is a string of the alphabet, `al` is a list of lowercase letters, `res` is a list of indices, and `m` is an empty list. 

To ensure that the loop can execute, the list `res` must contain at least one index. Therefore, we need to state that `res` must not be empty, and we also need to set `k` to 0 to indicate the first iteration of the loop.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `b` is a NumPy array containing all characters of `s`, `k` is 0, `alp` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `al` is a list containing all lowercase English letters, `res` is a list of indices of characters from `al` that are present in `b` with at least 1 index, `m` is an empty list**
