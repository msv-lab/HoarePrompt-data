The variable `cur` is assigned the result of `map(int, inp[_i].split())`. The value of `_i` is 3, so the program will take the string at index 3 of the `inp` list, split it into components, convert each component to an integer, and create an iterable map object. The values of `T`, `N`, and `n` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is at least 1, `_i` is 3, `N` is greater than 0, `n` is 1, and `cur` will be a map object containing integers derived from `inp[3]`.

Output State: **`T` is at least 1, `_i` is 3, `N` is greater than 0, `n` is 1, `cur` will be a map object containing integers derived from `inp[3]**
