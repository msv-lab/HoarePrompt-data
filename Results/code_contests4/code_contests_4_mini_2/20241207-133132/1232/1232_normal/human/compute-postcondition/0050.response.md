The value of `_i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `_i` is unknown. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `start` is maxint, `res` has been updated by appending `mnShots + start`, `N` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `monsters` is an empty list, `mnShots` is 0, `cur` holds the mapped integer values from splitting the input line at index `_i` increased by 1.
