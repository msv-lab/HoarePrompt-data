The variable `cur` is assigned the result of `map(int, inp[_i].split())`, which takes the string at index `_i` from the `inp` list, splits it into components (based on spaces), and converts each component into an integer. The other variables are not affected directly by this operation. Since `_i` is already increased by 1, `N` remains unchanged and is still greater than 0, while `monsters` stays as an empty list and `mnShots` is still 0. Therefore, the output state is: `_i` is increased by 1, `start` is `maxint`, `res` is updated by appending `mnShots + start`, `N` is greater than 0, `monsters` is an empty list, `mnShots` is 0, and `cur` contains the integers from splitting the string at `inp[_i]`.
