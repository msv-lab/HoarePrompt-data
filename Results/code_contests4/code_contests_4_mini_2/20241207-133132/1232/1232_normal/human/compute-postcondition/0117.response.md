Functionality: ** The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing a number of monsters represented by pairs of integers (a_i, b_i). It calculates and returns a list of integers for each test case, where each integer represents the total damage needed to defeat the monsters and the minimum health required to start the battle. The function handles up to 150,000 test cases and ensures the total number of monsters does not exceed 300,000. It computes damage based on the difference between the health of consecutive monsters and accounts for edge cases where damage calculations may yield negative values. **
