The value of `_i` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value of 4 to 5. The other variables `T`, `N`, `n`, and `cur` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is at least 1, `_i` is 5, `N` is greater than 0, `n` is 2, and `cur` is a map object containing integers derived from `inp[4]` that is appended to the `monsters` list.
