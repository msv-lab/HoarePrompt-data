The code assigns the result of `map(int, inp[_i].split())` to the variable `cur`. This means that `cur` will hold a map object that contains integers converted from the split values of the string at `inp[_i]`. The previous state of `start` is not affected by this operation, and the values in `cur` depend on the contents of `inp[_i]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `start` is updated to the minimum of `maxint` and `cur[0] - dam`; `cur` contains a map object of integers.

Output State: **`start` is updated to the minimum of `maxint` and `cur[0] - dam`; `cur` contains a map object of integers.**
