The code `monsters.append(cur)` adds the value of `cur` to the list `monsters`. The initial state indicates that `_i` is increased by 1, but there is no information provided about the state of `monsters` or `cur`. Therefore, we cannot determine the specific values of these variables, but we know that the `monsters` list will have an additional element added.

Output State: **`_i` is increased by 1; `cur` is appended to the list `monsters`.**
