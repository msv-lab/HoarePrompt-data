The variable `cur` is assigned the value of `map(int, inp[_i].split())`, which takes the string at `inp[_i]`, splits it into parts based on whitespace, and converts each part into an integer. The previous state indicates that `cur` contains integers from splitting the string. Therefore, the output state reflects that `cur` now holds the integers obtained from that operation, but the exact integers are not specified.

Output State: **`_i` is increased by 1, `start` is `maxint`, `res` is updated by appending `mnShots + start`, `N` is greater than `k + 1`, `monsters` contains `cur`, `mnShots` is 0, `cur` contains integers from splitting the string at `inp[_i]`, and `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute a second time.**
