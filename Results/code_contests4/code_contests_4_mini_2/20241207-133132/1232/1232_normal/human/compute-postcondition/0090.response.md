The value of `mnShots` is incremented by `dam`. The previous value of `mnShots` is 0, and `dam` is the maximum of 0 and `cur[0] - monsters[n - 1][1]`. Since `dam` could be either non-negative or negative depending on the values in `cur` and `monsters`, `mnShots` will be updated to either `dam` or remain 0 if `dam` is negative. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `mnShots` is updated to either `0 + dam` (if dam is non-negative) or remains `0` (if dam is negative) and `dam` is the maximum of `0` and `cur[0] - monsters[n - 1][1]`.

Output State: **`mnShots` is updated to either `0 + dam` or remains `0`; `dam` is the maximum of `0` and `cur[0] - monsters[n - 1][1]**
