`N` is assigned the value of `int(inp[_i])`, where `_i` is 1. The input value at index `_i` is processed by `int()` to convert it to an integer. The value of `T` and `_i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is assigned an integer value of at least 1, `_i` is 1, `N` is an integer from `inp[1]`.

Output State: **`T` is assigned an integer value of at least 1, `_i` is 1, `N` is an integer from `inp[1]**
