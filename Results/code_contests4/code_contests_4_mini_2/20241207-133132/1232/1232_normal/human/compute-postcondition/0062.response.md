The variable `mnShots` is incremented by the value of `dam`. Since `dam` is calculated as `max(0, cur[0] - monsters[n - 1][1])`, its value depends on the previous values of `cur` and `monsters`. However, the exact values of these variables are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects the increase of `mnShots` by `dam` but does not specify exact values.

Output State: **`mnShots` is increased by `dam`**
