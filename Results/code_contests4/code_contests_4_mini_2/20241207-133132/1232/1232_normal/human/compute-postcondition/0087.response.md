The operation `monsters.append(cur)` adds the current value of `cur` to the list `monsters`. Since `monsters` is initially an empty list, after this execution, `monsters` will contain the value of `cur`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `_i` is increased by 1, `start` is `maxint`, `res` is updated by appending `mnShots + start`, `N` is greater than 0, `monsters` now contains `cur`, `mnShots` is 0, and `cur` contains the integers from splitting the string at `inp[_i]`.
