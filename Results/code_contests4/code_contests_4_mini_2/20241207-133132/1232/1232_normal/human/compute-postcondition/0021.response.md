According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n` and the value of `N`. If `n` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_i` is 3, `N` is greater than 0, and `n` is equal to the current iteration index. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, the value of `n` needs to be incremented by 1. 

Since `n` is currently 0 (the first iteration), it will be updated to 1 for the next iteration. As a result, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be less than `N`, which is already satisfied since `N` is greater than 0.

State: **`T` is at least 1, `_i` is 3, `N` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be less than `N`, and `n` will be 1**
