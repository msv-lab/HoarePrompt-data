According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `n` and the range defined by `N`. Since `N` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `_i` is 4, and `n` is 1. The variable `n` will increase by 1 for the next iteration, so `n` will be 2.

For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be less than `N`. Since `N` is greater than 0, this condition is satisfied. Therefore, `n` will be updated to 2 for the next iteration.

State: **`T` is at least 1, `_i` is 4, `N` is greater than 0, `n` is 2, and `cur` is a map object containing integers derived from `inp[3]` that is appended to the `monsters` list.**
