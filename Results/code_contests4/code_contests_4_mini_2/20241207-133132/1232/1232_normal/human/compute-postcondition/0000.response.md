Output State: **`T` is an integer (1 ≤ `T` ≤ 150000) representing the number of test cases; for each test case, `n` is an integer (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000) representing the number of monsters, followed by `n` pairs of integers (`a_i`, `b_i`) where 1 ≤ `a_i`, `b_i` ≤ 10^{12} for each monster `i`. The total number of monsters across all test cases does not exceed 300000. The standard input is set up to read the stream of data, but no variables are assigned specific values or changed.**
