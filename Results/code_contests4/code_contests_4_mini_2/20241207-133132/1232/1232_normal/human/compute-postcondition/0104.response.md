The code `monsters.append(cur)` adds the value of `cur` to the list `monsters`. The initial state indicates that `monsters` already contains `cur`, which is a collection of integers derived from splitting a string. Therefore, after executing the append operation, `monsters` will now contain an additional instance of `cur`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged; thus, the final output reflects the updated state of `monsters`.

Output State: **`_i` is increased by 1, `start` is `maxint`, `res` is updated by appending `mnShots + start`, `N` is greater than `k + 1`, `monsters` now contains an additional `cur`, `mnShots` is 0, `cur` contains integers from splitting the string at `inp[_i]`, and `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute a second time.**
