Postcondition: ***`T` is at least 1, `_i` is 3, `N` is greater than 0, `cur` is an iterator of integers derived from `inp[_i].split()`, `cur` is appended to the list `monsters`, and if `n` is greater than 0, `dam` is calculated as max(0, cur[0] - monsters[n - 1][1]), `mnShots` is increased by `dam`, and `start` is updated to the minimum value between its previous value and (cur[0] - dam).***
