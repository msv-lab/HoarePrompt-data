Postcondition: ***`T` is at least 1, `_i` is 5, `N` is greater than 0, `n` is 2, `cur` is a map object, if `n` is greater than 0, then `dam` is assigned the maximum of 0 and the value of `cur[0]` minus `monsters[1][1]`, and `start` is updated to the minimum of its current value and (cur[0] - dam).***
