The variable `cur` is assigned the value of `map(int, inp[_i].split())`, which processes the string at index `_i` of the list `inp`, splits it into separate components, converts each component into an integer, and creates an iterator of these integers. The values of other variables, `T` and `N`, remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is at least 1, `_i` is 2, `N` is greater than 0, and `cur` is an iterator of integers derived from `inp[2].split()`.

Output State: **`T` is at least 1, `_i` is 2, `N` is greater than 0, and `cur` is an iterator of integers derived from `inp[_i].split()`.**
