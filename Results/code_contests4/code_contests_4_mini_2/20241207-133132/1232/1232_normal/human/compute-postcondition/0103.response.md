The value of `_i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `_i` is unknown, but it is increased by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `_i` is increased by 1, `start` is `maxint`, `res` is updated by appending `mnShots + start`, `N` is greater than `k + 1`, `monsters` contains `cur`, `mnShots` is 0, `cur` contains integers from splitting the string at `inp[_i]`, and `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute a second time.

Output State: **`_i` is increased by 1, `start` is `maxint`, `res` is updated by appending `mnShots + start`, `N` is greater than `k + 1`, `monsters` contains `cur`, `mnShots` is 0, `cur` contains integers from splitting the string at `inp[_i]`, and `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute a second time.**
