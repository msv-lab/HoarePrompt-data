The code `monsters.append(cur)` adds the value of `cur` to the list `monsters`. The initial state indicates that `monsters` is an empty list, and `cur` holds some mapped integer values. Since `monsters` is empty before this operation, after executing the code, `cur` will be the first element in the `monsters` list. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is maxint, `res` has been updated by appending `mnShots + start`, `N` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `monsters` contains `cur`, `mnShots` is 0, `cur` holds the mapped integer values.**
