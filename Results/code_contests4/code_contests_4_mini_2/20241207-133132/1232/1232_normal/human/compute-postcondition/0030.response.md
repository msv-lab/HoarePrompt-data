The variable `cur` is assigned the value of `map(int, inp[_i].split())`. The input list `inp` is indexed at `_i`, which is 4, and the string at that index is split into individual components. Each component is then converted to an integer through the `map` function. The initial state indicates that `N` is greater than 0, which suggests that the string at `inp[4]` contains at least some integers. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is at least 1, `_i` is 4, `N` is greater than 0, `n` is 2, and `cur` is a map object containing integers derived from `inp[4]` that is appended to the `monsters` list.**
