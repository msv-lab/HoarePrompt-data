The value of `_i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `_i` is 1, so after execution, `_i` becomes 2. The values of `T` and `N` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is assigned an integer value of at least 1, `_i` is 2, `N` is an integer from `inp[1]`.

Output State: **`T` is assigned an integer value of at least 1, `_i` is 2, `N` is an integer from `inp[1]**
