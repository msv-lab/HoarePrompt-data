According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `N`. For the loop to execute at least once, `N` must be greater than 0. The state `_i` is increased by 1 and `N` is assigned a value from `inp[_i]`, which means that `N` must be a valid integer derived from the input list. Since `monsters` is an empty list and `mnShots` is 0, these values do not impact the execution of the loop directly. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time:
- `N` must be greater than 0
- `_i` must be pointing to a valid index in `inp` such that `N = int(inp[_i])`

State: **`_i` is increased by 1, `start` is `maxint`, `res` is updated by appending `mnShots + start`, `N` is greater than 0, `monsters` is an empty list, `mnShots` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `N` is assigned the value of at least 1 from `int(inp[_i])`**
