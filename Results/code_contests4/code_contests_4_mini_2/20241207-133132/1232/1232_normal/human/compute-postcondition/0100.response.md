Postcondition: ***`_i` is increased by 1, `start` is `maxint`, `res` is updated by appending `mnShots + start`, `N` is greater than `k + 1`, `monsters` contains `cur`, `mnShots` is 0, `cur` contains the integers from splitting the string at `inp[_i]`, and `cur` is appended to `monsters`. If `n` is greater than 0, `mnShots` is increased by `dam`, and `start` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `cur[0] - dam`. Otherwise, the values of `mnShots` and `start` remain unchanged.***
