Postcondition: ***`_i` is increased by 1, `start` is `maxint`, `res` is updated by appending `mnShots + start`, `N` is greater than `k + 1`, `monsters` now contains an additional `cur`, `mnShots` is 0, `cur` contains integers from splitting the string at `inp[_i]`, and `n` is greater than 1. If `n` is greater than 0, `mnShots` is increased by `dam`, calculated as `max(0, cur[0] - monsters[n - 1][1])`, and `start` is assigned the minimum of its previous value and `cur[0] - dam`. Otherwise, the program state remains unchanged since there is no else part.***
