Output State: **`T` is an integer (1 ≤ `T` ≤ 150000) representing the number of test cases; for each test case, `n` is an integer (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000) representing the number of monsters, followed by `n` pairs of integers (`a_i`, `b_i`) where 1 ≤ `a_i`, `b_i` ≤ 10^{12} for each monster `i`. The total number of monsters across all test cases does not exceed 300000. `stdout` is a BytesIO object for output stream.**
