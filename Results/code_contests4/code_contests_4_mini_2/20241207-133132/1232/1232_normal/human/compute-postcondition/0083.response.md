The variable `start` is assigned the value `maxint`. Since there are no previous values for `maxint` provided in the initial state, we assume it represents a very large integer value. The values of `_i`, `N`, `monsters`, `res`, and `mnShots` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `_i` is increased by 1, `start` is now `maxint`, `res` is updated by appending `mnShots + start`, `N` is assigned the value of `int(inp[_i])`, `monsters` is an empty list, and `mnShots` is 0.

Output State: **`_i` is increased by 1, `start` is now `maxint`, `res` is updated by appending `mnShots + start`, `N` is assigned the value of `int(inp[_i])`, `monsters` is an empty list, and `mnShots` is 0.**
