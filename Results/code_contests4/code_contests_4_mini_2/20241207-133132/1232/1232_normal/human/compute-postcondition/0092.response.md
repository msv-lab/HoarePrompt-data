Postcondition: ***Given that `_i` is increased by 1, `start` is `maxint`, `res` is updated by appending `mnShots + start`, `N` is greater than 0, `monsters` now contains `cur`, `mnShots` is 0, and `cur` contains the integers from splitting the string at `inp[_i]`, if `n` is greater than 0, then `mnShots` is updated to either `0 + dam` or remains `0`, where `dam` is the maximum of `0` and `cur[0] - monsters[n - 1][1]`, and `start` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `cur[0] - dam`. If `n` is not greater than 0, the state remains unchanged.***
