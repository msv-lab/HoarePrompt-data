The variable `cur` is assigned the result of `map(int, inp[_i].split())`, which means that it will contain the integers derived from splitting the string at `inp[_i]`. The values in `inp[_i]` are processed, and since `cur` is created from `inp[_i]`, it will hold the integer values obtained from that specific input.

Other variables (`_i`, `start`, `res`, `N`, `monsters`, `mnShots`) are not directly affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`_i` is increased by 1, `start` is `maxint`, `res` is updated by appending `mnShots + start`, `N` is greater than `k + 1`, `monsters` contains `cur`, `mnShots` is 0, `cur` contains the integers from splitting the string at `inp[_i]`.**
