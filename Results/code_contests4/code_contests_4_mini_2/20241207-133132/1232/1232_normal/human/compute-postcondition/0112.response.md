Output State: **`_i` is increased by `N`, `start` is the minimum value calculated during the loop, `res` contains a series of values updated by appending `mnShots + start` for each iteration, `N` is the total number of iterations performed, `monsters` contains `N` lists of integers derived from `inp`, `mnShots` is updated by adding `dam`, `dam` is calculated as max(0, monsters[0][0] - monsters[-1][1]); `start` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `monsters[0][0] - dam`.**
