According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. The loop will execute `T` times, starting from `t = 0`. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `T` must be at least 1. The initial value of `_i` does not affect the execution of the loop. 

State: **`T` is assigned an integer value of at least 1, `_i` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `t` is 0**
