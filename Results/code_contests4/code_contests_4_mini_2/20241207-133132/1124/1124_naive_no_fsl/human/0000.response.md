To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the logic and identify potential issues.

### Problem Description Recap
Mike needs to determine the minimum difficulty of a climbing track after removing one hold. The difficulty is defined as the maximum difference between adjacent holds after one hold (not the first or last) is removed.

### Program Analysis
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n` and a list of heights `lst`.
2. **Combination Generation**: It uses combinations to generate all possible ways to remove one hold while ensuring the first and last hold remain.
3. **Calculating Difficulty**: The function `func_1` is designed to compute the maximum difference between adjacent holds in the modified list.

### Issues with the Program
1. **Incorrect Use of `map`**: The `map` function returns an iterator in Python 3, which needs to be converted to a list. If `raw_input` is not defined, the program will fail. This should be `input()` in Python 3.
2. **Logic in `func_1`**: The condition `if 0 in c and n - 1 in c:` is incorrect. It checks if the first and last holds are included, but it doesn't address how we compute the new adjacency after removing a hold.
3. **Missing Edge Cases**: The program does not properly handle the case where the first or last hold is removed. While the problem states that the first and last holds must stay, the logic used to handle this might not cover all edge cases correctly.
4. **Initialization of `awk`**: The variable `awk` is initialized to a large number but the logic to find the maximum difference might not work as expected since it only considers conditions where `awk` is updated.

### Example of Failure
Consider the input:
```
5
1 2 3 8 9
```
Removing the hold at index 3 (value 8) would give the sequence `[1, 2, 3, 9]`. The maximum difference should be `6` (between `3` and `9`), but due to the faulty logic in `func_1`, it may not compute this correctly.

### Conclusion
Given the issues mentioned, particularly with the logic of calculating the maximum difference after removing a hold, the program does not correctly handle all cases as required by the problem description.

### Correctness
Correctness: **False**
