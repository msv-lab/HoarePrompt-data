#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers representing the heights of holds where 3 ≤ len(lst) ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ lst[i] ≤ 1000 for all valid i, and c is an integer representing the number of holds (which is not explicitly used in the removal process but relates to the number of elements in lst).
def func_1(lst, c):
    temp = []
    for i in c:
        temp.append(lst[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `temp` contains the elements of `lst` at the indices specified by `c`, `c` is the number of holds processed, `lst` is a list of integers representing heights of holds.
    awk = -1
    if (0 in c and n - 1 in c) :
        for i in range(len(temp)):
            awk = max(awk, temp[i] - temp[i - 1])
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `temp` contains elements of `lst` at the indices specified by `c`, `awk` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `temp`, `c` includes all valid indices from `lst`, `i` is equal to the length of `temp` after the loop finishes, and `temp` has at least as many elements as there are valid indices in `c`.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`temp` contains elements of `lst` at the indices specified by `c`, `awk` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `temp`, `c` includes all valid indices from `lst`, and `i` is equal to the length of `temp` after the loop finishes, with `temp` having at least as many elements as there are valid indices in `c`, provided that both 0 and `n - 1` are included in `c`.
    if (awk == -1) :
        return 10000000000
        #The program returns the value 10000000000
    else :
        return awk
        #The program returns the maximum difference between consecutive elements in 'temp', which is represented by the variable 'awk', and 'awk' is not equal to -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `lst` representing heights and an integer `c`, which is expected to be a list of indices. It returns 10000000000 if both the first (index 0) and last (index n-1) elements are not included in `c`. If both indices are included, it computes and returns the maximum difference between consecutive heights specified by `c`. If no valid differences are found, it defaults to returning 10000000000. The function does not handle cases where `c` is not a list of valid indices, which could lead to index errors.
