To assess the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's break down the requirements and the code implementation.

### Problem Description
The task is to determine the minimum difficulty of a rock climbing track after removing one hold from a strictly increasing sequence of heights. The difficulty is defined as the maximum distance between two adjacent holds remaining after one hold is removed, while ensuring that the first and last holds are always included.

### Program Analysis
1. The program uses the `itertools.combinations` function to generate combinations of indices from the list of heights, effectively simulating the removal of one hold.
2. The function `func_1` checks if the first and last holds are included in the combination of indices and calculates the maximum difference between the remaining adjacent heights.
3. The main loop iterates through all combinations, updating the minimum difficulty found.

### Code Issues
1. The code does not handle the case where the input heights are provided as a map object. The `lst` variable should be a list, but using `map` without converting it to a list will lead to issues when trying to access indices later on.
2. The function `func_1` has an issue where it does not compute differences correctly if the combination `c` does not include both the first and last indices, but the logic to ensure that both ends are included seems flawed. The program could produce misleading results if it does not handle the heights correctly.
3. The code contains redundant sections (it reads the input and initializes variables twice).

### Output Hints Verification
The output hints suggest that the function:
- Returns a high number (10000000000) if both the first and last indices are not present in the combination.
- Computes the maximum difference correctly if both ends are included.
- Does not handle invalid indices properly, which could lead to index errors.

### Edge Cases
- If the provided heights are in a format that does not convert correctly to a list, the code will fail.
- The function does not explicitly handle cases where the heights are at their limits, such as the minimum of 3 holds or the maximum height of 1000.

### Conclusion
The code has multiple issues that prevent it from correctly implementing the problem requirements. It does not handle all edge cases properly, especially concerning input handling and the logic for determining the minimum difficulty after removing a hold.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to correctly manage input types and could produce incorrect results due to logical flaws in managing the combinations and edge cases. For instance, if the heights are given as a map object or if the logic in `func_1` is executed incorrectly, it would not return the expected results as outlined in the problem description.
