According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `temp`. The loop will execute if `temp` has at least one element, which means that `len(temp)` must be greater than 0. 

Since `c` is specified to be 0 and `n - 1` (which implies `c` can take multiple values), we can infer that `temp` will be populated with elements from `lst` based on those indices. To ensure that `temp` contains at least one element, `c` must be able to reference valid indices in `lst`. 

For the loop to be executed for the first time, `temp` must contain at least one element, meaning that `c` must include at least one valid index from `lst`. Additionally, `i` should start at 0, as it is common for loop indices to start at 0. 

Hence, the necessary adjustments to the state are as follows:

State: **`temp` contains elements of `lst` at the indices specified by `c` with at least one valid index, `awk` is -1, `c` includes 0 and at least one valid index from `lst`, `i` is 0**
