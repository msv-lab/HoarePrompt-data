According to the code, the loop iterates over `c`, which is greater than 0, indicating that the loop can execute multiple times based on the value of `c`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` will be incremented by 1.

Since `c` is greater than 0, `i` must be less than `c` for the loop to continue executing. Therefore, if `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute a second time, `i` must become 2, and it must still be less than `c`.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers representing heights of holds; `c` is greater than 1; `temp` contains the first element of `lst` and the second element of `lst`; `i` is 2**
