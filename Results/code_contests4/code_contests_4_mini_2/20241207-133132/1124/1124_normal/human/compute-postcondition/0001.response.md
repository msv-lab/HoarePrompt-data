According to the code, the for loop iterates over `c`, which is expected to be an iterable. In this case, `c` is an integer representing the number of holds, and iterating over an integer will not work as intended. Instead, if `c` represents the count of holds, we would typically want the loop to iterate over a range from 0 to `c-1`. 

For the loop to execute, `c` must be greater than 0, and `i` should be initialized to the first value in the range of `c` (which would be 0). Additionally, `temp` starts as an empty list and may be populated during the loop execution.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers representing heights of holds, `c` is greater than 0, `temp` is an empty list, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
