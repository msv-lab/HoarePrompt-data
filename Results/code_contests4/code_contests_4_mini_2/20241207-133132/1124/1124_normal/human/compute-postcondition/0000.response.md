The variable `temp` is initialized as an empty list. The previous values of `lst` and `c` are unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `lst` is a list of integers representing heights of holds, `c` is an integer representing the number of holds, and `temp` is an empty list.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers representing heights of holds, `c` is an integer representing the number of holds, and `temp` is an empty list**.
