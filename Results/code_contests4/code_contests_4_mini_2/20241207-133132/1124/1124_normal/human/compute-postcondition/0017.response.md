Postcondition: ***`temp` contains elements of `lst` at the indices specified by `c`, `awk` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `temp`, `c` includes all valid indices from `lst`, and `i` is equal to the length of `temp` after the loop finishes, with `temp` having at least as many elements as there are valid indices in `c`, provided that both 0 and `n - 1` are included in `c`.***
