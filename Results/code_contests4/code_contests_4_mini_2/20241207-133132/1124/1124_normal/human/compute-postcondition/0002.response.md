The value of `temp` is updated by appending the value of `lst[i]`. Since `i` is 0, `temp` will now contain the first element of `lst`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `lst` is a list of integers representing heights of holds, `c` is greater than 0, `temp` contains the first element of `lst`, `i` is 0.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers representing heights of holds, `c` is greater than 0, `temp` contains the first element of `lst`, `i` is 0**
