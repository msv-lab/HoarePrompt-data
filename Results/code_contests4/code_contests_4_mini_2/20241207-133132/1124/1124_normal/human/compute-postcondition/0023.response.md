Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers `lst` representing heights and an integer `c`, which is expected to be a list of indices. It returns 10000000000 if both the first (index 0) and last (index n-1) elements are not included in `c`. If both indices are included, it computes and returns the maximum difference between consecutive heights specified by `c`. If no valid differences are found, it defaults to returning 10000000000. The function does not handle cases where `c` is not a list of valid indices, which could lead to index errors. **
