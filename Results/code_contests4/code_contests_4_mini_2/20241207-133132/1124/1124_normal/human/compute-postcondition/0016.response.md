Output State: **`temp` contains elements of `lst` at the indices specified by `c`, `awk` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `temp`, `c` includes all valid indices from `lst`, `i` is equal to the length of `temp` after the loop finishes, and `temp` has at least as many elements as there are valid indices in `c`.**
