The code attempts to append the element at index `i` of the list `lst` to the list `temp`. Given that `i` is 1, `temp` will now contain the second element of `lst`. The variable `c` is not affected, and the variable `i` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers representing heights of holds; `c` is greater than 0; `temp` now contains the first element of `lst` and the second element of `lst`; `i` is 1**.
