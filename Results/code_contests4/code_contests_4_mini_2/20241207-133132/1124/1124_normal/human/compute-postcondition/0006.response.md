The code `temp.append(lst[i])` adds the element at index `i` of the list `lst` to the list `temp`. Given that `i` is 2, the element being added is `lst[2]`. The previous values of `temp` include the first two elements of `lst`. Therefore, after execution, `temp` will now include three elements: the first element of `lst`, the second element of `lst`, and the third element of `lst` (which is `lst[2]`).

The values of `lst`, `c`, and `i` will not change. Therefore, the Output State reflects the updated `temp` list.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers representing heights of holds; `c` is greater than 1; `temp` contains the first three elements of `lst`; `i` is 2**.
