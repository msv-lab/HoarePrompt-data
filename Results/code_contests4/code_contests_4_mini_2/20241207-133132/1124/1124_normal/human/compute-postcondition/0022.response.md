The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst` and `c`. The parameter `lst` is a list of integers, where the length of the list is between 3 and 100, and each integer in the list is between 1 and 1000. The parameter `c` is an integer representing the number of holds, which is related to the number of elements in `lst` but is not explicitly used in the removal process.

After executing the function body, the function returns different values based on certain conditions:
- Case_1: If a specific condition is met, the function returns the value 10000000000.
- Case_2: If another condition is met and is not equal to -1, the function returns the maximum difference between consecutive elements in a variable 'temp', represented by 'awk'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `lst` and an integer `c`, and return either a large constant value or the maximum difference between consecutive elements in a derived list based on specific conditions. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `lst` and an integer `c`, and returns 10000000000 or the maximum difference between consecutive elements in a derived list based on specific conditions.**
