Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. 

### Issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Function Implementation**: 
   - The `func_2` function is not defined to accept any arguments, but it is called with an argument in `func_1`. This will lead to a `TypeError`.
   - The purpose of `func_2` appears to be to print values, but it does not return the minimum number of colors needed, which is the main requirement of the problem description.

2. **Logic Flaw**:
   - The logic implemented in `func_1` only counts the frequency of the most common element in the list `a` (`Counter(a).most_common()[0][1]`). While this can inform us about how many times the most frequent number appears, it does not directly relate to the minimum number of colors required. 
   - The problem requires coloring the balls such that for each color the numbers form a strictly increasing sequence. The number of colors needed corresponds to the maximum frequency of any number in the list, but the implementation does not correctly derive or display this information.

3. **No Output Mechanism**: 
   - There is no mechanism in place to gather the results from `func_1` and output them accordingly, which is necessary since the problem requires output for each test case.

### Example of Failure:
For the input:
```
1
5
1 1 2 2 3
```
The expected output is `2`, since we can use two colors to ensure that each color's selected balls are in a strictly increasing sequence. However, the current program will likely fail to provide this output due to the reasons mentioned above.

Overall, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description, resulting in incorrect behavior.
