To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, let's break down the requirements and analyze the provided code.

### Problem Description Recap:
Nezzar wants to color balls (with numbers on them) using the minimum number of colors such that:
1. For any color, the numbers on the balls of that color form a strictly increasing sequence.
2. The input consists of multiple test cases, each providing a sequence of non-decreasing integers.

### Code Logic:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - Reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, reads `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers.
   - Calls `func_2` with the count of the most common element in the list `a`.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - Prints the provided arguments, which in this case would be the count of the most common element.

### Analysis:
- The core of the problem is about determining how many colors are needed. The color count should correspond to the maximum frequency of any single number in the list, because each number can only appear in one color to maintain a strictly increasing sequence.
- The implementation currently calculates the most common element's count and prints it, which, on the surface, seems like it would give the correct number of colors required.

### Potential Issues:
1. The program only considers the frequency of the most common number and does not account for how multiple colors can be assigned to the other numbers. 
2. For example, consider the input sequence `1, 1, 2, 2, 3`. While it has two `1`s and two `2`s, the program might incorrectly assume that two colors are sufficient, but it actually requires three colors, one for each unique number to form strictly increasing sequences.
3. The example given in the problem description (with the output of `2` for this case) may be misleading, and the code does not verify that the sequences formed by the colors are strictly increasing.

### Conclusion:
Since the code fails to handle cases where multiple instances of different numbers need separate colors (to maintain strictly increasing sequences), it does not adhere to the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is as follows:

Correctness: **False**

### Example of Failure:
For the input:
```
1
5
1 1 2 2 3
```
The expected output is `3` (since we can assign three colors as follows: color 1 to the two `1`s, color 2 to the two `2`s, and color 3 to `3`). However, the program would output `2`, which is incorrect.
