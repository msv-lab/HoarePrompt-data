The function accepts a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers that must be a non-decreasing sequence. It then calls `func_2` with the count of the most common element in the list `a` for each test case. The function does not return any value or results; it only processes the input data by invoking `func_2` with the specified argument.
