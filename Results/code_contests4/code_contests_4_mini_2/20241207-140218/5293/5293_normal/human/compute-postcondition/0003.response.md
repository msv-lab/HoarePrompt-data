According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `args` variable. If `args` is a non-empty iterable, the loop will execute. The variable `at_start` being set to `True` does not affect the execution of the loop itself, but it indicates that we are at the beginning of the loop. For the loop to execute at least once, `args` must be a non-empty iterable, and `x` will take the value of the first element in `args`. 

State: **`at_start` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `args` is a non-empty iterable, and `x` is the first element in `args`**
