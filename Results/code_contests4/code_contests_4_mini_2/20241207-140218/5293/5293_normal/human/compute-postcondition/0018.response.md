`at_start` is assigned the value `False`, which means it remains unchanged since it was already `False`. The other variables (`args`, `x`, and `sep`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `at_start` is False, `args` has at least one more element, `x` will be the next element in `args`, `sep` has been written to the file, and `x` has been converted to a string and written to the file.

Output State: **`at_start` is False, `args` has at least one more element, `x` will be the next element in `args`, `sep` has been written to the file, and `x` has been converted to a string and written to the file.**
