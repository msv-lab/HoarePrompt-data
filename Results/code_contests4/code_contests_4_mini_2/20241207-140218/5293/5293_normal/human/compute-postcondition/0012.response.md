The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file. The variable `at_start` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. The variable `args` contains at least one more element, and `x` is assigned as the next element in `args`, which is converted to a string and written to the file. Therefore, the output state reflects that `at_start` is still False and that `x` has been written to the file as a string.

Output State: **`at_start` is False, `x` is written to the file as a string**
