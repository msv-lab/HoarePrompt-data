Postcondition: ***`at_start` is False, `args` is a list of elements, `x` will not have a value since the loop has iterated through all elements in `args`, `sep` has been written to the file before each element except the first, and if the value of `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is True, the file buffer is flushed.***
