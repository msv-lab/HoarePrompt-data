Output State: **`at_start` is False, `args` is a list of elements, `x` will not have a value since the loop has iterated through all elements in `args`, `sep` has been written to the file before each element except the first, `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))` writes the value of `kwargs` with a default of a newline character if 'end' is not specified, and the value of `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is True; the file buffer is flushed.**
