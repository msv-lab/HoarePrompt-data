Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where each integer 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ `n` and the list is non-decreasing (i.e., `a[i]` ≤ `a[i+1]` for all 1 ≤ `i` < `n`). The operation does not modify any variables but indicates a function intended for outputting values.**
