The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters directly. However, it operates under the constraints that there is an integer `t` such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, an integer `n` is provided, which satisfies \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), and a list of integers `a` of length `n` is provided. The integers in the list `a` fall within the range \(1 \leq a[i] \leq n\) and the list is non-decreasing (i.e., \(a[i] \leq a[i+1]\) for all \(1 \leq i < n\)).

The function processes the input according to these constraints and relationships. However, the exact output or behavior based on the input has not been specified, so we can only describe the parameters and their constraints.

Functionality: **The function operates on a set of test cases defined by an integer `t`, where each test case includes an integer `n` and a non-decreasing list of integers `a` of length `n`, with each integer in the range from 1 to `n`.**
