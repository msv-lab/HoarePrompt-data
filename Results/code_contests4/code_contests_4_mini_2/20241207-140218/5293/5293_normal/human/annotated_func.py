#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases; for each test case, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100); a is a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) that forms a non-decreasing sequence.

    t = int(input())

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer from the input for each test case, `a` is a list of integers from the input for each test case, and the function `func_2` has been called `t` times with the most common count of the elements in each list `a` as its argument for each respective test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers that must be a non-decreasing sequence. It then calls `func_2` with the count of the most common element in the list `a` for each test case. The function does not return any value or results; it only processes the input data by invoking `func_2` with the specified argument.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, for each test case n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of integers a of length n is provided where each integer 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n and the list is non-decreasing (a[i] ≤ a[i+1] for all 1 ≤ i < n).

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `at_start` is False, `args` is a list of elements, `x` will not have a value since the loop will have iterated through all elements in `args`, `sep` has been written to the file before each element except the first, and all elements in `args` have been converted to strings and written to the file.

    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`at_start` is False, `args` is a list of elements, `x` will not have a value since the loop has iterated through all elements in `args`, `sep` has been written to the file before each element except the first, and if the value of `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is True, the file buffer is flushed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts variable arguments and keyword arguments, prints each argument to a specified file (defaulting to standard output) separated by a specified separator (defaulting to a space), and ends with a specified end character (defaulting to a new line). It also flushes the output buffer if indicated by the keyword argument. The function does not directly handle the test cases or the list `a` mentioned in the annotations, as it primarily focuses on printing the provided arguments.
