The function accepts variable arguments and keyword arguments, prints each argument to a specified file (defaulting to standard output) separated by a specified separator (defaulting to a space), and ends with a specified end character (defaulting to a new line). It also flushes the output buffer if indicated by the keyword argument. The function does not directly handle the test cases or the list `a` mentioned in the annotations, as it primarily focuses on printing the provided arguments.
