You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Taro is going to play a card game. However, now he has only n cards, even though there should be 52 cards (he has no Jokers).

The 52 cards include 13 ranks of each of the four suits: spade, heart, club and diamond.

Note

解説



Input

In the first line, the number of cards n (n ≤ 52) is given.

In the following n lines, data of the n cards are given. Each card is given by a pair of a character and an integer which represent its suit and rank respectively. A suit is represented by 'S', 'H', 'C' and 'D' for spades, hearts, clubs and diamonds respectively. A rank is represented by an integer from 1 to 13.

Output

Print the missing cards. The same as the input format, each card should be printed with a character and an integer separated by a space character in a line. Arrange the missing cards in the following priorities:

* Print cards of spades, hearts, clubs and diamonds in this order.
* If the suits are equal, print cards with lower ranks first.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
