The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement skips the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52, `k` is 'S', `i` is 4, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.
