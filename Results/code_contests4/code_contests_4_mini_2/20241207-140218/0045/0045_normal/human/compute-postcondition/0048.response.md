According to the code, the loop iterates over a range of 13, which means it will execute for values of `i` from 0 to 12. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, indicating that the loop has executed once with `i` being 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 1, and since the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 13, it can execute a second time. 

Therefore, the state needs to reflect that `i` has been incremented to 1, while the values for `n`, `k`, and the output remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52, `k` is 'H', `i` is 1, and the output is 'H 1' for the loop to execute a second time.**
