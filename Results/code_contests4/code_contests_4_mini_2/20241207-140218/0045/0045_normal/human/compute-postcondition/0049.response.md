The values of the variables do not change, but we skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52, `k` is 'H', `i` is 1, and the loop will execute a second time with the same variable values.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52, `k` is 'H', `i` is 1, and the loop will execute a second time with the same variable values.**
