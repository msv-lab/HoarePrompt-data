The code prints the values of `k` and `i + 1`. The value of `k` is 'H' and `i` is 2. Therefore, `i + 1` is 3. The loop does not execute again as there is no else part, but the printing operation occurs.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52, `k` is 'H', `i` is 2; output: H 3**
