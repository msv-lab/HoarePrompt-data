Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and reads a non-negative integer `n` (where 0 <= n <= 52) that represents the number of cards. It then records the suits ('S', 'H', 'C', 'D') and ranks (1 to 13) of the cards, marking them as present in a dictionary. After processing the input, the function prints out all the missing cards for each suit, indicating which ranks are not present among the input cards. If no cards are inputted (i.e., if n is 0), it will print all cards from each suit. **
