The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52**
