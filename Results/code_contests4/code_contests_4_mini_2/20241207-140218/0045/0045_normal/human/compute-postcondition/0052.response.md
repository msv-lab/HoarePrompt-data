According to the code, the loop iterates over a range of 13, meaning it will execute as long as `i` is less than 13. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, which allows for the loop to execute again. For the loop to run a second time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to become 2.

Since the loop will execute again, `n` does not affect the loop's execution in this case, but `k` remains unchanged.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52, `k` is 'H', `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than 13**
