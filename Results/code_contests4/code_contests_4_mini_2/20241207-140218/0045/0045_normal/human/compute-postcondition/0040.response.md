The code executes a print statement that formats the values of `k` and `i + 1`. The current value of `k` is 'S', and `i` is 5. So, `i + 1` equals 6. The print statement will output the formatted string containing these values. Other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52, `k` is 'S', `i` is 5, and the output is 'S 6'.**
