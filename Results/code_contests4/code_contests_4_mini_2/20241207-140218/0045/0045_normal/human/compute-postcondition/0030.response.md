The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52, `k` is 'S', `i` is 3, and the value of `d[k][i]` is true, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
