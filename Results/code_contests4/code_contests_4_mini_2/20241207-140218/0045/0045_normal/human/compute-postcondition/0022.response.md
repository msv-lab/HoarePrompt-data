According to the code, the loop iterates based on the variable `i`, which is currently 1. The loop is set to execute 13 times, so it will continue as long as `i` is less than 13. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, meaning the loop has executed once and will execute again for `i` equal to 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` becoming 2. The variable `n` remains within the specified range of 0 to 52, and `k` remains 'S'.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52, `k` is 'S', `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than 13**
