The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to operate based on the constraints that `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 52\). The function will use the following `n` lines of input, where each line consists of a suit represented by 'S', 'H', 'C', or 'D', and a rank represented by an integer from 1 to 13. The function's output is not explicitly stated, but it will likely process or validate the input data based on these constraints. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to handle a set of card representations based on the specified constraints of suits and ranks without accepting any direct parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and processes a non-negative integer n (0 <= n <= 52) representing the number of cards, where each card is defined by a suit ('S', 'H', 'C', or 'D') and a rank (1 to 13).**
