The code prints the formatted string containing the current values of `k` and `i + 1`. Given that `k` is 'S' and `i` is 3, the value of `i + 1` will be 4. Therefore, the output of the print statement will be 'S 4'. The other variables, `n` and `d[k][i]`, are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52, `k` is 'S', `i` is 3, and the output is 'S 4'**.
