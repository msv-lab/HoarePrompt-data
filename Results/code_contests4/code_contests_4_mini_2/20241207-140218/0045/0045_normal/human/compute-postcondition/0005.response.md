According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 < n \leq 52\). For the loop to execute again, `i` will be incremented by 1.

Therefore, after the last iteration, `i` becomes 1. Since `n` is still greater than 1 (keeping in mind the constraint that \(0 < n \leq 52\)), the loop can execute for a second time.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 < n <= 52, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
