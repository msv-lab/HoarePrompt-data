The code snippet uses the `print` function to output a formatted string. The variable `k` is 'S' and `i` is 2. The expression `i + 1` evaluates to 3. Therefore, the print statement will output the string 'S' followed by the number 3.

The values of the other variables are not affected by this print statement.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52, `k` is 'S', `i` is 2; printed output is 'S 3'**
