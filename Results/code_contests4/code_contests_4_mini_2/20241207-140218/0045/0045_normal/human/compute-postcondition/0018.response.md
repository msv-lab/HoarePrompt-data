According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 13. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` will be increased by 1, making it 1. Therefore, the loop can execute again since `i` (which will be 1) is still less than 13.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52, `k` is 'S', `i` is 1; for the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be less than 13**
