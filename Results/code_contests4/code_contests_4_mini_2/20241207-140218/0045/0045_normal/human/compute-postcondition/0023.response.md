The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the remaining code in the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. Since `i` is 2, and it is less than 13, the loop will execute again. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52, `k` is 'S', `i` is 2, and the loop will execute a second time.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52, `k` is 'S', `i` is 2, and the loop will execute a second time.**
