The code provided is a print statement that outputs the values of `k` and `i + 1`. The variable `k` is 'S' and `i` is 4. The calculation for `i + 1` results in 5. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52, `k` is 'S', `i` is 4, and the printed output will be 'S 5'.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52; `k` is 'S'; `i` is 4; printed output is 'S 5'**.
