The loop iterates a total of 13 times, once for each value of `i` from 0 to 12. During each iteration, if `d[k][i]` evaluates to true, the loop continues to the next iteration without printing. If it evaluates to false, it prints the value of `k` and `i + 1`. 

Given that `k` is 'S' and `n` is a non-negative integer within the specified range, after all iterations of the loop have executed, the output state will reflect the following:

1. `n` remains a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52.
2. `k` remains 'S'.
3. `i` will have iterated through all values from 0 to 12, meaning the last value of `i` will be 12.

Thus, the output state after all iterations, regardless of whether any output occurred during the loop, is:

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52, `k` is 'S', `i` is 12.**
