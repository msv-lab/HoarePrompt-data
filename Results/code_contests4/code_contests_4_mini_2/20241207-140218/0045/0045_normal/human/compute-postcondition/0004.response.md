The line of code assigns the value `True` to the element at the `x`-th index and `(int(y) - 1)`-th index of the 2D list `d`. The variable `x` holds a value obtained from `raw_input()`, and `y` also holds a value obtained from `raw_input()`. The value of `y` is converted to an integer and decremented by 1 before being used as an index. The variable `n` does not directly affect this assignment.

Since `x` and `y` are assigned values from `raw_input()`, we don't know their specific values without additional context. However, we can state that `d[x][int(y) - 1]` is set to `True`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 < n <= 52; `i` is 0; `d[x][int(y) - 1]` is set to True where `x` and `y` are obtained from raw_input().**
