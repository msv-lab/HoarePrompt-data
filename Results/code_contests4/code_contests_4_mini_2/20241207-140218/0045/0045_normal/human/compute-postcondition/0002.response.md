According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Given that `n` is a non-negative integer within the range 0 to 52, the loop will only execute if `n` is greater than 0. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` will be equal to `n - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed the first time, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` should start at 0 during the first iteration.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 < n <= 52, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
