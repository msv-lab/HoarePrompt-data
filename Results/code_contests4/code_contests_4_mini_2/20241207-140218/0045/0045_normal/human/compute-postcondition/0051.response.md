The code snippet prints the values of `k` and `i + 1`. Given the initial state, `k` is 'H' and `i` is 1. Therefore, `i + 1` will evaluate to 2. The output will print 'H' followed by 2.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52, `k` is 'H', `i` is 1; the output is 'H 2'.**
