According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will run again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 < n \leq 52\). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1. After the last iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 < n <= 52, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
