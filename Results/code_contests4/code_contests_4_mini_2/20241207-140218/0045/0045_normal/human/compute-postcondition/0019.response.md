The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the remaining code in the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52, `k` is 'S', `i` is 1, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop since `i` must be less than 13 for the loop to execute a second time.
