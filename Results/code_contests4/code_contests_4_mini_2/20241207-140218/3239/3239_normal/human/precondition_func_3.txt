t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases; for each test case, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) representing the number of composite integers in the sequence; and a is a list of n composite integers where each integer a_i satisfies 4 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
