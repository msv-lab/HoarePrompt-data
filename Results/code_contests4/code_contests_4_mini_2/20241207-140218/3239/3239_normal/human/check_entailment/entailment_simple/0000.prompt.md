You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: A positive integer is called composite if it can be represented as a product of two positive integers, both greater than 1. For example, the following numbers are composite: 6, 4, 120, 27. The following numbers aren't: 1, 2, 3, 17, 97.

Alice is given a sequence of n composite numbers a_1,a_2,…,a_n.

She wants to choose an integer m ≤ 11 and color each element one of m colors from 1 to m so that:

  * for each color from 1 to m there is at least one element of this color; 
  * each element is colored and colored exactly one color; 
  * the greatest common divisor of any two elements that are colored the same color is greater than 1, i.e. \gcd(a_i, a_j)>1 for each pair i, j if these elements are colored the same color. 



Note that equal elements can be colored different colors — you just have to choose one of m colors for each of the indices from 1 to n.

Alice showed already that if all a_i ≤ 1000 then she can always solve the task by choosing some m ≤ 11.

Help Alice to find the required coloring. Note that you don't have to minimize or maximize the number of colors, you just have to find the solution with some m from 1 to 11.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the amount of numbers in a sequence a.

The second line of the test case contains n composite integers a_1,a_2,…,a_n (4 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^4.

Output

For each test case print 2 lines. The first line should contain a single integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 11) — the number of used colors. Consider colors to be numbered from 1 to m. The second line should contain any coloring that satisfies the above conditions. Print n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n (1 ≤ c_i ≤ m), where c_i is the color of the i-th element. If there are multiple solutions then you can print any of them. Note that you don't have to minimize or maximize the number of colors, you just have to find the solution with some m from 1 to 11.

Remember that each color from 1 to m should be used at least once. Any two elements of the same color should not be coprime (i.e. their GCD should be greater than 1).

2 1
11
4 7 8 10 7 3 10 7 7 8 3 1 1 5 5 9 2 2 3 3 4 11 6

Note

In the first test case, \gcd(6,10)=2, \gcd(6,15)=3 and \gcd(10,15)=5. Therefore, it's valid to color all elements the same color. Note that there are other colorings which satisfy Alice's requirement in this test case.

In the second test case there is only one element of each color, so the coloring definitely satisfies Alice's requirement.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, followed by t test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), followed by a list of n composite integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (4 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns the integer value 't', which represents the number of test cases.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000 for each test case, and a_i is a composite integer such that 4 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000 for each a_i in the sequence. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
def func_2():
    return input()
    #The program returns the input provided by the user, which is a sequence of composite integers a_i with values ranging from 4 to 1000, and the number of integers n that is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 1000 for each test case.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function does not take any input parameters. It is intended to process multiple test cases, each consisting of a sequence of composite integers where the number of integers in each sequence (n) ranges from 1 to 1000, and each integer (a_i) is a composite number between 4 and 1000. The total number of integers across all test cases does not exceed 10,000.
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing integers parsed from the input sequence of composite integers, where each integer is between 4 and 1000.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases; for each test case, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) representing the number of composite integers in the sequence; and a is a list of n composite integers where each integer a_i satisfies 4 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
def func_4():
    return list(func_3())
    #The program returns a list generated by func_3() based on the composite integers provided in the test cases. Each composite integer a_i satisfies 4 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000, and the total number of composite integers across all test cases does not exceed 10^4.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function does not take any input parameters. It will handle multiple test cases where each test case consists of a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) indicating the number of composite integers followed by a sequence of n composite integers (4 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000). The total number of integers across all test cases will not exceed 10^4.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000), and y is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) followed by a list of n composite integers a_i (4 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000). The total number of composite integers across all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
def func_6(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is a list with at least one tuple containing an integer n followed by a list of n composite integers a_i; `y` is the remainder of the last valid integer division of the previous value of `x` by the previous value of `y` until y is empty.
    return x
    #The program returns the list x which contains at least one tuple with an integer n followed by a list of n composite integers a_i

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function does not take any parameters.

The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
