You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A positive integer is called composite if it can be represented as a product of two positive integers, both greater than 1. For example, the following numbers are composite: 6, 4, 120, 27. The following numbers aren't: 1, 2, 3, 17, 97.

Alice is given a sequence of n composite numbers a_1,a_2,…,a_n.

She wants to choose an integer m ≤ 11 and color each element one of m colors from 1 to m so that:

  * for each color from 1 to m there is at least one element of this color; 
  * each element is colored and colored exactly one color; 
  * the greatest common divisor of any two elements that are colored the same color is greater than 1, i.e. \gcd(a_i, a_j)>1 for each pair i, j if these elements are colored the same color. 



Note that equal elements can be colored different colors — you just have to choose one of m colors for each of the indices from 1 to n.

Alice showed already that if all a_i ≤ 1000 then she can always solve the task by choosing some m ≤ 11.

Help Alice to find the required coloring. Note that you don't have to minimize or maximize the number of colors, you just have to find the solution with some m from 1 to 11.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the amount of numbers in a sequence a.

The second line of the test case contains n composite integers a_1,a_2,…,a_n (4 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^4.

Output

For each test case print 2 lines. The first line should contain a single integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 11) — the number of used colors. Consider colors to be numbered from 1 to m. The second line should contain any coloring that satisfies the above conditions. Print n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n (1 ≤ c_i ≤ m), where c_i is the color of the i-th element. If there are multiple solutions then you can print any of them. Note that you don't have to minimize or maximize the number of colors, you just have to find the solution with some m from 1 to 11.

Remember that each color from 1 to m should be used at least once. Any two elements of the same color should not be coprime (i.e. their GCD should be greater than 1).

Note

In the first test case, \gcd(6,10)=2, \gcd(6,15)=3 and \gcd(10,15)=5. Therefore, it's valid to color all elements the same color. Note that there are other colorings which satisfy Alice's requirement in this test case.

In the second test case there is only one element of each color, so the coloring definitely satisfies Alice's requirement.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, followed by t test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), followed by a list of n composite integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (4 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns the integer value 't', which represents the number of test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns an integer value 't' that represents the number of test cases, which is read from input. There are no checks for input validity, so if the input is not a valid integer, it may raise an error.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000 for each test case, and a_i is a composite integer such that 4 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000 for each a_i in the sequence. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
def func_2():
    return input()
    #The program returns the input provided by the user, which is a sequence of composite integers a_i with values ranging from 4 to 1000, and the number of integers n that is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 1000 for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts user input, which is expected to be a sequence of composite integers (each between 4 and 1000) followed by a positive integer `n` (between 1 and 1000) for each test case. The function returns this input as a string, but it does not validate whether the input adheres to the specified constraints. Therefore, it could potentially return invalid input if the user does not follow the expected format.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function does not take any input parameters. It is intended to process multiple test cases, each consisting of a sequence of composite integers where the number of integers in each sequence (n) ranges from 1 to 1000, and each integer (a_i) is a composite number between 4 and 1000. The total number of integers across all test cases does not exceed 10,000.
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing integers parsed from the input sequence of composite integers, where each integer is between 4 and 1000.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns a map object containing integers parsed from an input sequence of integers. The integers are expected to be composite numbers ranging from 4 to 1000, but the function does not validate this. It relies on the user to provide valid input, and does not handle cases where the input might contain non-composite numbers or be empty.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases; for each test case, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) representing the number of composite integers in the sequence; and a is a list of n composite integers where each integer a_i satisfies 4 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
def func_4():
    return list(func_3())
    #The program returns a list generated by func_3() based on the composite integers provided in the test cases. Each composite integer a_i satisfies 4 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000, and the total number of composite integers across all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases and generates a list by calling `func_3()`, which processes a list of composite integers for each test case. However, the function does not directly handle the input parameters `n` and the list of composite integers `a`, as these are likely managed within `func_3()`. The function returns a list based on the output of `func_3()`, but the specifics of how the list is generated and the handling of composite integers are not defined in the provided code.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function does not take any input parameters. It will handle multiple test cases where each test case consists of a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) indicating the number of composite integers followed by a sequence of n composite integers (4 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000). The total number of integers across all test cases will not exceed 10^4.
def func_5():
    sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
    sys.stdout = open('output.txt', 'w')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and sets up the environment to read from 'input.txt' and write to 'output.txt', intending to handle multiple test cases of composite integers, but it does not contain any logic for processing those integers. The function only prepares the input and output streams without implementing any functionality related to the actual processing of the composite integers as described in the annotations.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000), and y is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) followed by a list of n composite integers a_i (4 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000). The total number of composite integers across all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
def func_6(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is a list with at least one tuple containing an integer n followed by a list of n composite integers a_i; `y` is the remainder of the last valid integer division of the previous value of `x` by the previous value of `y` until y is empty.
    return x
    #The program returns the list x which contains at least one tuple with an integer n followed by a list of n composite integers a_i
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `x` and a list `y` of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` composite integers. The function performs a calculation involving the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the integers in the list, but incorrectly modifies `x` and `y` in the process. The function ultimately returns `x`, which is expected to be a list containing at least one tuple with an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` composite integers, but the actual returned value may not reflect the original input structure properly due to the variable reassignment in the loop. Thus, the function does not correctly maintain the integrity of its inputs and can lead to unexpected results.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function does not take any parameters. It is assumed to handle multiple test cases where each test case consists of a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) followed by n composite integers a_i (4 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000), and the total number of integers across all test cases does not exceed 10^4.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases of composite integers where for each integer, it checks divisibility by specific primes (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31) and keeps track of unique counts for each divisor. It generates a list `l` that contains unique indices corresponding to the first occurrence of each divisor category for the integers processed. After processing, the function calls `func_8` with the maximum value from `l` and with all values from `l`. It does not return any output directly to the caller, but it interacts with `func_8` for further processing. Additionally, there are no explicit checks for edge cases where `n` might be 0, as the loop assumes `n` is always a positive integer based on the context provided.

The function prints the elements of `args` to a specified output stream, separated by a specified separator, followed by an optional end character. It does not return any value. The function does not process the test cases or composite integers beyond printing them, meaning the annotations regarding logic for handling test cases are inaccurate.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
