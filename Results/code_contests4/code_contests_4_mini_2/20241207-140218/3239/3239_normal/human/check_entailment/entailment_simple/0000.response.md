Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here are the main issues:

1. **Coloring Logic**: The program attempts to color composite numbers based on their divisibility by specific primes (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31). While this may work for some composite numbers, it does not guarantee that all composite numbers can be colored according to the rules specified. Specifically, it does not ensure that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of any two elements that are colored the same is greater than 1. For example, if two composite numbers share no common prime factors, they would be colored the same, violating the GCD condition.

2. **Single Color Usage**: In some cases, the program may color all composite numbers with the same color, but it may not use all the colors from 1 to m, violating the requirement that every color must be represented at least once.

3. **Output Format**: The program's output format does not align with the expected output. The problem description specifies that the output should include the number of colors used followed by the coloring. The function `func_8()` does not seem to return the correct output format required.

4. **Multiple Test Cases**: The implementation of handling multiple test cases through `func_7()` may be flawed since it does not properly manage the output for each test case in a way that adheres to the specified output format.

In summary, the provided program fails to meet the problem requirements regarding both the correctness of the coloring scheme and the format of the output, resulting in its incorrectness.
