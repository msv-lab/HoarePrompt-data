The function accepts user input, which is expected to be a sequence of composite integers (each between 4 and 1000) followed by a positive integer `n` (between 1 and 1000) for each test case. The function returns this input as a string, but it does not validate whether the input adheres to the specified constraints. Therefore, it could potentially return invalid input if the user does not follow the expected format.
