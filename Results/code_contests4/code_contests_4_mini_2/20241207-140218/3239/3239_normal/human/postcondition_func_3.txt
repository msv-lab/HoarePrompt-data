The function accepts a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases and generates a list by calling `func_3()`, which processes a list of composite integers for each test case. However, the function does not directly handle the input parameters `n` and the list of composite integers `a`, as these are likely managed within `func_3()`. The function returns a list based on the output of `func_3()`, but the specifics of how the list is generated and the handling of composite integers are not defined in the provided code.
