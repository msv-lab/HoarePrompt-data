The function accepts a variable-length argument list `args`, where the first element is an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by pairs of integers indicating the number of composite integers and their respective lists. The function prints the elements of `args` to a specified output stream, separated by a specified separator, followed by an optional end character. It does not return any value. The function does not process the test cases or composite integers beyond printing them, meaning the annotations regarding logic for handling test cases are inaccurate.
