The input consists of a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, followed by t test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), followed by a list of n composite integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (4 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
