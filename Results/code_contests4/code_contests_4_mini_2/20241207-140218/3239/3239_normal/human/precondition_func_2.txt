The function does not take any input parameters. It is intended to process multiple test cases, each consisting of a sequence of composite integers where the number of integers in each sequence (n) ranges from 1 to 1000, and each integer (a_i) is a composite number between 4 and 1000. The total number of integers across all test cases does not exceed 10,000.
