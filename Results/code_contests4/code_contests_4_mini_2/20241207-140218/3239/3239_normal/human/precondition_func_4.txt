The function does not take any input parameters. It will handle multiple test cases where each test case consists of a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) indicating the number of composite integers followed by a sequence of n composite integers (4 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000). The total number of integers across all test cases will not exceed 10^4.
