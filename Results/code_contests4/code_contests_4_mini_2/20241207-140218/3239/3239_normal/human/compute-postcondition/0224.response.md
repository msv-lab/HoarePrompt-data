The value of `f[3]` is incremented by 1. This changes the state of `f[3]`, but the values of `n`, `i`, `j`, and `g[3]` remain unchanged. The effect of the increment on `f[3]` could influence the subsequent conditional statements, but since we are only executing the current line of code, we will reflect only the change to `f[3]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `f[3]` is increased by 1, `j` remains unchanged, and `g[3]` remains unchanged.**
