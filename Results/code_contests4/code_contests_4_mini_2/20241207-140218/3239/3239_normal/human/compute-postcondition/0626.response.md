The value of `j` is incremented by 1, and since its initial value is 0, the new value of `j` will be 1. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is an empty list, `j` is 1, `g` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the value returned from `func_4()`, `f` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `i` is 0, the value of `a[i]` is an odd number, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, `a[i]` is divisible by 11, and `f[5]` is false.
