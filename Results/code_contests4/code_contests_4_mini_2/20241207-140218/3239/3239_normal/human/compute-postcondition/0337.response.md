The code `l.append(g[5])` appends the value of `g[5]` to the list `l`. Given that `g` is a list of twelve 0's, the value of `g[5]` is 0. Therefore, after executing this code, the list `l` will now contain one element, which is 0.

The other variables remain unaffected, so the output state reflects the updated state of `l`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `l` is a list containing one 0, `f` is a list of twelve 0's, `g` is a list of twelve 0's, `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is odd, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, the element `a[i]` is divisible by 11, and the element `f[5]` is 0.**
