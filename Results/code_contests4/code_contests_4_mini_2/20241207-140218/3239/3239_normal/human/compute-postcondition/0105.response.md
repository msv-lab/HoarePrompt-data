Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, the first element of `a` is an odd integer not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, or 23, and is divisible by 29. If `f[10]` is true, then `l` includes the value of `g[10]`. If `f[10]` is false, then `j` is increased by 1, `j` is appended to the list `l`, and `g[10]` is updated to the new value of `j`.***
