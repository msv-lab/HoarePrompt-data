Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is odd. If `a[i]` is divisible by 3, then `j` is either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `f[2]`; if `f[2]` is true, then `l` is [0], otherwise `l` is [1]. `f` remains a list of twelve 0's, `g` is a list of twelve 0's with a 1 at index 2 if `f[2]` is false, and `f[2]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 3 but is divisible by 5, then `j` is set to 1, `l` becomes [1], `g` is updated to [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `f` remains unchanged, and `f[3]` is now 1. Otherwise, if `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, or 23, then `j` can be 0 or 1, `l` can be [0] or [1], and the other variables remain unchanged. If `a[i]` is divisible by 7, then `f` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `j` is 1, `l` is [1], and `g[4]` is set to 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 11, then `f[5]` is set to 1, `j` is updated to 1, `l` contains 1, and `g[5]` is updated to 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 13, then `j` remains 0, `l` is updated to [0], and the other variables remain unchanged. If `f[6]` is truthy, then `j` is set to 1, `l` is updated to [1], and `g[6]` is updated to 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 17, then the values of `j`, `l`, and `g[7]` depend on `f[7]`. If `a[i]` is divisible by 19, then `f[8]` is set to true, `j` is reset to 0, and `l` is updated to [0]. If `a[i]` is divisible by 23, then `j` can be 0 or 1, `l` can be [0] or [1], and `f[9]` is set to 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 29, then `f[10]` is set to 1, `j` remains 0, and `l` is updated to [0]. If `a[i]` is divisible by 31, then `j` can be 0 or 1, `l` can be [0] or [1], `f[11]` is set to 1, and `g[11]` is updated to 1, while `i` remains 0 and `a[i]` retains its properties.***
