The code `l.append(j)` appends the value of `j`, which is 1, to the list `l`. Since `l` is initially an empty list, after executing this code, `l` will contain the single element `[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `l` is now [1], `f` is a list of twelve 0's, `g` is a list of twelve 0's, `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is odd, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is divisible by 5, and the fourth element of `f` is 0.
