The variable `l` is affected by the operation `l.append(g[3])`, which appends the value of `g[3]` to the list `l`. The initial state indicates that `f[3]` evaluates to true, but does not provide information about `g`, so we cannot determine the value of `g[3]`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `a`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the action taken.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, the first element of `a` is an odd integer, the first element of `a` is not divisible by 3, the first element of `a` is divisible by 5, `f[3]` evaluates to true, and `g[3]` is appended to `l`.**
