Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0. If `f[10]` is true, then `j` remains 0, `l` is updated to [0], and all other variables retain their initial states. Otherwise, `j` is set to 1, `l` is updated to [1], `g` is updated such that `g[10]` is now 1, and all other variables still maintain their initial conditions, with `f[10]` being 0. In both cases, `i` is still 0, the element `a[i]` is odd, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and is divisible by 29.***
