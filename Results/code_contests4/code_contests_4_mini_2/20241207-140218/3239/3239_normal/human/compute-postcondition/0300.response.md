`l` is a list that is being modified by appending the value of `j`, which is 1. After this operation, `l` will contain the value 1. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `l` is now a list containing 1, `f` is a list of twelve 0's, `g` is a list of twelve 0's, `i` is 0, the `i`-th element of `a` is even, and the second element of `f` is 0.
