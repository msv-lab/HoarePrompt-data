The code `l.append(g[7])` appends the value of `g[7]` to the list `l`. Given the initial state, `g` is a list of twelve 0's, which means `g[7]` is 0. Therefore, when the code is executed, 0 is added to the empty list `l`. 

The output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `l` is now a list containing one element, which is 0, `f` is a list of twelve 0's, `g` is a list of twelve 0's, `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is odd, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, `a[i]` is not divisible by 11, `a[i]` is not divisible by 13, `a[i]` is divisible by 17, and `f[7]` is true (non-zero).

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `l` is [0], `f` is a list of twelve 0's, `g` is a list of twelve 0's, `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is odd, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, `a[i]` is not divisible by 11, `a[i]` is not divisible by 13, `a[i]` is divisible by 17, and `f[7]` is true (non-zero).**
