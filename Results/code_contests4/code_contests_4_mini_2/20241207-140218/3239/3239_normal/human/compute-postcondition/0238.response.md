The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown. The variable `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, which allows the loop to execute a second time, but it does not affect the value of `j`. The variable `i` remains at 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `j` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `j` is increased by 1**
