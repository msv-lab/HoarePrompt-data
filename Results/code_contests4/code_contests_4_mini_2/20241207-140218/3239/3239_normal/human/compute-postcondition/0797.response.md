Postcondition: ***`l` can be determined based on the value of `a[2]`. If `f[3]` is true, then `l` is updated to include `g[3]`, and `j` can be either 0 or 1, with potential updates to `f` and `g`. `i` remains 2, and for the loop to execute a third time, `n` must be greater than 2. If `f[3]` is false, then `l` is determined based on the value of `a[2]`, `j` can again be either 0 or 1, `i` remains 2, `n` must still be greater than 2, and `g[3]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
