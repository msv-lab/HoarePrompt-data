Postcondition: ***`l` can be either [0] or [1]. If `f[10]` is true, then `g[10]` is unknown, and the state of `l` remains either [0] or [1]. If `f[10]` is false, then `l` can be either [0, 1] or [1, 2]; `j` can be either 1 or 2; `g[10]` is either 1 or 2; `f` remains [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]; and `i` is still 1.***
