The value of `f[4]` is incremented by 1. Since `f` is either `[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` if `f[4]` is true, or `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` otherwise, we can conclude that the initial value of `f[4]` must have been 1 (true) based on the initial state. Therefore, the new value of `f[4]` becomes 2. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`l` is either [0] or [1], `j` is either 0 or 1, `g` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the value returned from `func_4()`, `f` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `i` is 0, the value of `a[i]` is an odd number, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, and `a[i]` is divisible by 7.**
