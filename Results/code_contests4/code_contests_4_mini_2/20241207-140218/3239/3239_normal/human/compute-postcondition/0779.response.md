Postcondition: ***If `a[i]` is even, then `l` can be either [0, g[1]] or [1, g[1]] if `f[1]` is true, and `j` can be either 0 or 1, while `g[1]` is updated based on `j`. If `f[1]` is false, then `l` can be either [0] or [1], and `g[1]` is set to the value of `j` (either 1 or 2), and `f[1]` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is odd, then if `a[i]` is divisible by 3, `f` becomes [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]; `l` can take values [0], [1], [0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 1], or [1, 2], with `j` being either 1 or 2, and `g[2]` is set to `j`. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 3 but divisible by 5, `l` can be either [0, g[3]] or [1, g[3]], with `j` still being either 0 or 1, `g` updated accordingly, `f` becomes [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], and `i` remains 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 5 but divisible by 7, then `l` can be [0, 0] or [1, 0], and `f` is updated to [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], with `i` still being 1. If `a[i]` is neither divisible by 5 nor 7, and if `f[5]` is true, `l` can be either [0, g[5]] or [1, g[5]]. Otherwise, possible values for `l` include [0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 1], or [1, 2] with `j` being either 1 or 2. If `a[i]` is divisible by 13, `l` can be either [0] or [1] depending on `f[6]`, resulting in `f` being updated to [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] while `i` stays 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 17, then `f` updates to [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], allowing `l` to be [0] or [1] with `g[7]`, and `j` can still be either 1 or 2. If `a[i]` is divisible by 19, `f` updates to [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], and `l` can be [0, g[8]] or [1, g[8]]. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 19 but divisible by 23, `f` updates to [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], and `l` can be [0, 0] or [1, 0], with `j` being either 0 or 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 23 but divisible by 29, `f[10]` can take values 1 or 2, with `j` either 1 or 2 and `g[10]` being either 1 or 2. Finally, if `a[i]` is divisible by 31, `l` can be either [0, g[11]] or [1, g[11]], with `f[11]` true, `j` can be either 0 or 1, while `i` remains 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 31, `l` remains unchanged.***
