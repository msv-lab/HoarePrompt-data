Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1 and `i` is 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 11, then `f[5]` is increased by 1, while `j`, `l`, and `g[5]` remain unchanged. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 11, and `a[i]` is divisible by 13, then `f[6]` is incremented by 1, with `j`, `l`, and `g[6]` unchanged. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 13 and is divisible by 17, then `f[7]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 17 and is divisible by 19, then `f[8]` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 19 and is divisible by 23, then `f[9]` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 23 but is divisible by 29, then `f[10]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 31, then `f[11]` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `f[11]` remains unchanged.***
