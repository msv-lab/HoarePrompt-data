Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, and the first element of `a` is an odd integer not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, or 17, and divisible by 19. If `f[8]` is true, then `g[8]` has been appended to `l`. Otherwise, if `f[8]` is false, `j` is increased by 1, `l` has the new value of `j` appended to it, and `g[8]` is now equal to the updated value of `j`.***
