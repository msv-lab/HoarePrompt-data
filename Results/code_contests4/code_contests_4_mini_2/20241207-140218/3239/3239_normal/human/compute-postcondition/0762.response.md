`f[10]` is incremented by 1. The previous state of `f[10]` could be either 0 or 1, which means after the increment, `f[10]` will be either 1 or 2. The state of `l`, `j`, `g[10]`, and `i` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` can be either [0] or [1]; `f[10]` is either 1 or 2; `j` can be either 1 or 2; `g[10]` is either 1 or 2; `i` is 1.

Output State: **`l` can be either [0] or [1]; `f[10]` is either 1 or 2; `j` can be either 1 or 2; `g[10]` is either 1 or 2; `i` is 1**
