The code attempts to append the value of `g[9]` to the list `l`. However, the initial state does not provide information about the list `l` or the list `g`. Since we do not know the contents of `g` or if `g` has at least 10 elements (to access index 9), we cannot determine the outcome of this operation. Therefore, the output state will indicate that the operation cannot be performed due to the lack of information.

Output State: **`l` is undefined, `g` is undefined, and the operation cannot be completed**
