Postcondition: ***`l` can be determined based on the value of `a[2]`. If `f[8]` is true, `l` is updated by appending `g[8]`. If `f[8]` is false, `j` can be either 1 or 2, `j` is appended to `l`, and `g[8]` is assigned the value of `j`. In both cases, `f` and `g` may be updated accordingly, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2.***
