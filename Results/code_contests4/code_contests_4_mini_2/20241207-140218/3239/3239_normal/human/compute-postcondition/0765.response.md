The value of `j` can either be 1 or 2, and `l` can be either [0] or [1]. When executing `l.append(j)`, `j` will be appended to the list `l`. Therefore, if `l` is [0], it will become [0, j], which could be either [0, 1] or [0, 2]. If `l` is [1], it will become [1, j], which could be either [1, 1] or [1, 2]. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`l` can be either [0, 1] or [0, 2] or [1, 1] or [1, 2]; `j` is either 1 or 2; `g` is based on the conditions stated; `f` is [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]; `i` is 1; `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute a second time.**
