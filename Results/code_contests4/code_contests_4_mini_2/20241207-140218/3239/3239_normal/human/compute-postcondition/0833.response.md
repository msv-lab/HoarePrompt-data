Postcondition: ***`l` can be determined based on the value of `a[2]`. If `f[9]` is true, `l` now includes the value of `g[9]` appended to it, `j` can be either 0 or 1, `f` and `g` may be updated accordingly, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2. Otherwise, `l` can still be determined based on the value of `a[2]`, `j` can be either 1 or 2, and `g[9]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
