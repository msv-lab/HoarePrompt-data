According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute while `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2, which must be less than `n` for the loop to run again.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2.**
