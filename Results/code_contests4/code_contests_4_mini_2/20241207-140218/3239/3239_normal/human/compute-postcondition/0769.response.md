Postcondition: ***`l` can be either [0, g[11]] or [1, g[11]] if `a[i] % 31 == 0`. In this case, `f[11]` is true, `j` can be either 0 or 1, `g` is based on the conditions stated, `f` is [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], and `i` is 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 31, the condition does not hold, and `l` remains unchanged.***
