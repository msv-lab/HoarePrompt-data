The variable `at_start` is assigned the value `True`. The values of `sep` and `file` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is the value of kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), `file` is the value of kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout), `at_start` is True.

Output State: **`sep` is the value of kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), `file` is the value of kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout), `at_start` is True**
