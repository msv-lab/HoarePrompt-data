The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` can either be 0 or 1. This means after execution, `j` will be either 1 or 2. The states of the other variables (`l`, `g`, `f`, `i`, `n`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` can be either [0] or [1]; `j` can be either 1 or 2; `g` is based on the conditions stated; `f` is [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]; `i` is 1; and for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1.
