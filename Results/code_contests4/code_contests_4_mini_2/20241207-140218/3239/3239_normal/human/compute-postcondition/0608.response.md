In the provided code, `g[3]` is assigned the value of `j`. The initial state shows that `j` is 1. Therefore, after the execution, `g[3]` will be updated to 1. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`l` is [1], `j` is 1, `g` is [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the value returned from `func_4()`, `f` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `i` is 0, the value of `a[i]` is an odd number, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is divisible by 5, and `f[3]` is 0 (or false)**.
