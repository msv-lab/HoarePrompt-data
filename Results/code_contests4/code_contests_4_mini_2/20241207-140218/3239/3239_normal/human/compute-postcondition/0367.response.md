The code snippet appends the value of `g[8]` to the list `l`. Since the initial state indicates that `g` is a list of twelve 0's, the value of `g[8]` is 0. Therefore, after execution, the list `l` will have one element, which is 0. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `l` is [0], `f` is a list of twelve 0's, `g` is a list of twelve 0's, `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is odd, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, `a[i]` is not divisible by 11, `a[i]` is not divisible by 13, `a[i]` is not divisible by 17, `a[i]` is divisible by 19, and the element `f[8]` is true (not 0)**.
