The code `l.append(g[7])` appends the value found at index 7 of the list `g` to the list `l`. The variable `l` can be determined based on the value of `a[2]`, but its exact content is not specified. The variable `g` is referenced, and it is assumed that it has at least 8 elements (since indexing starts at 0). The states of `j`, `f`, and `g` are not directly impacted by this line of code. 

Thus, the output state will reflect that `g[7]` has been appended to `l`, but without explicit values for `g` or `l`, we cannot specify their exact states. 

Output State: **`l` has a new element appended from `g[7]`, `j` can be either 0 or 1, `f` and `g` may be updated accordingly, `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be greater than 2**.
