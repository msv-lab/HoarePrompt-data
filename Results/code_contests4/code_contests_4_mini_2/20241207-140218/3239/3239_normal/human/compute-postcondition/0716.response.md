The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown (it can be either 0 or 1). Therefore, the new value of `j` can either be 1 or 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`l` can be either [0] or [1]; `j` can be either 1 or 2; `g` is based on the conditions stated; `f` is [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]; `i` is 1.**
