`l` is updated by appending the value of `j` to it. Since `l` can either be [0] or [1], after appending `j`, the possible outcomes for `l` will be [0, 1] if `j` is 1 or [1, 2] if `j` is 2. The other variables (`g`, `f`, and `i`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` can be either [0, 1] or [1, 2]; `j` can be either 1 or 2; `g` is based on the conditions stated; `f` is [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]; `i` is 1.

Output State: **`l` can be either [0, 1] or [1, 2]; `j` can be either 1 or 2; `g` is based on the conditions stated; `f` is [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]; `i` is 1**.
