The value of `f[1]` is incremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `f[1]` is true, which means the condition for appending from `g[1]` to `l` is satisfied. Therefore, `l` will have an element appended from `g[1]`, but the values of `j` and `g[1]` remain unchanged since the else condition is not executed. The output state reflects the updated value of `f[1]` and the unchanged states of `j`, `g[1]`, and `l`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `f[1]` is incremented by 1, `j` is unchanged, `g[1]` is unchanged, `l` has an element appended from `g[1]`.**
