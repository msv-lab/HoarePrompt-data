The value of `g[1]` is assigned the value of `j`. The previous value of `j` is not explicitly given, but it is known that `j` has been increased by 1. The output state indicates that `g[1]` now holds the incremented value of `j`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `l` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1, `l` has `j` appended to it, and `g[1]` is now equal to `j`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1, `l` has `j` appended to it, and `g[1]` is now equal to `j`.**
