`l` is a list that has `j` appended to it. The value of `j` has been increased by 1, but its specific value is not provided. Therefore, `j` could be any integer greater than or equal to 1. The initial values for `n` and `i` do not affect the operation of appending to the list. Hence, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1, and `l` now contains the new value of `j`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1, and `l` now contains the new value of `j`.**
