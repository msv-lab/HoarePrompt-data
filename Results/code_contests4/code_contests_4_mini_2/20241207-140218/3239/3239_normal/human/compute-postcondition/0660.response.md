Output State: **`l` is a list that will be [0] if `f[8]` is true (non-zero), and it will be [1] if `f[8]` is false (0). `j` is 0 if `f[8]` is true and 1 if `f[8]` is false. The list `g` is updated to [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0] if `f[8]` is false, while remaining unchanged as [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] if `f[8]` is true. `f[8]` is incremented by 1.**
