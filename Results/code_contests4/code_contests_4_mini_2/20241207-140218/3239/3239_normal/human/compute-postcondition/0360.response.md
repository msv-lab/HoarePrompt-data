The code `l.append(j)` appends the value of `j` to the list `l`. The initial value of `j` is 1, and since `l` is initially an empty list, after executing this line, `l` will contain the single element `[1]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `l` is [1], `f` is a list of twelve 0's, `g` is a list of twelve 0's, `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is odd, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, `a[i]` is not divisible by 11, `a[i]` is not divisible by 13, and `a[i]` is divisible by 17, and the 8th element of `f` (i.e., `f[7]`) is 0.
