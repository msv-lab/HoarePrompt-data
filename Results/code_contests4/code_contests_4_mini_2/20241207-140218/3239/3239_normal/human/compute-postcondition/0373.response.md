The code `f[8] += 1` increments the value at index 8 of the list or array `f` by 1. 

Given the initial state:
- If `f[8]` is true (which means `f[8]` is non-zero), then `j` remains 0, `l` is updated to [0], and all other variables remain unchanged.
- If `f[8]` is false (which means `f[8]` is 0), then `j` is updated to 1, `l` is updated to [1], and `g[8]` is updated to 1, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Since the operation `f[8] += 1` will change `f[8]` from either 0 to 1 or from a positive value to a higher positive value, we can deduce that `f[8]` becomes true after this operation.

Therefore, after executing `f[8] += 1`, the condition `f[8]` is true, leading to the first case where:
- `j` remains 0
- `l` is updated to [0]

The variables `g`, `i`, and `a[i]` stay unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `f[8]` is true; `j` is 0; `l` is [0]; `g`, `i`, and `a[i]` remain unchanged.**
