Postcondition: ***`l` is either [0] or [1]. If `f[6]` is true (non-zero), then `l` is set to [0], `j` remains 0, and `g` remains [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. If `f[6]` is false (zero), then `l` is set to [1], `j` is increased to 1, and `g` is updated to [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], while `n` remains greater than 0, `a` is the value returned from `func_4()`, `f` remains [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], and `i` is 0, with the value of `a[i]` being an odd number that is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, or 11, and is divisible by 13.***
