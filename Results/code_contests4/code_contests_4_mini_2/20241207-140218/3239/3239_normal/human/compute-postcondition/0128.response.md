According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the integer `n`. Since `i` is currently 0 and `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, the loop can execute again as long as `i` remains less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1. The loop can execute again as long as `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1**
