The value of `j` is increased by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown. The list `l` is updated by appending the new value of `j`. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `j` and the action of appending it to the list `l`. The values of `n` and `i` are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2; `j` is increased by 1, and `j` is appended to the list `l`.**
