`g[1]` is assigned the value of `j`, which is 1. The previous value of `g[1]` was 0, so after execution, `g[1]` will now be 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is [1], `j` is 1, `g` is [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the value returned from `func_4()`, `f` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is even, and `f[1]` is false.
Output State: **`l` is [1], `j` is 1, `g` is [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the value returned from `func_4()`, `f` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is even, and `f[1]` is false.**
