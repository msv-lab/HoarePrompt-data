The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is 0, so after execution, `j` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is an empty list, `j` is 1, `g` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the value returned from `func_4()`, `f` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `i` is 0, the value of `a[i]` is an odd number, `a[i]` is divisible by 3, and `f[2]` is 0 (or evaluates to false).

Output State: **`l` is an empty list, `j` is 1, `g` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the value returned from `func_4()`, `f` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `i` is 0, the value of `a[i]` is an odd number, `a[i]` is divisible by 3, and `f[2]` is 0 (or evaluates to false)**.
