The code assigns the value of `j` to the last element of the list `g`, which is `g[11]`. The initial value of `j` is 1, so after execution, `g[11]` will be updated to 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `l` is [1], `f` is a list of twelve 0's, `g` is a list of eleven 0's followed by 1, `i` is 0, and the last element of `f` (i.e., `f[11]`) is 0.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `l` is [1], `f` is a list of twelve 0's, `g` is a list of eleven 0's followed by 1, `i` is 0, and the last element of `f` (i.e., `f[11]`) is 0.**
