The value of `f[3]` is incremented by 1, changing it from 1 to 2. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` can be either [0, g[3]] or [1, g[3]] when `f[3]` is True, while `j` can be either 0 or 1, `g` is based on the conditions stated, `f` is [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], and `i` is 1.
