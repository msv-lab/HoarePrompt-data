Postcondition: ***`l` can be either [0, 0] or [1, 0]; `j` can be either 0 or 1; `g` is based on the conditions stated; `f` is [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]; `i` is 1 if `f[4]` is True. If `f[4]` is False, then `l` can be either [0, 1] or [1, 2]; `j` can be either 1 or 2; `g[4]` is assigned either 1 or 2; `f` remains [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]; `i` is still 1.***
