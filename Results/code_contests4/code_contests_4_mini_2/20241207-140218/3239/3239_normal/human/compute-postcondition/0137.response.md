The code `l.append(j)` adds the current value of `j` to the list `l`. The value of `j` has been previously stated to be increased by 1, but the specific value of `j` is not provided. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, and we do not have information about the state of the list `l` prior to this operation.

Since `j` has been increased by 1, it will hold a value greater than its initial state, but we cannot specify an exact value without knowing its previous state.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is increased by 1, and `j` is appended to list `l`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is increased by 1, and `j` is appended to list `l`.**
