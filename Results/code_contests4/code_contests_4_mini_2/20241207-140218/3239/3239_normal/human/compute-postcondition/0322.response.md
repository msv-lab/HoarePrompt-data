Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, if the fourth element of `f` is truthy, then `j` remains 0, `l` is [0], and `g` is a list of twelve 0's. Otherwise, `j` is 1, `l` is now [1], `g` is updated to [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], while `f` remains a list of twelve 0's, and `i` is still 0. The element `a[i]` is odd, not divisible by 3, and divisible by 5 in both cases.***
