The list `l` can either be [0] or [1], and `j` can either be 1 or 2. The code `l.append(j)` will add the value of `j` to the end of the list `l`. 

If `l` is [0], the possibilities after appending `j` are:
- If `j` is 1, then `l` becomes [0, 1].
- If `j` is 2, then `l` becomes [0, 2].

If `l` is [1], the possibilities after appending `j` are:
- If `j` is 1, then `l` becomes [1, 1].
- If `j` is 2, then `l` becomes [1, 2].

Thus, the output state reflects the possible new states of `l` based on the initial values.

Output State: **`l` can be either [0, 1] or [0, 2] or [1, 1] or [1, 2]; `j` can be either 1 or 2; `g` is based on the conditions stated; `f` is [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]; `i` is 1**
