Postcondition: ***Given that `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 1, if `a[i]` is divisible by 11, then `f[5]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `a[i]` is divisible by 13, then `f[6]` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 13 but is divisible by 17, then `f[7]` is greater than its previous value. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 17 but is divisible by 19, then `f[8]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 23, then `f[9]` is updated by adding 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 29, then `f[10]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 31 but not by 29, then `f[11]` is increased by 1; if `f[11]` was previously false, `j` is increased by 1, `l` is updated to include the new value of `j`, and `g[11]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
