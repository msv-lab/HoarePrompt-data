Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `j` is either 0 or 1, `l` is either [0] or [1], `f` is a list of twelve 0's, `g` is a list of twelve 0's, with `g[7]` being 1 if `f[7]` was true, otherwise remains unchanged, `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is odd, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, or 13, and `a[i]` is divisible by 17. If `f[7]` is true, then `j` remains 0 and `l` is updated to [0]. Otherwise, `j` is set to 1 and `l` is updated to [1].***
