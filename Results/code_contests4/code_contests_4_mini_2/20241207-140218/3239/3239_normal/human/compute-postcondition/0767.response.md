Postcondition: ***`l` can either be [0, g[11]] or [1, g[11]] if `f[11]` is true, with `j` being either 0 or 1, `g` based on the conditions stated, `f` being [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], and `i` is 1. If `f[11]` is false, then `l` can either be [0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 1], or [1, 2]; `j` is either 1 or 2; `g` is based on the conditions stated; `f` remains [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]; `i` is 1; `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute a second time, and `g[11]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
