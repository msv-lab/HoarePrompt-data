Postcondition: ***`l` is a list, `j` is an integer, `g` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the value returned from `func_4()`, `f` is a list of integers, `i` is 0, the value of `a[i]` is an odd number, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, `a[i]` is divisible by 11. If `f[5]` is true, then `l` is [0], `j` is 0, and `g` remains [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Otherwise, if `f[5]` is false, then `l` is [1], `j` is 1, and `g` is updated to [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].***
