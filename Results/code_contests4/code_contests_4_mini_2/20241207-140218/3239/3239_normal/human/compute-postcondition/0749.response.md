Postcondition: ***If `f[8]` is true, then `l` can be either [0, g[8]] or [1, g[8]], `j` can be either 0 or 1, `g` is as defined by the conditions stated, `f` remains [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], and `i` is 1. If `f[8]` is false, then `l` can be either [0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 1], or [1, 2]; `j` can be either 1 or 2; `g` is modified to either [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0] or [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]; `f` remains [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], and `i` is 1.***
