The code `l.append(j)` appends the value of `j` (which is 1) to the list `l`. The previous state of `l` is an empty list, so after executing the code, `l` will contain the single element 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is [1], `j` is 1, `g` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the value returned from `func_4()`, `f` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `i` is 0, the value of `a[i]` is an odd number, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, `a[i]` is divisible by 7, and `f[4]` is 0.
