Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `j` is the count of unique integers added to `g`, `l` contains the values corresponding to the unique integers encountered from `a`, `f` indicates the count of how many times each condition was met (f[1] for even, f[2] for divisible by 3, etc.), `g` contains the unique values associated with each condition (if they were encountered at least once), and the function `func_8` is called with the maximum value of `l`.**
