The code `l.append(g[11])` appends the value of `g[11]` to the list `l`. From the initial state, `g` is defined as `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, so `g[11]` is `0`. The list `l` starts as an empty list. After executing the code, `l` will contain one element, which is `0`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is [0], `j` is 0, `g` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the value returned from `func_4()`, `f` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `i` is 0, the value of `a[i]` is an odd number, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, `a[i]` is not divisible by 11, `a[i]` is not divisible by 13, `a[i]` is not divisible by 17, `a[i]` is not divisible by 19, `a[i]` is not divisible by 23, `a[i]` is not divisible by 29, `a[i]` is divisible by 31, and `f[11]` is true.**
