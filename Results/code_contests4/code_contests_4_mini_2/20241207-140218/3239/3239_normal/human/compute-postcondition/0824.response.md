In this case, the value of `j` is incremented by 1. Since `j` can be either 0 or 1, after the execution of the code, `j` will therefore be either 1 or 2. The other variables `l`, `f`, `g`, and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`l` can be determined based on the value of `a[2]`, `j` can be either 1 or 2, `f` and `g` may be updated accordingly, `i` is 2**
