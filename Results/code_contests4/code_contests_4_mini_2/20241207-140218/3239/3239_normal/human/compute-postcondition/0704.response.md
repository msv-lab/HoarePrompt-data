The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is either 0 or 1. Therefore, `j` can be either 1 or 2 after the execution. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` can be either [0] or [1], `j` can be either 1 or 2, `g` is based on the conditions stated, `f` is [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `i` is 1.

Output State: **`l` can be either [0] or [1], `j` can be either 1 or 2, `g` is based on the conditions stated, `f` is [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `i` is 1**
