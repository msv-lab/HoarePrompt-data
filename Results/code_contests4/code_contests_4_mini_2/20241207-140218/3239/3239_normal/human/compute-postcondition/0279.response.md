Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 2 and `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is divisible by 11, then `f[5]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 11 but is divisible by 13, then `f[6]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 11 or 13 but is divisible by 17, then `f[7]` is incremented by 1, `j` is increased, and `g[7]` remains unchanged. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 11, 13, or 17 but is divisible by 19, then `f[8]` is incremented by 1, with `j` and `l` remaining unchanged. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 11, 13, 17, or 19 but is divisible by 23, then `f[9]` is incremented by 1, while `j`, `l`, and `g[9]` remain unspecified. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 11, 13, 17, 19, or 23 but is divisible by 31, then `f[11]` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `f[11]` remains unchanged. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, or 31 but is divisible by 29, then `f[10]` is incremented by 1, making `f[10]` true, and `l` is updated by appending `g[10]`.***
