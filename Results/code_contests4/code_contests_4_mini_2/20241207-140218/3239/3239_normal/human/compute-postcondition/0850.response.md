Postcondition: ***`l` is determined based on the value of `a[2]`. If `a[i] % 19 == 0`, then if `f[8]` is true, `l` is updated by appending `g[8]`; if `f[8]` is false, `j` can be either 1 or 2, `j` is appended to `l`, and `g[8]` is assigned the value of `j`, with `f[8]` updated by adding 1. If `a[i] % 19` is not equal to 0, and if `a[i] % 23 == 0`, then `f[9]` is increased by 1 and `g[9]` may be updated accordingly. Otherwise, if `a[i] % 29 == 0`, then `f[10]` is incremented by 1; if `a[i] % 31 == 0`, then `f[11]` is incremented by 1; if `a[i] % 31` is not equal to 0, there is no update to `f[11]`. The variable `j` can be either 0 or 1, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute a third time.***
