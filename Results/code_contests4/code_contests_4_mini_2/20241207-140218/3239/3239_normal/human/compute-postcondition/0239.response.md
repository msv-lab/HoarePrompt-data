The code `l.append(j)` adds the current value of `j` to the list `l`. The initial state indicates that `j` has been increased by 1, but the specific value of `j` is not provided. The other variables, `n` and `i`, are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `j` has been appended to `l`, and the values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` has been appended to `l`.**
