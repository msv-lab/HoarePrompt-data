Postcondition: ***`l` is updated to include the value of `g[6]` if `f[6]` is true; otherwise, `l` can be determined based on the value of `a[2]`. `j` can either be 0 or 1 when `f[6]` is true, and can be either 1 or 2 when `f[6]` is false. `f` and `g` may be updated accordingly in both cases; `i` remains 2, and for the loop to execute a third time, `n` must be greater than 2. If `f[6]` is false, `g[6]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
