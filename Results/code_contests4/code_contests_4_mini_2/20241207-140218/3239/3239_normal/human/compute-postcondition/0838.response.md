The code assigns the value of `j` to the index `10` of the list `g`. The variable `j` can either be `1` or `2`, and this assignment does not affect the values of `l` or `i`. Therefore, after execution, `g[10]` will hold either `1` or `2`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`l` is updated to include the value of `j` (which can be either 1 or 2), `i` is 2, and `g[10]` is assigned the value of `j` (which can be either 1 or 2).**
