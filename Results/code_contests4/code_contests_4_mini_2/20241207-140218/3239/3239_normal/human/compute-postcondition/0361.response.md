The value of `g[7]` is assigned the value of `j`, which is currently 1. Therefore, `g[7]` becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `l` is [1], `f` is a list of twelve 0's, `g` is a list of twelve 0's with `g[7]` now being 1, `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is odd, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, `a[i]` is not divisible by 11, `a[i]` is not divisible by 13, and `a[i]` is divisible by 17, and the 8th element of `f` (i.e., `f[7]`) is 0.**
