Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 3, then `f[2]` remains unchanged, while `l`, `j`, and `g[2]` also remain unchanged. Otherwise, if `a[i]` is divisible by 5, then `f[3]` is incremented by 1; if divisible by 7, `f[4]` is increased by 1; if divisible by 11, `f[5]` is increased by 1; if divisible by 13, `f[6]` is increased by 1. If not divisible by 13 but divisible by 17, `f[7]` is greater than its previous value; if not divisible by 17 but divisible by 19, then `f[8]` is incremented by 1. If divisible by 23, then `f[9]` is updated by adding 1; if divisible by 29, then `f[10]` is incremented by 1. If divisible by 31 but not by 29, then `f[11]` is increased by 1. If `f[11]` was previously false, `j` is increased by 1, `l` is updated to include the new value of `j`, and `g[11]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
