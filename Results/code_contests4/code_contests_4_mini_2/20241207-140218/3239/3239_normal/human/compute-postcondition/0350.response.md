`l` is updated by appending the value of `j`, which is 1. The previous value of `l` was an empty list, so after the execution, `l` will contain one element: [1]. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `l` is [1], `f` is a list of twelve 0's, `g` is a list of twelve 0's, `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is odd, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, `a[i]` is not divisible by 11, and `a[i]` is divisible by 13, and the element `f[6]` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `l` is [1], `f` is a list of twelve 0's, `g` is a list of twelve 0's, `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is odd, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, `a[i]` is not divisible by 11, and `a[i]` is divisible by 13, and the element `f[6]` is 0.**
