The list `l` is modified by appending the value of `j` to it. The initial state of `l` can either be `[0]` or `[1]`, and `j` can be either `1` or `2`. Therefore, after the execution of the code, the possible values of `l` will be either `[0, 1]` or `[1, 1]` (if `j` is `1`), or `[0, 2]` or `[1, 2]` (if `j` is `2`). The values of `g`, `f`, and `i` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`l` can be either [0, 1] or [1, 1] or [0, 2] or [1, 2]; `g` is based on the conditions stated; `f` is [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]; `i` is 1**
