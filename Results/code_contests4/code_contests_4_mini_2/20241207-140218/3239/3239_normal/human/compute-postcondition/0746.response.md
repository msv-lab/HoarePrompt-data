The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` can be either 0 or 1, so after execution, the value of `j` will be either 1 or 2. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` can be either [0] or [1]; `j` can be either 1 or 2; `g` is based on the conditions stated; `f` is [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]; `i` is 1.
