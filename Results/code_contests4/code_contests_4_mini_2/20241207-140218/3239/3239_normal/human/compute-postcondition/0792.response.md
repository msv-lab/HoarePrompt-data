Output State: **`l` is updated to include `g[2]` if `f[2]` is true; otherwise, `l` is determined based on the value of `a[2]`. `j` can be either 0 or 1, `f` and `g` may be updated accordingly, `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute a third time, `n` must be greater than 2. `f[2]` is incremented by 1.**
