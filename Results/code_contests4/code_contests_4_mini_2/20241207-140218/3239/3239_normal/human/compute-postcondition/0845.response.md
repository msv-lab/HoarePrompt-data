Postcondition: ***`l` can be determined based on the value of `a[2]`. If `f[11]` is true, then `l` is updated to include the value of `g[11]`. If `f[11]` is false, then `l` is updated by appending `j`, which can be either 0 or 1, `i` remains 2, and `g[11]` is assigned the value of `j`, which can also be either 0 or 1.***
