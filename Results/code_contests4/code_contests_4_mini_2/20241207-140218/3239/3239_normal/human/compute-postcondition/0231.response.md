The value of `l` is modified by appending the value of `g[5]` to it. The variable `g` is assumed to be defined elsewhere, and `g[5]` will yield a specific value based on the contents of `g`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `l` due to the append operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `l` is modified by appending `g[5]`**
