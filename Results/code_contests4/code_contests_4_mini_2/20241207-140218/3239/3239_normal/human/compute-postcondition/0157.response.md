Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1 and `i` is 1. If `f[5]` evaluates to true, the values of `n`, `i`, and `l` do not change, but there may be an error when attempting to append `g[5]` to `l` if `g` is not defined or does not have enough elements. If `f[5]` is false, `j` is increased by 1, `l` now contains the value of `j`, and `g[5]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
