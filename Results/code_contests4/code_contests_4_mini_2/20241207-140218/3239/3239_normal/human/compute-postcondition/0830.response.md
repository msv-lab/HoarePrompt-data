The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is either 0 or 1. Therefore, after execution, `j` can be either 1 or 2. The states of the other variables (`l`, `f`, `g`, and `i`) are not affected. Hence, the Output State is: `l` can be determined based on the value of `a[2]`, `j` can be either 1 or 2, `f` and `g` may be updated accordingly, `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be greater than 2.
