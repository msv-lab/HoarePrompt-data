Postcondition: ***`l` is updated based on the condition of `f[10]`. If `f[10]` is true, `l` takes the value of `g[10]`, `j` can be either 0 or 1, `f` and `g` may be updated accordingly, `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be greater than 2. If `f[10]` is false, `l` is updated to include the value of `j` (which can be either 1 or 2), `i` is 2, and `g[10]` is assigned the value of `j` (which can be either 1 or 2).***
