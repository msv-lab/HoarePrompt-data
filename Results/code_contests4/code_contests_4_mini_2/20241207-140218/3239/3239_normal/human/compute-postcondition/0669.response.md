Postcondition: ***`l` is either [0] or [1], `j` is either 0 or 1, `g` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the value returned from `func_4()`, `f` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `i` is 0, the value of `a[i]` is an odd number, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, or 19, and `a[i]` is divisible by 23. If `f[9]` is true, then `l` is [0] and `j` is 0. Otherwise, if `f[9]` is false, then `l` is [1] and `j` is 1, with the 10th element of `g` being updated to 1.***
