Postcondition: ***`l` is updated to include `g[4]` if `f[4]` is true, otherwise `l` is determined based on the value of `a[2]`. `j` can be either 0 or 1 if `f[4]` is true, or 1 or 2 if `f[4]` is false. The variables `f` and `g` may be updated accordingly, and `i` remains 2 in both cases. For the loop to execute a third time, `n` must be greater than 2. If `f[4]` is false, `g[4]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
