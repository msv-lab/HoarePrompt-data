The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is 0, so after execution, `j` becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `l` is an empty list, `f` is a list of twelve 0's, `g` is a list of twelve 0's, `i` is 0, the `i`-th element of `a` is even, and the second element of `f` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `l` is an empty list, `f` is a list of twelve 0's, `g` is a list of twelve 0's, `i` is 0, the `i`-th element of `a` is even, and the second element of `f` is 0.**
