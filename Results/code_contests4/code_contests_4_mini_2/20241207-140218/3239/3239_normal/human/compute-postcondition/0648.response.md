The value of `g[7]` is assigned the value of `j`, which is 1. The previous value of `g[7]` was 0. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is [1], `j` is 1, `g` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the value returned from `func_4()`, `f` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `i` is 0, the value of `a[i]` is an odd number, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, `a[i]` is not divisible by 11, `a[i]` is not divisible by 13, `a[i]` is divisible by 17, and `f[7]` is 0 (or false).
