The code `l.append(g[5])` appends the value at index 5 of list `g` to list `l`. The current state of `g` is given as `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, so `g[5]` is `0`. The list `l` is initially empty. 

After executing the code, `l` will contain one element, which is `0`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is [0], `j` is 0, `g` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the value returned from `func_4()`, `f` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `i` is 0, the value of `a[i]` is an odd number, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, `a[i]` is divisible by 11, and `f[5]` is true (non-zero).

Output State: **`l` is [0], `j` is 0, `g` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the value returned from `func_4()`, `f` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `i` is 0, the value of `a[i]` is an odd number, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, `a[i]` is divisible by 11, and `f[5]` is true (non-zero)**.
