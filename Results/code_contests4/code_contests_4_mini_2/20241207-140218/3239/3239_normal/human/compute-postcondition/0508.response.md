The code appends the value of `j` to the list `l`. Since the initial state indicates that `j` has been increased by 1, its value is unknown but is not affected by the operation. The value of `n` and `i` does not impact this operation either. Therefore, the output state will reflect that the value of `j` has been appended to the list `l`, without changing any other variable's value.

Output State: **`j` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2; `j` has been appended to the list `l`.**
