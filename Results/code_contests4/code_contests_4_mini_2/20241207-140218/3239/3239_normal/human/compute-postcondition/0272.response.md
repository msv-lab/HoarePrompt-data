The code snippet `f[11] += 1` increments the value of `f[11]` by 1. The values of the other variables `n`, `i`, `j`, `g[11]`, and `l` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `f[11]`, while the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `f[11]` is incremented by 1**
