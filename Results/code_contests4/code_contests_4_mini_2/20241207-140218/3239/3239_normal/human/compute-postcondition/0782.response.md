The value of `j` is incremented by 1. Since `j` can either be 0 or 1, after execution, `j` will be either 1 or 2. The values of `l`, `f`, `g`, and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` can be determined based on the value of `a[2]`, `j` can be either 1 or 2, `f` and `g` may be updated accordingly, `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be greater than 2.
