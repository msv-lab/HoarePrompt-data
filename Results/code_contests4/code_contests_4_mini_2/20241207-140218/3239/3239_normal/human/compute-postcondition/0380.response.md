`l` is an empty list initially. The code `l.append(j)` adds the value of `j`, which is 1, to the list `l`. Therefore, after execution, `l` will contain the single element [1]. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `l` is [1], `f` is a list of twelve 0's, `g` is a list of twelve 0's, `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is odd, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, `a[i]` is not divisible by 11, `a[i]` is not divisible by 13, `a[i]` is not divisible by 17, and `a[i]` is not divisible by 19, and `a[i]` is divisible by 23; the 10th element of `f` is 0.**
