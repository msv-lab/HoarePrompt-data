Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is divisible by 5, then `f[3]` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 5 and is divisible by 7, then `f[4]` is updated while `l`, `j`, and `g[4]` remain unchanged. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 5 and is not divisible by 7 but is divisible by 11, `f[5]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, 7, or 11 but is divisible by 13, then `f[6]` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, 7, 11, or 13 but is divisible by 17, then `f[7]` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, 7, 11, 13, or 17 but is divisible by 19, then `f[8]` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, or 19 but is divisible by 23, then `f[9]` is incremented by 1 (making `f[9]` true) and `g[9]` is appended to `l`. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, or 23 but is divisible by 29, then `f[10]` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, or 29 but is divisible by 31, then `f[11]` is incremented by 1; if not, `f[11]` remains unchanged.***
