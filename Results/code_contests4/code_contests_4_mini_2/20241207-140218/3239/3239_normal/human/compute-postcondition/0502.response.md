The code `l.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` to the list `l`. The previous value of `j` is not specified, but it is stated that `j` has been increased by 1. The value of `n` and `i` do not affect this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `j` has been added to the list `l`, but the exact value of `j` is unknown.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1, and `j` has been appended to the list `l`.**
