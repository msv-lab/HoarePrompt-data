The code attempts to append the value of `g[10]` to the list `l`. However, the initial state does not provide information about the list `l` or the variable `g`. Since `l` and `g` are not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine how the execution will affect them. Therefore, the output state will indicate that the execution of the code does not alter the known variables, but may lead to an error due to undefined variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, and the code attempts to append `g[10]` to `l`, but `l` and `g` are undefined.**
