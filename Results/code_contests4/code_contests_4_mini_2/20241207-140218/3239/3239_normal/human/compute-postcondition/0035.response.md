Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, the first element of `a` is an odd integer, not divisible by 3 and divisible by 5. If `f[3]` evaluates to true, `g[3]` is appended to `l`. Otherwise, if `f[3]` is false, `j` is increased by 1, `l` now contains the value of `j`, and `g[3]` is equal to `j`.***
