`j` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `j` is 0. Therefore, after execution, `j` becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`l` is an empty list, `j` is 1, `g` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the value returned from `func_4()`, `f` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `i` is 0, the value of `a[i]` is an odd number, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, `a[i]` is not divisible by 11, `a[i]` is not divisible by 13, `a[i]` is not divisible by 17, `a[i]` is not divisible by 19, `a[i]` is not divisible by 23, `a[i]` is not divisible by 29, `a[i]` is divisible by 31, and `f[11]` is 0 (or false).**
