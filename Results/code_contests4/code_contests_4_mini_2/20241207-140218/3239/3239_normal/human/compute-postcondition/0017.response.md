`x` is assigned the value of the third element in the list `args`, and it is converted to a string before being written to `file`. The state of `sep` is not affected, and since `at_start` is False, `sep` has already been written to `file` prior to this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is the value of kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), `file` is the value of kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout), `at_start` is False, `args` is a list with at least 3 elements, `x` is the string representation of the third element in the list `args`, and `x` has been written to `file`.

Output State: **`sep` is the value of kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), `file` is the value of kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout), `at_start` is False, `args` is a list with at least 3 elements, `x` is the string representation of the third element in the list `args`, and `x` has been written to `file.**
