Postcondition: ***`l` can be either [0] or [1]. If `f[2]` is true, then `l` is appended with the value of `g[2]`, which is unknown. If `f[2]` is false, then `l` can be either [0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 1], or [1, 2]; `j` can be either 1 or 2, and `g[2]` is set to `j`. In both cases, `f` remains [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] and `i` is 1.***
