Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and `i` is 0. If the first element of `a` is an odd integer not divisible by 3 and divisible by 5, then `f[3]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if the first element of `a` is an odd integer not divisible by 3 or 5, if it is divisible by 7, then `f[4]` is incremented by 1; if it is not divisible by 7 but divisible by 11, then `f[5]` is incremented by 1; if it is not divisible by 11 but divisible by 13, then `f[6]` is incremented by 1; if it is not divisible by 13 but divisible by 17, then `f[7]` is incremented by 1; if it is divisible by 19, then `f[8]` is updated by 1; if it is divisible by 23, then `f[9]` is increased by 1; if it is not divisible by 23 but divisible by 29, then `f[10]` is incremented by 1; if it is not divisible by 23 or 29 but divisible by 31, then `f[11]` is increased by 1. Variables `j`, `g[8]`, and `l` remain unchanged.***
