The code `l.append(g[8])` appends the value of `g[8]` to the list `l`. There are no changes to the variables `n` or `i` from this operation. The state of the list `l` will change, but the previous value of `g[8]` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `l` has an additional element which is `g[8]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `l` has an additional element which is `g[8]`**
