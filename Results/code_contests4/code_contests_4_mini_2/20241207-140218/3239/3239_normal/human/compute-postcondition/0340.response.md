The code `l.append(j)` adds the value of `j` to the list `l`. The current value of `j` is 1, so after execution, `l` will contain the element 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `l` is a list containing 1, `f` is a list of twelve 0's, `g` is a list of twelve 0's, `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is odd, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, and the element `a[i]` is divisible by 11. The element `f[5]` is 0.**
