Postcondition: ***`l` is either [0] or [1], `j` is either 0 or 1, `g` is updated to [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0] if `f[7]` is false, and remains [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] if `f[7]` is true. `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the value returned from `func_4()`, `f` remains [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], and `i` is 0 with the value of `a[i]` being an odd number that satisfies various divisibility conditions.***
