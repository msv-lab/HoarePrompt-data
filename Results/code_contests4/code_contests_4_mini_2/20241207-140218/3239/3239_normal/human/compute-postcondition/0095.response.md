Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, the first element of `a` is an odd integer not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and 19 but divisible by 23. If the 10th element of `f` is true, `g[9]` is appended to `l`. Otherwise, `j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the value of `j`, and `g[9]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
