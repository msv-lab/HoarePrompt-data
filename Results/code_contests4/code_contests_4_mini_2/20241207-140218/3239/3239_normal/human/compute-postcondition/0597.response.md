The code `l.append(j)` appends the value of `j` to the list `l`. The initial state indicates that `l` is an empty list and `j` is 1. After executing the code, the list `l` will contain the value 1. The other variables (`g`, `n`, `a`, `f`, `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is [1], `j` is 1, `g` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the value returned from `func_4()`, `f` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `i` is 0, the value of `a[i]` is an odd number, `a[i]` is divisible by 3, and `f[2]` is 0 (or evaluates to false).

Output State: **`l` is [1], `j` is 1, `g` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the value returned from `func_4()`, `f` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `i` is 0, the value of `a[i]` is an odd number, `a[i]` is divisible by 3, and `f[2]` is 0 (or evaluates to false)**.
