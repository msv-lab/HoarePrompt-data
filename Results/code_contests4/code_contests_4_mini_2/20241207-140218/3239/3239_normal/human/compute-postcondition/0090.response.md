The code `l.append(g[9])` appends the value of `g[9]` to the list `l`. The previous values of the affected variables include `l`, which is a list that is currently unchanged before the append operation, and `g[9]`, which is not defined in the initial state but will be used for the append operation. Since `g[9]` is not given any specific value in the initial state, we cannot determine its value.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `l` will have an additional element appended to it, but the specific value of `g[9]` cannot be determined. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, the first element of `a` is an odd integer, the first element of `a` is not divisible by 3, the first element of `a` is not divisible by 5, the first element of `a` is not divisible by 7, the first element of `a` is not divisible by 11, the first element of `a` is not divisible by 13, the first element of `a` is not divisible by 17, the first element of `a` is not divisible by 19, the first element of `a` is divisible by 23, the 10th element of `f` is true, and we append `g[9]` to `l`.**
