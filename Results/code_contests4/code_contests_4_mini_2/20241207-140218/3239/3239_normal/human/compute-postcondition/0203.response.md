Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1 and `i` is 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 5, then `f[3]` is increased by 1, and `g` remains undefined. If `a[i]` is divisible by 7, then `f[4]` is incremented by 1 if it was initially true; if it was false, it becomes true, `j` is increased by 1, and `g[4]` is assigned the value of `j`. If `a[i]` is divisible by 11, then `f[5]` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 13, then `f[6]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 17, then `f[7]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 19, then `f[8]` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 23, then `f[9]` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 29, then `f[10]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 31, then `f[11]` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `f[11]` remains unchanged.***
