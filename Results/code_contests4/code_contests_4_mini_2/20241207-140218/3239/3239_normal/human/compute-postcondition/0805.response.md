The code `l.append(g[5])` appends the value of `g[5]` to the list `l`. The previous state indicates that `l` can be determined based on the value of `a[2]`, but we do not have specific information on its contents. The variable `j` can be either 0 or 1, but this does not affect the operation of appending to the list. The states of `f`, `g`, and `i` are not directly impacted by this line of code, but the value of `g[5]` is necessary for the operation to take place. Since the loop is stated to execute a third time, it implies that the conditions for executing this line of code are met.

Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is updated by appending `g[5]`, where the exact value of `g[5]` is unknown but it will add to `l`.

Output State: **`l` is updated by appending `g[5]`**
