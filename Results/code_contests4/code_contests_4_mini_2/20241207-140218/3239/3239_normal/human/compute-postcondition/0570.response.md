Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is even, `f[1]` is incremented by 1, while `j`, `g[1]`, and `l` remain unchanged. If `a[i]` is odd, then if `a[i]` is divisible by 3, `f[2]` is incremented by 1; if not divisible by 3 but divisible by 5, `f[3]` is increased by 1; if not divisible by 3 or 5 but divisible by 7, `f[4]` is updated while `l`, `j`, and `g[4]` remain unchanged; if not divisible by 3, 5, or 7 but divisible by 11, `f[5]` is incremented by 1; if not divisible by 3, 5, 7, or 11 but divisible by 13, `f[6]` is increased by 1; if not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, or 13 but divisible by 17, `f[7]` is increased by 1; if not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, or 17 but divisible by 19, `f[8]` is increased by 1; if not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, or 19 but divisible by 23, `f[9]` is incremented by 1 (making `f[9]` true) and `g[9]` is appended to `l`; if not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, or 23 but divisible by 29, `f[10]` is increased by 1; if not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, or 29 but divisible by 31, `f[11]` is incremented by 1; if not, `f[11]` remains unchanged.***
