Postcondition: ***`l` is updated by appending `g[1]` if `f[1]` is true, while `j` can be either 0 or 1, and `f` and `g` may be updated accordingly, with `i` being 2 and `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute a third time. If `f[1]` is false, `l` is determined based on the value of `a[2]`, `j` can be either 1 or 2, `f` and `g` may also be updated, with `i` still equal to 2, `n` must again be greater than 2, and `g[1]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
