Postcondition: ***`l` can either be [0, g[5]] or [1, g[5]] if `f[5]` is true. If `f[5]` is false, then `l` can be either [0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 1], or [1, 2]; `j` is either 1 or 2; `g` is based on the conditions stated, and `g[5]` is either 1 or 2. If `a[i] % 13 == 0`, then `l` can be either [0] or [1] based on the condition of `f[6]`, and `f` is updated to [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]; `i` remains 1, and `g[6]` takes the value of `j`. If `a[i] % 17 == 0`, `f` is [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]; `l` can be either [0] or [1] with an additional element `g[7]`, and `j` can be either 1 or 2. If `a[i] % 19 == 0`, then `f` is [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], and `l` can be either [0, g[8]] or [1, g[8]]. If `a[i] % 19 != 0` and `a[i] % 23 == 0`, then `l` can be either [0, 0] or [1, 0]; `f` is [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], and `j` can be either 0 or 1. If `a[i] % 23 != 0` and `a[i] % 29 == 0`, then `f[10]` is either 1 or 2; `j` can be either 1 or 2, and `g[10]` is either 1 or 2. If `a[i] % 31 == 0`, then `l` can be either [0, g[11]] or [1, g[11]], `f[11]` is true, and `j` can be either 0 or 1, while `i` is still 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 31, `l` remains unchanged.***
