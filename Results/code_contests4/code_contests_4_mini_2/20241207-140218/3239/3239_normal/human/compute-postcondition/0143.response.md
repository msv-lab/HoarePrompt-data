The code `l.append(j)` adds the current value of `j` to the list `l`. The initial state indicates that `j` has been increased by 1, but its exact value is not specified. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged and are not impacted by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `j` has been appended to the list `l`, but we do not have the exact value of `j`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is increased by 1, and `j` has been appended to the list `l`.**
