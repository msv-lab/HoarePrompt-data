Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 2 and `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is divisible by 29, then `f[10]` is incremented by 1, making `f[10]` true, and `l` is updated by appending `g[10]`. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 29, and if `a[i]` is divisible by 31, then `f[11]` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `f[11]` remains unchanged.***
