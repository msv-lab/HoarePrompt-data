The code snippet `l.append(g[4])` attempts to append the value of `g[4]` to the list `l`. However, the initial state does not provide information about the list `l` or the variable `g`. Therefore, we cannot determine the values being appended or the state of `l` after execution. 

Since the values of `l` and `g` are unknown, we conclude that the state of `n` and `i` remains unchanged, and we cannot specify the new state of `l`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, and the state of `l` and `g` is unknown due to insufficient information.**
