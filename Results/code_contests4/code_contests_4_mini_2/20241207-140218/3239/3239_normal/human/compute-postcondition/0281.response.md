Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 2 and `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is divisible by 5, `f[3]` is increased by 1, while `j` and `g[3]` remain unchanged. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 5 and is divisible by 7, `f[4]` is incremented by 1, with `j`, `l`, and `g[4]` remaining unchanged. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 7 but is divisible by 11, `f[5]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 11 but is divisible by 13, `f[6]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 13 but is divisible by 17, `f[7]` is incremented by 1 and `j` is increased, while `g[7]` remains unchanged. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 17 but is divisible by 19, `f[8]` is incremented by 1, with `j` and `l` remaining unchanged. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 19 but is divisible by 23, `f[9]` is incremented by 1, while `j`, `l`, and `g[9]` remain unchanged. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 23 but is divisible by 31, `f[11]` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `f[11]` remains unchanged. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 31 but is divisible by 29, `f[10]` is incremented by 1, making `f[10]` true, and `l` is updated by appending `g[10]`.***
