The statement `l.append(j)` adds the value of `j` to the list `l`. The previous states of the variables indicate that `j` has been increased by 1, but its specific value is not provided. The variable `l` is assumed to be a list, and its state will reflect the addition of the current value of `j`. The other variables `n` and `i` are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is increased by 1, and `j` is appended to the list `l`.**
