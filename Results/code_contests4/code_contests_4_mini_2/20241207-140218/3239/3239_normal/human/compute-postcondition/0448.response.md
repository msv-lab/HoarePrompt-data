The code `l.append(j)` adds the value of `j` to the list `l`. The value of `j` is previously stated to be increased by 1. Since `n` is greater than 0 and affects the loop or condition that determines how `j` is incremented, we know that `j` has a positive value. The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a[i]` is the element being evaluated, `j` is increased by 1, and we append `j` to the list `l`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a[i]` is the element being evaluated, `j` is increased by 1, and we append `j` to the list `l`.**
