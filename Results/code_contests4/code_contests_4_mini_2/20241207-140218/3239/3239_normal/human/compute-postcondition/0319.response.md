The value of `j` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `j` is 0. Therefore, after execution, `j` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Thus, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `l` is an empty list, `f` is a list of twelve 0's, `g` is a list of twelve 0's, `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is odd, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is divisible by 5, and the fourth element of `f` is 0.
