The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown. The state of `n` and `i` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `j` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `j` is increased by 1**
