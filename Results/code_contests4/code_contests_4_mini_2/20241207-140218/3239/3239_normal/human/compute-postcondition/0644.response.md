The code `l.append(g[7])` appends the value at index 7 of the list `g` to the list `l`. The current state shows that `g` is initialized as `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, meaning `g[7]` is `0`. The list `l` is currently empty. Therefore, after executing the code, `l` will contain one element, which is `0`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`l` is [0], `j` is 0, `g` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the value returned from `func_4()`, `f` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `i` is 0, the value of `a[i]` is an odd number, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, `a[i]` is not divisible by 11, `a[i]` is not divisible by 13, `a[i]` is divisible by 17, and `f[7]` is a truthy value (non-zero).**
