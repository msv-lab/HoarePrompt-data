Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `f[2]`; if `f[2]` is true, then `l` is [0], if false, then `l` is [1]; `f` is a list of twelve 0's; `g` is a list of twelve 0's with a 1 at index 2 if `f[2]` is false; `i` is 0, and `a[i]` is odd and divisible by 3; `f[2]` is incremented by 1.**
