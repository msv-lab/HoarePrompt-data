The code `l.append(g[5])` attempts to append the value of `g[5]` to the list `l`. However, the value of `g` is based on certain conditions that are not provided, so we cannot determine its exact value. 

Given that `l` can either be `[0]` or `[1]`, after executing `l.append(g[5])`, the state of `l` will change by adding one more element to it, but we cannot specify what `g[5]` is. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `l` has one additional element based on `g[5]`, which is unknown.

Since no other variables are affected:

Output State: **`l` can be either [0, g[5]] or [1, g[5]]**
