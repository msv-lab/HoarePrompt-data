The variable `g` at index `11` is assigned the value of `j`. Since `j` was increased by 1 before this line, the current value of `j` is 1 more than its previous value. The value of `l` now contains the updated value of `j`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is increased by 1; `l` contains the value of `j`; `g[11]` is assigned the value of `j`.

Output State: **`j` is increased by 1; `l` contains the value of `j`; `g[11]` is assigned the value of `j`**
