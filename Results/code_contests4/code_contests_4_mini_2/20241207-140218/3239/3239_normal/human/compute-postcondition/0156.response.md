The variable `g` at index 5 is assigned the value of `j`. The previous value of `j` is unknown, but it is stated that `j` has been increased by 1 before this assignment. The initial states of `n`, `i`, and `l` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment operation and acknowledges the values of the relevant variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is increased by 1, `l` now contains the value of `j`, and `g[5]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
