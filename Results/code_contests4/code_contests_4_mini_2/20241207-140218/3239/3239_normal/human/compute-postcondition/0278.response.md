Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 2 and `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is divisible by 13, then `f[6]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `a[i]` is divisible by 17, `f[7]` is incremented by 1, `j` is increased, and `g[7]` remains unchanged. If `a[i]` is divisible by 19, then `f[8]` is incremented by 1, with `j` and `l` remaining unchanged. If `a[i]` is divisible by 23 but not by 19, then `f[9]` is incremented by 1, while `j`, `l`, and `g[9]` remain unspecified. If `a[i]` is divisible by 31 but not by 23 or 29, then `f[11]` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `f[11]` remains unchanged. If `a[i]` is divisible by 29, then `f[10]` is incremented by 1, making `f[10]` true, and `l` is updated by appending `g[10]`.***
