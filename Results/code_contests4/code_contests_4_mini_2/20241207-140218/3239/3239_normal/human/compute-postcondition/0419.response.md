The variable `g[1]` is assigned the value of `j`. The value of `j` is increased by 1 and appended to the list `l` before this line of code executes, but since we do not know the specific value of `j` after it is increased, we cannot determine the exact value assigned to `g[1]`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a[i]` is the element being evaluated, `j` is increased by 1, and `j` is appended to the list `l`; `g[1]` is assigned the value of `j`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a[i]` is the element being evaluated, `j` is increased by 1, `j` is appended to the list `l`; `g[1]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
