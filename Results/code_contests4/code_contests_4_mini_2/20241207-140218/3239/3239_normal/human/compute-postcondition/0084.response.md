The value of `g[8]` is assigned the value of `j`, which has been increased by 1 prior to this assignment. The previous state of the variables is unaffected except for `j`, which is now one greater than its previous value. The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, `f`, and `l` remain unchanged, but `g[8]` now holds the updated value of `j`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, the first element of `a` is an odd integer, the first element of `a` is not divisible by 3, the first element of `a` is not divisible by 5, the first element of `a` is not divisible by 7, the first element of `a` is not divisible by 11, the first element of `a` is not divisible by 13, the first element of `a` is not divisible by 17, the first element of `a` is divisible by 19, `f[8]` is false, `j` is increased by 1, `l` has the new value of `j` appended to it, and `g[8]` is now equal to the updated value of `j`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, the first element of `a` is an odd integer, the first element of `a` is not divisible by 3, the first element of `a` is not divisible by 5, the first element of `a` is not divisible by 7, the first element of `a` is not divisible by 11, the first element of `a` is not divisible by 13, the first element of `a` is not divisible by 17, the first element of `a` is divisible by 19, `f[8]` is false, `j` is increased by 1, `l` has the new value of `j` appended to it, and `g[8]` is now equal to the updated value of `j`.**
