Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, if the second element of `f` is true, then `j` remains 0, `l` is [0], and `g` remains a list of twelve 0's. Otherwise, `j` is updated to 1, `l` is now [1], `g` has the second element set to 1, while the rest of the elements remain 0. The `i`-th element of `a` is even, and `i` is 0.***
