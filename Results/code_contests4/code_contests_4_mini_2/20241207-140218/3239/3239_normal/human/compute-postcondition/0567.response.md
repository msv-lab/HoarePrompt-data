Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is divisible by 7, then `f[4]` is updated, while the states of `l`, `j`, and `g[4]` remain unchanged. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, and if `a[i]` is divisible by 11, then `f[5]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 13, then `f[6]` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 17, then `f[7]` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 19, then `f[8]` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 23, then `f[9]` is incremented by 1 (making `f[9]` true) and `g[9]` is appended to `l`. If `a[i]` is divisible by 29, then `f[10]` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 31, then `f[11]` is incremented by 1; if not, `f[11]` remains unchanged.***
