The code appends the value of `g[9]` to the list `l`. Given the initial state, `g` is defined as `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, which means `g[9]` is `0`. Therefore, `l` will now contain one element, which is `0`. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`l` is [0], `j` is 0, `g` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the value returned from `func_4()`, `f` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `i` is 0, the value of `a[i]` is an odd number, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, `a[i]` is not divisible by 11, `a[i]` is not divisible by 13, `a[i]` is not divisible by 17, `a[i]` is not divisible by 19, `a[i]` is divisible by 23, and `f[9]` is true.**
