The code `l.append(g[3])` appends the value of `g[3]` to the list `l`. Initially, `g` is a list of twelve 0's, so `g[3]` is 0. The list `l` is currently empty. After executing the code, `l` will contain one element, which is 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `l` is [0], `f` is a list of twelve 0's, `g` is a list of twelve 0's, `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is odd, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is divisible by 5, and the fourth element of `f` is truthy (non-zero).**
