`g[1]` is assigned the value of `j`, which is 1. Therefore, after execution, `g[1]` becomes 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `l` is now a list containing 1, `f` is a list of twelve 0's, `g` is now a list where the second element is 1, `i` is 0, the `i`-th element of `a` is even, and the second element of `f` is 0.
