To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the current state and how the loop operates based on the given conditions.

1. The loop variable `i` is used to access elements in the array `a`, and it is incremented with each iteration of the loop.
2. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
3. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 2, and there must be at least 3 elements in `a` (i.e., `n` must be greater than 2) to avoid an out-of-bounds error.

Given the conditions for `a[i]`, the states we need to consider include:
- The value of `i` must increase by 1.
- The conditions for the values of `l`, `j`, `f`, and `g` will also depend on the value of `a[i]` for the new iteration.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be 2.
- We will need to check the value of `a[2]` to determine the possible values for `l`, `j`, `f`, and `g`.

Now, summarizing this into the required state format:

State: **`l` can be determined based on the value of `a[2]`, `j` can be either 0 or 1, `f` and `g` may be updated accordingly, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be greater than 2**
