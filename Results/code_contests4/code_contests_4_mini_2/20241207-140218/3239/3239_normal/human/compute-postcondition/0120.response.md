Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, and the first element of `a` is an odd integer not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, or 19. If the first element of `a` is divisible by 19, `f[8]` is updated by 1. If the first element of `a` is divisible by 23, then `f[9]` is increased by 1. If it is not divisible by 23 but is divisible by 29, then `f[10]` is incremented by 1. If it is not divisible by 23 or 29 but is divisible by 31, then `f[11]` is increased by 1. `j`, `g[8]`, and `l` remain unchanged.***
