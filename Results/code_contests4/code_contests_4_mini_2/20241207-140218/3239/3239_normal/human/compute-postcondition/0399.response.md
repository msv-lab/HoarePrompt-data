The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is 0, so after execution, `j` will be 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `l` is an empty list, `f` is a list of twelve 0's, `g` is a list of twelve 0's, `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is odd, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, `a[i]` is not divisible by 11, `a[i]` is not divisible by 13, `a[i]` is not divisible by 17, `a[i]` is not divisible by 19, `a[i]` is not divisible by 23, `a[i]` is not divisible by 29, `a[i]` is divisible by 31, and the last element of `f` (i.e., `f[11]`) is 0.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `l` is an empty list, `f` is a list of twelve 0's, `g` is a list of twelve 0's, `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is odd, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, `a[i]` is not divisible by 11, `a[i]` is not divisible by 13, `a[i]` is not divisible by 17, `a[i]` is not divisible by 19, `a[i]` is not divisible by 23, `a[i]` is not divisible by 29, `a[i]` is divisible by 31, and the last element of `f` (i.e., `f[11]`) is 0**
