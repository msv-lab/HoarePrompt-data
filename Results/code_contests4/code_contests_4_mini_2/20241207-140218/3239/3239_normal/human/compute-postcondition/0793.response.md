The code `l.append(g[3])` appends the value of `g[3]` to the list `l`. The variable `l` can have its value changed based on the execution of this code. The previous values of the affected variables are not explicitly provided, but `g` must have at least 4 elements since we are accessing `g[3]`. The variables `j`, `f`, and `g` may also change, but their specific values are not known in this context. The variable `i` is 2, which does not directly affect the execution of this line.

Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is updated to include `g[3]`, and `j` can be either 0 or 1, `f` and `g` may be updated accordingly, `i` is 2, with the condition that `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute a third time.

Output State: **`l` is updated to include `g[3]`, `j` can be either 0 or 1, `f` and `g` may be updated accordingly, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute a third time.**
