Postcondition: ***`sep` is the value of kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), `file` is the value of kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout), `at_start` is False, and `args` is a list with at least 2 elements. If `at_start` is False, the string representation of `x` is written to the specified file, followed by the string representation of `sep`.***
