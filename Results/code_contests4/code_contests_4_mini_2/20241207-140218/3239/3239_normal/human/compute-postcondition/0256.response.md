The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is unknown, but since it is being incremented, we note that its value is increased by 1. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `j` is increased by 1. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `j` is increased by 1.**
