The code `l.append(g[6])` appends the value of `g[6]` to the list `l`. Given the initial state, `g` is defined as `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, so `g[6]` is `0`. 

Since `l` is initially an empty list, after appending `0`, the state of `l` will be `[0]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is `[0]`, `j` is 0, `g` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the value returned from `func_4()`, `f` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `i` is 0, the value of `a[i]` is an odd number, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, `a[i]` is not divisible by 11, `a[i]` is divisible by 13, and the value of `f[6]` is true (non-zero).

Output State: **`l` is [0], `j` is 0, `g` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the value returned from `func_4()`, `f` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `i` is 0, the value of `a[i]` is an odd number, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, `a[i]` is not divisible by 11, `a[i]` is divisible by 13, and the value of `f[6]` is true (non-zero).**
