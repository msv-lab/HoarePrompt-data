The variable `j` is appended to the list `l`. The value of `j` is increased by 1 before this statement, but the exact value of `j` is not specified, only that it has been increased by 1. Therefore, `l` now includes the new value of `j`, but we cannot determine what that value is. The other variables `n` and `i` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, and `j` has been appended to the list `l`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, and `j` has been appended to the list `l`.**
