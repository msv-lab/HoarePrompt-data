Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, the first element of `a` is an odd integer not divisible by 3 or 5 and divisible by 7. If `f[4]` is true, then `l` includes the value of `g[4]`. Otherwise, if `f[4]` is false, `j` is appended to the list `l`, and `g[4]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
