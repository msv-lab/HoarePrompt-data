Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, the first element of `a` is an odd integer not divisible by 3, 5, or 7, and divisible by 11. If `f[5]` is true, the value of `g[5]` is appended to the list `l`. Otherwise, if `f[5]` is false, the value of `j` is added to the list `l`, and `g[5]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
