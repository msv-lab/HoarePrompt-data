The value of `g[4]` is accessed, which is determined by the conditions stated and can be assumed to be 0 based on the provided initial state of `f`. The function `append` is then called on the list `l`, which can either be [0] or [1]. This means that if `l` was [0], it will become [0, 0], and if `l` was [1], it will become [1, 0]. The values of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the two possible outcomes based on the initial state of `l`.

Output State: **`l` can be either [0, 0] or [1, 0]; `j` can be either 0 or 1; `g` is based on the conditions stated; `f` is [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]; `i` is 1.**
