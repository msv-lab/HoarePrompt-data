Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, if the fifth element of `f` is true, then `j` is set to 0, `l` is [0], while `f` remains a list of twelve 0's, `g` remains a list of twelve 0's, `i` is 0, and the element `a[i]` is odd, not divisible by 3 or 5, and divisible by 7. Otherwise, if the fifth element of `f` is false, `j` is set to 1, `l` is [1], `f` remains a list of twelve 0's, `g` is a list of twelve elements where `g[4]` is now 1, `i` is 0, and the element `a[i]` retains the same properties as previously stated.***
