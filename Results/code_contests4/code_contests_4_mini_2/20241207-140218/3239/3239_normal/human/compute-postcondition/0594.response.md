`l` is an empty list and `g` is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. The element `g[2]` is `0`. The code `l.append(g[2])` will append the value `0` from `g[2]` to the list `l`. After execution, `l` will be `[0]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `l` is `[0]`, `j` is 0, `g` is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the value returned from `func_4()`, `f` is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, `i` is 0, the value of `a[i]` is an odd number, `a[i]` is divisible by 3, and `f[2]` is true (non-zero).

Output State: **`l` is [0], `j` is 0, `g` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the value returned from `func_4()`, `f` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `i` is 0, the value of `a[i]` is an odd number, `a[i]` is divisible by 3, and `f[2]` is true (non-zero).**
