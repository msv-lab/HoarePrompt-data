The code `l.append(g[8])` attempts to append the value at index 8 of the list `g` to the list `l`. However, the initial state does not provide any information about the variables `l` or `g`, which means we cannot determine their previous values or states. Therefore, we can only state that the operation affects the list `l` by appending a new element from `g`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1; `l` is modified by appending the value from `g[8]`.**
