Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `j` can be 0 or 1, `l` can be [0] or [1], and `i` remains 0 with `a[i]` retaining its properties of being odd and not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, or 23. If `a[i]` is divisible by 7, then `f` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `j` is 1, `l` is [1], and `g` has `g[4]` set to 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 7 and if `a[i]` is divisible by 11, then `f[5]` is set to 1, `j` is updated to 1, `l` contains 1, and `g[5]` is updated to 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 11 but divisible by 13, then `j` remains 0, `l` is updated to [0], and the other variables remain unchanged. If the element at index 6 of list `f` is truthy, then `j` is set to 1, `l` is updated to [1], and `g[6]` is updated to 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 17, then the values of `j`, `l`, and `g[7]` depend on whether `f[7]` was true, while `a[i]` remains unchanged. If `a[i]` is divisible by 19, then `f[8]` is set to true, `j` is reset to 0, and `l` is updated to [0]. If `a[i]` is divisible by 23, then `j` can be 0 or 1, `l` can be [0] or [1], and `f[9]` is set to 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 29, then `f[10]` is set to 1, `j` remains 0, and `l` is updated to [0]. If `a[i]` is divisible by 31, then `j` can be 0 or 1, `l` can be [0] or [1], `f` has its last element set to 1, and `g` has its last element updated to 1 while `i` remains 0 and `a[i]` retains its properties.***
