Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, the first element of `a` is an odd integer not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29, and divisible by 31. If `f[11]` is true, `l` contains the value of `g[11]` appended to it. Otherwise, `j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the value of `j`, and `g[11]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
