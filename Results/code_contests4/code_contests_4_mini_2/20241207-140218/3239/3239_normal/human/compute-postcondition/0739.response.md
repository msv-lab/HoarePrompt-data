In the given code snippet, `l.append(g[7])` appends the value of `g[7]` to the list `l`. However, the initial state does not provide the value of `g` directly, and since `g` is based on unspecified conditions, we cannot determine its value. 

The value of `g[7]` is not defined in the current state, and we cannot assume what it is without additional context about `g`. Therefore, we cannot specify the exact impact on `l`.

Since `l` can either be `[0]` or `[1]`, and we cannot ascertain the value of `g[7]`, the output state should reflect that `l` may change depending on the value of `g[7]`. 

Output State: **`l` can be either [0] or [1]; `l` will have an additional element which is `g[7]` (value of `g[7]` is unknown)**
