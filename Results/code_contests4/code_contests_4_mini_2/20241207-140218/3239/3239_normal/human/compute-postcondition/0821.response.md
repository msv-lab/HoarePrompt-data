Postcondition: ***`l` is updated by appending an element from `g[7]` if `f[7]` is true; otherwise, `l` is updated by appending `j`, where `j` can be either 0 or 1, and `g[7]` is assigned the value of `j`. The variable `i` remains 2, and `f` and `g` may be updated accordingly, while for the loop to execute a third time, `n` must be greater than 2.***
