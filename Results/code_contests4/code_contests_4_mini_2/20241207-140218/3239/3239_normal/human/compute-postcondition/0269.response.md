The variable `j` is increased by 1, but we do not know its previous value. The code appends `j` to the list `l`. Since `n` and `i` are not directly affected by this operation, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 2; `i` is 2; `j` is increased by 1, and `j` has been appended to the list `l`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2; `i` is 2; `j` is increased by 1, and `j` has been appended to the list `l.**
