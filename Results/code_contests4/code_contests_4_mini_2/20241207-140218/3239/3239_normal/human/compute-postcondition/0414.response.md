Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is the element being evaluated. If `a[i]` is even, then `j` is 1, `l` is [1], `g` has a 1 at index 1 while the rest are 0's, `f` remains a list of twelve 0's, and `i` is 0. If `a[i]` is odd, then the value of `j` is determined by the divisibility of `a[i]` by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, and 31. Depending on these conditions, `l` can either be [0] or [1], `g` can have updates at indices 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11, and `f` is updated based on the respective conditions, while `i` remains 0 and `a[i]` retains its properties.***
