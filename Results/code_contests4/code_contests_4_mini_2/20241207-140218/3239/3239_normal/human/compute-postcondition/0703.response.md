The value of `g[1]` is not defined in the initial state, but depending on how `g` is determined, it could vary. However, since it is stated that `g` is based on certain conditions, we cannot ascertain its exact value without that information. Thus, the action of appending `g[1]` to `l` will result in `l` having one additional element, the value of which is uncertain.

Given that `l` can either be `[0]` or `[1]`, after appending `g[1]`, `l` will be `[0, g[1]]` or `[1, g[1]]`.

Therefore, the output state is: `l` can be either [0, g[1]] or [1, g[1]]; `j` can be either 0 or 1; `g` is based on the conditions stated; `f` is [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]; `i` is 1.

Output State: **`l` can be either [0, g[1]] or [1, g[1]]; `j` can be either 0 or 1; `g` is based on the conditions stated; `f` is [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]; `i` is 1.**
