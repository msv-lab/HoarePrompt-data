The value of `g[8]` is assigned the current value of `j`. The variable `j` has been increased by 1, but its specific value is not given prior to this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment without specifying the exact value of `j`. The state of the other variables is not affected. 

Output State: **variable `j` is increased by 1; `g[8]` is assigned the value of `j`**
