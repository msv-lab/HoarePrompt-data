The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is unknown, and the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `j` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `j` is increased by 1**
