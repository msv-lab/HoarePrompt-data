The value of `j` can be either 1 or 2. The function `append` adds the value of `j` to the list `l`. Since `l` can initially be either [0] or [1], after appending `j`, `l` will either be [0, 1] or [1, 2]. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` can be either [0, 1] or [1, 2]; `j` can be either 1 or 2; `g` is based on the conditions stated; `f` is [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]; `i` is 1.

Output State: **`l` can be either [0, 1] or [1, 2]; `j` can be either 1 or 2; `g` is based on the conditions stated; `f` is [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]; `i` is 1**
