The code `g[3] = j` assigns the value of `j` to the 4th index (index 3) of the list or array `g`. The previous value of `j` is not specified in the initial state, but it indicates that `j` has been increased by 1 prior to this operation. The value of `j` is now set in `g[3]`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is increased by 1 and assigned to `g[3]`.**
