The code `l.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` to the list `l`. The initial state indicates that `j` has already been increased by 1. Since there is no information about the initial state of the list `l`, we will assume it exists but its contents are not specified. After executing the code, `j` remains unchanged and its value is still increased by 1, and `l` will now contain the value of `j`. 

Output State: **`j` is increased by 1; `l` now contains the value of `j`**
