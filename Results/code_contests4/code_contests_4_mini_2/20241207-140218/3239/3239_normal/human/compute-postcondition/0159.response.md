The code `l.append(g[6])` appends the value at index 6 of the list `g` to the list `l`. The variable `n` and `i` are not affected by this operation. However, since the values of `g` and `l` are not defined in the initial state, the output state will reflect that an element has been appended to `l` without specifying the value. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, and an element is appended to `l` from `g[6]`**.
