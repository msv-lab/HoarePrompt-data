Postcondition: ***`l` can be determined based on the value of `a[2]`. If `a[2] % 11 == 0`, then if `f[5]` is true, `l` is updated by appending the value of `g[5]`, and `f[5]` is incremented by 1. If `f[5]` is false, `l` is updated to include the value of `j` (which can be either 0 or 1). If the condition is false, then `l` is updated based on the value of `g[6]` if `f[6]` is true; otherwise, `l` can be determined based on the value of `a[2]`. If `f[6]` is true, `j` can either be 0 or 1; if `f[6]` is false, `j` can either be 1 or 2, and `g[6]` is assigned the value of `j`. Additionally, if `a[2] % 17 == 0`, then `f[7]` is incremented, and if true, `l` is updated by appending an element from `g[7]`; otherwise, `l` is updated by appending `j`. If `a[2] % 19 == 0`, then depending on the value of `f[8]`, `l` is updated by appending either `g[8]` or `j`, and `g[8]` is assigned the value of `j`, with `f[8]` incremented. If `a[2] % 23 == 0`, then `f[9]` is incremented; if `a[2] % 29 == 0`, then `f[10]` is incremented; if `a[2] % 31 == 0`, then `f[11]` is incremented; otherwise, there is no update to `f[11]`. The value of `i` remains 2, and for the loop to execute a third time, `n` must be greater than 2.***
