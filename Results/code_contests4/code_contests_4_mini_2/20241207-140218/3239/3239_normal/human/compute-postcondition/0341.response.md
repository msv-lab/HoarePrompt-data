`g[5]` is assigned the value of `j`, which is 1. The previous state of `g[5]` was 0, and now it changes to 1. The values of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `l` is a list containing 1, `f` is a list of twelve 0's, `g` is a list of twelve 0's with `g[5]` updated to 1, `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is odd, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, and the element `a[i]` is divisible by 11.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `l` is a list containing 1, `f` is a list of twelve 0's, `g` is a list of twelve 0's with `g[5]` updated to 1, `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is odd, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, and the element `a[i]` is divisible by 11.**
