The code attempts to append the value at index 10 of the list `g` to the list `l`. However, without knowing the initial state or values of the list `g`, we cannot determine the specific value being appended. Other variables `n` and `i` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, the list `l` has appended a value from `g[10]` if it exists.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, the list `l` has appended a value from `g[10]` if it exists.**
