The value of `g[5]` is assigned the value of `j`, which can be either 1 or 2. The other variables `l` and `i` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is updated to include the value of `j`, which can be either 1 or 2; `i` is 2; `g[5]` is either 1 or 2.

Output State: **`l` is updated to include the value of `j`, which can be either 1 or 2; `i` is 2; `g[5]` is either 1 or 2**.
