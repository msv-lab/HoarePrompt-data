According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the output of `func_1()`. Since `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, it indicates the number of times the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is the count of unique integers added to `g`, `l` contains the values corresponding to the unique integers encountered from `a`, `f` indicates the count of how many times each condition was met, and `g` contains the unique values associated with each condition. 

The loop can execute again if `func_1()` returns a value greater than the current iteration count (which is implicitly tracked by how many times the loop has executed). Since we do not have the exact count of how many times the loop has executed, we can infer that for the loop to execute one more time, the value returned by `func_1()` must be greater than the current iteration count.

Let's adjust the states accordingly:

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `j` is the count of unique integers added to `g`, `l` contains the values corresponding to the unique integers encountered from `a`, `f` indicates the count of how many times each condition was met, `g` contains the unique values associated with each condition, for the loop to execute one more time `func_1()` must return a value greater than the current iteration count.**
