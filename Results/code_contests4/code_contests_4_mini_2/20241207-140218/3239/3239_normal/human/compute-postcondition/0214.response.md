The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is unknown, but it will now be `j + 1`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `j` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `j` is increased by 1**
