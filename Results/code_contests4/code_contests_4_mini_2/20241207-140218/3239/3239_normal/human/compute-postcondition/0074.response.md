The value of `g[7]` is assigned the value of `j`. Since `j` has been increased by 1, its current value (which is now greater than its previous value) is used to update `g[7]`. The state of `l` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is increased by 1; `l` now contains `j` appended to it; `g[7]` is now equal to `j`.

Output State: **`j` is increased by 1; `l` now contains `j` appended to it; `g[7]` is now equal to `j`.**
