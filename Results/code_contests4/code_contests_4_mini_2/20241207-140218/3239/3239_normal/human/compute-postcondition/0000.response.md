Output State: **args is a variable-length argument list where the first element is an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, followed by pairs of integers: each pair consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) indicating the number of composite integers in a sequence, and a list of n composite integers a_i (4 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000) for each test case. The total count of integers across all test cases does not exceed 10^4; and the output is printed to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default.**
