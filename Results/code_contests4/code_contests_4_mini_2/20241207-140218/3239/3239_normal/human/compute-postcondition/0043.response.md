The value of `j` is increased by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown. The code appends the current value of `j` to the list `l`. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, the first element of `a` is an odd integer that is not divisible by 3 or 5, is divisible by 7, the value of `f[4]` is false, and `j` is now appended to the list `l`.
