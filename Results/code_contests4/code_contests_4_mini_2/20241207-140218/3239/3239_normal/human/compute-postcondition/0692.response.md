Postcondition: ***`l` is either [0] or [1], `j` is either 0 or 1, `g` is either [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0] or [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the value returned from `func_4()`, `f` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], `i` is 0; if `a[i]` is divisible by 29, then `l` is [0], `j` is 0, `g` is either [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] or [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], and the value of `a[i]` is an odd number, not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and divisible by 29; otherwise, `l` is either [0] or [1], `j` is either 0 or 1, `g` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0] if `f[11]` is false, and [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] if `f[11]` is true, with the value of `a[i]` being an odd number, not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, and divisible by 31.***
