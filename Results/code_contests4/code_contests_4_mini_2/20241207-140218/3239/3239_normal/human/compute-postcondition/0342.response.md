Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0. If `f[5]` is 0, `j` remains 0, `l` contains one 0, and all other variables (`f`, `g`, `i`, and the properties of `a[i]`) remain unchanged. Otherwise, `j` is set to 1, `l` contains 1, `g` remains a list of twelve 0's with `g[5]` updated to 1, and all other variables (`f`, `i`, and the properties of `a[i]`) remain unchanged.***
