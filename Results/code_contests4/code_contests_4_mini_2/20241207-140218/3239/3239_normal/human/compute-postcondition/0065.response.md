Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, the first element of `a` is an odd integer that is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, or 11, is divisible by 13. If `f[6]` is true, `l` is updated by appending the value of `g[6]`. If `f[6]` is false, `j` is appended to the list `l`, and `g[6]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
