The code `l.append(j)` adds the current value of `j` to the list `l`. The value of `j` is increased by 1 in the initial state, which means `j` now holds a value that is one greater than its previous value (though the exact value is not specified). The variables `n` and `i` are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1, and `l` now contains the value of `j`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1, and `l` now contains the value of `j`.**
