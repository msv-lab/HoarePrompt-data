`l` is a list that can either be [0] or [1]. The value of `j` can be either 1 or 2. The `append` method is used to add the value of `j` to the list `l`. The other variables (`g`, `f`, `i`, `n`) are not affected by this operation. After the execution, `l` will have one additional element, which is either 1 or 2, depending on the value of `j`.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the possible new states of `l`:

If `l` was [0]: `l` becomes either [0, 1] or [0, 2].  
If `l` was [1]: `l` becomes either [1, 1] or [1, 2].

Output State: **`l` can be either [0, 1] or [0, 2]; or `l` can be either [1, 1] or [1, 2]; `j` is either 1 or 2; `g` is based on the conditions stated; `f` is [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]; `i` is 1; and for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1.**
