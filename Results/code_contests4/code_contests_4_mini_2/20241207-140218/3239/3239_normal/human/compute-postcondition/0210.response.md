The variable `g[1]` is assigned the value of `j`. The previous values indicate that `j` has been increased by 1 and is then appended to `l`, but we do not have the specific value of `j` after these operations. Since `n`, `i`, and `l` remain unaffected by this line of code, we only note the change to `g`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is the value after being increased by 1 and appended to `l`, and `g[1]` is assigned the value of `j`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is the value after being increased by 1 and appended to `l`, `g[1]` is assigned the value of `j`**.
