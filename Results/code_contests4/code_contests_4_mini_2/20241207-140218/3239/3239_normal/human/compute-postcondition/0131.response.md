In the provided code, `l.append(j)` adds the current value of `j` to the list `l`. The variable `j` has been increased by 1, but its specific value before the increment is not given. The variable `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, and `i` is 1, but these variables are not affected by the operation.

Since `j` was increased by 1 prior to this operation, it can be inferred that `j` has a specific value, but we don't know what that value was before the increment. Therefore, `j` is now at least 1 more than its previous value.

The output state reflects the addition of the current value of `j` to the list `l`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is the current value after being increased by 1, and `j` is appended to the list `l`.**
