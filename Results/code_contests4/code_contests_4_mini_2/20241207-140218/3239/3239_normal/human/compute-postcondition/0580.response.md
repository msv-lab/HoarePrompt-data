The variable `j` is assigned the value of 0. Since `j` was previously a count of unique identifiers, its value is now explicitly set to 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is an empty list; `j` is 0; `g` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]; `n` is the return value from `func_1()` which is greater than 0; `a` is assigned the value returned from `func_4(); `f` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

Output State: **`l` is an empty list; `j` is 0; `g` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]; `n` is the return value from `func_1()` which is greater than 0; `a` is assigned the value returned from `func_4(); `f` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]**.
