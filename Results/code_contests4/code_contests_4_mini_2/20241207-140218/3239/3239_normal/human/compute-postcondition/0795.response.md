The list `l` is updated by appending the current value of `j` to it. Given that `j` can be either 0 or 1, the value appended to `l` will also be either 0 or 1. The other variables `f` and `g` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` can be determined based on the value of `a[2]; `j` can be either 0 or 1; `i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 2; and `l` now contains the value of `j`.

Output State: **`l` can be determined based on the value of `a[2]; `j` can be either 0 or 1; `i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 2; and `l` now contains the value of `j`.**
