Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0. If `a[i]` is divisible by 11, then `f[5]` is set to 1, `j` is updated to 1, `l` contains 1, and `g[5]` is updated to 1, while `i` and the properties of `a[i]` remain unchanged. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 11 and is divisible by 13, then `j` remains 0, `l` is updated to [0], and the other variables retain their initial values. If the element at index 6 of list `f` is truthy, then `j` is set to 1, `l` is updated to [1], and `g[6]` is updated to 1, while `a[i]` retains its properties. If `a[i]` is divisible by 17, then `j` can be 0 or 1, `l` can be [0] or [1], `f[7]` is set to 1, `g[7]` is updated to 1 if `f[7]` was true, while `i` remains 0 and `a[i]` retains its properties. If `a[i]` is divisible by 19, then `f[8]` is set to true, `j` is 0, `l` is updated to [0], and `g`, `i`, and `a[i]` remain unchanged. If `a[i]` is divisible by 23, then `j` can be 0 or 1, `l` can be [0] or [1], `f[9]` is set to 1, while `g` remains a list of twelve 0's, `i` is still 0, and `a[i]` retains its properties. If `a[i]` is divisible by 29, then `f[10]` is set to 1, `j` remains 0, `l` is updated to [0], `i` is still 0, and `a[i]` retains its properties. If `a[i]` is divisible by 31, then `j` can be 0 or 1, `l` can be [0] or [1], `f` has its last element as 1, `g` is a list of eleven 0's followed by 1, `i` remains 0, and `a[i]` continues to be odd and not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, or 23.***
