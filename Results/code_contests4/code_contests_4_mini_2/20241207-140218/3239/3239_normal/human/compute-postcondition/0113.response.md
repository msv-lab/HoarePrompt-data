The code appends the current value of `j` to the list `l`. The previous state indicates that `j` has already been increased by 1, but the current value of `j` is not explicitly given. The output state reflects that `j` has been appended to `l`, and since `l` was not previously defined, we consider it as an empty list before the operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is increased by 1; `l` now contains the value of `j`. 

Output State: **`j` is increased by 1; `l` now contains the value of `j`**
