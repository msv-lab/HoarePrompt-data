The code `l.append(g[3])` appends the value of `g[3]` to the list `l`. The initial state indicates that `g` is a list containing only zeros, so `g[3]` is 0. 

Before execution:
- `l` is an empty list: `[]`
- `g[3]` is 0

After execution, `l` will contain one element, which is the value of `g[3]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is [0], `j` is 0, `g` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the value returned from `func_4()`, `f` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `i` is 0, the value of `a[i]` is an odd number, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is divisible by 5, and `f[3]` is true (non-zero).**
