The code `l.append(g[8])` appends the value of `g[8]` to the list `l`. The initial state indicates that `g` is a list of zeros, specifically `g = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Therefore, `g[8]` is 0.

Since `l` starts as an empty list, after executing the code, `l` will contain one element, which is the value 0 from `g[8]`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`l` is [0], `j` is 0, `g` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the value returned from `func_4()`, `f` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `i` is 0, the value of `a[i]` is an odd number, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, `a[i]` is not divisible by 11, `a[i]` is not divisible by 13, `a[i]` is not divisible by 17, `a[i]` is divisible by 19, and the value of `f[8]` is true (non-zero).**
