The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, the first element of `a` is an odd integer, the first element of `a` is not divisible by 3, the first element of `a` is not divisible by 5, the first element of `a` is divisible by 7, and the value of `f[4]` is false; variable `j` is increased by 1.
