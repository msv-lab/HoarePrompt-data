Postcondition: ***`l` is either [0] or [1], `j` is either 0 or 1. If `f[2]` is true (non-zero), then `l` is [0], `j` remains 0, and `g` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. If `f[2]` is false (0), then `l` is [1], `j` is 1, and `g` is [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the value returned from `func_4()`, `f` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `i` is 0, and the value of `a[i]` is an odd number that is divisible by 3.***
