The code appends the value of `g[4]` to the list `l`. The variable `g` is currently a list of twelve 0's, so `g[4]` is `0`. The list `l` is initially empty, and after appending `0`, it will contain one element which is `0`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `l` is [0], `f` is a list of twelve 0's, `g` is a list of twelve 0's, `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is odd, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, `a[i]` is divisible by 7, and the fifth element of `f` is true.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `l` is [0], `f` is a list of twelve 0's, `g` is a list of twelve 0's, `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is odd, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, `a[i]` is divisible by 7, and the fifth element of `f` is true.**
