`g[8]` is assigned the value of `j`. The initial state indicates that `j` has been increased by 1, and `l` includes this new value of `j`. Therefore, after executing the code, `g[8]` will hold the updated value of `j`. The other variables are not directly affected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`j` is increased by 1; `l` now includes the value of `j`; `g[8]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
