`g[5]` is assigned the value of `j`. The initial state indicates that `j` has been increased by 1 and `l` now contains the value of `j`, so the value of `j` is 1 greater than its previous state (which is unknown). The other variables `n` and `i` are not directly impacted by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1, `l` now contains the value of `j`, and `g[5]` is assigned the value of `j`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1, `l` now contains the value of `j`, `g[5]` is assigned the value of `j`**
