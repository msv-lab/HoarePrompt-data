The value at index 10 of the list `g` is 0, as `g` is initialized with all zeroes. The code `l.append(g[10])` appends this value (0) to the list `l`. The previous state of `l` was an empty list, so after this operation, `l` will contain one element, which is 0.

The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is [0], `j` is 0, `g` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the value returned from `func_4()`, `f` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `i` is 0, the value of `a[i]` is an odd number, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, `a[i]` is not divisible by 11, `a[i]` is not divisible by 13, `a[i]` is not divisible by 17, `a[i]` is not divisible by 19, `a[i]` is not divisible by 23, `a[i]` is divisible by 29, and the value of `f[10]` is truthy (non-zero).
