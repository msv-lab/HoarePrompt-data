Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, and the first element of `a` is an odd integer not divisible by 3, 5, or 7. If the first element of `a` is divisible by 11, then `f[5]` is incremented by 1. If the first element of `a` is not divisible by 11, and if it is divisible by 13, then `f[6]` is incremented by 1. If it is not divisible by 13 but is divisible by 17, then `f[7]` is increased by 1. If it is divisible by 19, then `f[8]` is updated by 1. If it is divisible by 23, then `f[9]` is increased by 1. If it is not divisible by 23 but is divisible by 29, then `f[10]` is incremented by 1. If it is not divisible by 23 or 29 but is divisible by 31, then `f[11]` is increased by 1. Variables `j`, `g[8]`, and `l` remain unchanged.***
