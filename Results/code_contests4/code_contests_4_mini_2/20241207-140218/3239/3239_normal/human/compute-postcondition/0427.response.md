The value of `f[2]` is incremented by 1. Since `f[2]` was initially true (assumed to be 1 or any non-zero value), it becomes greater than 1. The previous values of `j`, `l`, and `g[2]` are not affected by this operation, as the else condition is not executed. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `f[2]` is greater than 1, `l` remains unchanged, `j` remains unchanged, and `g[2]` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `f[2]` is greater than 1, `l` remains unchanged, `j` remains unchanged, `g[2]` remains unchanged**.
