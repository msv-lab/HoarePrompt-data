According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` in relation to `n`. Since `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is currently 0, the loop can execute at least once. After the current iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. Given that `i` is currently 0, for the loop to execute again, `i` will be updated to 1. Therefore, `i` must be 1 and `a[i]` will be the element being evaluated at index 1. 

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a[i]` is the element being evaluated**.
