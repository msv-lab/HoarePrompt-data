Postcondition: ***`l` is updated to include `g[2]` if `f[2]` is true; otherwise, `l` is determined based on the value of `a[2]`. In either case, `j` can be either 0 or 1, `f` and `g` may be updated accordingly, `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute a third time, `n` must be greater than 2. If `f[2]` is false, `j` is incremented by 1, `j` is appended to `l`, and `g[2]` is assigned the value of `j` (which is now either 1 or 2).***
