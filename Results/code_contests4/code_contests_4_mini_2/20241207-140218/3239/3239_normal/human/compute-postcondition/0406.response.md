Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0. If `a[i]` is divisible by 23, then `j` is either 0 or 1, `l` is either [0] or [1], `f` is a list of twelve 0's with `f[9]` updated to 1, `g` is a list of twelve 0's, `i` is still 0, and `a[i]` is odd and not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19. Otherwise, if `a[i]` is divisible by 29, then `f[10]` is set to 1, `j` remains 0, `l` is updated to [0], `i` is still 0, and `a[i]` is odd and not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, or 23. If `a[i]` is divisible by 31, then `j` is either 0 or 1, `l` is either [0] or [1], `f` has its last element as 1, `g` is a list of eleven 0's followed by 1, `i` is still 0, and `a[i]` retains its properties of being odd and not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, or 23.***
