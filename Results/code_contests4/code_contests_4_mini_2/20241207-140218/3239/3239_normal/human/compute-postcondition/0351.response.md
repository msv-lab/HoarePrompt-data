`g[6]` is assigned the value of `j`, which is 1. The previous value of `g[6]` is 0, so it will change to 1. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `l` is [1], `f` is a list of twelve 0's, `g` is a list of twelve with `g[6]` as 1, `i` is 0, and the element `a[i]` meets the specified conditions.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `l` is [1], `f` is a list of twelve 0's, `g` is a list of twelve with `g[6]` as 1, `i` is 0, and the element `a[i]` is odd, not divisible by 3, not divisible by 5, not divisible by 7, not divisible by 11, and divisible by 13.**
