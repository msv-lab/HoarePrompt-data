Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, and `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is divisible by 17, then `f[7]` is incremented by 1, `j` is an increased positive integer, and `g[7]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `a[i]` is divisible by 19, `f[8]` is incremented by 1, while `j` and `l` remain unchanged. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 19 but is divisible by 23, then `f[9]` is incremented by 1, with `j`, `l`, and `g[9]` remaining unspecified. If `a[i]` is neither divisible by 23 nor by 29 but is divisible by 31, then `f[11]` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `f[11]` remains unchanged. If `a[i]` is divisible by 29, then `f[10]` is incremented by 1, making `f[10]` true, and `l` is updated by appending `g[10]`.***
