Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `j` is either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `f[2]`. If `f[2]` is true (non-zero), then `l` is [0], and both `f` and `g` remain as lists of twelve 0's, while `i` is 0, with the element `a[i]` being odd and divisible by 3. If `f[2]` is false (zero), then `j` is 1, `l` is a list containing 1, `f` remains a list of twelve 0's, `g` is a list of twelve 0's with a 1 at index 2, and the element `a[i]` remains odd and divisible by 3.***
