The code `l.append(j)` appends the value of `j` to the list `l`. The state of `l` will change based on the value of `j`, which can be either 1 or 2. The other variables (`f`, `g`, `i`, and `n`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` can be determined based on the value of `a[2]`, `j` can be either 1 or 2, and `l` will now include the value of `j`.

Output State: **`l` can be determined based on the value of `a[2]`, `j` can be either 1 or 2, and `l` will now include the value of `j`.**
