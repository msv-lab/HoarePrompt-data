The value of `n` is assigned the result of the function call `func_1()`. Since `n` is stated to be greater than 0, it indicates that the function `func_1()` must return a value greater than 0 for the loop to execute again. However, the specific return value of `func_1()` is unknown. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a list containing unique sequential identifiers; `j` is the count of those unique identifiers; `g` is a list with indices 1 to 11 containing the last unique identifier assigned for respective divisors; `f` is a list indicating how many times each divisor condition was satisfied for elements in `a`; `n` is the return value from `func_1()` which is greater than 0.
