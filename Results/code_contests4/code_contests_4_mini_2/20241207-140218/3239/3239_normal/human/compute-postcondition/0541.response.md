The code `f[8] += 1` increments the value of `f[8]` by 1. The initial state does not provide the specific value of `f[8]`, so we cannot determine its exact value after the increment. However, it will certainly be greater than or equal to its previous value. The other variables `n`, `i`, `j`, and `g[8]` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State reflects the change in `f[8]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2; `f[8]` is increased by 1.**
