The value of `j` is appended to the list `l`. Since `j` has been increased by 1 previously, the exact value of `j` is now known. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a[i]` is the element being evaluated, and `j` is the value increased by 1 which is appended to `l`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a[i]` is the element being evaluated, `j` is increased by 1 and appended to `l`.**
