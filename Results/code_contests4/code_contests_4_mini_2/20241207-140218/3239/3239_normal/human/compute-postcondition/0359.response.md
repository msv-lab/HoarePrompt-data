`j` is incremented by 1, and its previous value is 0. Thus, after execution, `j` becomes 1. The states of the other variables (`n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `i`, `a`, and the condition checks) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `l` is an empty list, `f` is a list of twelve 0's, `g` is a list of twelve 0's, `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is odd, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, `a[i]` is not divisible by 11, `a[i]` is not divisible by 13, and `a[i]` is divisible by 17, and the 8th element of `f` (i.e., `f[7]`) is 0.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `l` is an empty list, `f` is a list of twelve 0's, `g` is a list of twelve 0's, `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is odd, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, `a[i]` is not divisible by 11, `a[i]` is not divisible by 13, and `a[i]` is divisible by 17, and the 8th element of `f` (i.e., `f[7]`) is 0.**
