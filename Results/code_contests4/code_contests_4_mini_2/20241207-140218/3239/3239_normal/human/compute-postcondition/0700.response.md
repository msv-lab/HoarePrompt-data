Postcondition: ***`l` can be either [0] or [1], `j` can be either 0 or 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 3, then `l` is [0], `j` remains 0, and `g` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, then if `a[i]` is divisible by 5, `g` is either [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (if `f[3]` was true) or [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (if `f[3]` was false), `n` remains greater than 0, `a` is the value returned from `func_4()`, `f` is [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]; `i` is 0; the value of `a[i]` is an odd number not divisible by 3. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, then if `a[i]` is divisible by 7, `g` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] and `f` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], with `a[i]` still an odd number not divisible by 3, 5, or 7. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, the conditions on `l`, `j`, `g`, and `f` remain as described, with additional checks for divisibility by 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, and 31, affecting the values of `f` and `g` accordingly, while `a[i]` continues to be an odd number not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, and divisible by 31.***
