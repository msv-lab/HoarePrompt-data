`f[4]` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `f[4]` is 0 (as `f` is [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]), so after executing the line, `f[4]` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` can be either [0, 0] or [1, 0]; `j` can be either 0 or 1; `g` is based on the conditions stated; `f` is [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]; `i` is 1.

Output State: **`l` can be either [0, 0] or [1, 0]; `j` can be either 0 or 1; `g` is based on the conditions stated; `f` is [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]; `i` is 1.**
