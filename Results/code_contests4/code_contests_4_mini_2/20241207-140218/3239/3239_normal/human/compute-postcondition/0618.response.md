The code assigns the value of `j` to `g[4]`. Given the initial state, `j` is 1, and `g` is a list that initially has all elements set to 0. Therefore, after executing `g[4] = j`, the value of `g[4]` will change from 0 to 1 while the rest of the elements in `g` remain unchanged. 

The output state reflects the updated value of `g[4]` along with the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`l` is [1], `j` is 1, `g` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the value returned from `func_4()`, `f` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `i` is 0, the value of `a[i]` is an odd number, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, `a[i]` is divisible by 7, and `f[4]` is 0.**
