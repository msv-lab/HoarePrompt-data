Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, and the first element of `a` is an odd integer that is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, or 13, and is divisible by 17. If `f[7]` is true, `g[7]` is appended to `l`. Otherwise, `j` is increased by 1, `j` is appended to `l`, and `g[7]` is now equal to `j`.***
