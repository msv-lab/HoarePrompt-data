The value of `j` is incremented by 1. However, the previous value of `j` is unknown, and since `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, we can infer that the loop still has the potential to execute again. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `j` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `j` is increased by 1**
