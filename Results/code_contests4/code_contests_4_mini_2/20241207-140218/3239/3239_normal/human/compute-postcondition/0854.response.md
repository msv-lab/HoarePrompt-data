Postcondition: ***`l` is determined based on the value of `a[2]`. If `a[2] % 7 == 0`, `l` is updated to include `g[4]` if `f[4]` is true, otherwise it is set based on `a[2]`; `j` can be either 0 or 1 if `f[4]` is true, or 1 or 2 if `f[4]` is false, and `f[4]` is incremented by 1. If `f[4]` is false, `g[4]` is assigned the value of `j`. If `a[2] % 11 == 0`, `l` is updated by appending `g[5]` if `f[5]` is true, and `f[5]` is incremented; if false, `l` is updated to include `j`. If `a[2] % 17 == 0`, `f[7]` is incremented and `l` is updated by appending `g[7]` if true, otherwise by `j`. If `a[2] % 19 == 0`, `l` is updated by appending either `g[8]` or `j` depending on `f[8]`, with `g[8]` assigned to `j` and `f[8]` incremented. If `a[2] % 23 == 0`, `f[9]` is incremented; if `a[2] % 29 == 0`, `f[10]` is incremented; if `a[2] % 31 == 0`, `f[11]` is incremented; otherwise, `f[11]` remains unchanged. The value of `i` remains 2, and for the loop to execute a third time, `n` must be greater than 2.***
