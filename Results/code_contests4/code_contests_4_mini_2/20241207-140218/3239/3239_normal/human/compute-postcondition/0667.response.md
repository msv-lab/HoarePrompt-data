The value of `j` is appended to the list `l`. Since `j` is 1, after execution, `l` will contain the value `[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is [1], `j` is 1, `g` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the value returned from `func_4()`, `f` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `i` is 0, the value of `a[i]` is an odd number, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, `a[i]` is not divisible by 11, `a[i]` is not divisible by 13, `a[i]` is not divisible by 17, `a[i]` is not divisible by 19, `a[i]` is divisible by 23, and the 10th element of `f` is 0 (i.e., `f[9]` is false.
