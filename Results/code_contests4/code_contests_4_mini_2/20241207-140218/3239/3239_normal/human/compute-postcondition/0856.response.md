Postcondition: ***`l` can be determined based on the value of `a[2]`. If `a[2]` is divisible by 3, `l` is updated to include `g[2]` if `f[2]` is true; otherwise, it is set based on `a[2]`, and `f[2]` is incremented by 1. If `a[2]` is not divisible by 3 and is divisible by 5, `f[3]` is incremented by 1, `j` can be either 0 or 1, and `g[3]` is assigned the value of `j`. If `a[2]` is not divisible by 5, `l` is determined based on the value of `a[2]`. If `a[2]` is divisible by 7, `l` is updated to include `g[4]` if `f[4]` is true; otherwise, it is set based on `a[2]`, and `j` varies depending on the truth value of `f[4]`. If `a[2]` is divisible by 11, `l` is updated by appending `g[5]` if `f[5]` is true; if false, `l` includes `j`. If `a[2]` is divisible by 17, `f[7]` is incremented and `l` is updated by appending `g[7]` if true, otherwise by `j`. If `a[2]` is divisible by 19, `l` is updated by appending either `g[8]` or `j` depending on `f[8]`, with `g[8]` assigned to `j` and `f[8]` incremented. If `a[2]` is divisible by 23, `f[9]` is incremented; if `a[2]` is divisible by 29, `f[10]` is incremented; if `a[2]` is divisible by 31, `f[11]` is incremented; otherwise, `f[11]` remains unchanged. The value of `i` remains 2, and for the loop to execute a third time, `n` must be greater than 2.***
