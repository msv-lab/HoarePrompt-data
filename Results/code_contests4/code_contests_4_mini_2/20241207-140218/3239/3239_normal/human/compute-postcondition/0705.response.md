The list `l` will have the value of `j` appended to it. Since `l` can either be `[0]` or `[1]`, the possible outcomes for `l` after the operation would be `[0, 1]` or `[1, 1]` depending on its initial state. The variable `j` can either be `1` or `2`, but since the code only appends `j` to `l`, the output state will capture both possibilities.

Therefore, the Output State is: `l` can be either [0] or [1]; after appending `j`, `l` can be either [0, 1] or [0, 2] or [1, 1] or [1, 2]. 

Output State: **`l` can be either [0] or [1]; after appending `j`, `l` can be either [0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 1], or [1, 2]**
