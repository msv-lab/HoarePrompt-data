Postcondition: ***`l` can be either [0] or [1], `j` can be either 0 or 1. If `a[i]` is even, then `g` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] if `f[1]` is true or [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] if `f[1]` is false. If `a[i]` is odd and not divisible by 3, then if `a[i]` is divisible by 5, `g` is either [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (if `f[3]` was true) or [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (if `f[3]` was false), while `n` remains greater than 0, `f` is [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], and `i` is 0. If `a[i]` is odd and not divisible by 3 or 5, then if it's divisible by 7, `g` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] and `f` becomes [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. If not divisible by 7, the conditions on `l`, `j`, `g`, and `f` are maintained, with further checks for divisibility by 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, and 31, with `a[i]` remaining an odd number not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29 and divisible by 31.***
