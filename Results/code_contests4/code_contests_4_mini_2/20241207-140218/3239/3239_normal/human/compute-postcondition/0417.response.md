The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, and `a[i]`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a[i]` is the element being evaluated, and `j` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a[i]` is the element being evaluated, and `j` is increased by 1.**
