Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `j` is either 0 or 1, `l` is either [0] or [1], `f` is a list of twelve 0's if `f[11]` is true, otherwise `f` remains a list of twelve 0's with the last element unchanged. The list `g` is a list of twelve 0's if `f[11]` is true, but becomes a list of eleven 0's followed by 1 if `f[11]` is false. The integer `i` remains 0, and the element `a[i]` retains its properties as odd and not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, and is divisible by 31.***
