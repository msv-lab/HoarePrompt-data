Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, if the element at index 6 of list `f` is truthy, then `j` remains 0, `l` is updated to [0], and the other variables retain their initial values. Otherwise, `j` is set to 1, `l` is updated to [1], `g` has its element at index 6 set to 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The element `a[i]` is odd, not divisible by 3, not divisible by 5, not divisible by 7, not divisible by 11, and divisible by 13 in both cases.***
