The code assigns the value of `j` to the index 4 of the list `g`. The previous value of `j` was not specified, but we know that `j` has been increased by 1 and appended to the list `l`. Since `n` is greater than 0 and does not affect the assignment, we focus on the assignment to `g[4]`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2; `j` is increased by 1 and appended to the list `l`; `g[4]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
