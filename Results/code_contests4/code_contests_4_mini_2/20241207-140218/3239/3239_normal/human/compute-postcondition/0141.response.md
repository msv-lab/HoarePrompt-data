In the given code, the command `l.append(g[3])` attempts to append the value at index 3 of the list (or array) `g` to the list `l`. However, the variables `l` and `g` are not mentioned in the initial state, which implies that their values or states are unknown.

Since `l` is expected to be a list where the value from `g[3]` will be appended, and `g` should be a list or similar structure with at least 4 elements to access the index 3, we cannot determine the new state of `l` or the value being appended without knowing the current state of `g`.

Therefore, the output state reflects the inability to determine what `l` holds after the operation, while acknowledging that the operation is meant to append a value from `g` to `l`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1; `l` is unchanged, and `g` is undefined or not provided.**
