Postcondition: ***`f` is [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0] if `a[i] % 17 == 0`; `l` can be either [0] or [1] with an additional element `g[7]`; `j` can be either 1 or 2; `g[7]` is either 1 or 2; `i` is 1. If `a[i] % 19 == 0`, then `f` is [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], `l` can be either [0, g[8]] or [1, g[8]], `j` can be either 0 or 1, and `g` is as defined by the conditions stated, with `i` equal to 1. If `a[i] % 19 != 0`, and if `a[i] % 23 == 0`, `f[9]` is True, allowing `l` to be either [0, 0] or [1, 0]; `j` can be either 0 or 1; `g` follows the conditions stated, and `f` is [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0] with `i` being 1. If `a[i] % 23 != 0`, and if `a[i] % 29 == 0`, then `f[10]` is either 1 or 2, `j` can be either 1 or 2, and `g[10]` is either 1 or 2 with `i` equal to 1. If `a[i] % 31 == 0`, then `l` can be either [0, g[11]] or [1, g[11]], `f[11]` is true, `j` can be either 0 or 1, and `g` is as defined by the conditions stated with `f` being [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], and `i` is 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 31, `l` remains unchanged.***
