The code `l.append(g[2])` appends the value at index 2 of the list `g` to the list `l`. However, the initial state of `g` is not provided. Therefore, the value of `g[2]` cannot be determined. As a result, we cannot ascertain the new value of `l`. The values of other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`l` can be either [0] or [1]; `j` can be either 0 or 1; `g` is based on the conditions stated; `f` is [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]; `i` is 1; `l` is appended with the value of `g[2]`, which is unknown.**
