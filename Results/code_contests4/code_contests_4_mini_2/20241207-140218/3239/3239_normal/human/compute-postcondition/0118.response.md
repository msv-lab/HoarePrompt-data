Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, and the first element of `a` is an odd integer not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, or 29. If the first element of `a` is divisible by 29, then `f[10]` is incremented by 1. If the first element of `a` is not divisible by 29 but is divisible by 31, then `f[11]` is increased by 1.***
