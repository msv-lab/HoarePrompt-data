The code `l.append(g[4])` appends the value at index 4 of list `g` to list `l`. Given the initial state, list `g` contains 12 elements, all of which are 0, i.e., `g` is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Therefore, the value at index 4 of `g` is `0`. 

The previous value of `l` is an empty list, `[]`. After the execution of the code, `l` will now contain one element, which is `0`.

The values of `j`, `n`, `a`, `f`, and `i` remain unchanged. 

Thus, the Output State is: `l` is [0], `j` is 0, `g` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the value returned from `func_4()`, `f` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `i` is 0, the value of `a[i]` is an odd number, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, `a[i]` is divisible by 7, and the fifth element of `f` is true (non-zero).

Output State: **`l` is [0], `j` is 0, `g` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the value returned from `func_4()`, `f` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `i` is 0, the value of `a[i]` is an odd number, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, `a[i]` is divisible by 7, and the fifth element of `f` is true (non-zero).**
