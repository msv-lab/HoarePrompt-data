The code `l.append(g[1])` appends the value of `g[1]` to the list `l`. Given that `g` is a list of twelve 0's, `g[1]` is 0. Therefore, after executing the code, the list `l`, which was initially empty, will now contain one element which is 0. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `l` is [0], `f` is a list of twelve 0's, `g` is a list of twelve 0's, `i` is 0, the `i`-th element of `a` is even, and the second element of `f` is true (non-zero).**
