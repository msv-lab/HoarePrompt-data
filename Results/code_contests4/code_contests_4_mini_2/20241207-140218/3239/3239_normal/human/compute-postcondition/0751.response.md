The value of `g[9]` is accessed, which corresponds to `f[0]` since `g` is based on conditions. The initial state indicates that `f` is `[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, and thus `g[9]` is `0`. 

Since `l` can initially be either `[0]` or `[1]`, appending `0` to `l` will result in either `[0, 0]` or `[1, 0]`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` can be either `[0, 0]` or `[1, 0]`, `j` can be either 0 or 1, `g` is based on the conditions stated, `f` is `[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, and `i` is 1.

Output State: **`l` can be either [0, 0] or [1, 0]; `j` can be either 0 or 1; `g` is based on the conditions stated; `f` is [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]; `i` is 1.**
