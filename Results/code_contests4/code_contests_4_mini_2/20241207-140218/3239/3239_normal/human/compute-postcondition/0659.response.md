Postcondition: ***`l` is a list that will be [0] if `f[8]` is true (non-zero), and it will be [1] if `f[8]` is false (0). In both cases, `j` is 0 if `f[8]` is true and 1 if `f[8]` is false. The list `g` is updated to [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0] if `f[8]` is false, while remaining unchanged as [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] if `f[8]` is true. The variables `n`, `a`, and `f` retain their states as described in the precondition, with the value of `a[i]` being an odd number that is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, or 17 and is divisible by 19.***
