The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is unknown, so we cannot determine its specific new value. However, `i` remains unchanged at 2, and `n` is still greater than 0 with the condition for the loop to execute a second time. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, and `j` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, and `j` is increased by 1**
