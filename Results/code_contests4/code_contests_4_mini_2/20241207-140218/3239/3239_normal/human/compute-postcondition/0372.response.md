Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0. If `f[8]` is true, then `j` remains 0, `l` is updated to [0], and all other variables (`f`, `g`, `i`, `a[i]`) remain unchanged. Otherwise, `j` is updated to 1, `l` is updated to [1], `g` has `g[8]` updated to 1, and all other variables (`f`, `i`, `a[i]`) remain unchanged, while `f[8]` is 0.***
