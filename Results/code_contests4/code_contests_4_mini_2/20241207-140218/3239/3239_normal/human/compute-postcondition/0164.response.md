The value of `f[6]` is incremented by 1. The previous state of `f[6]` is not provided, but it is initially true. This means that `f[6]` can now be either true or false depending on its previous value. The states of other variables (`n`, `i`, `j`, `l`, and `g[6]`) are not affected directly by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `f[6]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `f[6]` is incremented by 1, and the states of `j`, `l`, and `g[6]` remain unchanged.**
