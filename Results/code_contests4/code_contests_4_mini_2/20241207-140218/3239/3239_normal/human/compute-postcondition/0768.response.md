The value of `f[11]` is incremented by 1. Initially, `f[11]` is 0, so after the execution, `f[11]` becomes 1. The values of all other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` can either be [0, g[11]] or [1, g[11]] if `f[11]` is true, with `j` being either 0 or 1, `g` based on the conditions stated, `f` is [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], and `i` is 1.

Output State: **`l` can either be [0, g[11]] or [1, g[11]] if `f[11]` is true, with `j` being either 0 or 1, `g` based on the conditions stated, `f` is [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], and `i` is 1.**
