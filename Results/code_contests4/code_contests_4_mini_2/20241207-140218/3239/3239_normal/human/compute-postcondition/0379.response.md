`j` is incremented by 1, so its value changes from 0 to 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `l` is an empty list, `f` is a list of twelve 0's, `g` is a list of twelve 0's, `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is odd, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, `a[i]` is not divisible by 11, `a[i]` is not divisible by 13, `a[i]` is not divisible by 17, and `a[i]` is not divisible by 19, and `a[i]` is divisible by 23; the 10th element of `f` is 0.
