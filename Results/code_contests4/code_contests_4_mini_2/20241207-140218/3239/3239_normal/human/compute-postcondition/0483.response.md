Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 29, then `f[10]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 29 and is divisible by 31, then `f[11]` is increased by 1. If `f[11]` was previously false, `j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the value of `j` appended to it, and `g[11]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
