The code `l.append(j)` adds the current value of `j` to the list `l`. The value of `j` has been previously mentioned as "increased by 1," but its specific value is not provided. The variables `n` and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `j` has been appended to the list `l`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1, and `j` has been appended to the list `l`.**
