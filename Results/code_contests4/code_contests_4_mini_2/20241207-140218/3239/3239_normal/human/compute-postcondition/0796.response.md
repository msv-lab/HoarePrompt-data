The statement `g[3] = j` assigns the value of `j` to the index 3 of the list `g`. The value of `j` can either be 0 or 1. The state of `l` is determined by the value of `j`, so if `j` is 0, then `l` is 0, and if `j` is 1, then `l` is 1. The variable `n` is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the possible values of `j` and `l` based on the assignment.

Output State: **`l` can be determined based on the value of `a[2]; `j` can be either 0 or 1; `i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 2; `g[3]` is assigned the value of `j`**
