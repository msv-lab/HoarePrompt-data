Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 17, then `f[7]` is greater than its previous value, while the values of `l`, `j`, and `g[7]` remain uncertain. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 17, and if `a[i]` is divisible by 19, then `f[8]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 23, then `f[9]` is updated by adding 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 29, then `f[10]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 31 but not by 29, then `f[11]` is increased by 1, and if `f[11]` was previously false, `j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the value of `j` appended to it, and `g[11]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
