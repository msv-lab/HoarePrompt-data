Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `j` is either 0 or 1, `l` is either [0] or [1], `f` is a list of twelve 0's, `g` is a list of twelve 0's with `g[9]` updated to 1 if `f[9]` is false, `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is odd and meets various divisibility conditions, specifically, it is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, or 19, and it is divisible by 23. If `f[9]` is true, then `j` remains 0 and `l` is [0]. Otherwise, `j` is updated to 1 and `l` is [1].***
