Postcondition: ***`l` can be either [0, g[3]] or [1, g[3]] when `a[i]` is divisible by 5, while `j` can be either 0 or 1, `g` is based on the conditions stated, `f` is updated to [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], and `i` remains 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, then `l` can be either [0, 0] or [1, 0] if `a[i]` is divisible by 7, leading to `f` being updated to [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] and `i` becoming 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, then `l` can either be [0, g[5]] or [1, g[5]] if `f[5]` is true; if false, possible values for `l` include [0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 1], or [1, 2] with `j` being either 1 or 2. Further, if `a[i]` is divisible by 13, `l` can be either [0] or [1] depending on `f[6]`, with `f` updated to [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] and `i` remaining 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 17, `f` updates to [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], allowing `l` to be [0] or [1] with an extra element `g[7]`, and `j` can still be either 1 or 2. If `a[i]` is divisible by 19, `f` updates to [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], and `l` can be [0, g[8]] or [1, g[8]]. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 19 but is divisible by 23, `f` updates to [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0] and `l` can be [0, 0] or [1, 0], with `j` being either 0 or 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 23 but divisible by 29, `f[10]` can take values 1 or 2, with `j` either 1 or 2 and `g[10]` being either 1 or 2. Finally, if `a[i]` is divisible by 31, `l` can be either [0, g[11]] or [1, g[11]], with `f[11]` true, `j` can be either 0 or 1, while `i` remains 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 31, `l` remains unchanged.***
