The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is 0. Therefore, after execution, `j` becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `l` is an empty list, `f` is a list of twelve 0's, `g` is a list of twelve 0's, `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is odd, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, `a[i]` is not divisible by 11, `a[i]` is not divisible by 13, `a[i]` is not divisible by 17, `a[i]` is not divisible by 19, `a[i]` is not divisible by 23, and `a[i]` is divisible by 29, and the element `f[10]` is 0.**
