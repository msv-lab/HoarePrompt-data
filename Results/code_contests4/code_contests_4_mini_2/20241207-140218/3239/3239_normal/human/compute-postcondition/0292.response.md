The assignment `g = [0] * 12` initializes `g` to be a list containing twelve 0's. However, since the initial state already states that `g` remains unchanged, we can conclude that the previous value of `g` is preserved, and a new assignment is made to `g` that doesn't affect the other variables.

Thus, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the new assignment to `g`. 

Output State: **`n` is assigned the value returned by `func_1()`, which must be greater than the current iteration count; `j` remains unchanged; `l` is now an empty list; `f` is a list of twelve 0's; `g` is now a list of twelve 0's.**
