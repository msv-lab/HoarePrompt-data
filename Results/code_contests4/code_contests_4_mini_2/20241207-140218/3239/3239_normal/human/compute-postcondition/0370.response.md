The code `l.append(j)` adds the value of `j` to the list `l`. The initial value of `j` is 1, and `l` is currently an empty list. After executing this line, `l` will contain the value 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `l` is [1], `f` is a list of twelve 0's, `g` is a list of twelve 0's, `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is odd, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, `a[i]` is not divisible by 11, `a[i]` is not divisible by 13, `a[i]` is not divisible by 17, `a[i]` is divisible by 19, and `f[8]` is 0.**
