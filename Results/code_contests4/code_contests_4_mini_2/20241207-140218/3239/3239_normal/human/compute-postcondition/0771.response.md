Postcondition: ***`l` can be either [0] or [1]. If `a[i] % 23 == 0`, then `f[9]` is True, allowing `l` to be either [0, 0] or [1, 0]; `j` can be either 0 or 1; `g` is based on the conditions stated; `f` is [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]; `i` is 1. If `a[i] % 23 != 0`, and if `a[i] % 29 == 0`, then `f[10]` is either 1 or 2, `j` can be either 1 or 2, and `g[10]` is either 1 or 2 with `i` equal to 1. If `a[i] % 31 == 0`, then `l` can be either [0, g[11]] or [1, g[11]], `f[11]` is true, `j` can be either 0 or 1, and `g` follows the conditions stated with `f` being [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], and `i` is 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 31, `l` remains unchanged.***
