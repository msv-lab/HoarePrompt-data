The code `l.append(j)` adds the current value of `j` to the list `l`. Since `j` is stated to be "increased by 1," we assume `j` has a specific value based on the context that it was incremented prior to this operation. However, since we don't have the exact previous value of `j`, we cannot determine the specific integer that is being appended to `l`. 

The variable `n` remains unaffected, and while `i` is given as 2, it does not impact the execution of the append operation. Thus, the output state reflects the change made by appending `j` to the list `l`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1, and `j` is appended to `l`.**
