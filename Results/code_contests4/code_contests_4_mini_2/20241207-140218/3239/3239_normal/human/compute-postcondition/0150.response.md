In the provided code snippet, `g[4]` is being assigned the value of `j`. The initial state indicates that `j` has been increased by 1 and is also appended to the list `l`. However, since the exact value of `j` before it was increased is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `j` after the increment.

Since `n` is a positive integer greater than 1 and does not affect the assignment to `g[4]`, the output state will reflect the previous values of the variables along with the assignment that occurs.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is increased by 1, and `g[4]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
