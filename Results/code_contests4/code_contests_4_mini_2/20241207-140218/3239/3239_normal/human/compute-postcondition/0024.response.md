The function `func_8` accepts a variable-length argument list `args`. The first element of `args` is an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`. Following `t`, there are pairs of integers for each test case: an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) indicating the number of composite integers in a sequence, and a list of `n` composite integers `a_i` (4 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000). The total count of integers across all test cases does not exceed 10^4. 

Based on the provided output information, the function processes the input for the specified test cases and returns results according to the logic defined within the function. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a variable-length argument list `args`, where the first element is an integer `t` (number of test cases), followed by pairs of integers representing the number of composite integers and their respective lists. It processes these inputs and returns results based on the defined logic for the test cases.**
