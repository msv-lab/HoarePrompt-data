The value of `g[9]` is assigned the value of `j`. The variable `j` can either be 1 or 2, but we don't know its current value. Therefore, `g[9]` can also be either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `j`. The other variables, `l`, `f`, and `i`, remain unaffected. Thus, the output state is: `l` can be either [0, 1] or [1, 2]; `j` can be either 1 or 2; `g[9]` is either 1 or 2; `f` is [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]; `i` is 1.

Output State: **`l` can be either [0, 1] or [1, 2]; `j` can be either 1 or 2; `g[9]` is either 1 or 2; `f` is [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]; `i` is 1**
