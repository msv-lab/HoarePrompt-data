The assignment `g[6] = j` assigns the current value of `j` to the 6th index of the list `g`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `l` are not altered by this operation, but the value of `j` is used to update the list. Since `j` was increased by 1 before this operation, it holds a value of at least 1. The exact value of `j` is unknown as it is not provided, but it's assumed to be greater than or equal to 1 after the increment.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is increased by 1; `l` now contains the value of `j`, and `g[6]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
