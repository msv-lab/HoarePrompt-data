According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `args`. If `args` contains at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `sep` and `file` do not affect the execution of the loop, but `at_start` is True. Therefore, for the loop to be executed the first time, `args` must contain at least 1 element, and `x` will be the first element in the `args` list.

State: **`sep` is the value of kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), `file` is the value of kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout), `at_start` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `args` is a list with at least 1 element, and `x` is the first element in `args`**
