According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `args`. If `args` has at least 3 elements, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `args` is a list with at least 2 elements, and `at_start` remains False. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, the `args` list must have at least 3 elements, and the variable `x` will represent the third element in the list.

State: **`sep` is the value of kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), `file` is the value of kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout), `at_start` is False, `args` is a list with at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in the list**.
