Output State: **`l` can be determined based on the value of `a[2]`; if `f[8]` is true, `l` is updated by appending `g[8]`; if `f[8]` is false, `j` can be either 1 or 2, `j` is appended to `l`, and `g[8]` is assigned the value of `j`; `f[8]` is updated by adding 1; `i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 2.**
