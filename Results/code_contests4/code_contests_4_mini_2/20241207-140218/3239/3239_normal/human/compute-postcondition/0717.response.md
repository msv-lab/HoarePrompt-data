The value of `j` can be either 1 or 2, and `l` can be either [0] or [1]. The `append` method adds the value of `j` to the end of the list `l`. Therefore, the possible results for `l` after the operation will be:

- If `l` is [0] and `j` is 1, then `l` becomes [0, 1].
- If `l` is [0] and `j` is 2, then `l` becomes [0, 2].
- If `l` is [1] and `j` is 1, then `l` becomes [1, 1].
- If `l` is [1] and `j` is 2, then `l` becomes [1, 2].

The states of the other variables (`g`, `f`, `i`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is summarized as follows:

Output State: **`l` can be either [0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 1], or [1, 2]; `j` can be either 1 or 2; `g` is based on the conditions stated; `f` is [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]; `i` is 1.**
