Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 2 and `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is even, then `f[1]` is incremented by 1 while the values of `l`, `j`, and `g[1]` remain unchanged. If `a[i]` is odd, and it is divisible by 3, then `f[2]` is increased by 1; if not, but it is divisible by 5, `f[3]` is increased by 1; if not, but it is divisible by 7, `f[4]` is incremented by 1; if not, but it is divisible by 11, `f[5]` is incremented by 1; if not, but it is divisible by 13, `f[6]` is incremented by 1; if not, but it is divisible by 17, `f[7]` is incremented by 1 and `j` is increased; if not, but it is divisible by 19, `f[8]` is incremented by 1; if not, but it is divisible by 23, `f[9]` is incremented by 1; if not, but it is divisible by 31, `f[11]` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `f[11]` remains unchanged; if not divisible by 31 but divisible by 29, `f[10]` is incremented by 1, making `f[10]` true, and `l` is updated by appending `g[10]`.***
