The value of `g[7]` is assigned the value of `j`. The variable `j` can either be 1 or 2. Therefore, `g[7]` will take on either of these values depending on the current state of `j`. Since `g` is based on conditions, its previous values are not explicitly defined in the initial state, but the only variable that is affected by this assignment is `g[7]`.

Output State: **`l` can be either [0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 1], or [1, 2]; `j` can be either 1 or 2; `g[7]` is either 1 or 2; `f` is [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]; `i` is 1**
