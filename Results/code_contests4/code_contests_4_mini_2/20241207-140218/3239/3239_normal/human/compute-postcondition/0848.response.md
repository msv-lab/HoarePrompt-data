Postcondition: ***`l` can be determined based on the value of `a[2]`. If `a[i] % 29 == 0`, then `f[10]` is incremented by 1, `j` can be either 0 or 1, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2. Otherwise, if `a[i] % 31 == 0`, then `f[11]` is incremented by 1; if `a[i] % 31` is not equal to 0, there is no update to `f[11]`.***
