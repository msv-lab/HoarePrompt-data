Postcondition: ***`l` can be either [0, g[3]] or [1, g[3]] when `f[3]` is True, while `j` can be either 0 or 1, `g` is based on the conditions stated, `f` is [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], and `i` is 1. If `f[3]` is False, then `l` can be either [0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 1], or [1, 2]; `j` can be either 1 or 2; `g` is either [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] or [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]; `f` remains [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]; and `i` is still 1.***
