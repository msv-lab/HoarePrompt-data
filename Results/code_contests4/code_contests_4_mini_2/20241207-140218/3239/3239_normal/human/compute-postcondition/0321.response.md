The value of `g[3]` is assigned the value of `j`, which is 1. The previous values of `g` indicate that it is a list of twelve 0's, so after execution, `g[3]` will be updated to 1 while the other elements remain unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `l` is now [1], `f` is a list of twelve 0's, `g` is now [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is odd, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is divisible by 5, and the fourth element of `f` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `l` is now [1], `f` is a list of twelve 0's, `g` is now [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is odd, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is divisible by 5, and the fourth element of `f` is 0.**
