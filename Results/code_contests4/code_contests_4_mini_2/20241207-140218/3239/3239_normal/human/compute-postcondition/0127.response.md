Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and `i` is 0. If `a[i]` is an even integer, then `f[1]` is incremented while `j`, `g[1]`, and `l` remain unchanged. Otherwise, if `a[0]` is an odd integer, `f[2]` is incremented if `a[0]` is divisible by 3, `f[3]` is incremented if it is divisible by 5, `f[4]` is incremented if it is divisible by 7, `f[5]` is incremented if it is divisible by 11, `f[6]` is incremented if it is divisible by 13, `f[7]` is incremented if it is divisible by 17, `f[8]` is incremented if it is divisible by 19, `f[9]` is incremented if it is divisible by 23, `f[10]` is incremented if it is divisible by 29, and `f[11]` is incremented if it is divisible by 31; while `j`, `g[1]`, and `l` remain unchanged.***
