The statement `g[4] = j` assigns the value of `j` to the fifth element of the list `g` (since list indexing starts at 0). The previous state of `g` is not provided, so we don't know its value prior to this assignment. However, we know that the assignment does not affect the other variables, so we will only note the assignment.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, the first element of `a` is an odd integer that is not divisible by 3 or 5, is divisible by 7, the value of `f[4]` is false, `j` is now appended to the list `l`, and `g[4]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
