The value of `j` is 1, and the code appends this value to the list `l`. Since `l` is initially an empty list, after execution, `l` will contain the single element 1. The other variables' states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is [1], `j` is 1, `g` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the value returned from `func_4()`, `f` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `i` is 0, the element `a[i]` is even, and `f[1]` is false.**
