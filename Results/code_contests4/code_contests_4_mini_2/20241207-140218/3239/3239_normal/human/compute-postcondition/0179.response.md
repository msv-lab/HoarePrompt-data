The code `l.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` to the list `l`. The previous value of `j` is stated to be "increased by 1", but its exact value is not provided in the initial state. The variable `n` and `i` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State reflects the addition of `j` to the list `l`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is increased by 1, and `j` has been appended to the list `l`.**
