The variable `j` is being appended to the list `l`, which will not affect the values of `n` or `i`, but it will include the current value of `j` in the list `l`. Since `j` is already stated to be increased by 1, we assume it has a specific value, but its value is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `j` at this moment, only that it has been incremented.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1, and `l` now includes the current value of `j`.**
