The code appends the current value of `j` to the list `l`. The initial state indicates that `j` has already been increased by 1, but the specific value of `j` is not provided. Therefore, the output state reflects the action taken without specifying the exact value of `j`. The variable `l` is also affected as it now contains the new value of `j`.

Output State: **`j` is increased by 1; `l` now includes the value of `j`.**
