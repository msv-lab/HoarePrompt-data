Postcondition: ***`l` can be either [0, 0] or [1, 0] if `a[i]` is divisible by 7, resulting in `f` being updated to [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] and `i` becoming 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, then `l` can either be [0, g[5]] or [1, g[5]] if `f[5]` is true. If `f[5]` is false, `l` can be either [0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 1], or [1, 2]; `j` can be either 1 or 2; `g` is based on the conditions stated, and `g[5]` is either 1 or 2. If `a[i]` is divisible by 13, then `l` can be either [0] or [1] depending on `f[6]`, `f` gets updated to [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], while `i` remains 1, and `g[6]` takes the value of `j`. If `a[i]` is divisible by 17, `f` updates to [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], allowing `l` to be either [0] or [1] with an extra element `g[7]`, and `j` can still be either 1 or 2. If `a[i]` is divisible by 19, `f` updates to [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], allowing `l` to be either [0, g[8]] or [1, g[8]]. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 19 but is divisible by 23, `f` is updated to [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0] and `l` can be either [0, 0] or [1, 0]; `j` can be either 0 or 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 23 but divisible by 29, `f[10]` can be either 1 or 2; `j` can be either 1 or 2, and `g[10]` is either 1 or 2. If `a[i]` is divisible by 31, `l` can be either [0, g[11]] or [1, g[11]], with `f[11]` being true, `j` can be either 0 or 1, while `i` remains 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 31, `l` remains unchanged.***
