According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `args` list. If `args` has at least 1 element, the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `at_start` is False, and `x` is the last element of `args`. For the loop to execute one more time, `args` must still have at least 1 more element, and `x` should be the next element in the list.

Since `x` is currently the last element, we cannot increment it, but we need to note that for the loop to execute again, `args` must have at least one more element than it did in the current state.

State: **`sep` is the value of kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), `file` is the value of kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout), `at_start` is False, for the loop to execute a second time `args` is a list with at least 2 elements; `file.write(str(x))` is executed, writing the string representation of x to the specified file.**
