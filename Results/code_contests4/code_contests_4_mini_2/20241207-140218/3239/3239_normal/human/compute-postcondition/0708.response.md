Output State: **`l` can be either [0, g[1]] or [1, g[1]] if `f[1]` is true; in this case, `j` can be either 0 or 1, and `g` is based on the conditions stated. If `f[1]` is false, then `l` can be either [0] or [1], and `g[1]` is assigned the value of `j`, resulting in `g[1]` being either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `j`; `f[1]` is increased by 1.**
