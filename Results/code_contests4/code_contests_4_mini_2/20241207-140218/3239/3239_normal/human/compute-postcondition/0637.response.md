The code `l.append(j)` appends the value of `j`, which is 1, to the list `l`. Since `l` is initially an empty list, after executing this line, `l` will contain one element, which is 1. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is [1], `j` is 1, `g` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the value returned from `func_4()`, `f` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `i` is 0, the value of `a[i]` is an odd number, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, `a[i]` is not divisible by 11, `a[i]` is divisible by 13, and `f[6]` is 0.
