The code `l.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` to the list `l`. The previous state indicates that `j` has been increased by 1, but we do not know its exact value. The initial values of `n` and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `j` has been increased by 1 and is now appended to the list `l`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `j` has been increased by 1 and is now appended to the list `l.**
