The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer `n` followed by `n` composite integers `a_i`. Each `a_i` is guaranteed to be within the range of 4 to 1000, and the total number of integers across all test cases does not exceed 10,000. The function processes these inputs and produces output based on the specified logic for composite integers. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and handles multiple test cases of composite integers, processing them according to defined logic and constraints.**
