The code `l.append(g[1])` will append the value of `g[1]` to the list `l`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `a[i]` are not directly affected by this operation. However, the operation assumes that `g` is defined and has at least two elements since `g[1]` is being accessed. 

Since the initial state specifies that `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `a[i]` is the element being evaluated, we don't have information about the list `l` or the variable `g`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a[i]` is the element being evaluated, and `g[1]` is appended to `l`. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a[i]` is the element being evaluated, and `g[1]` is appended to `l.**
