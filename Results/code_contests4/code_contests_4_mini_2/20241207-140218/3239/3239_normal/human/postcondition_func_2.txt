The function accepts no parameters and returns a map object containing integers parsed from an input sequence of integers. The integers are expected to be composite numbers ranging from 4 to 1000, but the function does not validate this. It relies on the user to provide valid input, and does not handle cases where the input might contain non-composite numbers or be empty.
