The function does not accept any parameters and sets up the environment to read from 'input.txt' and write to 'output.txt', intending to handle multiple test cases of composite integers, but it does not contain any logic for processing those integers. The function only prepares the input and output streams without implementing any functionality related to the actual processing of the composite integers as described in the annotations.
