According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `vs` object. The `vs` is a map object created from the input and should contain at least one element for the loop to execute. Given that `n` is a positive integer, it implies that there is an input split by spaces, which is transformed into the map object `vs`. 

For the loop to execute the first time, we can assume that `e` will take the first value from the `vs` map object. However, we need to ensure that `vs` has elements. 

Thus, the necessary adjustments to the state are as follows: `vs` must contain at least one integer (i.e., it should not be empty), `e` will be the first integer from `vs`, and since `minO` and `res` are not directly impacting the loop execution, they remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `minO` is -1, `res` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `vs` must be a map object containing at least 1 integer, and `e` is the first integer from `vs`**.
