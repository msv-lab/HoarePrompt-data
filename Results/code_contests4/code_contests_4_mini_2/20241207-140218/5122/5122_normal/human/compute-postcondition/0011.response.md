`minO` is assigned the value of `e`. Since `e` is the second integer from `vs`, the value of `minO` will be equal to `e`. The other variables `n`, `res`, and `vs` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `minO` is equal to `e`; `res` is updated to `res + e`; `vs` is a map object containing at least 1 integer; `e` is the second integer from `vs`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `minO` is equal to `e`; `res` is updated to `res + e`; `vs` is a map object containing at least 1 integer; `e` is the second integer from `vs`.**
