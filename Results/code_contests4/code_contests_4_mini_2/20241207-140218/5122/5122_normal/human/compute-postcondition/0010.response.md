The value of `res` is incremented by `e`. The previous value of `res` is not provided, but it is noted that `e` is the second integer from the `vs` map object. Therefore, after execution, `res` becomes `res + e`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `minO` is -1 or greater than `e`; `res` is updated to `res + e`; `vs` is a map object containing at least 1 integer; `e` is the second integer from `vs`.**
