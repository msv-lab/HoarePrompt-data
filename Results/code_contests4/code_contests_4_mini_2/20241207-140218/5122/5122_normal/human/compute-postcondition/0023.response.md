Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000) and reads `n` space-separated integers (each between 1 and 10^9). It calculates the sum of these integers and identifies the minimum integer among them. If the sum is odd, it subtracts the minimum integer from the sum before printing the result. If the sum is even, it prints the sum as is. The function does not return a value, but instead prints the final result. **
