According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the number of elements in the `vs` object. If `vs` contains at least 1 integer, the loop can execute at least once. At the end of the last iteration, `vs` is a map object containing at least 1 integer, and `e` is the first integer from `vs`. For the loop to execute one more time, the `vs` object must still contain at least one more integer after the current one has been processed.

Since `e` is assigned from the `vs` object in each iteration, and after processing the first integer, the next integer from `vs` will be assigned to `e` in the subsequent iteration. Therefore, the state needs to reflect the next integer to be processed. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, if `minO` is -1 or `minO` is greater than `e`, then `minO` is set to `e`, and `res` is equal to `e`; `vs` is a map object containing at least 1 integer, where `e` is the second integer from `vs` for the loop to execute a second time.**
