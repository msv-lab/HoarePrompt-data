To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the code in relation to the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. We have a rectangular parallelepiped defined by three integer edge lengths.
2. We are given the areas of the three faces that share a common vertex.
3. We need to compute the sum of the lengths of all 12 edges of the parallelepiped.

### Given Areas:
Let the edge lengths be `x`, `y`, and `z`. The areas of the three faces can be expressed as:
- Area 1 (xy) = a
- Area 2 (yz) = b
- Area 3 (zx) = c

### Edge Lengths and Their Relationship:
From the areas, we can derive:
- \( x = \sqrt{\frac{a \cdot c}{b}} \)
- \( y = \sqrt{\frac{a \cdot b}{c}} \)
- \( z = \sqrt{\frac{b \cdot c}{a}} \)

The sum of the edges is calculated as:
\[ \text{Sum of edges} = 4(x + y + z) \]

### Program Analysis:
The program attempts to calculate the edge lengths based on the areas provided as input and then computes the sum of all edges.

```python
(a, b, c) = map(float, raw_input().split())
x = (a / b * c) ** 0.5
y = (b / c * a) ** 0.5
z = (c / a * b) ** 0.5
print(4 * (x + y + z))
```

### Key Points of the Program:
1. It uses `float` for input, which is unnecessary since edge lengths must be integers. This could lead to precision issues.
2. The formulas used for calculating `x`, `y`, and `z` are incorrect. The correct formulas should be derived from \( x^2 = \frac{a \cdot c}{b} \), etc.
3. The program does not handle cases where the areas do not form a valid parallelepiped, although the problem guarantees the existence of at least one.

### Example to Illustrate Incorrectness:
Let's consider the input:
```
4 4 4
```
According to the correct logic:
- \( x = 2, y = 2, z = 2 \) 
- The expected output should be \( 4(2 + 2 + 2) = 24 \).

However, running the current program would yield incorrect results due to the flawed calculations.

### Conclusion:
The program does not implement the correct logic for calculating the edge lengths based on the provided areas. Given the provided examples, it may succeed in some cases, but it will fail in others due to the incorrect formula used.

Correctness: **False**
