Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` which is not available in Python 3. The correct function in Python 3 is `input()`. This will cause the program to fail if run in a Python 3 environment.

2. **Type of Variables**: The areas are read as `float` values (`map(float, ...)`) while the problem description specifies that the input should be integers. Although the areas might be positive floats, it is explicitly stated that the input consists of integers, which could lead to confusion and unexpected behavior.

3. **Mathematical Calculation**: The calculation of `x`, `y`, and `z` appears to be incorrect. The formulas used to derive the lengths of the edges from the areas are not mathematically valid based on the areas of the faces of a rectangular parallelepiped. Specifically, if `a`, `b`, and `c` are the areas of the three faces, the lengths of the edges `x`, `y`, and `z` should be derived differently:
   - From the areas, we have:
     - `x * y = a`
     - `y * z = b`
     - `z * x = c`
   - The correct way to calculate the edge lengths would be through the relationships between the areas, not through division and square roots as done in the program.

4. **Output**: The program calculates `4 * (x + y + z)` which is intended to find the total length of all edges, but due to the incorrect calculation of `x`, `y`, and `z`, the final output is also incorrect.

Overall, due to the reasons outlined above, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem based on the provided description.
