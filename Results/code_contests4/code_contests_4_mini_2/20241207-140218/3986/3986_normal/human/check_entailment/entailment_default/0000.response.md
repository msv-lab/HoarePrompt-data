The program is intended to calculate the sum of the lengths of all edges of a rectangular parallelepiped given the areas of its three faces that share a common vertex. 

Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. The program takes three space-separated integers (areas of faces) as input.
2. It calculates the edge lengths \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) using the given areas:
   - \(x = \sqrt{\frac{a}{b} \cdot c}\)
   - \(y = \sqrt{\frac{b}{c} \cdot a}\)
   - \(z = \sqrt{\frac{c}{a} \cdot b}\)
3. It then computes the sum of all edges as \(4 \cdot (x + y + z)\) and prints the result.

Now let's consider potential edge cases:

- The input areas provided are guaranteed to be positive integers, which means the calculations involving division and square roots should work without any issues related to zero or negative values.
- The calculations assume that the areas correspond correctly to a valid rectangular parallelepiped. However, let's check if the calculated edges \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) always yield a valid parallelepiped.

For example, consider the areas \(1\), \(1\), and \(1\):
- The calculated edges will be \(x = 1\), \(y = 1\), and \(z = 1\), leading to a total edge length of \(12\), which is correct.

Now consider the provided output hints:
- The output hints state that the function calculates the lengths of the edges based on the areas and returns the total surface area by printing \(4\) times the sum of these lengths.

However, let's focus on the correctness of the edge length calculations. The calculation method used relies on \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) being areas of faces and computes lengths based on the assumption that these areas allow for valid lengths. 

Now, examining the output hints further, they mention:
- The function accepts three positive float parameters representing the areas of the three faces.

It's important to note that the original areas are integers, but the code uses `float` for calculations. This might lead to inaccuracies when representing integer lengths, although, in practice, the integer inputs will yield valid float outputs due to the operations being performed. 

However, the more significant concern is whether the approach to calculate \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) is always valid for every set of areas. The mathematical relationships must hold for all valid parallelepiped configurations.

After analyzing these aspects, I find a potential issue with the method of calculating edge lengths, even though the output hints suggest it correctly computes the edges. The hint does not provide any assurance that all configurations of areas will yield valid edges, particularly given that the formulae used are not standard and could lead to incorrect edge lengths if the areas do not correspond to a proper rectangular parallelepiped.

Therefore, since the program may not handle all potential edge cases correctly, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not guarantee correct edge length calculations for all potential input cases based on the areas provided.
