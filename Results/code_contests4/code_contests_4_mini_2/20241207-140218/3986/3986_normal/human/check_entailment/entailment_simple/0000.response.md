The provided program aims to compute the sum of the lengths of the edges of a rectangular parallelepiped given the areas of its three faces. However, there are a few issues that prevent it from being correct as per the problem description.

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` which is not available in Python 3. The correct function to use for input in Python 3 is `input()`. However, this is a minor issue and can be overlooked if we assume the program is written in Python 2.

2. **Data Types**: The program reads the areas as floats using `map(float, ...)`, but the problem description specifies that the areas are integers. This inconsistency could lead to unexpected behavior, especially in arithmetic operations.

3. **Calculation of Edge Lengths**: The calculations for `x`, `y`, and `z` are based on the areas of the faces. The areas of the parallelepiped's faces are given by:
   - Area1 = ab (where `a` and `b` are the lengths of two edges)
   - Area2 = ac (where `a` and `c` are the lengths of another two edges)
   - Area3 = bc (where `b` and `c` are the lengths of the last two edges)

   The relationships used to calculate `x`, `y`, and `z`:
   - `x = (a / b * c) ** 0.5` is incorrect. It should be derived using the areas rather than dividing the edge lengths.
   - The correct approach would be to derive `a`, `b`, and `c` from the areas directly using:
     - \( a = \sqrt{\frac{A1 \cdot A2}{A3}} \)
     - \( b = \sqrt{\frac{A1 \cdot A3}{A2}} \)
     - \( c = \sqrt{\frac{A2 \cdot A3}{A1}} \)

   The final sum of the edges is correctly calculated as `4 * (x + y + z)` if `x`, `y`, and `z` are computed correctly. However, since the calculations of `x`, `y`, and `z` are incorrect, the final output will also be incorrect.

Due to these issues, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
