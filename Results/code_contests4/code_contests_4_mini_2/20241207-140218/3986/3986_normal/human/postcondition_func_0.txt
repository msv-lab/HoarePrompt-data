The function accepts three positive float parameters representing the areas of the three faces of a rectangular parallelepiped (a, b, c). It calculates the lengths of the edges (x, y, z) based on these areas and returns the total surface area of the parallelepiped by printing 4 times the sum of these lengths. The function does not return a value but instead prints the result directly.
