The function `func` accepts three parameters representing the areas of the three faces of a rectangular parallelepiped. Each area is a positive integer greater than 0 and does not exceed 10^4. The function calculates the volume of the parallelepiped based on these areas. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept three positive integer areas of a rectangular parallelepiped's faces and return the computed volume based on these areas. 

Functionality: **The function accepts three positive integer parameters representing the areas of the three faces of a rectangular parallelepiped and returns the computed volume based on these areas.**
