In the given code, `y` is assigned the value of `(b / c * a) ** 0.5`. The previous values of the affected variables are `a`, `b`, and `c`, which are all positive integers. The expression calculates `b / c` and then multiplies it by `a`, followed by taking the square root of the result.

Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are three positive integers; `y` is calculated as the square root of the product of `b / c` and `a`.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are three positive integers; `y` is calculated as the square root of the product of `b / c` and `a`.**
