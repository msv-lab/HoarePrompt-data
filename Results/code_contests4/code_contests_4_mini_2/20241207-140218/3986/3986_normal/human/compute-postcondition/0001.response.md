The value of `x` is assigned the result of the expression `(a / b * c) ** 0.5`. This expression uses the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, which are positive integers representing the areas of the three faces of the rectangular parallelepiped. Since `a`, `b`, and `c` are all greater than 0 and do not exceed 10^4, the calculation will be valid, and `x` will also be a positive number. The exact value of `x` depends on the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, which are not provided. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are three positive integers; `x` is calculated as `(a / b * c) ** 0.5`.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are three positive integers; `x` is calculated as `(a / b * c) ** 0.5`.**
