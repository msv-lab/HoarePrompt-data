The variable `z` is assigned the value of the square root of the product of `b / c` and `a`, which can be expressed as `(c / a * b) ** 0.5`. Given that `a`, `b`, and `c` are three positive integers, the value of `z` will depend on these specific values. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are three positive integers; `z` is calculated as the square root of the product of `b / c` and `a`.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are three positive integers; `z` is calculated as the square root of the product of `b / c` and `a`.**
