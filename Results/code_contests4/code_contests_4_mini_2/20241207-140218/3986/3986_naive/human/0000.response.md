To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program and the requirements.

### Problem Description:
We need to calculate the sum of the lengths of all 12 edges of a rectangular parallelepiped given the areas of its three adjacent faces. 

Let:
- The edges of the parallelepiped be \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\).
- The areas of the three faces that share a common vertex be:
  - \(a = xy\)
  - \(b = xz\)
  - \(c = yz\)

### Given Program:
```python
(a, b, c) = map(float, raw_input().split())
x = (a / b * c) ** 0.5
y = (b / c * a) ** 0.5
z = (c / a * b) ** 0.5
print(4 * (x + y + z))
```

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - It correctly reads three space-separated integers representing the areas of the faces.

2. **Calculating Edge Lengths**:
   - It uses the formulas derived from the areas to compute the lengths of the edges:
     - \(x = \sqrt{\frac{a}{b} \cdot c}\)
     - \(y = \sqrt{\frac{b}{c} \cdot a}\)
     - \(z = \sqrt{\frac{c}{a} \cdot b}\)
   - These formulas are mathematically correct based on the relationships between the areas and the dimensions.

3. **Calculating the Total Edge Length**:
   - The output is calculated as \(4 \cdot (x + y + z)\), which is the correct formula for the sum of the lengths of all edges of a parallelepiped.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- We need to consider whether the program handles all possible inputs within the constraints. Given that the areas are guaranteed to form a valid parallelepiped, the mathematical derivations should hold true.
- We should also check if the program could potentially run into issues with floating-point arithmetic; however, since the problem guarantees valid inputs and the area values are positive integers, this should not lead to incorrect outputs under normal conditions.

### Conclusion:
Since the program correctly computes the edge lengths and their sum based on the provided formulas without missing any edge cases or logic, it adheres to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.
