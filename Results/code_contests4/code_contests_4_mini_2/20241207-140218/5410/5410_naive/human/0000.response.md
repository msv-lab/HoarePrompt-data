To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it based on the given problem description and the constraints.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to select at least `A` and at most `B` items from a list of `N` items, and to find the maximum possible arithmetic mean of the values of the selected items. Additionally, we need to count how many ways there are to select items such that the mean is maximized.

### Program Analysis
The program reads the input values and attempts to generate combinations of the item values to find the maximum mean. However, there are several issues that arise:

1. **Incorrect Range for Combinations**: The line `for pcs in range(B - A + 1):` generates combinations of size `B + pcs`, which does not correctly cover the range of selections from `A` to `B`. The correct implementation should allow combinations of sizes ranging from `A` to `B`, meaning `for pcs in range(A, B + 1):` should be used instead.

2. **Use of itertools.combinations**: The use of `itertools.combinations` is correct for generating combinations. However, the way the loop is structured can lead to missing some valid combinations because it does not iterate over all valid sizes correctly.

3. **Computation of Means**: The program attempts to calculate the maximum mean, but given the above issues, it may not reach the correct combinations necessary to compute the mean accurately.

4. **Count of Maximum Mean Combinations**: The program initializes `resultCount` to zero but does not handle the case where no combinations are counted if the maximum mean is not updated.

### Potential Case
Consider the scenario where:
```
Input:
5 2 3
1 2 3 4 5
```
The correct output should be:
```
4.500000
1
```
However, if the program fails to calculate combinations correctly (for instance, if it does not consider all combinations of size 2 and 3), it may incorrectly compute the mean and the count.

Moreover, if we test with a case where the maximum possible mean is achieved by different combinations but not all combinations are considered due to the incorrect range in the loop, it would lead to an incorrect count.

### Conclusion
Due to the incorrect range for the combinations and the potential for missing valid combinations, the program does not guarantee the correct output for all cases specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
