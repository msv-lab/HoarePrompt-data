The variable `resultCount` is assigned the value of 1. The values of `resultValue`, `resultCount`, and `cand` remain unchanged, with `resultValue` still equal to `average`, `resultCount` now being 1, and `cand` representing the (k+1)th candidate in the list. Therefore, the Output State is: `resultValue` is equal to `average`, `resultCount` is 1, `cand` is the (k+1)th candidate in the list.

Output State: **`resultValue` is equal to `average`, `resultCount` is 1, `cand` is the (k+1)th candidate in the list.**
