Postcondition: ***`average` is calculated as float(sum(cand)) / len(cand). If `resultValue` is less than `average`, then `resultValue` is assigned the value of `average` and `resultCount` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `resultValue` equals `average`, `resultCount` is increased by 1, and if `resultValue` does not equal `average`, no changes are made to `resultCount`.***
