In this case, `resultValue` is assigned the value of `average`. The `average` is calculated as the float of the sum of `cand` divided by the length of `cand`, and `resultValue` is updated to reflect this new average. The previous values of `resultValue` and `resultCount` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `resultValue` is now equal to `average`, `resultCount` remains unchanged, `cand` is the `k`th candidate in the list, and the calculation of `average` has been done.

Output State: **`resultValue` is now equal to `average`, `resultCount` remains unchanged, `cand` is the `k`th candidate in the list.**
