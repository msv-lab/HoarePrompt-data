The value of `resultCount` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `resultCount` is not specified, but it will be increased by 1. The states of the other variables (`N`, `A`, `B`, `perm`, `cand`, `current_index`, and `average`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `A`, `B` are integers such that 1 <= `N` <= 50; `perm` must have more candidates remaining; `cand` is the candidate at index `current_index`; `current_index` is incremented by 1; `average` is the calculated average of `cand`; `resultCount` is increased by 1.
