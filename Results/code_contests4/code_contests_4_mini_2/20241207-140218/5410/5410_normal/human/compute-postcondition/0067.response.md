The value of `resultCount` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `resultCount` is unknown, but it will now be one greater than its initial value. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `resultValue` is the maximum average of all candidates in `perm`, `resultCount` is incremented by 1, `perm` is a non-empty list of candidates, `average` is the float value of the sum of candidates in `cand` divided by the length of `cand`.

Output State: **`resultValue` is the maximum average of all candidates in `perm`, `resultCount` is incremented by 1, `perm` is a non-empty list of candidates, `average` is the float value of the sum of candidates in `cand` divided by the length of `cand`.**
