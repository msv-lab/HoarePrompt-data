Postcondition: ***`N`, `A`, `B` are integers such that 1 <= `N` <= 50; `perm` must have more candidates remaining; `cand` is the next candidate in the list; `current_index` is incremented by 1; `average` is the float value of the sum of `cand` divided by the length of `cand`. If `resultValue` is less than `average`, then `resultValue` is assigned the value of `average` and `resultCount` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `resultValue` is equal to `average`, then `resultCount` is increased by 1.***
