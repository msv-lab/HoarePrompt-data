The code calculates the average of the values in the list `cand`. The variable `average` is assigned the value of the sum of the elements in `cand` divided by the length of `cand`. The values of `N`, `A`, `B`, and `current_index` do not change as a result of this operation, and we know that `cand` is a list of integers with a defined length. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `A`, `B` are integers such that 1 <= `N` <= 50; `perm` must have more candidates remaining; `cand` is the candidate at index `current_index`; `current_index` is incremented by 1; `average` is the calculated average of `cand`.
