According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `perm` iterable. If `perm` has at least one more candidate, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `average` is calculated as `float(sum(cand)) / len(cand)`, but the specific values of `cand` are not provided. The loop processes each element in `perm`, and if the loop has executed up to the last candidate, it suggests that the loop has processed all elements in `perm`.

Since `cand` is the current candidate being processed from `perm`, and given that there are no further candidates left to process, for the loop to execute one more time, `perm` must have at least one more candidate. If we assume `perm` had `k` candidates and the loop has executed `k` times, then `cand` would represent the last candidate processed (the `k`-th candidate).

To execute the loop again, `perm` needs at least `k + 1` candidates, and `cand` must be the `k + 1`-th candidate.

State: **`average` is a float calculated as float(sum(cand)) / len(cand), for the loop to execute one more time `perm` must have at least `k + 1` candidates, and `cand` is the `k + 1`-th candidate in the list.**
