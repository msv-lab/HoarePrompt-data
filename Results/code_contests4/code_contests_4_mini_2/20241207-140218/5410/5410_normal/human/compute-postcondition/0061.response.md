The code calculates the average of the candidates in the list `cand` by summing all the elements and dividing by the number of elements. The variable `average` is assigned this calculated value. However, the values of `resultValue`, `resultCount`, and `perm` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged variables along with the newly calculated average.

Output State: **`resultValue` is the maximum average of all candidates in `perm`, `resultCount` is the number of candidates that have an average equal to `resultValue`, `perm` is a non-empty list of candidates, `average` is the float value of the sum of candidates in `cand` divided by the length of `cand`.**
