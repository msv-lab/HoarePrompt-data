Postcondition: ***`resultValue` is the maximum average of all candidates in `perm`. If `resultValue` is less than `average`, then `resultValue` is equal to `average`, `resultCount` is 1, and `cand` is the (k+1)th candidate in the list. Otherwise, if `resultValue` equals `average`, `resultCount` is increased by 1, `cand` is the (k+1)th candidate in the list, and `average` is calculated as float(sum(cand)) / len(cand).***
