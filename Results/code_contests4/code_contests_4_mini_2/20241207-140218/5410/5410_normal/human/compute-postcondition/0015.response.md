Postcondition: ***`N`, `A`, and `B` are integers such that 1 <= `N` <= 50, 1 <= `A` <= `N`, and 1 <= `B` <= `N`. If `resultValue` is less than `average`, then `resultValue` is equal to `average` and `resultCount` is 1. If `resultValue` is greater than or equal to `average`, `resultCount` is increased by 1 if `resultValue` equals `average`, otherwise `resultCount` remains unchanged.***
