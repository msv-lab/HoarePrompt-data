The variable `resultCount` is assigned the value `1`, and it does not affect any other variables since no other variables are being modified or utilized in this line of code. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged for the other variables. 

Output State: **`average` is calculated from `cand`, which contains elements from `perm`, ensuring `perm` has at least 2 elements; `resultValue` is assigned the value of `average`; `resultCount` is 1.**
