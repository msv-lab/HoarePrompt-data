The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as the signature shows no input parameters. However, it operates under certain constraints defined for variables `N`, `A`, `B`, and a list of integers `v_i`. 

Given the constraints:
- `N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 50.
- `A` and `B` are integers such that 1 <= A, B <= N.
- Each `v_i` is an integer such that 1 <= v_i <= 10^15 for each item i (1 <= i <= N).

Based on the provided output conditions, we can summarize the functionality as follows: 

The function `func` processes the input values of `N`, `A`, `B`, and the list of integers `v_i` indirectly. The function's return value depends on the logic applied to these inputs. However, without specific output conditions provided in the prompt, we cannot detail the cases of output.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but operates on the constraints related to integers N, A, B, and a list of integers v_i, returning a result based on these values.**
