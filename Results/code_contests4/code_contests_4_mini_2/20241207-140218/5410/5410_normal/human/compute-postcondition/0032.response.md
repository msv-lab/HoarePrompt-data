Output State: **`N`, `A`, and `B` are integers such that 1 <= `N` <= 50; `perm` is the list of all combinations of `v` taken `B + pcs` at a time; `resultValue` is the maximum average of all candidates in `perm`; `resultCount` is the number of candidates that have an average equal to `resultValue`, for the loop to execute one more time `B` must be greater than `A`, and `pcs` is equal to `B - A + 1`.**
