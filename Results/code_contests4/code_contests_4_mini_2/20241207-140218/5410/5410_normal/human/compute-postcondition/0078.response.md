The variable `average` is assigned the value of the sum of the elements in `cand` divided by the number of elements in `cand`. The initial state indicates that `cand` represents the (k+1)th candidate in the list and that `perm` contains at least (k+1) candidates. Therefore, `len(cand)` is greater than 0, ensuring that the division can be performed without error. The states of `resultValue` and `resultCount` are not altered by this operation.

Output State: **`resultValue` is the maximum average of all candidates in `perm`, `resultCount` is the count of candidates with the maximum average, `cand` is the (k+1)th candidate in the list, and `average` is calculated as float(sum(cand)) / len(cand)**
