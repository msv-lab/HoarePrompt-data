Postcondition: ***`average` is calculated from `cand`, which contains elements from `perm`, ensuring `perm` has at least 2 elements. If `resultValue` is less than `average`, then `resultValue` is assigned the value of `average` and `resultCount` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `resultValue` equals `average`, `resultCount` is increased by 1.***
