Postcondition: ***`average` is a float calculated as float(sum(cand)) / len(cand). If `resultValue` is less than `average`, then `resultValue` is equal to `average` and `resultCount` is set to 1. If `resultValue` is equal to `average`, `resultCount` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `resultValue` is greater than or equal to `average`.***
