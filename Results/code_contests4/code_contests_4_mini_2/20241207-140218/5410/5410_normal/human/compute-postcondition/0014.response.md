Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 50, `A` is an integer such that 1 <= A <= N, `B` is an integer such that 1 <= B <= N, `pcs` is 0, `perm` contains combinations of `v` taken `B` at a time with `B` <= size of `v`, `average` is calculated as float(sum(cand)) / len(cand), `resultValue` is greater than or equal to `average`, and if `resultValue` is equal to `average`, then `resultCount` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `resultCount` remains unchanged.***
