Postcondition: ***`resultValue` is the maximum average of all candidates in `perm`, `resultCount` is incremented by 1 if `resultValue` is equal to `average`. The `perm` is a non-empty list of candidates, and `average` is the float value of the sum of candidates in `cand` divided by the length of `cand`, with `resultValue` being greater than or equal to `average`.***
