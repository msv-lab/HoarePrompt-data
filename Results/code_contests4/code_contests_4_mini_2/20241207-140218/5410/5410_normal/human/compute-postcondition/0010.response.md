Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 50, `A` is an integer such that 1 <= `A` <= `N`, `B` is an integer such that 1 <= `B` <= `N`, `pcs` is 0, `perm` contains combinations of `v` taken `B` at a time with `B` <= size of `v`, `average` is calculated as float(sum(cand)) / len(cand), `resultValue` is equal to `average`, and `resultCount` is 1.**
