The variable `resultValue` is initialized to 0. The values of `N`, `A`, `B`, and `v` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 50; `A` is an integer such that 1 <= A <= N; `B` is an integer such that 1 <= B <= N; `v` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces; `resultValue` is 0.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 50; `A` is an integer such that 1 <= A <= N; `B` is an integer such that 1 <= B <= N; `v` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces; `resultValue` is 0**.
