According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `perm`, which is an iterable. If `perm` contains more elements, the loop can execute a next iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `average` is calculated based on the values in `cand`, and the state of `resultValue` and `resultCount` may have been updated based on comparisons with `average`. 

Since the loop uses `cand` from `perm`, if the loop executed once, `cand` would have been assigned the first element of `perm`. For the loop to execute one more time, `perm` must contain at least 2 elements. Therefore, if `cand` was the first element from `perm`, in the next iteration, `cand` would be the second element from `perm`.

State: **`average` is calculated as float(sum(cand)) / len(cand), for the loop to execute a second time `perm` must contain at least 2 elements, `cand` is the second element in `perm`.**
