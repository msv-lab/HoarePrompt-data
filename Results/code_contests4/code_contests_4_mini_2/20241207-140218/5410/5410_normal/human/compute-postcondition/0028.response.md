Postcondition: ***`N`, `A`, `B` are integers such that 1 <= `N` <= 50; `perm` must have more candidates remaining; `cand` is the candidate at index `current_index` which is incremented by 1; `average` is the calculated average of `cand`. If `resultValue` equals `average`, then `resultCount` is increased by 1.***
