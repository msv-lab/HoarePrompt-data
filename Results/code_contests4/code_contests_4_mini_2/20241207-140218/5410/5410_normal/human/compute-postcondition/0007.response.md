The code calculates the average of the elements in the list `cand`. The `sum(cand)` computes the total of all elements in `cand`, and `len(cand)` calculates the number of elements in `cand`. The result is then converted to a float and assigned to the variable `average`. The values of `N`, `A`, `B`, `pcs`, and `perm` are not directly affected by this calculation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 50, `A` is an integer such that 1 <= A <= N, `B` is an integer such that 1 <= B <= N, `pcs` is 0, `perm` contains combinations of `v` taken `B` at a time with `B` <= size of `v`, and `average` is calculated as float(sum(cand)) / len(cand).

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 50, `A` is an integer such that 1 <= A <= N, `B` is an integer such that 1 <= B <= N, `pcs` is 0, `perm` contains combinations of `v` taken `B` at a time with `B` <= size of `v`, `average` is calculated as float(sum(cand)) / len(cand)**.
