Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 50; `A` is an integer such that 1 <= `A` <= `N`; `B` is an integer such that 1 <= `B` <= `N`; `perm` must have more candidates remaining; `cand` is the next candidate in the list; `current_index` is incremented by 1; `average` is the float value of the sum of `cand` divided by the length of `cand`; `resultValue` is assigned the value of `average`.**
