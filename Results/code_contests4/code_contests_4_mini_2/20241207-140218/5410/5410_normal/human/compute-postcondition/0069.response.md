Postcondition: ***`resultValue` is the maximum average of all candidates in `perm`. If `resultValue` is less than `average`, then `resultValue` is updated to be equal to `average`, `resultCount` is set to 1, and both `perm` and `average` remain unchanged. Otherwise, if `resultValue` is greater than or equal to `average`, `resultCount` is incremented by 1 if `resultValue` equals `average`, and both `perm` and `average` remain unchanged.***
