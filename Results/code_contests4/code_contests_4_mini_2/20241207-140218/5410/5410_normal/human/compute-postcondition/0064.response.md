The value of `resultCount` is assigned the value 1, but its previous value is unknown. The other variables (`resultValue`, `perm`, and `average`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `resultValue` is now equal to `average`, which is greater than the previous value of `resultValue`; `resultCount` is 1; `perm` is unchanged; `average` is unchanged.

Output State: **`resultValue` is now equal to `average`, which is greater than the previous value of `resultValue`; `resultCount` is 1; `perm` is unchanged; `average` is unchanged.**
