The line of code assigns the value `1` to `resultCount`. The previous state indicates that `resultValue` is equal to `average`, and `resultCount` remains unchanged just prior to this line of code. Therefore, after execution, `resultCount` will now be `1`, overriding any previous value it might have held. The states of `resultValue` and `cand` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`resultValue` is now equal to `average`, `resultCount` is 1, `cand` is the `k`th candidate in the list.**
