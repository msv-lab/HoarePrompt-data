Postcondition: ***`resultValue` is the maximum average of all candidates in `perm`. If `resultValue` is less than `average`, then `resultValue` becomes equal to `average`, `resultCount` is set to 1, and `cand` is the `k`th candidate in the list. Otherwise, if `resultValue` equals `average`, `resultCount` is incremented by 1, and `average` is still calculated as the float of the sum of `cand` divided by the length of `cand`.***
