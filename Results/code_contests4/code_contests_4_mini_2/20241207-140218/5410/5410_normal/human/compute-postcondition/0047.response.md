The value of `resultCount` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `resultCount` is unknown. The value of `average` remains unaffected, as it does not change in this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `average` is calculated as float(sum(cand)) / len(cand); `resultCount` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`average` is calculated as float(sum(cand)) / len(cand); `resultCount` is increased by 1**
