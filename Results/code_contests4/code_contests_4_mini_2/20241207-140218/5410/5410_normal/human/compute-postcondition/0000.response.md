The code assigns values to `N`, `A`, and `B` by taking input from the user, which will be split into three integers. The initial constraints indicate that `N` is within the range of 1 to 50, and both `A` and `B` are integers within the range from 1 to `N`. The specific values of `A` and `B` will be determined by the input provided.

Since the exact input is not defined, we can only describe the impact of the code on the program without specifying exact values for `A` and `B`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 50; `A` is an integer such that 1 <= A <= N; `B` is an integer such that 1 <= B <= N**
