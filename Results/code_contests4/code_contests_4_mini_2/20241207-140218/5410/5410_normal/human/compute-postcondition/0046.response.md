The variable `resultCount` is assigned the value `1`, while previously, `resultValue` was assigned the value of `average`, which is calculated as `float(sum(cand)) / len(cand)`. The assignment of `resultCount` does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `average` is calculated as `float(sum(cand)) / len(cand); `resultValue` is assigned the value of `average`; `resultCount` is 1.

Output State: **`average` is calculated as float(sum(cand)) / len(cand); `resultValue` is assigned the value of `average`; `resultCount` is 1**
