According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `perm`. If there are more candidates remaining in `perm`, the loop can execute for the next candidate. At the end of the last iteration, `current_index` has been incremented by 1, which means it points to the next candidate in the list. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `current_index` should be adjusted to point to the next candidate, and `cand` should be updated to reflect the candidate at this new index.

Since `perm` must have more candidates remaining, `current_index` should be less than the length of `perm`. If `current_index` was incremented by 1, it means the next value of `current_index` to be used would be `current_index + 1`, and `cand` will be the candidate at this new index.

State: **`N`, `A`, `B` are integers such that 1 <= `N` <= 50; `perm` must have more candidates remaining; `cand` is the candidate at index `current_index`, `current_index` is incremented by 1.**
