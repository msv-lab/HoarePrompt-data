The variable `resultCount` is assigned the value 1. The previous values of the affected variables are `average` (a float calculated as `float(sum(cand)) / len(cand)`) and `resultValue` (equal to `average`). The assignment of `resultCount` does not affect these variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `average` and `resultValue`, along with the new assignment of `resultCount`.

Output State: **`average` is a float calculated as float(sum(cand)) / len(cand); `resultValue` is equal to `average`; `resultCount` is 1**
