The variable `resultCount` is assigned the value `1`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed by this assignment, and other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `A`, `B` are integers such that 1 <= `N` <= 50; `perm` must have more candidates remaining; `cand` is the candidate at index `current_index`; `current_index` is incremented by 1; `average` is the calculated average of `cand`; `resultValue` is assigned the value of `average`; `resultCount` is 1.
