The variable `average` is calculated as the sum of the elements in the list `cand` divided by the length of the list `cand`. The specific values of `cand` and its length are not provided, but we know that `cand` is a list whose elements are summed up and then the total is divided by the number of elements in the list. Therefore, the output state depends on the values computed from `cand`.

The output state reflects the calculation performed, indicating that `average` is assigned a float value based on the elements of `cand`.

Output State: **`average` is calculated as float(sum(cand)) / len(cand)**
