The value of `resultCount` is incremented by 1. Since `resultValue` is equal to `average`, it confirms that the condition for incrementing `resultCount` is met. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `average` is calculated as float(sum(cand)) / len(cand), `resultValue` is greater than or equal to `average`, `resultValue` is equal to `average`, and `resultCount` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`average` is calculated as float(sum(cand)) / len(cand), `resultValue` is greater than or equal to `average`, `resultValue` is equal to `average`, and `resultCount` is increased by 1.**
