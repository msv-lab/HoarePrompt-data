The code `print(resultCount)` outputs the value of `resultCount`. The previous values of the affected variables, `N`, `A`, `B`, and `resultValue`, are not impacted by this print statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `A`, and `B` are integers such that 1 <= `N` <= 50; `resultValue` is the maximum average of all candidate combinations evaluated; `resultCount` is the number of candidates that have an average equal to `resultValue`; and `resultValue` has been printed.
