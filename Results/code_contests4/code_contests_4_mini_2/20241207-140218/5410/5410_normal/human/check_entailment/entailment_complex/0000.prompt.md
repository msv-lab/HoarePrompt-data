You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given N items.
The value of the i-th item (1 \leq i \leq N) is v_i.
Your have to select at least A and at most B of these items.
Under this condition, find the maximum possible arithmetic mean of the values of selected items.
Additionally, find the number of ways to select items so that the mean of the values of selected items is maximized.

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 50
* 1 \leq A,B \leq N
* 1 \leq v_i \leq 10^{15}
* Each v_i is an integer.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N A B
v_1
v_2
...
v_N


Output

Print two lines.
The first line should contain the maximum possible arithmetic mean of the values of selected items. The output should be considered correct if the absolute or relative error is at most 10^{-6}.
The second line should contain the number of ways to select items so that the mean of the values of selected items is maximized.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 50, A and B are integers such that 1 <= A, B <= N, and v_i are integers such that 1 <= v_i <= 10^15 for each item i (1 <= i <= N).
def func():
    N, A, B = map(int, raw_input().split())
    v = map(int, raw_input().split())
    resultValue = 0
    resultCount = 0
    for pcs in range(B - A + 1):
        perm = list(itertools.combinations(v, B + pcs))
        
        for cand in perm:
            average = float(sum(cand)) / len(cand)
            if resultValue < average:
                resultValue = average
                resultCount = 1
            elif resultValue == average:
                resultCount += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N`, `A`, and `B` are integers such that 1 <= `N` <= 50; `resultValue` is the maximum average of all candidate combinations evaluated; `resultCount` is the number of candidates that have an average equal to `resultValue`.
    print(resultValue)
    print(resultCount)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters directly but reads three integers N, A, and B from input, along with a list of integers v_i. It calculates the maximum average of all combinations of the integers in v_i, where the size of each combination ranges from B to B + (B - A). It returns the maximum average found and counts how many combinations yield this maximum average. If no combinations are formed (which can happen if B is greater than the number of available integers), it will still attempt to compute averages, potentially leading to a division by zero error.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
