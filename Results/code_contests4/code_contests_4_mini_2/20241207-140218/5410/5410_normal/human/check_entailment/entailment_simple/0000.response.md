The provided program attempts to solve the problem of selecting a specified number of items to maximize the arithmetic mean of their values. However, there are several issues in the implementation that prevent it from being correct according to the problem description.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Range of Selection**: The loop `for pcs in range(B - A + 1)` is incorrect. It iterates over a range that does not properly account for selecting at least `A` items and at most `B` items. Instead, it should iterate from `A` to `B` inclusive.

2. **Combinations Generation**: The line `perm = list(itertools.combinations(v, B + pcs))` is also incorrect. The number of items in the combinations generated should be between `A` and `B`, but the current implementation is generating combinations of size `B + pcs`, which does not align with the constraints.

3. **Counting Combinations**: The method of counting combinations is flawed. The program currently checks for the maximum average and counts combinations, but it does not correctly handle the counts for all sizes of combinations between `A` and `B`.

4. **Output Format**: The program does not ensure that the output for the maximum mean adheres to the specified precision (up to `10^{-6}`), as it does not format the output.

### Conclusion:
Due to these issues, the program does not fulfill the requirements specified in the problem description. Specifically, it fails to correctly find the maximum possible arithmetic mean and the number of ways to select the items within the specified constraints.

Correctness: **False**
