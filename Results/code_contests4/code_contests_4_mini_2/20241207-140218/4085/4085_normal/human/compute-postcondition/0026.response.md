Output State: **`gcd_arr` is a list where `gcd_arr[0]` contains the gcd of the first element of `a`, `gcd_arr_rev` is a list where `gcd_arr_rev[n]` contains the gcd of the elements from `a[n-1]` to `a[n-1]`, `res` is the maximum gcd value computed from pairs of `gcd_arr[i]` and `gcd_arr_rev[i + 1]` for `0 <= i < n - 1`, `n` is the total number of elements in `a`, and `func_2(res)` is called with `res` as an argument.**
