Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 10^5; `A` is a list of `N` integers between 1 and 10^9; `sep` is written to `file` between each element of `args` except before the first; `file` now contains the string representation of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` along with the value from `kwargs` for 'end' or a newline; `at_start` is False; `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least `N` elements; `x` is the last element in `args` written to `file`; the value of 'flush' has been popped from `kwargs`, and it was True.***
