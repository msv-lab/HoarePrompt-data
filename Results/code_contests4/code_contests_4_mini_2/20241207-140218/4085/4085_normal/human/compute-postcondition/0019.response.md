The line of code `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', b'\n'))` affects the state of the `file` variable by writing a value to it. The `kwargs.pop('end', b'\n')` retrieves the value associated with the key 'end' from the `kwargs` dictionary, removing it from the dictionary. If 'end' is not present, it defaults to `b'\n'`. 

The previous values of the affected variables are not changed, but `file` now contains an additional string representation of the value retrieved from `kwargs` (or just a newline if 'end' wasn't present).

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 10^5; `A` is a list of `N` integers between 1 and 10^9; `sep` is written to `file` between each element of `args` except before the first; `file` now contains the string representation of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` along with the value from `kwargs` for 'end' or a newline, `at_start` is False; `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least `N` elements; `x` is the last element in `args` written to `file`.
