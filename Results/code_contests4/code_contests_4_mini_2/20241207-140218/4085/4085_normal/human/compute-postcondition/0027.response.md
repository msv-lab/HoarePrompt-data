The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `N` and `A`. `N` is an integer that must satisfy the constraint 2 <= N <= 10^5, and `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `A_i` satisfies the constraint 1 <= A_i <= 10^9. The function processes these inputs and returns an output based on the specified relationships and constraints. 

However, the output behavior is not provided in your prompt. If you can provide the output behavior for `func_1`, I would be able to complete the functionality description accordingly. 

For now, based on the available information, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer N and a list A of N integers, where N satisfies 2 <= N <= 10^5 and each integer in A satisfies 1 <= A_i <= 10^9.**
