The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `N` and `A`. `N` is an integer that must satisfy the constraint \(2 \leq N \leq 100,000\). `A` is a list of integers with a length of `N`, where each element `A[i]` is an integer that lies between 1 and \(10^9\) (inclusive). After executing the function, it will return a value based on the contents of the list `A` and the integer `N`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer N and a list A of N integers, where each integer in A is between 1 and 10^9.**
