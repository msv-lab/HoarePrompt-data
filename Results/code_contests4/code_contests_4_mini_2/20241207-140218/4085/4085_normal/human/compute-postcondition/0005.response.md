Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 10^5, `A` is a list of `N` integers between 1 and 10^9, `sep` is written to `file`, `file` is assigned from `kwargs`, `at_start` is False, and `args` is a non-empty iterable if `at_start` is False. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
