According to the code, the loop iterates over `args`. For the loop to execute at least once, `args` must be a non-empty iterable. The states that need to be considered are the contents of `args`, as well as the initial values of the variables `N`, `A`, `sep`, `file`, and `at_start`, which do not directly affect the execution of the loop.

Since `N` is an integer and `A` is a list of integers, these values do not influence the execution of the loop. The crucial point is ensuring that `args` is not empty. Therefore, we need to ensure that `args` contains at least one element.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 10^5, `A` is a list of `N` integers between 1 and 10^9, `sep` is assigned from `kwargs`, `file` is assigned from `kwargs`, `at_start` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `args` must be a non-empty iterable**
