You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: There are N integers, A_1, A_2, ..., A_N, written on the blackboard.

You will choose one of them and replace it with an integer of your choice between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), possibly the same as the integer originally written.

Find the maximum possible greatest common divisor of the N integers on the blackboard after your move.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 2 \leq N \leq 10^5
* 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^9

Output

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
A_1 A_2 ... A_N

Output

Print the maximum possible greatest common divisor of the N integers on the blackboard after your move.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 10^5, and A is a list of N integers where each integer A_i satisfies 1 <= A_i <= 10^9.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = sorted(readlist())
    gcd_arr = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        gcd_arr[i + 1] = gcd(gcd_arr[i], a[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `gcd_arr` is a list where `gcd_arr[i]` contains the gcd of the first `i` elements of `a`, for `1 <= i <= n`; `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 10^5; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
    gcd_arr_rev = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in reversed(range(n)):
        gcd_arr_rev[i] = gcd(gcd_arr_rev[i + 1], a[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `gcd_arr` is a list where `gcd_arr[i]` contains the gcd of the first `i` elements of `a` for `1 <= i <= n`; `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 10^5; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `gcd_arr_rev` is a list where `gcd_arr_rev[i]` contains the gcd of the elements from `a[i]` to `a[n-1]` for `0 <= i < n`.
    res = 0
    for i in range(n):
        res = max(res, gcd(gcd_arr[i], gcd_arr_rev[i + 1]))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `gcd_arr` is a list where `gcd_arr[0]` contains the gcd of the first element of `a`, `gcd_arr_rev` is a list where `gcd_arr_rev[n]` contains the gcd of the elements from `a[n-1]` to `a[n-1]`, `res` is the maximum gcd value computed from pairs of `gcd_arr[i]` and `gcd_arr_rev[i + 1]` for `0 <= i < n - 1`, `n` is the total number of elements in `a`.
    func_2(res)

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 10^5, and A is a list of N integers where each A[i] is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).
def func_2():
    sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', b' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        
        file.write(str(x))
        
        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 10^5; `A` is a list of `N` integers between 1 and 10^9; `sep` is written to `file` between each element of `args` except before the first; `file` contains the string representation of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`; `at_start` is False; `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least `N` elements; `x` is the last element in `args` written to `file`.
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', b'\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 10^5; `A` is a list of `N` integers between 1 and 10^9; `sep` is written to `file` between each element of `args` except before the first; `file` contains the string representation of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` along with the value from `kwargs` for 'end' or a newline; `at_start` is False; `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least `N` elements; `x` is the last element in `args` written to `file`; if the value of 'flush' was True, then the file has been flushed. Otherwise, there are no changes made to the file.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
