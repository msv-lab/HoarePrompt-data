You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are N integers, A_1, A_2, ..., A_N, written on the blackboard.

You will choose one of them and replace it with an integer of your choice between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), possibly the same as the integer originally written.

Find the maximum possible greatest common divisor of the N integers on the blackboard after your move.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 2 \leq N \leq 10^5
* 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^9

Output

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
A_1 A_2 ... A_N

Output

Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 10^5, and A is a list of N integers where each integer A_i satisfies 1 <= A_i <= 10^9.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = sorted(readlist())
    gcd_arr = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        gcd_arr[i + 1] = gcd(gcd_arr[i], a[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `gcd_arr` is a list where `gcd_arr[i]` contains the gcd of the first `i` elements of `a`, for `1 <= i <= n`; `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 10^5; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
    gcd_arr_rev = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in reversed(range(n)):
        gcd_arr_rev[i] = gcd(gcd_arr_rev[i + 1], a[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `gcd_arr` is a list where `gcd_arr[i]` contains the gcd of the first `i` elements of `a` for `1 <= i <= n`; `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 10^5; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `gcd_arr_rev` is a list where `gcd_arr_rev[i]` contains the gcd of the elements from `a[i]` to `a[n-1]` for `0 <= i < n`.
    res = 0
    for i in range(n):
        res = max(res, gcd(gcd_arr[i], gcd_arr_rev[i + 1]))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `gcd_arr` is a list where `gcd_arr[0]` contains the gcd of the first element of `a`, `gcd_arr_rev` is a list where `gcd_arr_rev[n]` contains the gcd of the elements from `a[n-1]` to `a[n-1]`, `res` is the maximum gcd value computed from pairs of `gcd_arr[i]` and `gcd_arr_rev[i + 1]` for `0 <= i < n - 1`, `n` is the total number of elements in `a`.
    func_2(res)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `N` and a list `A` of `N` integers, where `N` satisfies `2 <= N <= 10^5` and each integer in `A` satisfies `1 <= A_i <= 10^9`. It computes the maximum GCD of any two non-overlapping subsets of the list `A` by calculating the GCD of prefix and suffix segments of the sorted list `A`. The result is then passed to another function, `func_2(res)`, but the actual output of `func_1` is not returned and remains undefined.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 10^5, and A is a list of N integers where each A[i] is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).
def func_2():
    sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', b' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        
        file.write(str(x))
        
        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 10^5; `A` is a list of `N` integers between 1 and 10^9; `sep` is written to `file` between each element of `args` except before the first; `file` contains the string representation of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`; `at_start` is False; `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least `N` elements; `x` is the last element in `args` written to `file`.
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', b'\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 10^5; `A` is a list of `N` integers between 1 and 10^9; `sep` is written to `file` between each element of `args` except before the first; `file` contains the string representation of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` along with the value from `kwargs` for 'end' or a newline; `at_start` is False; `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least `N` elements; `x` is the last element in `args` written to `file`; if the value of 'flush' was True, then the file has been flushed. Otherwise, there are no changes made to the file.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a variable number of arguments and keyword arguments, writes the string representation of each argument to a specified file with a specified separator, and appends an end character. If the `flush` keyword argument is true, it flushes the output buffer. It assumes that there are at least two arguments and handles the output formatting accordingly.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
