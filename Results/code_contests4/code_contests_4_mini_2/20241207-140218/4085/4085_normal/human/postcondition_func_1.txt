The function accepts a variable number of arguments and keyword arguments, writes the string representation of each argument to a specified file with a specified separator, and appends an end character. If the `flush` keyword argument is true, it flushes the output buffer. It assumes that there are at least two arguments and handles the output formatting accordingly.
