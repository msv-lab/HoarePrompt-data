Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads exactly 10 integers from input, which corresponds to the 10 lines specified in the problem description. Each integer represents the score of a question.

2. **Score Constraints**: The program ensures that each score is converted to an integer using `int(input())`. The problem description states that each score \( s_i \) must satisfy the condition \( 0 \leq s_i \leq 100 \). The program does not explicitly check for these constraints, but it assumes valid input as stated in the problem. Therefore, if the input follows the given constraints, the program will function correctly.

3. **Summation**: The variable `k` is initialized to 0 and is updated in a loop that runs 10 times, accumulating the score of each question. This is in line with the requirement to calculate the total score of the 10 questions.

4. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the total score, which is exactly what is required by the problem description.

Given this analysis, the program adheres to the problem description and correctly computes the total score from the input provided. Thus, the correctness of the program is confirmed.
