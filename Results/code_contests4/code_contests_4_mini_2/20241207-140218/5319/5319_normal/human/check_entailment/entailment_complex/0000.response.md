Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Although it correctly sums up the 10 integer inputs representing the scores, it does not handle or validate cases where the input may not be an integer or where the integer is out of the specified range (0 ≤ si ≤ 100). 

The problem description implies that the input will always be valid integers within the specified range, but the program lacks error handling for scenarios where this might not be the case, such as if a user inputs a non-integer value or a number outside the specified range. Therefore, while the function may work correctly under ideal conditions, it cannot be guaranteed to do so in all potential cases as required by the problem description.
