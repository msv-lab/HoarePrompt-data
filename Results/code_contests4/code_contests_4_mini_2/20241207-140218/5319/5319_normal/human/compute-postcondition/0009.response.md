The function `func` does not accept any parameters as it reads 10 integers directly from input. Each integer represents the score of a problem and satisfies the constraint 0 ≤ si ≤ 100. After processing these scores, the function will return a result based on the scores read. Since the output details are not provided, we cannot specify the exact return value. However, based on the constraints, we can outline the expected inputs.

Functionality: **The function reads 10 integers from input, each representing a score that satisfies 0 ≤ si ≤ 100.**
