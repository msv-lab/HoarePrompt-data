The value of `k` is updated to `k + int(input())`. Initially, `k` is 0, and the input will be converted to an integer. The specific value of the input is not known, but it will be added to 0. Therefore, the value of `k` will equal the integer input. The state of the other variables is not affected. 

Output State: **`k` is the integer input, `i` is 0**
