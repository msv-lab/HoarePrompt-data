The value of `k` is updated by adding `int(input())`, which means `k` is increased by the value obtained from user input converted to an integer. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is the integer input increased by an additional integer input, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`k` is the integer input increased by an additional integer input, `i` is 1**
