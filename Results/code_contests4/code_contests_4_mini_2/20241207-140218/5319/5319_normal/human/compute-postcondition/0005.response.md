According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than 10. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` being 2. Since `i` must be less than 10 for the loop to continue, the condition will still hold true.

State: **`k` is the integer input increased by an additional integer input, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than 10**
