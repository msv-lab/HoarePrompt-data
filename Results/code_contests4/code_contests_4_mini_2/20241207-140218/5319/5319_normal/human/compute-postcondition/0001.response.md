According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the range provided. The range is defined as `range(10)`, which means `i` will take on the values from 0 to 9. The variable `k` initialized to 0 does not affect the execution of the loop directly; however, `i` needs to be set to the starting value of the range when the loop begins. 

For the loop to execute the first time, `i` should start at 0, as that is the first value in the specified range. 

State: **`k` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0**
