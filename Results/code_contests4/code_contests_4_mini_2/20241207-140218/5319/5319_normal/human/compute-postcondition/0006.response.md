`k` is updated by adding an integer obtained from `input()`. The previous value of `k` is the integer input increased by an additional integer input, while `i` is 2, allowing the loop to execute a second time since `i` is less than 10. The state of `i` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is the integer input increased by an additional integer input plus the new integer input from `input()`; `i` is 2.

Output State: **`k` is the integer input increased by an additional integer input plus the new integer input from `input()`; `i` is 2**
