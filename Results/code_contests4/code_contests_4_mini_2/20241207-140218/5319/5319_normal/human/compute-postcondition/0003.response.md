According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 10. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` will be incremented by 1 with each iteration. Therefore, after the first iteration, `i` will be 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must remain less than 10.

State: **`k` is the integer input, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than 10**
