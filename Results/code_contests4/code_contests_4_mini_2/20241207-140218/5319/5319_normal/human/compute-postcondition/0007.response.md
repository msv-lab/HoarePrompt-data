The loop iterates 10 times, and during each iteration, it takes an integer input and adds it to the variable `k`. After all iterations, `k` will be the sum of all the 10 integer inputs provided, and `i` will be 9, representing the last index of the loop.

Output State: **`k` is the sum of the 10 integer inputs, `i` is 9.**
