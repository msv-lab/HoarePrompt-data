Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly reads 10 lines of input, each representing an integer score, and sums them up. It uses a loop that iterates exactly 10 times, ensuring that it captures all the inputs as required by the problem description. The input range is correctly handled since it specifies that scores are between 0 and 100, which the program processes by converting input strings to integers. Thus, the output will be the correct total score of the provided inputs in every valid case that adheres to the problem's constraints.
