Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. It reads 10 integer scores from the input, one for each line, and calculates their total. The program uses a loop that iterates exactly 10 times, ensuring that it captures all the inputs as required. 

The input constraints (0 ≤ si ≤ 100) are respected by converting the input to an integer, and since there are exactly 10 lines of input expected, the program will work correctly for all valid inputs within these constraints. 

There are no edge cases or potential inputs where the program would fail to produce the correct total score based on the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct and works as intended for all specified cases.
