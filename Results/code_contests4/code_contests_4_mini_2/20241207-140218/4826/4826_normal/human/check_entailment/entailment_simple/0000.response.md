To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the given problem description, we need to analyze the program's logic and ensure it meets all requirements.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of cities.
   - It then reads the city coordinates in the form of a list of `n` distinct integers.

2. **Sorting Coordinates**:
   - The program sorts the list of coordinates. This is crucial because the minimum distance between any two cities will occur between consecutive cities when they are sorted.

3. **Distance Calculation**:
   - The program initializes a variable `dist` with a large value (`2 * 10 ** 9`), which serves as the minimum distance found so far.
   - It also initializes a `count` variable to keep track of how many pairs of cities have this minimum distance.
   - The program iterates through the sorted list of coordinates, checking the distance between each pair of consecutive cities. It calculates the distance `temp_dist` as the difference between consecutive coordinates.

4. **Updating Minimum Distance and Count**:
   - If a new minimum distance is found (`temp_dist < dist`), it updates `dist` and resets the count to 1.
   - If the distance equals the current minimum distance (`temp_dist == dist`), it increments the count.

5. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the minimum distance and the count of pairs that have this distance.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly calculates the minimum distance between pairs of cities by focusing on consecutive cities in a sorted list. This is efficient because the minimal distance can only be between adjacent numbers in sorted order.
- The counting of pairs with the minimum distance is handled correctly.
- The program adheres to the constraints and requirements laid out in the problem description.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles the minimum input size (n=2) correctly.
- The program will also perform correctly when the coordinates are spread widely across the specified range since it only looks at differences in sorted order.

### Conclusion:
The program fulfills all aspects of the problem description, correctly calculating both the minimal distance and the number of pairs with that distance.

Correctness: **True**
