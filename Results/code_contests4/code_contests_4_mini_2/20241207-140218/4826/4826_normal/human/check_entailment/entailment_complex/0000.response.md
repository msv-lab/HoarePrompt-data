Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why it meets the criteria:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of cities and then reads a list of `n` distinct integers which represent the coordinates of these cities. It correctly handles the constraints given (2 ≤ n ≤ 200,000 and the range of coordinates).

2. **Sorting**: The program sorts the list of coordinates, which is essential for finding the minimal distance between any two cities efficiently. By sorting the coordinates, the minimal distance will always be found between consecutive cities in the sorted order.

3. **Distance Calculation**: The function initializes a variable `dist` to a large value (2 * 10^9) to ensure that any valid distance found will be smaller. It then iterates through the sorted list of coordinates to calculate the distance between each consecutive pair of cities. This correctly identifies the minimal distance.

4. **Counting Pairs**: The program counts how many pairs of cities have the minimal distance. It increments the `count` variable when it finds a pair of consecutive cities with the same distance as the current minimum. This correctly accounts for multiple pairs that may have the same minimal distance.

5. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the minimal distance and the count of pairs, formatted correctly as required by the problem description.

Overall, the logic of the program aligns perfectly with the problem statement, and it efficiently determines the minimal distance and the number of pairs with that distance within the specified constraints. Thus, it correctly performs the task as described.
