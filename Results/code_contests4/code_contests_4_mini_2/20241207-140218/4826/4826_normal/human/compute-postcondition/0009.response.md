The value of `dist` is assigned the value of `temp_dist`. Since it is given that `temp_dist` is less than `dist`, the previous value of `dist` is greater than `temp_dist`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp_dist` is the distance between `coordinates[index + 1]` and `x`, `temp_dist` is less than `dist`, and `dist` is now equal to `temp_dist`.

Output State: **`temp_dist` is the distance between `coordinates[index + 1]` and `x`, `temp_dist` is less than `dist`, `dist` is now equal to `temp_dist`**
