Postcondition: ***`temp_dist` is the distance between `coordinates[index + 1]` and `x`. If `temp_dist` is less than `dist`, then `dist` is updated to `temp_dist` and `count` is set to 1. If `temp_dist` is greater than or equal to `dist`, and if `temp_dist` equals `dist`, then `count` is increased by 1.***
