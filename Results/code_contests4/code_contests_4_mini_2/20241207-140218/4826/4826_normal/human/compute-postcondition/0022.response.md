Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `cities` is an input integer, `coordinates` is a sorted iterable of integers with at least 2 integers, `dist` is 2000000000, `count` is 1, `index` is 1, `x` is the second integer in `coordinates`, `temp_dist` is `coordinates[2] - coordinates[1]` if `temp_dist` equals `dist`.***
