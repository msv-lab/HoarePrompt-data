The variable `temp_dist` is assigned the value of `coordinates[index + 1] - x`. The value of `x` is the first integer in `coordinates`, and `index` is less than the length of `coordinates` minus 1, which means `index + 1` is a valid index in the `coordinates` list. The exact values of `coordinates` and `x` are not specified, but we know that `x` is the first integer in `coordinates`, and `coordinates[index + 1]` will yield the next integer in the sorted iterable.

Therefore, `temp_dist` will hold the distance between the second integer in `coordinates` (at index `index + 1`) and the first integer (at index `index`).

Output State: **`temp_dist` is the distance between `coordinates[index + 1]` and `x` (the first integer in `coordinates`)**.
