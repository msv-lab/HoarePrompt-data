The value of `count` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `count` is unknown, so we can only state that it has increased. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `cities` is an input integer; `coordinates` is a sorted iterable of integers with at least 3 integers; `index` is 2; `x` is the third integer in `coordinates`; `temp_dist` is assigned the value `coordinates[index + 1] - x; count` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `cities` is an input integer; `coordinates` is a sorted iterable of integers with at least 3 integers; `index` is 2; `x` is the third integer in `coordinates`; `temp_dist` is assigned the value `coordinates[index + 1] - x; count` is increased by 1.**
