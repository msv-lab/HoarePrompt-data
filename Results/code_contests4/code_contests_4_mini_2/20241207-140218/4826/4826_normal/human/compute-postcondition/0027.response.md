The variable `dist` is assigned the value of `temp_dist`. The value of `temp_dist` is previously calculated as `coordinates[index + 1] - x`, where `index` is 2 and `x` is the third integer in `coordinates`. 

Thus, `temp_dist` is the difference between the fourth integer in `coordinates` (which is `coordinates[3]`) and `x`. Therefore, `dist` will take on the value of this difference.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `cities` is an input integer; `coordinates` is a sorted iterable of integers with at least 3 integers; `index` is 2; `x` is the third integer in `coordinates`; `temp_dist` is assigned the value `coordinates[index + 1] - x`; `dist` is assigned the value `temp_dist`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `cities` is an input integer; `coordinates` is a sorted iterable of integers with at least 3 integers; `index` is 2; `x` is the third integer in `coordinates`; `temp_dist` is assigned the value `coordinates[index + 1] - x`; `dist` is assigned the value `temp_dist`.**
