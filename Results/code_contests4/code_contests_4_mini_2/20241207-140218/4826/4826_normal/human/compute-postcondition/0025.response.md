According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `index` and the length of `coordinates`. If `index` is less than the length of `coordinates` minus 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `index` is set to 1 and `coordinates` has at least 2 integers, so the length of `coordinates` is at least 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `index` must be incremented to 2 and `x` must be the third integer in `coordinates`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `cities` is an input integer; `coordinates` is a sorted iterable of integers with at least 3 integers; `index` is 2, and `x` is the third integer in `coordinates`.**
