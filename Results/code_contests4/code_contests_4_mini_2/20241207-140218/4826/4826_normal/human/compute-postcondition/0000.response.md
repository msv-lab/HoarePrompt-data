The variable `cities` is assigned the value `int(sys.stdin.readline())`, which reads an integer input from standard input. The initial state of `n` and `a` does not affect this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `a` is a list of n distinct integers where each integer ai satisfies -1,000,000,000 ≤ ai ≤ 1,000,000,000; `cities` is an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `a` is a list of n distinct integers where each integer ai satisfies -1,000,000,000 ≤ ai ≤ 1,000,000,000; `cities` is an input integer.**
