The `coordinates` iterable is sorted in ascending order. The initial state indicates that `coordinates` is an iterable of integers obtained from input. The sorting operation will rearrange the integers in `coordinates` without affecting the values of `n`, `a`, or `cities`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the sorted order of `coordinates`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `a` is a list of n distinct integers where each integer ai satisfies -1,000,000,000 ≤ ai ≤ 1,000,000,000; `cities` is an input integer; `coordinates` is a sorted iterable of integers from input.**
