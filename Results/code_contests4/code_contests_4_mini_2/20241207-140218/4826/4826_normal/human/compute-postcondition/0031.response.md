Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `cities` is an input integer; `coordinates` is a sorted iterable of integers with at least 3 integers; `index` is 2; `x` is the third integer in `coordinates`; `temp_dist` is assigned the value `coordinates[index + 1] - x`. If `temp_dist` is less than `dist`, then `dist` is updated to the value of `temp_dist` and `count` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `temp_dist` is equal to `dist`, `count` is increased by 1 while the values of `dist` and `temp_dist` remain unchanged.***
