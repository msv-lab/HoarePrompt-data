The code assigns the result of `map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())` to `coordinates`. This means that `coordinates` will hold an iterable of integers, each one converted from the space-separated input provided through standard input. The previous values of `n`, `a`, and `cities` remain unchanged. The state of `coordinates` will depend on the input provided, which is currently unspecified. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `a` is a list of n distinct integers where each integer ai satisfies -1,000,000,000 ≤ ai ≤ 1,000,000,000; `cities` is an input integer; `coordinates` is an iterable of integers from input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `a` is a list of n distinct integers where each integer ai satisfies -1,000,000,000 ≤ ai ≤ 1,000,000,000; `cities` is an input integer; `coordinates` is an iterable of integers from input.**
