Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `cities` is an input integer; `coordinates` is a sorted iterable of integers with at least 2 integers; `dist` is the minimum distance between any two consecutive integers in `coordinates`; `count` is the count of pairs of consecutive integers in `coordinates` that have the distance equal to `dist`; the output is the string representation of `dist` followed by a space and the string representation of `count`.**
