The variable `dist` is assigned the value of `temp_dist`. The value of `temp_dist` is calculated as `coordinates[2] - coordinates[1]`, which means `dist` will now hold the difference between the second and third integers in the sorted iterable `coordinates`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `cities` is an input integer, `coordinates` is a sorted iterable of integers with at least 2 integers, `dist` is the value of `temp_dist`, `count` is 0, `index` is 1, `x` is the second integer in `coordinates`, `temp_dist` is `coordinates[2] - coordinates[1]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `cities` is an input integer; `coordinates` is a sorted iterable of integers with at least 2 integers; `dist` is `temp_dist`; `count` is 0; `index` is 1; `x` is the second integer in `coordinates`; `temp_dist` is `coordinates[2] - coordinates[1]`**.
