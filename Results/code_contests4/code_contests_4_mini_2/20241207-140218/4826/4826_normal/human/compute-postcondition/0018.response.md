The variable `temp_dist` is assigned the value of `coordinates[index + 1] - x`. Given the initial state, `index` is 1, so `index + 1` equals 2. The value of `x` is the second integer in `coordinates`, which is also `coordinates[1]`. Therefore, `temp_dist` will be calculated as `coordinates[2] - coordinates[1]`. The rest of the variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a` is a list of n distinct integers, `cities` is an input integer, `coordinates` is a sorted iterable of integers with at least 2 integers, `dist` is 2000000000, `count` is 0, `index` is 1, `x` is the second integer in `coordinates`, `temp_dist` is `coordinates[2] - coordinates[1]`**.
