Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `cities` is an input integer; `coordinates` is a sorted iterable of integers with at least 2 integers. If `index` is less than the length of `coordinates` minus 1, and if `temp_dist` is less than `dist`, then `dist` is updated to `temp_dist`, `count` is set to 1, `index` is set to 1, and `x` is the second integer in `coordinates`. Otherwise, if `temp_dist` equals `dist`, `count` is set to 1, `index` is set to 1, and `x` is the second integer in `coordinates`, while `dist` remains unchanged. If `index` is not less than the length of `coordinates` minus 1, no changes are made to `dist`, `count`, `index`, or `x`.***
