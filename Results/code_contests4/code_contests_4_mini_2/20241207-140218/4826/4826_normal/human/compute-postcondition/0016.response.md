Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a` is a list of n distinct integers, `cities` is an input integer, `coordinates` is a sorted iterable of integers with at least 1 integer, `dist` is 2000000000, `count` is 0, `index` is 0, and `x` is the first integer in `coordinates`. If `index` is less than the length of `coordinates` minus 1, `temp_dist` is calculated as the distance between `coordinates[index + 1]` and `x`. If `temp_dist` is less than `dist`, then `dist` is updated to `temp_dist` and `count` is set to 1. If `temp_dist` is greater than or equal to `dist`, and if `temp_dist` equals `dist`, then `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the values of `dist` and `count` remain unchanged.***
