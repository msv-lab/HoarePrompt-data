The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) and a list of `n` distinct integers. It calculates the minimum distance between any two consecutive integers in the sorted list of coordinates and counts how many pairs of consecutive integers have that minimum distance. The function then prints the minimum distance and the count of such pairs.
