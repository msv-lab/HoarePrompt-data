The function accepts two non-negative integers `x` and `y`, along with a positive integer `p`. It calculates `x` raised to the power of `y` modulo `p` using an efficient method (exponentiation by squaring). The function returns the result of this computation. If `y` is 0, the function will return 1 (since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1). The initial value of `res` is 1, and it will remain unchanged if `y` is 0 or if there are no odd iterations during the computation. Therefore, the function returns 1 for `y` equal to 0 and the computed result for other values of `y`.
