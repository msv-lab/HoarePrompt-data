The function accepts two non-negative integers `x` and `y`, representing the number of students using two-block pieces and three-block pieces, respectively. It returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. If both `x` and `y` are zero, the function will not terminate properly, as it will enter an infinite loop since `y` will always be zero. However, given the constraint that `x + y > 0`, at least one of them will always be non-zero. The function effectively calculates the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm.
