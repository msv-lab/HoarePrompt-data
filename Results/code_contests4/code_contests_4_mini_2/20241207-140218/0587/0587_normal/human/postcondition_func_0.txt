The function accepts no parameters and retrieves a non-negative integer value from user input, which is expected to be between 0 and 1,000,000 (inclusive). The function returns this integer value. It does not handle invalid input or enforce the conditions on the input range, which could lead to a ValueError if the input is not an integer.
