The function accepts a list `l` containing two non-negative integers `n` and `m`, sorts the list in descending order based on a specified key provided by the function `getKey`, and returns the sorted list. It assumes that `l` contains exactly two elements, both of which are non-negative integers, and does not handle cases where the list has more or fewer than two elements.
