The function `func_6` initializes a thread that targets a function named `main`. It does not accept any parameters directly, but it operates under the assumption that two non-negative integers `n` and `m` exist in the larger scope, constrained by 0 ≤ n, m ≤ 1,000,000 and n + m > 0. However, it does not utilize these parameters within the function itself, and it has no return value or output functionality.
