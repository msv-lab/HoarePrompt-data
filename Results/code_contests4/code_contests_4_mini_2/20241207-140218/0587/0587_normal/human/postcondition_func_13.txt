The function accepts two non-negative integers `x` and `y`, representing counts of two types of pieces. It returns the result of integer division of `x` by `y` if `y` is non-zero and `x` is divisible by `y`. If `y` is non-zero and `x` is not divisible by `y`, it returns the floor division of `x` by `y` plus 1. However, if `y` is 0, the function will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` because division by zero is undefined. The function does not handle this case, leading to potential unhandled exceptions.
