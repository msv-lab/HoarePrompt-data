The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns a list of integers representing the individual digits of `n`. It correctly handles any non-negative integer input, including zero, by converting the integer to a string, iterating through each character, and converting it back to an integer for the output list. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities beyond this behavior.
