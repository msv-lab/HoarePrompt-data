The function accepts no parameters and prints the string representations of the elements in `args` to a specified output stream, separated by a specified delimiter. The default output stream is `sys.stdout`, and the default delimiter is a space. It appends a specified ending string (defaulting to a newline) after printing the elements. If the `flush` keyword argument is set to True, it flushes the output buffer. The function does not handle the cases where `args` is empty, which could lead to no output being produced.
