The function accepts two non-negative integers, `n` and `r`, and returns the binomial coefficient calculated as factorial(n) // (factorial(r) * factorial(n - r)). It assumes that `n` and `r` satisfy the conditions that 0 ≤ `n`, `r` ≤ 1,000,000, and `n + r > 0`. However, the function does not handle cases where `r` is greater than `n`, which would result in a negative value in the factorial calculation for `n - r`, potentially causing a runtime error. Thus, while the function aims to compute the binomial coefficient, it lacks error handling for invalid input scenarios.
