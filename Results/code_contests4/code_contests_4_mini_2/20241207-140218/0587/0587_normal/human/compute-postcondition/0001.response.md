The values of `sep` and `file` are being assigned defaults from the `kwargs` dictionary. The previous values of `sep` and `file` are not specified, but they will be set to either the values popped from `kwargs` or the default values of `' '` for `sep` and `sys.stdout` for `file`. The values of `n` and `m` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ n, m ≤ 1,000,000 and n + m > 0; `sep` is either the value from `kwargs` or ' '; `file` is either the value from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ n, m ≤ 1,000,000 and n + m > 0; `sep` is either the value from `kwargs` or ' '; `file` is either the value from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`.**
