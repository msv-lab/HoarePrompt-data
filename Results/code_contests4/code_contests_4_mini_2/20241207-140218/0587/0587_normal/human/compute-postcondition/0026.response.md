Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and determines whether it is a prime number. It returns `False` if `n` is less than or equal to 1, or if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3. For numbers greater than 3, it checks divisibility using a loop with potential divisors up to the square root of `n`, returning `False` if any divisors are found. If no divisors are found, it returns `True`, indicating that `n` is prime. The function does not handle cases where `n` is 0 or 1 appropriately by returning `False`, but does not explicitly cover other edge cases beyond the specified conditions.**
