Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `sep` is either the value from `kwargs` or ' ', `file` is either the value from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a list with at least 1 element, `file` contains the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`, and the value written to `file` is either `kwargs['end']` or '\n'. If `kwargs` has the key 'flush' with a value of True, the flush method of `file` is called to clear the output buffer. Otherwise, no action is taken regarding flushing the output buffer.***
