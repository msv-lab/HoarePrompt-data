Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `sep` is either the value from `kwargs` or ' ', `file` is either the value from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a list with at least 1 element, and `x` is the first element in `args`. If `at_start` is False, then `sep` is written to `file`.***
