The function `func_20` does not accept any parameters, as indicated by the definition. It operates under the constraints that `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq n, m \leq 1,000,000\) and \(n + m > 0\). However, since there are no inputs to the function, it does not return values based on parameters. The output behavior is unspecified in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its output behavior is unspecified based on the given information.**
