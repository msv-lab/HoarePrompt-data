The function `func_18` does not accept any parameters and simply redirects standard input to read from a file named 'input.txt' and standard output to write to a file named 'output.txt'. It does not perform any operations with the variables `n` and `m`, nor does it return any values or checks for their constraints. The function effectively sets up the environment for input and output file handling but lacks any logic related to `n` and `m`.
