The function accepts no parameters and returns a list containing the results of `func_3()`. It assumes that the variables `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ n, m ≤ 1,000,000 and n + m > 0. However, since it does not directly handle input for `n` and `m`, it relies on these conditions being satisfied externally.
