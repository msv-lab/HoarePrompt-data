Correctness: **False**.

The program uses `raw_input()` which is not defined in Python 3; it should be `input()`. This will result in a `NameError` when the program is executed in a Python 3 environment. Therefore, the program does not handle the input correctly.

Additionally, the variable name `list` shadows the built-in Python `list` type, which is not a good practice and could lead to confusion or errors in more complex programs. 

Since the program will fail to run correctly due to the `raw_input()` issue, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
