Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic specified in the problem description. It checks if `A` is a divisor of `B` using the modulo operation (`%`) and then prints the appropriate result based on that condition. 

Here's the reasoning behind the correctness:

1. **Divisor Check**: If `A` is a divisor of `B`, the condition `list[1] % list[0] == 0` will evaluate to `True`. In this case, the program correctly computes and prints `A + B`.
   
2. **Non-Divisor Case**: If `A` is not a divisor of `B`, the program correctly evaluates to `False`, and prints `B - A`.

3. **Constraints Handling**: The constraints specified (1 ≤ A ≤ B ≤ 20) ensure that both `A` and `B` are positive integers, and the program will handle all edge cases within this range correctly. 

4. **Examples Verification**: The program produces the correct outputs for the provided examples:
   - For input `4 12`, it prints `16` (since `4` is a divisor of `12`).
   - For input `8 20`, it prints `12` (since `8` is not a divisor of `20`).
   - For input `1 1`, it prints `2` (since `1` is a divisor of `1`).

Since I could not find any input case where the program fails to meet the requirements, I conclude that the program is correct.

Thus, the final output is:

Correctness: **True**
