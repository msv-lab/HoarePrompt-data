The annotated program performs the following steps:

1. It reads two integers, `A` and `B`, from standard input as a list of integers.
2. It checks if `B` is divisible by `A` using the condition `list[1] % list[0] == 0`. If this condition is true, it prints the sum `A + B`. Otherwise, it prints the difference `B - A`.

Now, let's compare this behavior with the problem description:

- The problem states that if `A` is a divisor of `B`, it should print `A + B`. The program correctly checks if `B` is divisible by `A` (using `list[1] % list[0] == 0`), which corresponds to the requirement of checking if `A` is a divisor of `B`.
- If `A` is not a divisor of `B`, it should print `B - A`. The program also correctly implements this by printing `list[1] - list[0]` when the condition is false.

Additionally, the constraints and input/output formats are respected:
- The program reads two integers, ensuring they are within the specified range (1 to 20).
- The output is provided directly as required.

Thus, the program behaves as specified in the problem description for all valid inputs within the defined constraints.

Correctness: **True**
