Correctness: **False**

The program contains a mistake in the way it handles input and output. Specifically, it uses `raw_input()` which is not a valid function in Python 3 (it is valid in Python 2). This would lead to a `NameError` in Python 3 environments since `raw_input()` does not exist.

Additionally, the program is defined inside a function `func()` but does not take any parameters for `A` and `B`, which means it relies solely on reading from standard input. While this is not a direct issue with the logic, it does not conform to conventional practices of passing parameters for better function design and testing.

Moreover, the logic for checking if `A` is a divisor of `B` is implemented correctly, and it would produce the expected output if the input were correctly handled. However, due to the aforementioned input handling issue, the program cannot function as required based on the problem description.

Thus, while the core logic is correct, the improper input handling makes the program fail to meet the problem requirements in a Python 3 environment.
