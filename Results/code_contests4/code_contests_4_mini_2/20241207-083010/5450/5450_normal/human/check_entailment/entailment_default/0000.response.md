The program is designed to read two positive integers A and B and check if A is a divisor of B. If A divides B without a remainder, it prints the sum of A and B; otherwise, it prints the difference B - A.

Let's analyze the code:

```python
list = [int(i) for i in raw_input().split()]
if list[1] % list[0] == 0:
    print(list[0] + list[1])
else:
    print(list[1] - list[0])
```

1. **Input Handling**: The code reads input correctly and splits the integers into a list.
2. **Divisibility Check**: It checks if B (list[1]) is divisible by A (list[0]) using the modulus operator.
3. **Output Logic**: It prints A + B if A is a divisor of B, otherwise it prints B - A.

Now, let's consider the constraints: 1 ≤ A ≤ B ≤ 20. This means both A and B will always be positive integers within this range.

### Edge Cases:
- If A equals B (for instance, when both are 1), the output should be A + B (which equals 2).
- If A is 1, it is a divisor of any positive integer B, so the output should always be A + B.
- If A does not divide B, the output will be B - A.

The examples given in the problem description align with the expected behavior of the code:
- For input `4 12`, since 12 is divisible by 4, the output is `4 + 12 = 16`.
- For input `8 20`, since 20 is not divisible by 8, the output is `20 - 8 = 12`.
- For input `1 1`, since 1 is a divisor of 1, the output is `1 + 1 = 2`.

### Output Hints:
The output hints state that the function reads two positive integers A and B and prints the sum of A and B if B is divisible by A; otherwise, it prints the difference B - A. This matches the logic in the code.

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the code, the problem description, edge cases, and output hints, I find that the program behaves correctly for all specified cases.

Correctness: **True**.
