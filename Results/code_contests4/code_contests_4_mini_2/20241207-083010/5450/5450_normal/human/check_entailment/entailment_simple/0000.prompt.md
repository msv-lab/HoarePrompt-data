You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given positive integers A and B.

If A is a divisor of B, print A + B; otherwise, print B - A.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 1 \leq A \leq B \leq 20

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


A B


Output

If A is a divisor of B, print A + B; otherwise, print B - A.

Examples

Input

4 12


Output

16


Input

8 20


Output

12


Input

1 1


Output

2
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: A and B are positive integers such that 1 <= A <= B <= 20.
def func():
    list = [int(i) for i in raw_input().split()]
    if (list[1] % list[0] == 0) :
        print(list[0] + list[1])
    else :
        print(list[1] - list[0])
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`A` and `B` are positive integers such that 1 <= `A` <= `B` <= 20; `list` is a list of integers parsed from input. If `list[1]` is divisible by `list[0]`, the result printed is `list[0] + list[1]`. Otherwise, the result printed is `list[1] - list[0]`.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
