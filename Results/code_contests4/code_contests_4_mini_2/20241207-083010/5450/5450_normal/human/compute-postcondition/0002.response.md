To analyze the given code snippet, we start with the initial state where `list` is a list of integers parsed from input, and we know that the second element of `list` is divisible by the first element. 

The code `print(list[0] + list[1])` computes the sum of the first and second elements of `list`. 

Let's denote:
- `list[0]` as `x`
- `list[1]` as `y`

From the initial state, we know:
- `x` is the first element of `list`
- `y` is the second element of `list` (and `y` is divisible by `x`)

The output of the code will be the result of `x + y`. Since we don't have specific values for `x` and `y` but know they are both positive integers and that `1 <= x <= y <= 20`, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`list` is a list of integers parsed from input; the first element is `list[0]`, the second element is `list[1]`; the result printed is `list[0] + list[1]`.**
