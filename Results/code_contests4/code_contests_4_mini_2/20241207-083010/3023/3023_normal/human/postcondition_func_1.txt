The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` tuples representing the coordinates of balls. It calculates the minimum score based on the differences between the coordinates of all pairs of balls, returning this minimum score as `ans`. The function also processes unique pairs of differences to avoid redundant calculations, ensuring efficient computation of the minimum score. Potential edge cases include scenarios where no pairs of balls result in a score lower than `n`, in which case the function would still return `n` as the minimum score.
