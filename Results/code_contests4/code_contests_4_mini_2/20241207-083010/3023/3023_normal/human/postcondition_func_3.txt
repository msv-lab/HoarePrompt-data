The function accepts an integer parameter N (where 1 ≤ N ≤ 50) and coordinates for N balls, each represented by (x_i, y_i) where |x_i|, |y_i| ≤ 10^9. The function checks a condition related to the environment variable 'PYCHARM_HOSTED', but since this condition is always false, it calls `func_1()` regardless of any other context. The return value of `func_1()` and any potential outputs from this function are not specified, leaving the exact output of `func_3()` unclear.
