The function accepts a `solution` function, an `inputs_gen` generator that yields test cases, and a `judge` function to verify the correctness of the `solution`. It processes each test case by applying `solution` to the arguments generated by `inputs_gen` and checks the result using `judge`. If the result is incorrect, it logs the error. At the end, it logs the total number of tests processed and the number of incorrect results. The function does not return any value.
