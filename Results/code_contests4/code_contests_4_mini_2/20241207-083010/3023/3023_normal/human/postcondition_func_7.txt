The function accepts three callables: `solution`, `inputs_gen`, and `solution_slow`. It runs tests by generating inputs using `inputs_gen` and comparing the outputs of `solution` and `solution_slow` for each input pair. If the results differ, it logs an error message and increments a counter for incorrect answers. After all tests are executed, it prints a summary indicating whether all tests passed or how many were wrong out of the total tests run. The function does not return any value explicitly.
