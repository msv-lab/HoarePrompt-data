In the provided code snippet, `points` is assigned the value returned by the function `score(p, q)`. The values of `p` and `q` are already calculated based on the previous state, which involves the `balls` list and the indices `n` and `i`. Since `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, and `p` and `q` are derived from the `balls` list using `n` and `i`, we can conclude that `points` will hold the result of the `score` function based on these values.

However, since we do not have specific values for `p` and `q`, we cannot determine the exact outcome of `points`. The other variables (`n`, `j`, and `tried`) remain unaffected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 50); `j` is equal to `n`; `p` is calculated as balls[n][0] - balls[i][0]; `q` is calculated as balls[n][1] - balls[i][1]; and `(-p, -q)` is added to the set `tried`; `points` is the result of score(p, q).**
