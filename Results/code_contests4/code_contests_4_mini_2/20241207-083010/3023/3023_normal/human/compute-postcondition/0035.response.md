Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 50). If `points` is less than `ans`, then `ans` is updated to the value of `points`, `i` is set to 2, `j` is set to 2, `p` is assigned the value of the first component difference, `q` is assigned the value of the second component difference, `(-p, -q)` is added to the set `tried`, and `points` is assigned the value returned by `score(p, q)`.***
