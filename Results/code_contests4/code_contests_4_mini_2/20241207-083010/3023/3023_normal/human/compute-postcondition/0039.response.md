According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. Since `i` is currently equal to `n`, the loop will not execute because the range for `j` is from 0 to `i - 1`, which means the loop requires `i` to be less than `n` for it to iterate. To allow the loop to execute again, `i` must be adjusted to a value that is less than `n`. 

Therefore, `i` can be set to a value less than `n`, for example, `i` can be `n - 1` or any value within the range from 0 to `n - 1`. The variable `ans` and `tried` are not directly affecting the execution of the loop, so they can remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 50), `ans` is the minimum score obtained from the differences calculated during the loop iterations, `i` is now `n - 1`, `tried` contains all unique pairs of differences that were processed during the loop**
