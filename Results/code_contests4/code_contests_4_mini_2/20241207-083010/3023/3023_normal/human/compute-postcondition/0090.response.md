The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `points`, which is the result of the function `score(p, q)`. The states of the other variables, `tried` and `points`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `tried` contains the tuples `(p, q)` and `(-p, -q)`; `points` is the result of the function `score(p, q)`; `ans` is equal to `points`.

Output State: **`tried` contains the tuples `(p, q)` and `(-p, -q)`; `points` is the result of the function `score(p, q)`; `ans` is equal to `points`**.
