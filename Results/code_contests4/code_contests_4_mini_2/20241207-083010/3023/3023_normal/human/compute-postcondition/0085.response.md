According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `j` is less than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` has reached a value of `i - 1`, as it would have started at 0 and incremented by 1 each time until it reached `i`. For the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to `i`, which means it can no longer execute again if `j` is equal to `i`.

Thus, the updated state should reflect that `j` is now `i`, and for the loop to execute again, `i` must be greater than `i` (which is not possible). Therefore, the loop cannot execute again.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 50); `tried` contains the tuples `(p, q)` and `(-p, -q)`; `points` is the value returned by `score(p, q)`; `ans` is assigned the value of `points`, and `j` is `i`, for the loop to execute again `i` must be greater than `i` (which is impossible)**.
