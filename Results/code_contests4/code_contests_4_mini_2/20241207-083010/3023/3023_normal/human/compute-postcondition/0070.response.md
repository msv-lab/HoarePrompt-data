The tuple (p, q) is added to the set `tried`. The values of `n`, `ans`, `i`, and the existing contents of `tried` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the addition of the tuple (p, q) to the set of tried values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 50), `ans` is the minimum score obtained from the processed differences, `i` is `n - 1`, `p` and `q` are calculated as the differences in the coordinates of `balls[j]` and `balls[i]`, and the tuple (p, q) has been added to the set of tried values.**
