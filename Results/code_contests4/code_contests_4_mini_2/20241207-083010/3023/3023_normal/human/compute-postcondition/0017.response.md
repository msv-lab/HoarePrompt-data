`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file. The previous state indicates that `x` is the third element in the list `args`. Therefore, the value of `x` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is assumed to be valid as per the elements in `args`. The other variables remain unaffected. The output state reflects that the value of `x` has been written to the file.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 50, `args` contains at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in the list, `at_start` is False, `sep` is written to the file, and `x` has been written to the file as a string.**
