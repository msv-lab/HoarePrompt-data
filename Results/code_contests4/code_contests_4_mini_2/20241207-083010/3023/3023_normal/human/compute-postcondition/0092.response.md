Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 50). If the tuple `(p, q)` is not present in `tried`, then `points` is computed by the function `score(p, q)`. If `points` is less than `ans`, then `ans` is updated to the value of `points`. If `(p, q)` is already in `tried`, no changes are made to `ans`.***
