The function `func_8` does not accept any parameters. It processes a set of coordinates for balls, where the number of balls `N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 50\). Each ball has distinct coordinates represented by integer pairs \((x_i, y_i)\) with the constraints \(|x_i|, |y_i| \leq 10^9\). The function returns a result based on the processed information regarding these coordinates.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and processes a set of coordinates for distinct balls, returning a result based on those coordinates.**
