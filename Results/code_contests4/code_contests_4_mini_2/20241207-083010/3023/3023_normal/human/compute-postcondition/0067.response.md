According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `i`. The loop will iterate `i` times, starting from `j` equal to 0 up to `j` equal to `i - 1`. However, given that `i` is currently equal to `n`, this means that the loop will not execute at all because the loop's condition requires `j` to iterate from 0 to `i - 1`, which cannot happen if `i` is equal to `n` and `i` must be less than `n`.

To ensure that the loop executes at least once, `i` must be adjusted to be less than `n`. Since `i` starts at `n`, it must be decremented by at least 1 to make it less than `n`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 50), `ans` is the minimum score obtained from the processed differences, `i` is `n - 1`, for the loop to execute at least once `i` must be less than `n`**
