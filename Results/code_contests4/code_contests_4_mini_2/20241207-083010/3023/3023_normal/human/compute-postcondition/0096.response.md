The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n` and `balls`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer representing the number of balls, with the constraint that 1 <= n <= 50. The parameter `balls` is a list containing `n` tuples, where each tuple consists of two integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the i-th ball, with the constraint that |x_i|, |y_i| <= 10^9. After executing the function body, it returns the minimum score `ans` obtained from all processed differences. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list of tuples `balls`, and return the minimum score `ans` based on the processed differences of the balls' coordinates.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of tuples `balls`, and returns the minimum score `ans` obtained from all processed differences.**
