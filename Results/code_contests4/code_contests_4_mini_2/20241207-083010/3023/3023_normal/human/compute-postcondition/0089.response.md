The variable `points` is assigned the value returned by the function `score(p, q)`, where `p` and `q` are the first elements of the tuple `tried`. The specific values of `p` and `q` are not provided, but they exist within the context of the tuple. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `tried` contains the tuples `(p, q)` and `(-p, -q)`; `points` is the result of the function `score(p, q)`.

Output State: **`tried` contains the tuples `(p, q)` and `(-p, -q)`; `points` is the result of the function `score(p, q)`**.
