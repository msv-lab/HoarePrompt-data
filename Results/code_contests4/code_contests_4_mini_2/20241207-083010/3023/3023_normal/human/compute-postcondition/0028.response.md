Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 50), `ans` is updated to a value less than the previous value, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `p` is assigned the value of the first component difference, `q` is assigned the value of the second component difference, and if the pair `(p, q)` has not been tried, then `points` is assigned the return value of `score(p, q)`. If `points` is less than `ans`, then `ans` is updated to be equal to `points`.***
