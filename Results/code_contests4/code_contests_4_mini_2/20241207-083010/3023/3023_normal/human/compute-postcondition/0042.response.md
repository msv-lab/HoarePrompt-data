The `tried` set will now include the new pair `(p, q)`, as it is being added to the set. The values of `n`, `ans`, `i`, and the contents of `tried` are not affected by this operation, except for the addition of the new pair. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 50), `ans` is the minimum score obtained from the differences calculated during the loop iterations, `i` is now `n - 1`, and `tried` now includes the pair `(p, q)`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 50), `ans` is the minimum score obtained from the differences calculated during the loop iterations, `i` is now `n - 1`, `tried` now includes the pair `(p, q)`**.
