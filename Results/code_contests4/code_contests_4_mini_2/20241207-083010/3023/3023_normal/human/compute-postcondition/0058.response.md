The code assigns the values of `p` and `q` based on the coordinates of `balls[j]` and `balls[i]`. The value of `j` is equal to `n`, which is a positive integer. Therefore, `balls[j][0]` and `balls[j][1]` refer to the coordinates of the `n`-th ball, while `balls[i][0]` and `balls[i][1]` refer to the coordinates of the `i`-th ball. The specific values of `p` and `q` depend on the coordinates of the respective balls.

Since `i` must be greater than `n - 1` for the loop to execute a second time, this implies that `i` is likely equal to or greater than `n` when the code is executed. The output state will indicate that `p` and `q` are calculated based on the difference between the coordinates of two balls.

Given that the specific values of the coordinates are not provided, we can summarize the output state as follows:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 50); `j` is equal to `n`; `p` is calculated as balls[n][0] - balls[i][0]; `q` is calculated as balls[n][1] - balls[i][1]**.
