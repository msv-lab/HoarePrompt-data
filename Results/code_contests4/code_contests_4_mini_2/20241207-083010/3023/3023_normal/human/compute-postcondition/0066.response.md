According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n`, which means that the loop has completed all its iterations, and `i` cannot be increased further without exceeding the range defined by `n`.

Since `i` is equal to `n`, for the loop to execute again, `i` would need to be incremented to `n + 1`, which is outside the allowed range for the loop. Therefore, the loop cannot execute again.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 50), `ans` is the minimum score obtained from the processed differences, `i` is equal to `n`, and for the loop to execute again `i` must be less than `n`**
