According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute again as long as `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` would have reached its maximum value of `i - 1`, meaning that it is currently `j = i - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented to `j = i`, and for the loop to be executed again, `i` must be greater than `j`, which means `i` must be greater than `i - 1`, which is always true as long as `i` is at least 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 50), for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be greater than `j`, where `j` is `i`**
