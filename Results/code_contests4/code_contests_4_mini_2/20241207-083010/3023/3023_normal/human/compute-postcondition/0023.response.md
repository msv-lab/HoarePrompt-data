Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 50; `args` contains at least `N` elements; `at_start` is False; `sep` has been written to the file before each element except the first; a value from `kwargs` associated with 'end' has been written to the file, or a newline character has been written if 'end' was not present; if the value associated with 'flush' in `kwargs` was True, it has been removed, and the file has been flushed to ensure all data is written to it.***
