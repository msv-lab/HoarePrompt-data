Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 50); `tried` contains the tuples `(p, q)` and `(-p, -q)`; `points` is the value returned by `score(p, q)`; `ans` is assigned the value of `points`; `j` is `i`, so it is impossible for the loop to execute again. The values of `p` and `q` are calculated as `balls[j][0] - balls[i][0]` and `balls[j][1] - balls[i][1]` respectively.**
