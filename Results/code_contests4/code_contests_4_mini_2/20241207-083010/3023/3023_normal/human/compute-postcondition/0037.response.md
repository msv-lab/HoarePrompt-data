Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 50), `ans` is the minimum score obtained from the differences calculated during the loop iterations, `i` is equal to the total number of iterations (which is the original value of `i`), `tried` contains all unique pairs of differences `(p, q)` and `(-p, -q)` that were processed during the loop.**
