According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to the total number of iterations, which means it is currently equal to `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

Since `i` is currently equal to `n`, after incrementing `i`, it will be `n + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `n`, which is not possible. Thus, the loop cannot execute a second time as `i` cannot be less than `n`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 50), `ans` is the minimum score obtained from the differences calculated during the loop iterations, `i` is equal to `n`, `tried` contains all unique pairs of differences that were processed during the loop; for the loop to execute again, it cannot since `i` is not less than `n`.**
