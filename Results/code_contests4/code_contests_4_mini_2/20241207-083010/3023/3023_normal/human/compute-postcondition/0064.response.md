Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 50); `j` is equal to `n`; `p` is calculated as `balls[n][0] - balls[i][0]`; `q` is calculated as `balls[n][1] - balls[i][1]`. If `(p, q)` was not previously tried, `(-p, -q)` is added to the set `tried`, and if `points` is less than `ans`, then `ans` is updated to the value of `points`, which is the result of `score(p, q)`.***
