Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 50), `ans` is the minimum score obtained from the differences calculated during the loop iterations, `i` is now `n - 1`, `tried` contains all unique pairs of differences that were processed during the loop, `p` and `q` are assigned the values of the differences between the coordinates of balls at indices `j` and `i`, and the pair `(p, q)` is not in `tried`.***
