According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `i`. The loop iterates while `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `n - 1`, which means that for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than `n - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it equal to `n - 1 + 1`, which simplifies to `n`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 50), `j` is equal to `n`, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be greater than `n - 1`**
