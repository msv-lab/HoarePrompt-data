The code `tried.add((-p, -q))` adds the tuple `(-p, -q)` to the set `tried`. The values of `p` and `q` are defined as `balls[n - 1][0] - balls[i][0]` and `balls[n - 1][1] - balls[i][1]`, respectively. The values of `p` and `q` are not affected by this code; they are computed prior to this line. The state of the set `tried` will now include the new tuple `(-p, -q)`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 50), `j` is equal to `n - 1`, `p` is balls[n - 1][0] - balls[i][0], `q` is balls[n - 1][1] - balls[i][1], and the tuple (-p, -q) is added to the set `tried`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 50), `j` is equal to `n - 1`, `p` is balls[n - 1][0] - balls[i][0], `q` is balls[n - 1][1] - balls[i][1], and the tuple (-p, -q) is added to the set `tried`.**
