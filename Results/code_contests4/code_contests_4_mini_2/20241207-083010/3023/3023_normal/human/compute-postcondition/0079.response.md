The code adds a tuple `(p, q)` to the set `tried`. The variables `p` and `q` are calculated based on the coordinates of `balls[j]` and `balls[i]`, but their specific values are not provided in the initial state. The value of `n` being a positive integer does not affect the execution of this line. Thus, while we know that `(p, q)` is being added to `tried`, the exact contents of `tried` cannot be determined without knowing the values of `p` and `q`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 50); `tried` now contains the tuple `(p, q)` based on the coordinates of `balls[j]` and `balls[i]`.**
