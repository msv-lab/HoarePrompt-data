The code attempts to add the tuple `(-p, -q)` to the set `tried`. The values of `p` and `q` are not provided explicitly, but they have been assigned the values of the first and second component differences, respectively. The set `tried` will now include the negative values of `p` and `q`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged in this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 50), `ans` is updated to a value less than the previous value, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `p` is assigned the value of the first component difference, `q` is assigned the value of the second component difference, and `(-p, -q)` is added to the set `tried`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 50), `ans` is updated to a value less than the previous value, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `p` is assigned the value of the first component difference, `q` is assigned the value of the second component difference, and `(-p, -q)` is added to the set `tried`.**
