Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 50), `ans` is assigned the value of `points`, which is less than `ans` prior to this assignment; `i` is `n - 1`, `p` and `q` are calculated as the differences in the coordinates of `balls[j]` and `balls[i]`, the tuple (p, q) has been added to the set of tried values; `tried` now includes the tuple (-p, -q).**
