The code snippet adds the tuple (-p, -q) to the set `tried`. The variables `p` and `q` are calculated from the `balls` list based on the values of `n` and `i`. The value of `j` remains equal to `n`, and `tried` is modified by adding a new element to it. The values of `p` and `q` are not changed by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 50); `j` is equal to `n`; `p` is calculated as balls[n][0] - balls[i][0]; `q` is calculated as balls[n][1] - balls[i][1]; and the tuple (-p, -q) is added to the set `tried`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 50); `j` is equal to `n`; `p` is calculated as balls[n][0] - balls[i][0]; `q` is calculated as balls[n][1] - balls[i][1]; and the tuple (-p, -q) is added to the set `tried`.**
