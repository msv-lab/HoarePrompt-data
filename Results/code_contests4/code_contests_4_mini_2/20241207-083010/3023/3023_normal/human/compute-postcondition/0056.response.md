Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 50), `j` is equal to `n - 1`, `p` is balls[n - 1][0] - balls[i][0], `q` is balls[n - 1][1] - balls[i][1]. If (p, q) is not in tried, `points` is assigned the value of `score(p, q)`, and if `points` is less than `ans`, then `ans` is updated to be equal to `points`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
