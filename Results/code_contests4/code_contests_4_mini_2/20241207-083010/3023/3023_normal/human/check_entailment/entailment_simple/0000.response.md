To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the functionality provided by the program.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to collect N balls located at specific coordinates (x_i, y_i) in a two-dimensional plane. The goal is to determine the minimum cost of collecting all the balls, which involves optimally choosing two integers p and q such that the cost is minimized. The cost is defined as follows:
- The cost of the first operation is always 1.
- The cost of subsequent operations is 0 if the operation is performed on a ball that is reachable by using the previously collected ball's coordinates adjusted by (p, q).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`:** 
   - Reads the number of balls and their coordinates into a list `balls`.
   - Calls `func_2` to compute the minimum cost.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - Constructs a dictionary `bdict` that maps each unique x-coordinate to a set of corresponding y-coordinates.
   - Iterates over pairs of balls and calculates potential p and q values (differences in coordinates).
   - Uses a helper function `score` to evaluate the cost for each (p, q) combination.
   - Returns the minimum cost found.

3. **Function `score`:**
   - For given p and q, calculates how many balls can be collected without additional cost.
   - The logic appears to correctly compute the effective cost based on the definition provided in the problem.

### Correctness Evaluation:
- The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum cost based on the operations defined in the problem description. 
- It effectively considers all pairs of balls to dynamically choose the best p and q that would minimize the cost of collecting all balls.
- The implementation of `score` correctly assesses how many balls can be collected at no cost based on previous operations, adhering to the cost definition provided.

### Conclusion:
The program follows the requirements laid out in the problem description. Given the way it processes the input, calculates differences, and evaluates costs, it is designed to find the minimum cost required to collect all balls optimally.

Correctness: **True**
