You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are N balls in a two-dimensional plane. The i-th ball is at coordinates (x_i, y_i).

We will collect all of these balls, by choosing two integers p and q such that p \neq 0 or q \neq 0 and then repeating the following operation:

* Choose a ball remaining in the plane and collect it. Let (a, b) be the coordinates of this ball. If we collected a ball at coordinates (a - p, b - q) in the previous operation, the cost of this operation is 0. Otherwise, including when this is the first time to do this operation, the cost of this operation is 1.



Find the minimum total cost required to collect all the balls when we optimally choose p and q.

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 50
* |x_i|, |y_i| \leq 10^9
* If i \neq j, x_i \neq x_j or y_i \neq y_j.
* All values in input are integers.

Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 50, and each ball's coordinates (x_i, y_i) are distinct integers with |x_i|, |y_i| <= 10^9 for i from 1 to N.
def func_1():
    N = read_int()
    balls = []
    for _ in range(N):
        balls.append(read_int_array())
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 50; `balls` contains `N` arrays of integers collected from `read_int_array()`.
    func_8(func_2(N, balls))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and reads an integer `N` (1 <= N <= 50) representing the number of balls. It then reads `N` arrays of integers, each representing the coordinates of the balls, which are stored in the `balls` list. Finally, it invokes another function `func_8` with the result of `func_2(N, balls)`, indicating that the function processes the ball coordinates but does not return any value directly.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 50) representing the number of balls, and balls is a list of n tuples, where each tuple contains two integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the i-th ball, with |x_i|, |y_i| <= 10^9.
def func_2(n, balls):
    bdict = collections.defaultdict(set)
    for (x, y) in balls:
        bdict[x].add(y)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 50); `balls` is a list of n tuples containing two integers each; `bdict` maps each unique first element `x` from the tuples in `balls` to a set containing all corresponding second elements `y` from those tuples; there are `n` iterations of the loop, processing all tuples in `balls`.
    tried = set()
    ans = n
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i):
            p, q = balls[j][0] - balls[i][0], balls[j][1] - balls[i][1]
            if (p, q) not in tried:
                tried.add((p, q))
                tried.add((-p, -q))
                points = score(p, q)
                if points < ans:
                    ans = points
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 50), `ans` is the minimum score obtained from all processed differences, `tried` contains all unique pairs of differences `(p, q)` and their negations that were processed during the entire loop execution.
    return ans
    #The program returns the minimum score `ans` obtained from all processed differences.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` tuples representing the coordinates of balls. It calculates the minimum score based on the differences between the coordinates of all pairs of balls, returning this minimum score as `ans`. The function also processes unique pairs of differences to avoid redundant calculations, ensuring efficient computation of the minimum score. Potential edge cases include scenarios where no pairs of balls result in a score lower than `n`, in which case the function would still return `n` as the minimum score.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: p and q are integers such that at least one of them is non-zero, and there are N balls with coordinates (x_i, y_i) where 1 <= N <= 50 and |x_i|, |y_i| <= 10^9 for each ball.
def score(p, q):
    out = n
    for (x, y) in balls:
        nx, ny = x + p, y + q
        
        if ny in bdict.get(nx, []):
            out -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `out` is equal to `N` minus the count of occurrences where `ny` is found in the list associated with `nx` in `bdict` for all pairs `(x, y)` in `balls`; `nx` is `x + p`, `ny` is `y + q` for each pair in `balls`.
    return out
    #The program returns the value of 'out', which is equal to N minus the count of occurrences where 'ny' is found in the list associated with 'nx' in 'bdict' for all pairs '(x, y)' in 'balls'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters, `p` and `q`, where at least one of them is non-zero. It calculates and returns the value of `out`, which is initialized to `N` (the number of balls) and decremented by one for each occurrence where the computed `ny` (y-coordinate adjusted by `q`) matches any entry in the list associated with the computed `nx` (x-coordinate adjusted by `p`) in `bdict`. The function effectively counts how many times the new y-coordinate can be found in the dictionary for the new x-coordinate and returns the adjusted count of balls.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 50, and each ball's coordinates (x_i, y_i) are integers with |x_i|, |y_i| ≤ 10^9, where i = 1, 2, ..., N.
def func_3():
    if (False and 'PYCHARM_HOSTED' in os.environ) :
        func_4()
    else :
        func_1()
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 50, and each ball's coordinates (`x_i`, `y_i`) are integers with |`x_i`|, |`y_i`| ≤ 10^9 for `i` = 1, 2, ..., `N`. Since the condition for the if block is false, the function `func_1()` is called instead of `func_4()`, leaving the output unchanged in terms of the conditions stated.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer parameter N (where 1 ≤ N ≤ 50) and coordinates for N balls, each represented by (x_i, y_i) where |x_i|, |y_i| ≤ 10^9. The function checks a condition related to the environment variable 'PYCHARM_HOSTED', but since this condition is always false, it calls `func_1()` regardless of any other context. The return value of `func_1()` and any potential outputs from this function are not specified, leaving the exact output of `func_3()` unclear.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 50, and each ball's coordinates (x_i, y_i) are integers where |x_i|, |y_i| <= 10^9, with all (x_i, y_i) being distinct pairs.

If `solution` is not None, then `solution` is assigned the value of `solve`, `test_inputs` is None, `test_outputs` is not None, `judge` is not None, `slow_solution` is not None, `func_6` has been called with arguments (`solution`, `test_inputs`, `judge`), and `func_7` has been called with arguments (`solution`, `test_inputs`, `slow_solution`).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and processes a set of distinct integer coordinates for balls, invoking different functions (`func_5`, `func_6`, `func_7`) based on whether certain variables (`solution`, `test_outputs`, `judge`, `slow_solution`) are not None. However, it does not specify a return value, so the outcome of the function is undefined in terms of output.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: solution is an integer representing the minimum total cost required to collect all balls, inputs_answers is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers representing the coordinates (x_i, y_i) of the balls, and the length of inputs_answers is an integer N such that 1 <= N <= 50.
def func_5(solution, inputs_answers):
    total, wrong = 0, 0
    for (args, test_ans) in inputs_answers:
        ans = solution(*args.copy())
        
        if ans != test_ans:

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `solution` is an integer representing the minimum total cost required to collect all balls, `total` is the number of tuples in `inputs_answers`, `wrong` is the count of incorrect answers, `inputs_answers` is the original list of tuples.
    func_8('ALL %d TESTS PASSED' % total if not wrong else 
    '%d out of %d tests are WRONG' % (wrong, total))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `solution`, which is a callable representing a method to calculate the cost of collecting all balls, and a list `inputs_answers` containing tuples of arguments and expected outputs for testing. It iterates through each tuple in `inputs_answers`, calling `solution` with the provided arguments and comparing the result against the expected answer. It counts the number of incorrect answers and logs the results. Finally, it summarizes the test results, indicating how many tests passed or failed. The function does not return a value; it only logs the test outcomes.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 50, and each ball's coordinates (x_i, y_i) are integers with |x_i|, |y_i| <= 10^9. Additionally, all coordinates are distinct.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 50; `total` is equal to the number of items processed from `inputs_gen`; `wrong` is equal to the count of incorrect answers; `args` is the last item yielded by `inputs_gen` (if any); `ans` is assigned the value of `solution(*deepcopy(args))` for the last item processed (if any).
    func_8('ALL %d TESTS PASSED' % total if not wrong else 
    '%d out of %d tests are WRONG' % (wrong, total))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a `solution` function, an `inputs_gen` generator that yields test cases, and a `judge` function to verify the correctness of the `solution`. It processes each test case by applying `solution` to the arguments generated by `inputs_gen` and checks the result using `judge`. If the result is incorrect, it logs the error. At the end, it logs the total number of tests processed and the number of incorrect results. The function does not return any value.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: solution is a callable that takes in an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 50) representing the number of balls, followed by N pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) with |x_i|, |y_i| ≤ 10^9, where each pair represents the coordinates of a ball in a two-dimensional plane. The pairs (x_i, y_i) are distinct. inputs_gen and solution_slow are callable functions relevant to the problem context.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `total` is the number of elements in `inputs_gen`, `wrong` is the number of discrepancies between `ans` and `slow`.
    func_8('ALL %d TESTS PASSED' % total if not wrong else 
    '%d out of %d tests are WRONG' % (wrong, total))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three callables: `solution`, `inputs_gen`, and `solution_slow`. It runs tests by generating inputs using `inputs_gen` and comparing the outputs of `solution` and `solution_slow` for each input pair. If the results differ, it logs an error message and increments a counter for incorrect answers. After all tests are executed, it prints a summary indicating whether all tests passed or how many were wrong out of the total tests run. The function does not return any value explicitly.

#Function 9:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 50, and each ball's coordinates (x_i, y_i) are integers with |x_i|, |y_i| <= 10^9, where all coordinate pairs (x_i, y_i) are distinct.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a variable number of arguments and optional keyword arguments. It prints the arguments to a specified output stream, separated by a specified separator. If the 'end' keyword argument is provided, it appends that value after printing; otherwise, it appends a newline. If the 'flush' keyword argument is set to True, it flushes the output stream to ensure all data is written. The function does not validate the number of arguments or their types beyond what is required for printing.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
