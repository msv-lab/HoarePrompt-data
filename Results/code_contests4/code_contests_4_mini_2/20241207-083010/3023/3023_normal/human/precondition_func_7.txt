solution is a callable that takes in an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 50) representing the number of balls, followed by N pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) with |x_i|, |y_i| ≤ 10^9, where each pair represents the coordinates of a ball in a two-dimensional plane. The pairs (x_i, y_i) are distinct. inputs_gen and solution_slow are callable functions relevant to the problem context.
