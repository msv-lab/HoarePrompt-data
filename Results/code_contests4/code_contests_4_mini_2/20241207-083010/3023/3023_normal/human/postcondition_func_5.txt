The function accepts an integer `solution`, which is a callable representing a method to calculate the cost of collecting all balls, and a list `inputs_answers` containing tuples of arguments and expected outputs for testing. It iterates through each tuple in `inputs_answers`, calling `solution` with the provided arguments and comparing the result against the expected answer. It counts the number of incorrect answers and logs the results. Finally, it summarizes the test results, indicating how many tests passed or failed. The function does not return a value; it only logs the test outcomes.
