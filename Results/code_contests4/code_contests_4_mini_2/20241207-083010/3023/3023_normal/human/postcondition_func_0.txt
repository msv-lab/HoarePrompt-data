The function accepts no parameters and reads an integer `N` (1 <= N <= 50) representing the number of balls. It then reads `N` arrays of integers, each representing the coordinates of the balls, which are stored in the `balls` list. Finally, it invokes another function `func_8` with the result of `func_2(N, balls)`, indicating that the function processes the ball coordinates but does not return any value directly.
