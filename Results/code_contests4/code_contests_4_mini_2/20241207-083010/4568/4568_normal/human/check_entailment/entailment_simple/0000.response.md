Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement. Here are the reasons why it is incorrect:

1. **Game Logic Misalignment**: The problem description requires determining the winner of the game based on optimal play from both players (Andrew and Alex). The program attempts to evaluate winning and losing conditions using a tree structure and returns specific values (1, 2, or 3) based on conditions that do not directly correlate to the game's win/loss conditions as described.

2. **Return Values**: The program's return values do not align with the expected output. The problem statement specifies that the output should be either "First" (if the first player wins) or "Second" (if the second player wins). However, the program returns integers 1, 2, or 3, which do not directly represent the winning conditions for either player.

3. **Optimal Play Representation**: The program's approach to evaluate the game does not capture the essence of the optimal play as required by the problem. The evaluations of `odd_ret` and `even_ret` in the `func_1` function do not appropriately determine the conditions under which a player can or cannot make a valid move based on the strings provided.

4. **Handling of Multiple Games**: The description mentions that the loser of the i-th game makes the first move in the (i + 1)-th game. The program does not incorporate any logic to handle the outcomes of multiple games in sequence, which is a crucial part of the problem.

In summary, the program fails to correctly determine the winner of the game based on the rules laid out in the problem statement, both in terms of logic and output format. Therefore, it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
