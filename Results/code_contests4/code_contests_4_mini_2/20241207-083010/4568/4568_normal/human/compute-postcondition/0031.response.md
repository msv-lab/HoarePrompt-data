The function `func_1` is called with `child` and `0` as arguments, and it is expected to return two values which are assigned to `odd_w` and `even_w`. The current values of `odd_w` and `even_w` may change based on the output of `func_1(child, 0)`. Other variables (`ttree`, `canloss`, `canwin`, `node`, `it`) remain unaffected by this operation, so their states do not change. 

Since the exact output of `func_1` is unknown, we cannot determine specific values for `odd_w` and `even_w`. Therefore, the output will reflect that the values of these variables have changed based on the function call.

Output State: **`ttree` is a tuple containing an integer `n` and an integer `k`, followed by `n` non-empty strings; `canloss` is True; `canwin` remains True; `node` has at least 2 elements; `child` is assigned the value of `node.get(it)`; `it` points to the next element in `node`; `odd_w` and `even_w` are the results of func_1(child, 0).**
