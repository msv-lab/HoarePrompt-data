According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements in `node`. For the loop to execute again, there must be at least one more element in `node` after the last iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `node` has at least 1 element, and `it` represents the current element being processed in the iteration. 

Assuming that `it` has taken the value of the last element in `node`, in order for the loop to execute one more time, `it` must be increased to point to the next element in `node`. Therefore, `node` must have at least one more element than it currently does to allow for another iteration.

State: **`ttree` is a tuple containing an integer `n` and an integer `k`, followed by `n` non-empty strings; `canloss` is set to True; `canwin` remains True; `node` has at least 2 elements; `child` is assigned the value of `node.get(it)`; `odd_w` is True; and `even_w` is True, if `odd_w` is True.**
