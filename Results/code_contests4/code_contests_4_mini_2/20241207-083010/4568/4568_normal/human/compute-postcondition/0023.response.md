The value of `even_w` is assigned the value `True`. Since `even_w` was previously evaluated as the output of `func_1(child, 0)`, and now it is explicitly set to `True`, this replaces the previous value. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `ttree` is a tuple containing an integer `n` and an integer `k`, followed by `n` non-empty strings; `canloss` is set to True; `canwin` remains True; `node` has at least 2 elements; `child` is assigned the value of `node.get(it)`; `odd_w` is True; `even_w` is True.
