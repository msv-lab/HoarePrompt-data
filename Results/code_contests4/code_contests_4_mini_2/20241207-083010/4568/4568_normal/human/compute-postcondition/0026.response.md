Postcondition: ***`ttree` is a tuple containing an integer `n` and an integer `k`, followed by `n` non-empty strings; `canloss` is set to True; `canwin` remains True; `node` has at least 2 elements; `child` is assigned the value of `node.get(it)`; `odd_w` is True; and `even_w` is True. If `even_w` is True, all these conditions hold, as there is no change in state.***
