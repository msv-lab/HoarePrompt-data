The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `ttree`. `ttree` is a tuple that contains an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), an integer `k` (where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9), followed by `n` non-empty strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters. The total length of all strings does not exceed 10^5. 

After executing the function body, there are three possible return cases:
- Case 1: The function returns the integer value 3.
- Case 2: The function returns the integer value 1.
- Case 3: The function returns the integer value 2.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a tuple `ttree` with specific constraints and return one of three integer values (3, 1, or 2) based on the conditions evaluated within the function. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter ttree, which is a tuple containing an integer n, an integer k, and n non-empty strings. It returns either 3, 1, or 2 based on specific conditions.**
