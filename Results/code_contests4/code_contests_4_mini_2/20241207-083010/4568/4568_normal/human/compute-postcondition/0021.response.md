The variable `odd_w` is directly assigned the value `True`. The previous value of `odd_w` was not specified, but it is now set to `True`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ttree` is a tuple containing an integer `n` and an integer `k`, followed by `n` non-empty strings; `canloss` is set to True; `canwin` remains True; `node` has at least 2 elements; `child` is assigned the value of `node.get(it)`; `odd_w` is True; `even_w` is the output of `func_1(child, 0)` if `odd_w` is True.
