The function accepts a `node` and a `level`, and returns a tuple indicating the presence of words at odd and even levels in a tree structure. If the `node` is a word node at an odd level, it returns (True, False); if it's a word node at an even level, it returns (False, True). For non-word nodes, it recursively checks child nodes and returns a tuple where the first element indicates if any child nodes have words at odd levels and the second element indicates if any child nodes have words at even levels.
