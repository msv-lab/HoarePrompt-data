#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a `node` and a `level`, and returns a tuple indicating the presence of words at odd and even levels in a tree structure. If the `node` is a word node at an odd level, it returns (True, False); if it's a word node at an even level, it returns (False, True). For non-word nodes, it recursively checks child nodes and returns a tuple where the first element indicates if any child nodes have words at odd levels and the second element indicates if any child nodes have words at even levels.

    return 2
    #The program returns the integer value 2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `ttree` containing an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and `n` non-empty strings. It checks conditions based on the results from a helper function `func_1` applied to the children of `ttree`. If both `canloss` and `canwin` are True, it returns 3; if only `canloss` is True, it returns 1; otherwise, it returns 2. The logic implies that the function is determining some game-winning conditions based on the state represented by `ttree` and its children.
