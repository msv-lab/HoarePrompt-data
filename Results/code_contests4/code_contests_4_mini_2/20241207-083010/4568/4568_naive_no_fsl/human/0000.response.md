To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the core logic and structure of the code.

1. **Understanding the Game:** 
   - Two players take turns to construct a word.
   - The constructed word must be a prefix of at least one string from a given group.
   - A player loses if they cannot make a valid move.
   - The output should determine whether the first player wins or the second player wins after `k` games.
   - The losing player of one game starts the next game.

2. **Trie Structure:** 
   - The program creates a Trie (prefix tree) to store the strings efficiently. 
   - The `insert` method constructs the Trie from the input strings.
   - The game logic is handled in `func_1` and `func_2`.

3. **Function Logic:**
   - `func_1` recursively checks each node and determines if the player whose turn it is can win or if they will lose.
   - `func_2` analyzes the root children of the Trie to determine the overall winning and losing conditions based on the recursive checks.

4. **Winning Conditions:**
   - If there are paths in the Trie that allow the first player to win, the program should output "First".
   - If the first player cannot win and will lose, it should output "Second".

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - Consider the edge case where `n = 1` and `k` is even. The first player may have a valid move but generally loses in the second game due to the alternation of moves.
   - Let's test this with an example:
     - Input: 
       ```
       1 2
       ab
       ```
     - The first player can start with `a` or `b`, but since `k` is even, the second player will always have a counter move that leads to their win.

6. **Potential Issue:**
   - After inspecting the code, it seems that the conditions for winning and losing may not be correctly assessed for all game states.
   - Particularly, when `k` is even, the logic might incorrectly determine the winner based on the Trie structure alone and not account for the game alternation correctly.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - An input case like `1 2` with the string "ab" should lead to "Second" but the logic might not consistently yield that due to potentially flawed assessments in `func_2`.
   - Therefore, since there exists at least one case where the program does not produce the expected output, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
