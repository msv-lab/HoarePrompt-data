The function accepts an integer `n` representing the length of an array, followed by `n` integers which form the array that includes at least one zero. It calculates and prints the shortest distances from each index in the array to the nearest zero. If an index contains a zero, the distance is 0; for other indices, it calculates the distance based on the nearest zero's position. If there are multiple zeros, the function will correctly reflect the closest distance for each index.
