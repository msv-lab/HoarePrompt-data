According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since `n` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will be 2 for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
