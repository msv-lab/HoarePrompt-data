Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers including at least one zero; `out` is updated at index `ix` to `lev`. If `out[ix]` is not -1, then `0 <= ix - 1 <= n - 1` must hold true, and `que` is updated by appending the tuple `(ix - 1, lev + 1)`. If `out[ix]` is -1, no changes are made to `out` or `que`.***
