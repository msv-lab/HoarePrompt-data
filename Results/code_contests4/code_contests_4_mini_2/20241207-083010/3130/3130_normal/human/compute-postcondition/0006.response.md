According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. So, `i` becomes 1. The condition for the loop to execute again requires that `n` must remain greater than 1.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
