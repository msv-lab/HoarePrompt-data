Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers including at least one zero; `out` is updated at index `ix` to `lev`; `que` contains tuples `(i, 0)` for each index `i` where `a[i]` is zero; `ix` and `lev` are assigned values from the first tuple in `que`; `ix - 1` is within the range [0, n-1].***
