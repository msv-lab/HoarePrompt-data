According to the code, the `while que:` loop will execute as long as there are elements in `que`. At the end of the last iteration, `que` includes the original tuples plus the new tuple (ix - 1, lev + 1), meaning that there is at least one element in `que`. 

However, for the loop to execute one more time, the conditions related to `ix` and `out[ix]` must also be checked. The loop can only continue if `ix` is within bounds (i.e., `0 <= ix <= n - 1`) and `out[ix]` is not -1. The current state indicates that `ix` and `lev` have been assigned values from the leftmost tuple of `que`, but we need to ensure that after the last iteration, `out[ix]` is not -1 and that `ix` remains within the valid range.

Given that `out[ix]` was updated at index `ix` to `lev` in the previous iteration, we cannot conclude that `out[ix]` is -1 without further information about its value. Therefore, to guarantee that the loop can execute again, we need to ensure that `out[ix]` is not -1 and also that `ix` remains valid.

Thus, we need to adjust the state to ensure these conditions hold true.

State: **`n` is a positive integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers including at least one zero; `out` is updated at index `ix` to `lev`; `que` includes the original tuples plus the new tuple (ix - 1, lev + 1); for the loop to execute again, `out[ix]` is not -1 and `0 <= ix <= n - 1`**.
