According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `que`. The loop will execute as long as `que` is not empty. Right before the loop, `que` contains tuples `(i, 0)` for each index `i` where `a[i]` is zero, which indicates that `que` is indeed populated and can lead to the loop executing. Since `que` is not empty, the loop can execute at least once without any modifications needed.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers including at least one zero, `out` is a list of `-1` repeated `n` times, `que` contains tuples `(i, 0)` for each index `i` where `a[i]` is zero**
