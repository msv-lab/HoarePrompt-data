`que` is a data structure (likely a list) that is being appended with a tuple containing the values of `i` and `0`. Given that `i` is currently `1`, the tuple `(1, 0)` will be added to `que`. The variable `n` remains unchanged, and since it is greater than `0`, it allows for the loop to continue executing, potentially leading to further iterations if `n` remains greater than `1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `que` now contains the tuple `(1, 0)`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `que` now contains the tuple `(1, 0)`**
