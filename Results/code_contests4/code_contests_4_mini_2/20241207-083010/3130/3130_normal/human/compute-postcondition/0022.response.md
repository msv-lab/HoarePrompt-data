Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers including at least one zero; `out` is updated at index `ix` to `lev`; `que` contains tuples `(i, 0)` for each index `i` where `a[i]` is zero; if `0 <= ix - 1 <= n - 1`, then `que` now includes the original tuples plus the new tuple `(ix - 1, lev + 1)`. If `ix - 1` is within the valid range, the tuple `(ix - 1, lev + 1)` is added to `que`, otherwise `que` remains unchanged.***
