Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers including at least one zero; `out` is a list of `-1` repeated `n` times; `que` contains tuples `(i, 0)` for each index `i` where `a[i]` is zero; `ix` and `lev` are assigned the values from the first tuple in `que`; and the value of `out[ix]` is not equal to `-1`.***
