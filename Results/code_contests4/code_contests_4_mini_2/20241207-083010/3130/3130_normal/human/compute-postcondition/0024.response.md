According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `que`. If `que` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that `que` includes the original tuples plus a new tuple if the condition `0 <= ix - 1 <= n - 1` is met. Since `que` is stated to include the original tuples, it suggests that `que` is not empty and thus the loop can execute again.

Since the state already indicates that `que` includes tuples, no adjustments need to be made to the state to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers including at least one zero; `out` is updated at index `ix` to `lev`; `que` includes the original tuples plus the new tuple (ix - 1, lev + 1)**
