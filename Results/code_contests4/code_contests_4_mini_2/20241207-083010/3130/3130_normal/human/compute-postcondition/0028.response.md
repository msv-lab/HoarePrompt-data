Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers including at least one zero; `out` is updated at index `ix` to `lev`; `que` includes the original tuples plus the new tuple (ix - 1, lev + 1); `ix` and `lev` are assigned the values from the leftmost tuple of `que`. If `ix + 1` is within the bounds of the list `a` (i.e., between 0 and `n - 1` inclusive), `que` now includes the new tuple (ix + 1, lev + 1).***
