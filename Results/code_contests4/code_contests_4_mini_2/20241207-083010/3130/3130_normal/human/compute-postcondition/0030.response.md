Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers including at least one zero; `out` is updated at index `ix` to `lev`; `que` includes the original tuples plus the new tuple (ix - 1, lev + 1); `ix` and `lev` are assigned the values from the leftmost tuple of `que`. If `0 <= ix - 1 <= n - 1`, the program proceeds with the operations as stated; otherwise, no changes are made to `out` and `que`.***
