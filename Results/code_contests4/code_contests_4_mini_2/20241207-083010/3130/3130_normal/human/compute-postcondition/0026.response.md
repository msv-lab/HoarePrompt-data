The value of `out` at index `ix` is updated to `lev`. The previous values of `ix` and `lev` have been assigned from the leftmost tuple of `que`, so `out[ix]` is now equal to `lev`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers including at least one zero; `out` is updated at index `ix` to `lev`; `que` includes the original tuples plus the new tuple (ix - 1, lev + 1); `ix` and `lev` are assigned the values from the leftmost tuple of `que`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers including at least one zero; `out` is updated at index `ix` to `lev`; `que` includes the original tuples plus the new tuple (ix - 1, lev + 1); `ix` and `lev` are assigned the values from the leftmost tuple of `que`.**
