The code appends a new tuple to the list `que`. The new tuple consists of two elements: `ix - 1` and `lev + 1`. Since `ix` is assigned from the first tuple in `que` and `ix - 1` is within the range [0, n-1], we can assume that `ix - 1` is a valid index. The value of `lev` is incremented by 1. The states of `n`, `a`, and `out` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers including at least one zero; `out` is updated at index `ix` to `lev`; `que` now contains the original tuples plus the new tuple `(ix - 1, lev + 1)`.**
