Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers including at least one zero; `out` is updated at index `ix` to `lev`; `que` contains tuples `(i, 0)` for each index `i` where `a[i]` is zero; `ix` and `lev` are assigned values from the first tuple in `que`; `ix + 1` is within the range [1, n-1]; `que` now includes the tuple `(ix + 1, lev + 1)`.**
