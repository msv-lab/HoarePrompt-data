The loop iterates over each index `i` of the list `a`, and if the value at that index is zero (i.e., `not a[i]` is true), it appends the tuple `(i, 0)` to the deque `que`. Given that `a` has at least one zero, there will be at least one index where `not a[i]` evaluates to true, which means at least one tuple will be appended to `que`.

After all iterations of the loop:
- `que` will contain all tuples `(i, 0)` for each index `i` where `a[i]` is zero.
- `out` remains a list of `-1` repeated `n` times since it is not modified in the loop.
- `n` remains unchanged and is still the length of the array `a`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers including at least one zero, `out` is a list of `-1` repeated `n` times, `que` contains tuples `(i, 0)` for each index `i` where `a[i]` is zero.**
