The code appends a tuple `(i, 0)` to the list `que`. The current value of `i` is 2, and 0 is a constant. Since `que` is not mentioned in the initial state, we assume it exists but does not have a defined value. Therefore, after executing the code, the state of `que` will now include the new tuple.

The output state indicates that `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, and now `que` has the tuple `(2, 0)` appended to it.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `que` has the tuple (2, 0) appended to it**
