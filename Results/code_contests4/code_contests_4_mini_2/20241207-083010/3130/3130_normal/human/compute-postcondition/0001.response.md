`out` is assigned a list of `-1` repeated `n` times, resulting in a list of size `n` with all elements being `-1`. `que` is assigned a new deque object, which is an empty deque. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer representing the length of the array, `a` is a list of `n` integers including at least one zero, `out` is a list of `-1` repeated `n` times, `que` is an empty deque.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer representing the length of the array, `a` is a list of `n` integers including at least one zero, `out` is a list of `-1` repeated `n` times, `que` is an empty deque.**
