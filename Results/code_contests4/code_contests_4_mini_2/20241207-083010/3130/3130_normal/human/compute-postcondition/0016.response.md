The value of `out[ix]` is assigned the value of `lev`. Since `out[ix]` is not equal to `-1`, this assignment will change the value at index `ix` in the list `out` to `lev`. The other variables, `n`, `a`, and `que`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the update to the `out` list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers including at least one zero; `out` is updated at index `ix` to `lev`; `que` contains tuples `(i, 0)` for each index `i` where `a[i]` is zero; `ix` and `lev` are assigned values from the first tuple in `que`.**
