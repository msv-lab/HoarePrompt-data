The `print` statement outputs the contents of the `out` list. The `join` function converts each integer in `out` to a string and joins them with a space. The previous values of `out` are not specified, but we know that it contains the shortest distances from each index to the nearest zero in `a`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers including at least one zero; `out` contains the shortest distances from each index to the nearest zero in `a`; `que` is empty; and the output is the string representation of the contents of `out`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers including at least one zero; `out` contains the shortest distances from each index to the nearest zero in `a`; `que` is empty; and the output is the string representation of the contents of `out`.**
