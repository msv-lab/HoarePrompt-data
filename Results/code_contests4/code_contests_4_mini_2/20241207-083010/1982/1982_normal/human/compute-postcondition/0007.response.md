The value of `i` is assigned a new string value that concatenates '1', the previous value of `i`, and '0'. The initial state does not provide a specific value for `i`, so we cannot determine its previous value. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `i` has been updated but without specifying its new value.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 6 <= `n` <= 100000; `i` is updated to '1' + previous value of `i` + '0'**
