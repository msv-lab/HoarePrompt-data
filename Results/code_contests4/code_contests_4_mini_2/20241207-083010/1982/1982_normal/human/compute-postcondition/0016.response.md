Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 6 <= `n` <= 100000; `i` is a binary string formed by repeated concatenation of '1' at the start and '0' at the end, and `p` is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n` (if such a power exists). If no power of 2 less than or equal to `n` was found during the iterations, `p` remains 1.**
