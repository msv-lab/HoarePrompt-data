To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions given.

The loop condition is `int(i, 2) <= n`. This means that the integer value of `i` interpreted as a binary number must be less than or equal to `n`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has been updated to '1' + previous value of `i` + '0'. This effectively means that the binary representation of `i` has been incremented, as it adds a '1' at the beginning and a '0' at the end, which increases its value.

Given that:
- `n` is a positive integer such that 6 <= `n` <= 100000,
- `i` has been updated, which means its value has increased.

For the loop to execute one more time, the new value of `i` (after the update) must still be less than or equal to `n`. 

Since `i` has been incremented, we need to ensure that `n` is at least as large as this new value of `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than or equal to the new value of `i`.

To summarize:
- The current state of `n` is within the bounds of 6 to 100000.
- The update to `i` means we need to ensure that `n` is at least as large as this new value of `i`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 6 <= `n` <= 100000 and for the loop to execute again, n must be greater than or equal to the new value of `i` after the update**.
