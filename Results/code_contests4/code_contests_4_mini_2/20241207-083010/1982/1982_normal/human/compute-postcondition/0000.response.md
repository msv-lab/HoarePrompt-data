Since `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer, the output state will depend on the value provided during input. However, since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100000, we can state that `n` will take on a value within this range after the input is received.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100000**
