According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the condition `int(i, 2) <= n`. The variable `i` is currently '110', which, when converted from binary to decimal, equals 6 (since 1*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 4 + 2 + 0 = 6). 

For the loop to execute, this value (6) must be less than or equal to `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer and can range from 1 to 100000, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 6 to satisfy the loop condition.

Therefore, the adjustments that need to be made are:
1. Ensure that `n` is greater than or equal to 6.

The other variables (`n` and `p`) do not need adjustments for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 6 <= n <= 100000, `i` is '110', `p` is 1**
