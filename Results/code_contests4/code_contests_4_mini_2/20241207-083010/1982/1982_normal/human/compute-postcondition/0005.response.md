The value of `p` is assigned the value of `int(i, 2)`, where `i` is '110'. The binary string '110' is converted to its integer equivalent, which is 6. Therefore, `p` is now 6. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 6 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is '110', `p` is 6, and `n` is divisible by 6.**
