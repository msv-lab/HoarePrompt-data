The variable `p` is assigned the value `1`. The previous values of the affected variables are not altered, and the states of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100000; `i` is '110'; `p` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100000; `i` is '110'; `p` is 1**
