The function `func` does not accept any parameters. According to the output constraints, it is implied that the function's behavior is dependent on a positive integer `n`, which satisfies the condition 1 <= n <= 100000. However, since the function does not take `n` as an argument and there are no specified return values in the output, we cannot ascertain the exact functionality of the function based solely on the information provided.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` remains undefined in terms of its input and output behavior based on the current information.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is unspecified.**
