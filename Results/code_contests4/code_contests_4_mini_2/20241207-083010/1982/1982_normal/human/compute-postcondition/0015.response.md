The variable `i` is updated to be the concatenation of the string `'1'`, the previous value of `i`, and the string `'0'`. This operation does not affect the value of `n` or `p`. The value of `i` changes from its previous state to a new string value, while `n` remains a positive integer between 6 and 100000. The output state will reflect the change in `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 6 <= `n` <= 100000; `i` is updated to '1' + previous value of `i` + '0'**
