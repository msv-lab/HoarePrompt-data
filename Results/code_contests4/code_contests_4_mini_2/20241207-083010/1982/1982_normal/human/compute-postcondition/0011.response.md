The value of `i` is being updated to the string formed by concatenating '1', the current value of `i`, and '0'. The previous value of `i` (which is a string) is preserved in the new string format. The variable `p` is not affected by this change unless evaluated later. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 6 <= `n` <= 100000; `i` is updated to '1' + the previous value of `i` + '0'.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 6 <= `n` <= 100000; `i` is updated to '1' + the previous value of `i` + '0'**
