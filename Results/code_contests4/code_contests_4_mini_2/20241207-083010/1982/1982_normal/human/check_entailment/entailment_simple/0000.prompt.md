You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Recently Luba learned about a special kind of numbers that she calls beautiful numbers. The number is called beautiful iff its binary representation consists of k + 1 consecutive ones, and then k consecutive zeroes.

Some examples of beautiful numbers: 

  * 12 (110); 
  * 1102 (610); 
  * 11110002 (12010); 
  * 1111100002 (49610). 



More formally, the number is beautiful iff there exists some positive integer k such that the number is equal to (2k - 1) * (2k - 1).

Luba has got an integer number n, and she wants to find its greatest beautiful divisor. Help her to find it!

Input

The only line of input contains one number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number Luba has got.

Output

Output one number — the greatest beautiful divisor of Luba's number. It is obvious that the answer always exists.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100000.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    i = '110'
    p = 1
    while int(i, 2) <= n:
        if n % int(i, 2) == 0:
            p = int(i, 2)
        
        i = '1' + i + '0'
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 6 <= `n` <= 100000; `i` is a binary string formed by repeated concatenation of '1' at the start and '0' at the end, and `p` is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n` (if such a power exists). If no power of 2 less than or equal to `n` was found during the iterations, `p` remains 1.
    print(p)

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
