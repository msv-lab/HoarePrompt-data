Correctness: **False**

The provided program only reads input values but does not implement any logic to count the number of integers \( x \) within the range \([a; b]\) such that the probability that \( f(x) = x \) is at least \( 31.4159265352718281828459045\% \). 

The problem requires checking different permutations of the four distinct integers \( p1, p2, p3, p4 \) and determining how many integers \( x \) meet the condition \( f(x) = x \) for at least 7 permutations. The program fails to perform any of these calculations, and therefore it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem.

For example, if we input:
```
2 7 1 8 2 8
```
The expected output is `0`, but the program does not produce any output as it lacks the necessary logic to compute this.

Thus, the program is incorrect as it does not implement the required logic for the problem.
