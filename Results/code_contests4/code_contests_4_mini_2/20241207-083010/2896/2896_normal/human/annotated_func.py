#State of the program right berfore the function call: p1, p2, p3, and p4 are distinct integers in the range [1, 1000], and a and b are integers such that 0 <= a <= b <= 31415.
def func():
    p1, p2, p3, p4, a, b = map(int, raw_input().split())
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts six integers: four distinct integers `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `p4` in the range [1, 1000], and two integers `a`, `b` such that `0 <= a <= b <= 31415`. The function reads these values from user input but does not perform any operations or return any values. It simply captures the input and does not validate or utilize the data in any further computation.
