Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not implement the required functionality as described in the problem statement. The problem requires the program to count the number of integers \( x \) in the range \([a;b]\) such that there are at least 7 permutations of \( p1, p2, p3, p4 \) for which \( f(x) = x \). The provided program only includes the input reading part and does not contain any logic to evaluate the permutations, check the condition \( f(x) = x \), or count the valid integers in the specified range.

In particular, the program fails to:
1. Define what the function \( f(x) \) is and how it operates with the remainders of \( p1, p2, p3, p4 \).
2. Count permutations of \( p1, p2, p3, p4 \) and check for the condition \( f(x) = x \).
3. Iterate through the range \([a, b]\) to count valid integers \( x \).

Since the program does not implement any of these necessary steps, it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description.
