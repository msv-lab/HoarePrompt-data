Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not contain any logic to solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` is defined but is empty, meaning it does not perform any operations or provide any output. 

A potential case where this program fails is any valid input scenario, for example:

Input:
```
2 5 0
1 3 2 5 4
1 4 3 2 5
```

The expected behavior is to output pairs of indices that can sort the given arrays in ascending order, but since the function does not implement any logic to generate these pairs, it cannot satisfy the requirements of the problem description.

Thus, since the program fails to produce a correct output for any input case, it is deemed incorrect.
