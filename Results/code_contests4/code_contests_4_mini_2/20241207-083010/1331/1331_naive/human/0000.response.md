Correctness: **False**.

The provided program `func_1()` is a placeholder function that does nothing (`pass`). This means it does not implement any logic to sort the arrays as described in the problem statement. 

For example, if we take the input:

```
2 5 0
1 3 2 5 4
1 4 3 2 5
```

The expected behavior would be to output a series of index pairs that, when applied, would sort both arrays. However, since the function does not perform any operations, it cannot produce any output or handle any input correctly. Thus, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.

Therefore, the program does not work for any input case.
