The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `k`. Here, `n` is an integer with a value between 1 and 1000, `m` is an integer with a value between 1 and 100, and `k` is an integer that can either be 0 (for ascending order) or 1 (for descending order). The function processes `n` lines of input, each containing `m` integers, where each integer `x` ranges from 1 to 10^6. 

After executing the function body, if `k` is 0, it returns the list of integers sorted in ascending order. If `k` is 1, it returns the list of integers sorted in descending order. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and return a sorted list of integers based on the value of `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, and k, and returns a sorted list of integers in ascending order if k is 0, or in descending order if k is 1.**
