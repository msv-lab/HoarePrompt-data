Functionality: ** The function accepts three parameters: an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), an integer `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 100), and an integer `k` (0 for ascending order, 1 for descending order). However, the function does not currently implement any functionality and simply serves as a placeholder. Therefore, it does not return any sorted list of integers as indicated in the annotations, and no actual processing of input data occurs.**
