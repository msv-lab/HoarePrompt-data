The code contains a `pass` statement, which means that it does nothing and simply acts as a placeholder. Therefore, the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged, and no calculations or modifications are made to the state of the program.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 100), `k` is an integer (0 for ascending order, 1 for descending order); no changes made.**
