Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not implement any functionality as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1()` is defined but contains only a `pass` statement, which means it does not execute any logic to sort the arrays or generate the appropriate pairs of indices for swapping. 

According to the problem description, the function must accept three parameters (`n`, `m`, and `k`), read `n` arrays of `m` integers each, and output pairs of indices that can be used to sort these arrays in either ascending or descending order based on the value of `k`. The program must also ensure that the pairs of indices do not exceed a certain size limit.

Since the program does not contain any code to process the input arrays or generate the required output, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, it does not provide a valid solution, and we cannot conclude that it always does what the problem description asks for.

In summary, the lack of implementation in the function leads to the conclusion that the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem, resulting in a correctness evaluation of **False**.
