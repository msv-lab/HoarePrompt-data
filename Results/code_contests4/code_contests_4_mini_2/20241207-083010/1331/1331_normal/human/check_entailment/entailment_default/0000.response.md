The provided program is an empty function (`func_1`) which does not implement any functionality at all. The problem description requires the function to sort multiple arrays simultaneously based on the specified order (ascending or descending) by using a specific method of swapping elements at given indices.

Given that the function does not contain any logic to process the input, generate swaps, or output the required indices, it clearly does not follow the problem description.

Additionally, the output hints state that the function does not currently implement any functionality and serves only as a placeholder. This reinforces the fact that there is no actual processing of input data occurring in the code.

Since the program does not follow the problem description for any potential case, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
