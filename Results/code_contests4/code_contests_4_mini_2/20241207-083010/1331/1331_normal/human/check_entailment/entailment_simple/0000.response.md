Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not implement any functionality. It defines a function `func_1()` but does not contain any logic or operations to address the problem description regarding sorting arrays. The problem requires the generation of a series of index pairs that can be used to sort the arrays in ascending or descending order, but the function currently has a placeholder implementation (using `pass`) and does not fulfill any of the requirements.

Since there is no algorithm or logic implemented to generate the index pairs or perform the necessary swaps on the arrays as described, the program fails to meet the problem's specifications. Therefore, it is incorrect.
