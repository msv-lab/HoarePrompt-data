Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of steps the elephant needs to take to reach his friend's house. The line of code `print(input() + 4) / 5` has several issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The input is taken as a string and should be converted to an integer for numerical operations.
2. **Incorrect Calculation**: The logic used to determine the number of steps is flawed. The expression `input() + 4` does not account for the actual distance `x` accurately. Even if the input were converted to an integer, adding 4 to it and then dividing by 5 does not yield the correct number of steps.
3. **Integer Division**: The program does not use integer division, which is necessary in Python to ensure that the number of steps is an integer since you can't take a fraction of a step.

For example:
- If the input is `12`, the program would execute `print(12 + 4) / 5`, which equals `3.2`. This would be incorrect because the elephant needs at least `3` steps (3 steps of 4, or 2 steps of 5 and 1 step of 2). 

Another example:
- For an input of `1`, the program would execute `print(1 + 4) / 5`, resulting in `1.0`, which is incorrect as the elephant needs `1` step.

Thus, the program fails to meet the problem requirements for various inputs, leading to the conclusion of incorrectness.
