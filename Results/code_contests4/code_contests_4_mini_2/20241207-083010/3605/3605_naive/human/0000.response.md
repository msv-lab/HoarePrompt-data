Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of steps the elephant needs to make to reach his friend's house. The program reads an integer input, adds 4 to it, and then divides the result by 5. This logic is incorrect for several reasons:

1. The input `x` should be treated as the distance the elephant needs to cover, but the program does not properly account for the number of steps required based on the range of movement (1 to 5 steps).
2. The formula used `(input() + 4) / 5` does not properly determine the number of steps needed. For example:
   - If `x = 5`, the expected output is `1` (one step of 5), but the program would output `1.8`, which is incorrect.
   - If `x = 12`, the expected output is `3` (as stated in the problem description), but the program would output `3.2`, which is also incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
