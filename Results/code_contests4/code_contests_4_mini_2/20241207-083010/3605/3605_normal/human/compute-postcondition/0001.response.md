The function `func` does not accept any parameters as defined in the function signature. According to the constraints, `x` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 1,000,000. However, since there are no parameters being passed to the function, it does not return any value related to `x`. Therefore, the functionality of the function is not explicitly defined based on the provided information.
