Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. 

1. The function `func()` does not accept any parameters, so it relies on `input()` to read the value of `x`. However, the way it processes the input is incorrect.
  
2. The line `print(input() + 4) / 5` is invalid due to operator precedence. The addition and division operations are not correctly grouped, leading to incorrect calculations. Additionally, the program does not compute the minimum number of steps needed to reach the friend's house.

3. The correct approach to find the minimum number of steps is to divide the distance `x` by the maximum step size (which is 5) and round up to account for any remaining distance. This can be done using integer division with an adjustment for any remainder.

4. For example, if `x = 12`, the correct calculation would be `12 // 5 = 2` with a remainder, which means we need one additional step, resulting in a total of `3` steps. The provided program does not implement this logic.

Therefore, because the program does not accurately compute the minimum number of steps needed for the elephant to reach his friend's house, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
