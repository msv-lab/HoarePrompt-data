Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here are the reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads input using `input()`, but it does not convert the input to an integer. This could lead to incorrect behavior if the input is not a valid number.

2. **Logic Error**: The expression in the function `print(input() + 4) / 5` is incorrect. The program is trying to add 4 to the input directly (which is still a string at this point), and then dividing by 5. This does not accurately compute the minimum number of steps required to reach the friend's house at point `x`. The calculation should be based on how many maximum steps (up to 5) are needed to cover the distance `x`.

3. **Output Requirements**: The problem description requires the program to return the minimum number of steps, while the program only prints a result and does not return the value. According to the problem, the output should be an integer representing the minimum steps, not an arithmetic operation result. 

4. **Mathematical Calculation**: To correctly calculate the minimum number of steps, the program should use the formula: `steps = (x + 4) // 5`. This accounts for the fact that the elephant can move up to 5 units in one step, and the addition of 4 is a mathematical trick to effectively perform ceiling division.

Due to these issues, the program does not fulfill the requirements stated in the problem description.
