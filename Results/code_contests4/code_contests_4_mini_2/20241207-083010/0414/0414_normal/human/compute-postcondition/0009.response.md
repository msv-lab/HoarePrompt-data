Postcondition: ***`sequence` is a string of length `n`, `length` is greater than 0. If `i` is odd and the character at index `i` of `sequence` is not equal to `oddchar`, then `oddmisplaced` is increased by 1, while `evenmisplaced` remains unchanged. If `i` is even and the character at index `i` of `sequence` is not equal to `evenchar`, then `evenmisplaced` is increased by 1.***
