`length` is assigned the value `len(sequence)`, which calculates the length of the string `sequence`. Since `sequence` is a string of length `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), `length` will be equal to `n`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `sequence` is a string of length `n`, `length` is `n`.

Output State: **`sequence` is a string of length `n`, `length` is `n`**
