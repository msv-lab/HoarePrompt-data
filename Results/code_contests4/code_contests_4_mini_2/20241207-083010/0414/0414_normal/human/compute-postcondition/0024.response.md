The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `sequence`, `oddchar`, and `evenchar`. The parameter `sequence` is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000) consisting of characters 'b' and 'r'. The parameters `oddchar` and `evenchar` are characters representing the colors of cockroaches ('b' for black and 'r' for red). After executing the function body, it returns the sum of the minimum of `evenmisplaced` and `oddmisplaced` (swaps) and the absolute difference between `evenmisplaced` and `oddmisplaced` (color). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `sequence` and two characters `oddchar` and `evenchar`, and return a value that combines the minimum number of misplaced cockroaches and the absolute difference in their counts. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `sequence` of characters 'b' and 'r', and two characters `oddchar` and `evenchar`. It returns the sum of the minimum of `evenmisplaced` and `oddmisplaced`, and the absolute difference between `evenmisplaced` and `oddmisplaced`.**
