Postcondition: ***`sequence` is a string of length `n`, `length` is greater than `0`, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `i` is odd and `sequence[i]` is not equal to `oddchar`, then `oddmisplaced` is increased by 1. If `i` is even and `sequence[i]` is equal to `oddchar`, `oddmisplaced` remains unchanged.***
