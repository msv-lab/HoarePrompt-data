#State of the program right berfore the function call: sequence is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000) consisting of characters 'b' and 'r', oddchar and evenchar are characters representing the colors of cockroaches ('b' for black and 'r' for red).
def func_1(sequence, oddchar, evenchar):
    length = len(sequence)
    oddmisplaced = 0
    evenmisplaced = 0
    for i in range(length):
        if i % 2 == 0 and sequence[i] != evenchar:
            evenmisplaced = evenmisplaced + 1
        
        if i % 2 == 1 and sequence[i] != oddchar:
            oddmisplaced = oddmisplaced + 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sequence` is a string of length `n`, `length` is `n`, `oddmisplaced` is the count of characters at odd indices that are not equal to `oddchar`, `evenmisplaced` is the count of characters at even indices that are not equal to `evenchar`.
    swaps = min(evenmisplaced, oddmisplaced)
    color = abs(evenmisplaced - oddmisplaced)
    return swaps + color
    #The program returns the sum of the minimum of `evenmisplaced` and `oddmisplaced` (swaps) and the absolute difference between `evenmisplaced` and `oddmisplaced` (color).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `sequence` consisting of characters 'b' and 'r', along with two characters `oddchar` and `evenchar`. It counts how many characters are misplaced at even and odd indices compared to `evenchar` and `oddchar`, respectively. The function returns the sum of the minimum number of misplaced characters that need to be swapped to correct the sequence and the absolute difference between the counts of misplaced characters at even and odd indices. This ensures that the sequence has the correct character at each position according to the specified colors.
