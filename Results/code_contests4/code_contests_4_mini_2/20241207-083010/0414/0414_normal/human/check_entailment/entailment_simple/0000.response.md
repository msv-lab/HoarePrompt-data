To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the function `func_1` and see if it correctly calculates the minimum number of moves required to make the colors of cockroaches alternate.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. The program needs to transform a given string of cockroaches ('b' for black and 'r' for red) into an alternating pattern.
2. The two possible patterns for a string of length `n` are:
   - Pattern A (starting with 'r'): "rbrbrb..."
   - Pattern B (starting with 'b'): "brbrbr..."
3. The allowed operations are swapping any two cockroaches or changing the color of a cockroach.
4. The output should be the minimum number of operations required to achieve the alternating pattern.

### Program Analysis:
1. The function counts how many cockroaches are misplaced for both even and odd indices:
   - `evenmisplaced`: Count of 'r' in even indices and 'b' in odd indices when the expected characters are defined by `evenchar` and `oddchar`.
   - `oddmisplaced`: Count of 'b' in even indices and 'r' in odd indices.
   
2. It calculates:
   - `swaps`: The minimum of `evenmisplaced` and `oddmisplaced`, which represents the number of swaps needed to fix misplaced cockroaches.
   - `color`: The absolute difference between `evenmisplaced` and `oddmisplaced`, which indicates how many cockroaches need to be repainted since they cannot be swapped.

3. The total number of operations is returned as `swaps + color`.

### Correctness Validation:
- The program correctly identifies misplaced cockroaches based on their expected positions in both patterns.
- It considers both the minimum swaps needed to rearrange them and the necessary color changes for any remaining mismatches.
- The logic for calculating `swaps` and `color` ensures that all possible cases of cockroach arrangements are handled correctly, including those where no changes are needed (i.e., already alternating).
- It effectively covers all scenarios where cockroaches can be either swapped or repainted.

### Conclusion:
The program adheres to the problem description and correctly calculates the minimum number of moves required to achieve the desired alternating pattern of cockroaches. 

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
