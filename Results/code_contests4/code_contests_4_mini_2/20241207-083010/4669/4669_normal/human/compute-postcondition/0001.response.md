The variable `ss` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which takes input from the user. The initial state specifies that `N` is a positive integer based on user input (1 ≤ N ≤ 100) and `S` is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters `(` and `)`. Since `raw_input()` will capture a string input, `ss` will be a string that the user provides, which should also comply with the condition of being of length `N`.

Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer based on user input (1 ≤ N ≤ 100), `S` is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters `(` and `)`, and `ss` is the input string taken from the user.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer based on user input (1 ≤ N ≤ 100), `S` is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters `(` and `)`, `ss` is the input string taken from the user.**
