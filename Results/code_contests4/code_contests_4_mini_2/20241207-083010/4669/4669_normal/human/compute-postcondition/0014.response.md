The variable `s` is reassigned to the result of `s.split('()')`, which splits the string `s` at each occurrence of '()'. The previous value of `s` is a single string created by joining elements of a list. After this operation, `s` will be a list containing the segments of the original string that were separated by '()'. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is now a list created by splitting the original string at each occurrence of '()'.

Output State: **`s` is now a list created by splitting the original string at each occurrence of '()'.**
