The variable `a` is updated by concatenating it with `')'`. The previous value of `a` is '))', so after this operation, `a` becomes ')))'. The states of the other variables `s`, `b`, and `i` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is the first element of the list, `a` is ')))', `b` is updated to the previous value concatenated with '(', `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than 1.

Output State: **`s` is the first element of the list, `a` is ')))', `b` is updated to the previous value concatenated with '(', `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than 1.**
