The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates on a positive integer `N` such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, and a string `S` of length `N` that consists only of the characters `(` and `)`. The function evaluates the string `S` and returns different results based on the validity of the string as a sequence of parentheses. 

Functionality: **The function checks if the string S of length N contains valid parentheses and returns a result indicating the validity of the sequence.**
