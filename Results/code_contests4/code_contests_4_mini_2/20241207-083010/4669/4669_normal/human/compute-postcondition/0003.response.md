To determine whether the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to analyze the condition `len(s) > 1`. The loop will execute if the length of the list `s` is greater than 1.

From the provided state before the loop, we know that:
- `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 100 (1 ≤ N ≤ 100).
- `S` is a string of length `N`, consisting only of the characters `(` and `)`.
- `s` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `S` at each `()`. 

For the loop to execute, the list `s` must contain more than one element. This can happen if:
1. The string `S` contains at least one pair of `()` so it can be split.
2. The string `S` is not composed entirely of `(` or `)` such that it would not yield multiple substrings upon splitting.

Given that `S` is of length `N`, if `N` is 1, `S` can only be either `(` or `)`, which would result in `s` being a list with a single element after the split, thus making `len(s)` equal to 1.

Thus, for the loop to execute at least once, `N` must be greater than 1, ensuring that `S` can contain at least one pair of `()`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer based on user input (1 ≤ N ≤ 100), for the loop to execute the first time `N` must be greater than 1**
