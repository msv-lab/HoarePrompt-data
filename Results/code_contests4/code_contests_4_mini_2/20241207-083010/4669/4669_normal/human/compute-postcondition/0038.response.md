To evaluate the output state, we need to analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet.

Initial State: 
- `s` is the first element of the list.
- `a` is equal to the number of opening parentheses in `s` concatenated with `)` for each of them.
- `b` is equal to the number of closing parentheses in `s` concatenated with `(` for each of them.

Given the code:
```
print(b + ss + a)
```
Here, `b`, `ss`, and `a` are being concatenated and printed. However, `ss` is not defined in the initial state and we do not have information on its value. 

Since `b` and `a` are dependent on the content of `s`, we can conclude that:
- The value of `b` depends on how many closing parentheses are in `s`.
- The value of `a` depends on how many opening parentheses are in `s`.

The output of the `print` statement will represent a string that consists of `b`, `ss`, and `a`, but since `ss` is undefined, we cannot accurately represent the output. Therefore, we state that `b` and `a` are defined based on `s`, and acknowledge that an undefined variable `ss` is present.

Output State: **`s` is the first element of the list, `a` is equal to the number of opening parentheses in `s` concatenated with `)` for each of them, `b` is equal to the number of closing parentheses in `s` concatenated with `(` for each of them, and `ss` is undefined.**
