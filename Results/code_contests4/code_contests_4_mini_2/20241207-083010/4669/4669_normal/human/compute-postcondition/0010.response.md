The code `s = s.split('()')` takes the string `s` and splits it into a list of substrings wherever the substring `()` occurs. Since `s` is initially a string that has been joined into a single string from its iterable components, the content of `s` will determine the number of elements in the resulting list. The variable `s` will now hold this list instead of the original string. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a list created by splitting the original string at each occurrence of '()'. 

Output State: **`s` is a list created by splitting the original string at each occurrence of '()'**.
