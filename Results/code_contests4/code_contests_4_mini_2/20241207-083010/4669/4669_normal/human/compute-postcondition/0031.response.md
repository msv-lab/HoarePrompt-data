Postcondition: ***`s` is the first element of the list. If `s[i]` is an opening parenthesis '(', then `a` is set to '))', `b` is updated to the previous value of `b` concatenated with '(', `i` is incremented by 1, and the loop can execute again if `N` is greater than `i`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
