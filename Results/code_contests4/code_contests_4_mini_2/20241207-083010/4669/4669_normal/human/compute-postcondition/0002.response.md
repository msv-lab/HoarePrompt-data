The variable `s` is assigned the result of `ss.split('()')`, which splits the string `ss` at each occurrence of the substring `()`. This operation creates a list of substrings from `ss`, where the occurrences of `()` are removed. The input string `ss` remains unchanged, and its length is `N`. The other variable `N` is not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer based on user input (1 ≤ N ≤ 100), `S` is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters `(` and `)`, and `s` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `ss` at each `()`.
