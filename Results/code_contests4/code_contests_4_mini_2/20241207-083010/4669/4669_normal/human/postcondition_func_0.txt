The function accepts a positive integer `N` and a string `S` of length `N` consisting of characters `(` and `)`. It repeatedly removes pairs of `()` from the string until no more pairs can be removed. Afterward, it counts the number of unbalanced parentheses in `S`, appending the appropriate number of closing parentheses `)` to the left and opening parentheses `(` to the right of the original string `S`. The final output is a string that represents the original string with balanced parentheses added, but it does not validate whether the original sequence of parentheses was valid or not.
