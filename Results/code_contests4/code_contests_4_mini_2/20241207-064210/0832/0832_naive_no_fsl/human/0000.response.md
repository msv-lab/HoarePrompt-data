Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the movement logic as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the logic and identify a potential case where it fails.

1. **Initial Movement**: The program correctly starts at (1, 1) and recognizes that if `k < n`, Lara would still be in the first column after moving down. However, the logic immediately prints `print(y, k + 1)` which assumes a direct mapping without considering that it is still in the first column.

2. **Transition to Snake Movement**: After the initial downward movement, the code attempts to switch to the snake movement. The calculation of `t` (the number of complete rightward movements) and `p` (the position in the current row) is flawed:
   - The calculation `y = n - t` does not accurately reflect the row number during snake movement.
   - The mapping of `x` is incorrect. The formula `x = 2 + p if t % 2 == 0 else m - p` does not correctly account for the alternating movement in the rows.

3. **Edge Cases**: For example, if `n = 4`, `m = 3`, and `k = 10`, the expected position after 10 moves would be (3, 1), but according to the program's logic, it would miscalculate the position due to the flawed handling of row and column assignments.

4. **Specific Case**: If we consider `n = 4`, `m = 3`, and `k = 8`:
   - The expected position is (4, 2) (after moving down and then starting the snake pattern).
   - The program results in a different position due to incorrect calculations.

Therefore, since there are clear cases where the position is calculated incorrectly, the correctness of the program is proven false.
