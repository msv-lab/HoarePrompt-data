The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters, but it operates under the following constraints: `n` and `m` are integers such that \( 2 \leq n, m \leq 10^9 \) and `n` is always even; `k` is a non-negative integer such that \( 0 \leq k < n \cdot m \). 

Given these constraints, the function's output can vary based on the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`. However, the exact output behavior is not provided in the prompt.

Functionality: **The function operates with integers n and m (where n is even), and a non-negative integer k, but specific output behavior based on these values is not described.**
