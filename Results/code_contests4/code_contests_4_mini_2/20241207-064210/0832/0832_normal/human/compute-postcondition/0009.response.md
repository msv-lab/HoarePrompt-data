To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we start by analyzing the impact of the code on the initial state of the variables.

1. We have the initial state with variables:
   - `n`, `m`, `k` are input integers
   - `x` is 1
   - `y` is 1
   - `t` is the result of `k / (m - 1)` where `k` is updated to `k - n`

2. The operation `p = k % (m - 1)` assigns the value of the modulus operation to `p`.
   - Before this line executes, we need to confirm the value of `k` after the update. 
   - The value of `k` was originally some input integer, and then it is updated to `k - n`.

3. The value of `m - 1` is calculated based on the input integer `m`. Since `m` is an input integer, `m - 1` will also be defined, assuming `m` is greater than 1 (to avoid division by zero).

4. Finally, `p` is assigned the value of `k % (m - 1)`, where `k` is `k - n`.

Since we cannot determine specific numerical values for the inputs `n`, `m`, and `k`, we can only describe the relationships:

- `p` is the result of `k - n` modulo `m - 1`.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the changes and calculations regarding `k`, `m`, and `p`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are input integers; `x` is 1; `y` is 1; `k` is updated to `k - n`; `p` is `k % (m - 1)`**.
