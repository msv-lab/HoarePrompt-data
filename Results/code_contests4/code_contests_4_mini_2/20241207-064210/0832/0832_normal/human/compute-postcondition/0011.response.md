To determine the output state, we first analyze the provided code snippet and the initial conditions. 

1. `x` is assigned a new value based on whether `t` is even or odd:
   - If `t % 2 == 0`, then `x` becomes `2 + p`.
   - If `t % 2 != 0`, then `x` becomes `m - p`.

2. The value of `p` is computed from the previous state where `p = k % (m - 1)`.

Since `n`, `m`, `k`, and `t` are input integers, we donâ€™t know their specific values, but we can describe the output based on the conditions.

- `x` will have two potential outcomes depending on the parity of `t`:
  - If `t` is even, then `x` will be `2 + p`, where `p` is calculated from `k` and `m`.
  - If `t` is odd, then `x` will be `m - p`.

We can summarize the possible outcomes for `x`:

- If `t` is even: 
  - `x` is `2 + (k % (m - 1))`.
  
- If `t` is odd:
  - `x` is `m - (k % (m - 1))`.

Thus, we can express the output state considering both cases:

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are input integers; `x` is either `2 + (k % (m - 1))` if `t` is even or `m - (k % (m - 1))` if `t` is odd; `y` is `n - t`; `k` is updated to `k - n`; `p` is `k % (m - 1)`**.
