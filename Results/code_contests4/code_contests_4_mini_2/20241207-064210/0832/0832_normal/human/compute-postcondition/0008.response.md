The value of `t` is assigned the result of `k / (m - 1)`. The variable `k` has been updated to `k - n`, so the new value of `k` is considered. The values of `n`, `m`, and the new `k` are input integers, while `m - 1` must not be zero for the division to be valid. The other variables `x` and `y` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `k` are input integers; `x` is 1; `y` is 1; `t` is the result of the expression `k / (m - 1)` where `k` is `k - n`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are input integers; `x` is 1; `y` is 1; `t` is the result of `k / (m - 1)` where `k` is `k - n`.**
