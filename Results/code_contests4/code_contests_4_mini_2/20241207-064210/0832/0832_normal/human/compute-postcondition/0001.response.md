The value of `x` is assigned the value 1. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is 1. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is 1**
