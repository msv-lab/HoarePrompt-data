Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, where `n` is even, and `k` is a non-negative integer. It first checks if `k` is less than `n`, and if so, it prints `(1, k+1)` and terminates the program. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, it calculates values `t` and `p` based on `(k - n)` and updates `y` and `x` using these calculations. Finally, it prints the values of `y` and `x`. The function does not return any values but prints two lines of output based on the calculations performed. It does not handle cases where `k` is less than `n` in a way that allows further execution beyond the initial print and exit.**
