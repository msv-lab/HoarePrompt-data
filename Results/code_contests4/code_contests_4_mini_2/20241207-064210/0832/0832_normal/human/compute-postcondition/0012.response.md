The code provided prints the values of `y` and `x`. The variable `y` is defined as `n - t`, and `x` depends on whether `t` is even or odd, and is calculated as either `2 + (k % (m - 1))` or `m - (k % (m - 1))`. The values of `y` and `x` will be rounded up using `math.ceil`, and both will be converted to integers before printing.

The output will depend on the specific values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `t`. However, since these values are not provided, we can only describe the output state based on the expressions given.

Output State: **`y` is `n - t`, `x` is either `2 + (k % (m - 1))` if `t` is even or `m - (k % (m - 1))` if `t` is odd**.
