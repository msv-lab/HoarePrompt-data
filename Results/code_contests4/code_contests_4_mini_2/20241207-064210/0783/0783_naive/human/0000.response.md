To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic and identify any potential edge cases that the program does not handle correctly.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Input Parameters**: The program takes six integers: `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `a`, `b`. These represent the chessboard dimensions, the initial position of the candy, and the allowable movement steps.
  
2. **Corners**: The corners of the board are at positions `(1, 1)`, `(1, m)`, `(n, 1)`, and `(n, m)`.

3. **Movement Rules**: The candy can be moved in four possible ways based on the values of `a` and `b`.

4. **Output Requirements**: The program should output the minimum number of moves required to reach any corner or indicate that it is impossible.

### Code Review:
The provided code attempts to calculate the minimum number of moves needed to reach the corners by checking the distance to each corner and validating if the distance can be covered in valid moves.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Edge Case of Positions**: The program checks if it can instantly reach the corner `(1, 1)` if `dx` and `dy` are zero. However, the condition for checking if the candy can move correctly based on the values of `a` and `b` may not account for all edge cases.
  
2. **Division and Evenness Check**: The use of integer division and modulo checks for evenness (`dx / a % 2 == dy / b % 2`) could lead to issues if the values of `a` and `b` are not properly aligned with the distances, which might lead to incorrect calculations about whether a corner is reachable.

3. **Specific Cases of Movement**: It does not consider scenarios where it might not be possible to reach any corner due to the dimensions of the board and the values of `a` and `b`. For example, if `a > n-1` or `b > m-1`, it may not be possible to move at all in the direction required to reach a corner.

### Example Case That Fails:
Consider the input:
```
1 1 1 1 2 2
```
- Here, the chessboard is of size `1x1`, and the candy is already at the only corner `(1, 1)`.
- The values of `a` and `b` are `2`, which means the candy cannot move anywhere since it exceeds the board dimensions.
- The expected output should be `0` moves since the candy is already at a corner; however, the program will likely not handle this case correctly because it will not find a valid move but also might not output the expected `0`.

### Conclusion:
Given these considerations and the potential failure case, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential inputs.

Correctness: **False**.
