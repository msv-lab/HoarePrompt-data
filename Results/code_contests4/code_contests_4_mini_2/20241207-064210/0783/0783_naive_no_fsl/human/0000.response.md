Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as specified in the problem description. 

For example, consider the input:

```
5 7 1 3 2 2
```

This corresponds to a 5x7 chessboard with the candy starting at (1, 3) and the allowed moves being 2 rows and 2 columns. The program should calculate the minimum number of moves necessary to reach one of the corners: (1, 1), (1, 7), (5, 1), or (5, 7).

The correct output for this case is `2`, as demonstrated in the example in the problem description. However, if we check other edge cases, such as the candy being near the edges or corners where it cannot move, the program fails to account for situations where the moves are not possible due to the parameters `a` and `b`.

For instance, if we test with:

```
1 1 1 1 1 1
```

This means the candy is already at a corner (1, 1), and the output should be `0`. However, the logic in the program does not correctly cover this case as it may incorrectly evaluate the moves, especially when one of the dimensions (n or m) is minimal (1).

Thus, the program is not handling all edge cases correctly, leading to incorrect outputs in certain scenarios.
