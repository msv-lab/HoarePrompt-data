The variable `dy` is assigned the value `abs(y - 1)`, which is already stated in the initial conditions. The values of `dx` and `a` and `b` are not provided, but they remain unchanged. The variable `v` is assigned the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `dx / a` and `dy / b`. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged values of `n`, `m`, and the previously defined variables, along with the new assignment of `v`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers; `c` is (1, 1); `dy` is abs(y - 1); `dx` is abs(x - 1); `dy` is abs(y - 1); `v` is assigned min(v, max(dx / a, dy / b)).**
