Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers; `c` is (1, 1); `dy` is assigned the value abs(y - 1); `dx` is assigned the value abs(x - 1). If `dx + dy` is equal to 0, then `v` is 0. Otherwise, if `dx + dy` is greater than 0, and if `dx % a == 0` and `dy % b == 0` and `(dx / a % 2 == dy / b % 2)`, then `v` is assigned the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `dx / a` and `dy / b.`***
