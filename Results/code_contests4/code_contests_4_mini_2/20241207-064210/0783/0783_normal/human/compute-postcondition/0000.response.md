The code takes input for the variables `n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `a`, and `b` from the user, using `map` to convert the input values into integers. The values of `n` and `m` define the dimensions of the chessboard, while `x` and `y` represent the initial position of the candy, and `a` and `b` represent the movement offsets. As a result, the values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `a`, and `b` will now hold the integers provided by the user.

Since the initial state does not specify the input values for these variables, we state that they will be positive integers representing their respective purposes. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of rows, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of columns, `x` is a positive integer representing the initial row position of the candy, `y` is a positive integer representing the initial column position of the candy, `a` is a positive integer representing the row movement offset, `b` is a positive integer representing the column movement offset.**
