According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the collection of tuples being iterated over, which consists of four pairs: (1, m), (n, 1), (n, m), and (1, 1). At the end of the last iteration, `c` is set to one of these pairs. 

Given that `c` is currently in the range (1, m), it suggests that on the next iteration, `c` will take on the next tuple in this collection. The tuples are processed in the order they are listed, so after evaluating (1, m), the next tuple would be (n, 1), then (n, m), and finally (1, 1). 

To execute one more time, the loop will iterate over the second element, which is (n, 1). Therefore, the state must reflect that `c` is now (n, 1).

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `c` is (n, 1), `dy` is equal to abs(y - m), and if the sum of `dx` and `dy` is equal to 0, then `v` is set to 0. Otherwise, if `dx` is not equal to -dy, and if `dx` is divisible by `a`, `dy` is divisible by `b`, and the parity of `dx / a` is equal to the parity of `dy / b,` then `v` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `dx / a` and `dy / b.`**
