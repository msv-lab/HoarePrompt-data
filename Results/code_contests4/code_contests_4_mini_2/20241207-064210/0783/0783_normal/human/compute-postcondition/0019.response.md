According to the code, the loop iterates over the list of tuples `[(1, m), (n, 1), (n, m), (1, 1)]`. The loop processes each tuple `c` in this list sequentially. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is set to one of the tuples in the list. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `c` must be updated to the next tuple in the list.

If `c` is currently `(n, m)`, which is the third tuple in the list, then for the loop to execute one more time, we need to move to the fourth tuple `(1, 1)`. 

Thus, the next state will have `c` updated to `(1, 1)`.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers; `c` is (1, 1), `dy` is abs(y - 1); `dx` is abs(x - n)**
