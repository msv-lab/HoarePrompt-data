The value of `dy` is assigned the value of `abs(y - c[1])`. Since `c` is defined as `(n, 1)`, `c[1]` is equal to `1`. Therefore, `dy` is assigned the value `abs(y - 1)`. The variables `n`, `m`, and `dx` remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers; `c` is (n, 1); `dy` is abs(y - 1); `dx` is equal to abs(x - n)**.
