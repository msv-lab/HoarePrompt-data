The variable `dx` is assigned the value of `abs(x - c[0])`. The value of `c` is defined as (1, m) for the first iteration, which means `c[0]` is 1. The variable `x` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its specific value. However, `dx` will depend on the unknown value of `x` and will be calculated as the absolute difference between `x` and 1. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `c` is (1, m), `dx` is abs(x - 1), where x is an unknown positive integer.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `c` is (1, m), `dx` is abs(x - 1)**
