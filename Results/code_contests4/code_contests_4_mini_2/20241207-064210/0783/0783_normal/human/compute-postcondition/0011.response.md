Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers, `c` is in the range (1, m), `dy` is equal to abs(y - m), and if the sum of `dx` and `dy` is equal to 0, then `v` is set to 0. Otherwise, if `dx` is not equal to -dy, and if `dx` is divisible by `a`, `dy` is divisible by `b`, and the parity of `dx / a` is equal to the parity of `dy / b`, then `v` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `dx / a` and `dy / b.***
