The code assigns the value 0 to the variable `v`. The other variables `n`, `m`, `c`, `dy`, and `dx` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers; `c` is (1, 1); `dy` is abs(y - 1); `dx` is abs(x - 1); `v` is 0.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers; `c` is (1, 1); `dy` is abs(y - 1); `dx` is abs(x - 1); `v` is 0**
