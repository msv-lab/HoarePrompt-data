According to the code, the loop iterates over a predefined list of tuples: `[(1, m), (n, 1), (n, m), (1, 1)]`. The loop will execute regardless of the values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `b`, and `v`, as long as they are defined and the list of tuples is not empty. 

At the start of the loop, the variable `c` will take on each tuple in the list sequentially. The first value of `c` will be `(1, m)` during the first iteration. 

Since `n` and `m` are both positive integers, the first tuple `(1, m)` will work without issues. Therefore, there are no specific adjustments needed for the loop to execute; however, we can note the values of `c` for the first iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `c` is (1, m) for the first iteration**
