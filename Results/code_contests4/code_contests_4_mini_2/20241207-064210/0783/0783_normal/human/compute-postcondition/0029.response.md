Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers; `v` is either 0 or 1152921504606846976; `dx` and `dy` are computed as absolute differences between `x`, `y`, and the respective values in `c`. If `v` is non-zero and either the maximum of `n - x` or `x - 1` is less than `a`, or the maximum of `m - y` or `y - 1` is less than `b`, then the conditions for `dx` and `dy` are satisfied based on these calculations.***
