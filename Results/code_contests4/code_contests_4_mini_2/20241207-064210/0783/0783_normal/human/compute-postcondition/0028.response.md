Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers; `v` is 1 << 60 (which is 1152921504606846976); `dx` and `dy` are computed as absolute differences between `x`, `y`, and the respective values in `c`. The value of `v` is non-zero, and either the maximum of `n - x` or `x - 1` is less than `a`, or the maximum of `m - y` or `y - 1` is less than `b`.**
