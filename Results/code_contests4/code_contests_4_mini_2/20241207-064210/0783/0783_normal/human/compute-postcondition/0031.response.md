The function `func` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `a`, and `b`. Here, `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the chessboard, while `i` and `j` are positive integers representing the initial position of the candy on the chessboard, constrained such that \(1 \leq i \leq n\) and \(1 \leq j \leq m\). The parameters `a` and `b` are also positive integers representing the movement offsets. 

The function does not return any specific output based on the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept these parameters related to the chessboard and the position of the candy, but the specific return value or action performed by the function is not described.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, i, j, a, and b, representing the dimensions of the chessboard and the position and movement offsets of the candy.**
