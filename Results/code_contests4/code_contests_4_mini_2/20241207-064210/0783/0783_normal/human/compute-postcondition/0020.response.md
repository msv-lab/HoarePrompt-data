In the provided code, `dx` is assigned the value of `abs(x - c[0])`. The variable `c` is a tuple with values (1, 1), so `c[0]` is 1. The value of `x` is unknown, but it remains a positive integer. The calculation for `dx` will depend on the value of `x`.

Thus, `dx` will be calculated as follows:
- If `x` > 1, then `dx` will be `x - 1`.
- If `x` = 1, then `dx` will be `0`.

This means that `dx` will be a non-negative integer representing the absolute difference between `x` and 1.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `c`, `dy`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers; `c` is (1, 1); `dy` is abs(y - 1); `dx` is abs(x - 1).

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers; `c` is (1, 1); `dy` is abs(y - 1); `dx` is abs(x - 1)**
