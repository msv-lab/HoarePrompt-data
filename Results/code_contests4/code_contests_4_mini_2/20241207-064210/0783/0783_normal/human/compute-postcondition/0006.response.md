The value of `v` is initialized to 0. The values of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `c`, `dy`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `c` is in the range (1, m), `dy` is the absolute value of `y - m`, and the sum of `dx` and `dy` is equal to 0; `v` is 0.
