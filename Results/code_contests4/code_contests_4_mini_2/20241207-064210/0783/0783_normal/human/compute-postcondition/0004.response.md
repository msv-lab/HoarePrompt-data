To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, let's analyze the impact of the code on the variables:

1. The variable `c` is a tuple or list containing two elements, where the second element is `c[1]`. Given that `c` is defined as (1, m), `c[1]` would be equal to `m`.
2. The variable `dy` is assigned the value of `abs(y - c[1])`, which simplifies to `abs(y - m)` since `c[1]` is `m`.
3. The values of `n`, `m`, and `c` do not change, and the variable `dy` is introduced with the value of `abs(y - m)`.

Now, let's summarize the output state, considering that `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `c` is (1, m), and `dy` is now defined as `abs(y - m)`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `c` is (1, m), `dy` is abs(y - m)**
