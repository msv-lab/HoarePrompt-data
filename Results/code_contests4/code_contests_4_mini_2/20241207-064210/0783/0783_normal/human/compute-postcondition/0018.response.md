Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers; `c` is (n, 1); `dy` is abs(y - 1); `dx` is abs(x - n). If `dx + dy` equals 0, then `v` is set to 0. Otherwise, if `dx` is divisible by `a`, `dy` is divisible by `b`, and the parity of `dx / a` is equal to the parity of `dy / b`, then `v` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of (dx / a) and (dy / b).***
