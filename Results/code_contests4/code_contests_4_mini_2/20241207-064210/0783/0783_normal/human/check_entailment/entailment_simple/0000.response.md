To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze both the expected behavior specified in the problem and the actual behavior of the program.

### Problem Description Summary:
1. We have a chessboard of size `n x m`.
2. A candy starts at position `(i, j)`.
3. The candy can be moved to certain positions determined by offsets `(a, b)`.
4. The goal is to determine the minimum number of moves required to get the candy to any of the corners of the chessboard: `(1, 1)`, `(1, m)`, `(n, 1)`, `(n, m)`.
5. If it's not possible to reach any of these corners, the output should be "Poor Inna and pony!".

### Analyzing the Program:
1. The program reads input values for `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `a`, and `b`.
2. It initializes `v` to a very large number (`1 << 60`) which is intended to represent the minimum number of moves found.
3. It iterates over the four corners of the chessboard.
4. For each corner, it calculates the distance `dx` and `dy` from the initial position `(x, y)` to the corner `(c[0], c[1])`.
5. It checks if it can reach that corner based on the conditions:
   - The distance to the corner must be divisible by the movement offsets (`a` for `dx` and `b` for `dy`).
   - The parity of the number of moves in each direction must match (i.e., both must either be even or odd).
6. If the conditions are satisfied, it calculates the number of moves required and updates `v` if this is the smallest found so far.
7. After checking all corners, it evaluates if a valid number of moves was found (`v` should not be the initial large value).
8. It checks additional conditions related to the board boundaries and prints the result accordingly.

### Evaluation of Correctness:
- The program correctly implements the necessary calculations to determine whether the candy can reach the corners based on the defined movement rules.
- It appropriately checks for divisibility and parity conditions that are crucial for determining if the corner is reachable.
- The output handling also matches the requirement to indicate if reaching the corners is impossible.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly follows the problem description and handles the essential conditions for moving the candy on the chessboard. Therefore, the correctness of the program can be concluded as:

Correctness: **True**
