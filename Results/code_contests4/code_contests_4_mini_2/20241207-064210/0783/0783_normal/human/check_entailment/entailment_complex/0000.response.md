The provided program is intended to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of moves required to reach one of the corners of a chessboard from a given starting position, using specified movement offsets. However, upon analyzing the code and the problem description, it appears that there are some inconsistencies and potential issues.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads input directly using `raw_input()` and maps the values to integers, which is correct for the expected input format.

2. **Movement Calculation**:
   - It iterates over the four corners of the chessboard: `(1, m)`, `(n, 1)`, `(n, m)`, and `(1, 1)`.
   - For each corner, it calculates the distance `dx` and `dy` from the current position `(x, y)` to the corner.

3. **Checking Conditions**:
   - The program checks if both `dx` is divisible by `a` and `dy` is divisible by `b`, and also verifies that the number of moves required in both the x and y directions are either both even or both odd. This ensures that the candy can only reach the corners with valid moves.

4. **Minimum Moves Calculation**:
   - It keeps track of the minimum number of moves required to reach any corner by updating `v`.

5. **Output Conditions**:
   - The program has a condition that checks if `v` is valid, and if the maximum distance to move in the x or y direction exceeds the given movement offsets `a` or `b`. If it does, it resets `v` to a very large number. 
   - Finally, it prints either the minimum moves or a message indicating "Poor Inna and pony!" if it is impossible to reach the corners.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Division and Modulo Operations**:
   - The use of integer division (`dx / a` and `dy / b`) should be changed to integer division using `//` to ensure that the results are integers. The code as it stands could potentially lead to floating-point results if `dx` or `dy` are not perfectly divisible by `a` or `b`.

2. **Output Logic**:
   - The line `print('Poor Inna and pony!', v)[v < 1 << 55]` is not clear and could lead to confusion. The intention seems to be to print either the number of moves or the message based on the value of `v`, but the logic is convoluted.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program may not correctly handle edge cases where the starting position is already at one of the corners, potentially leading to incorrect outputs.

### Conclusion:
While the program implements the core logic for solving the problem, it contains issues related to integer division, potential confusion in output logic, and may not adequately handle all edge cases. Therefore, it does not fully adhere to the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
