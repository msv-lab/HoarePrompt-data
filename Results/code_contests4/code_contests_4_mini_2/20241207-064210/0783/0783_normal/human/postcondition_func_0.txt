The function accepts positive integers `n` and `m` representing the dimensions of a chessboard, integers `x` and `y` representing the initial position of the candy, and integers `a` and `b` representing movement offsets. It calculates the minimum number of moves required to reach any corner of the chessboard from the initial position based on the specified movement offsets. If it is not possible to reach a corner under the given conditions, it determines that the candy cannot be moved appropriately and returns a message indicating the situation along with a value that reflects the minimum moves calculated. The function also handles cases where the movement is not feasible by checking if the movement offsets exceed the available space in the direction of movement.
