To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and output hints, let's analyze the code and the requirements step by step.

### Problem Description Analysis
The problem requires us to find the minimum number of "bad" cells encountered while moving from a starting position `(x1, y1)` to an ending position `(x2, y2)` on an infinite checkered field. A cell is considered "bad" if it satisfies either of the two conditions based on parameters `a` and `b`. 

### Code Analysis
The program defines a function `func_1(c, d)` which performs an integer division of `c` by `d`. The main logic calculates the differences in the coordinates based on the two conditions for bad cells, using this function to determine how many bad cells would be encountered in each case. It then returns the maximum of these two results.

### Key Observations:
1. **Division Behavior**:
   - The function `func_1` performs division but does not handle negative values correctly; specifically, the behavior is undefined when `c` is negative, and the division could lead to incorrect results because the output is not rounded or floored properly.
   
2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `d` is zero, the program will raise a division by zero error, which is a critical edge case not handled in the code.
   - The calculations assume that `x1` and `y1` are always non-negative before division, which is not guaranteed by the input constraints.

3. **Output Hints**:
   - The hints state that the function returns the result of dividing `c` by `d` if `c` is non-negative. If `c` is negative, the behavior is undefined. This aligns with the issue identified in the code regarding division of negative numbers.

### Conclusion
The program does not follow the problem description correctly for all potential cases due to the following issues:
- It does not correctly handle negative values or division by zero, leading to potential runtime errors.
- It may not accurately compute the number of bad cells visited due to the flawed division logic.

Thus, there are scenarios where the program can fail or provide incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**.
