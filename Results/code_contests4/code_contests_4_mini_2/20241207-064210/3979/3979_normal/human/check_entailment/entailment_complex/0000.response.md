Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. The problem requires a function that calculates the minimum number of bad cells one must visit when moving from square (x1, y1) to square (x2, y2) on an infinite checkered field, based on specific criteria for determining whether a cell is "bad." 

However, the annotated program (`func_1`) does not address the problem at all. Instead, it simply performs a division operation on two parameters `c` and `d`, which are not related to the coordinates or the checks for bad squares as described in the problem. The conditions for determining bad squares and the logic needed to compute the path from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2) are entirely missing. 

There are no implementations or calculations that evaluate the bad conditions based on the input parameters `a`, `b`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`. Consequently, the program fails to meet the requirements outlined in the problem description, which necessitates an evaluation of the grid and the specific bad squares encountered during movement. 

Thus, the program is incorrect and does not fulfill the problem's requirements.
