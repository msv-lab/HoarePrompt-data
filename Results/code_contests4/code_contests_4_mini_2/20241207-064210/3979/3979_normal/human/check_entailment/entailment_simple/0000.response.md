Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not address the problem description, which requires calculating the minimum number of bad cells one must visit while moving from one coordinate to another on a checkered field. The program instead contains a function that performs a division operation based on the variables `c` and `d`, which are not defined in the context of the problem. 

The main issues are as follows:

1. **Irrelevant Functionality**: The function `func_1` is irrelevant to the task of counting bad squares on a path. It merely divides two numbers and does not implement any logic related to the movement on a checkered field.

2. **Missing Logic for Bad Squares**: The problem requires a method to determine if a cell is "bad" based on the provided conditions involving parameters `a` and `b` and the coordinates. The program does not include any logic to check for bad squares or calculate the path from `(x1, y1)` to `(x2, y2)`.

3. **Undefined Variables**: The variable `d` is not defined or initialized in the context of the program, which would lead to a runtime error if the function were called.

4. **No Pathfinding Algorithm**: There is no implementation of any pathfinding algorithm that would be required to navigate from the starting coordinates to the target coordinates.

In summary, the program fails to implement the necessary checks, calculations, and logic required to solve the problem as described, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
