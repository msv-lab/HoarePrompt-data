The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `c` and `d`. Both `c` and `d` are integers. In the first case, if `c` is greater than or equal to 0, the function returns the result of dividing `c` by `d`. In the second case, if `c` is a negative integer, the output cannot be determined without knowing the value of `d`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integer parameters `c` and `d`, and if `c` is non-negative, it returns the result of `c` divided by `d`. If `c` is negative, the return value cannot be determined without additional information about `d`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters c and d, and returns c divided by d if c is non-negative; if c is negative, the return value cannot be determined without knowing d.**
