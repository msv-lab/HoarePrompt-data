Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer parameters, `c` and `d`. It returns the result of dividing `c` by `d` if `c` is non-negative. If `c` is negative, it still returns the result of dividing `c` by `d`, but the behavior of the function is undefined without knowing the value of `d`. Additionally, if `d` is zero, this will result in a division by zero error.**
