#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that 2 <= a, b <= 10^9; x1, y1, x2, and y2 are integers such that |x1|, |y1|, |x2|, |y2| <= 10^9. The coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are not bad squares according to the given conditions.
def func_1(c, d):
    if (c >= 0) :
        return c / d
        #The program returns the result of dividing c by d, where c is greater than or equal to 0 and d is not specified in the given conditions.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *a and b are integers such that 2 <= a, b <= 10^9; x1, y1, x2, and y2 are integers such that |x1|, |y1|, |x2|, |y2| <= 10^9; the coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are not bad squares according to the given conditions; c is a negative integer.
    return c / d
    #The program returns the result of dividing the negative integer c by the variable d, which is not defined in the provided state. Therefore, the output cannot be determined without knowing the value of d.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters, `c` and `d`. It returns the result of dividing `c` by `d` if `c` is non-negative. If `c` is negative, it still returns the result of dividing `c` by `d`, but the behavior of the function is undefined without knowing the value of `d`. Additionally, if `d` is zero, this will result in a division by zero error.
