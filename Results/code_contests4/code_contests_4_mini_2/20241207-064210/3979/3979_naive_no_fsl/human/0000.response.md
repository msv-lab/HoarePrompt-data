To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze if it correctly computes the minimum number of bad cells one will have to visit when moving from square (x1, y1) to square (x2, y2) based on the defined conditions for "bad" cells.

### Analysis of the Program

1. The program reads the parameters `a`, `b`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` from input.
2. It defines a function `func_1(c, d)` which divides `c` by `d`. However, the way it handles division does not appear to consider integer division correctly.
3. It calculates two values, `ans1` and `ans2`, that represent some form of distance or difference between the starting and ending positions relative to the conditions that define bad squares.
4. Finally, it prints the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.

### Potential Issue

The main issue arises from how `func_1` performs division. The division operation in Python 2 (`/`) performs integer division when both operands are integers. However, in Python 3, it performs floating-point division. The implementation is not clearly defined for one or the other, but if we assume it behaves as in Python 2, it could yield unintended results.

For example, consider the following inputs:
- `a = 2`
- `b = 2`
- `x1 = 1`
- `y1 = 0`
- `x2 = 0`
- `y2 = 1`

Expected output is `1`, as the only bad cell is (0, 0). However, due to potential floating-point behavior, the calculated distances might not yield the correct integer results, especially when the values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are large.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly ensure that the divisions yield integer results that are required to count the number of bad cells. Therefore, there are cases where the output may not match the expected output defined by the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
