To analyze the given program against the problem description, we need to evaluate whether it correctly calculates the minimum number of bad cells one will have to visit while moving from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2).

### Problem Breakdown:
The conditions for a cell (x, y) to be "bad" are:
1. |x + y| ≡ 0 (mod 2a)
2. |x - y| ≡ 0 (mod 2b)

The goal is to find the minimum number of bad cells on the path from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2).

### Analyzing the Program:
1. The program reads six integers: a, b, x1, y1, x2, y2.
2. It defines a function `func_1(c, d)` which divides `c` by `d`. However, the division operation in Python 2 (which uses `raw_input`) will yield an integer result, effectively performing floor division instead of true division.
3. The program calculates two values: `ans1` and `ans2`, representing the number of bad cells in two dimensions based on the given conditions.
4. Finally, it prints the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Bad Cell Calculation**: The program uses division to determine how many steps it is from the bad cells, which is not the correct method to count the number of bad cells encountered. The conditions provided need to be checked for each cell along the path rather than calculated through division.
2. **Logic Flaw**: The absolute difference in the division results does not correlate to the actual number of bad cells encountered on the path. The logic assumes a direct proportionality that does not hold true for arbitrary paths.

### Test Case for Incorrectness:
Consider the case:
- Input: `2 2 1 0 0 1`
- Expected output: `1` (the path from (1, 0) to (0, 1) goes through one bad cell).
- Using the program, it calculates `ans1` and `ans2` based on the differences without properly evaluating the bad cells along the full path.

This miscalculation shows that the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

### Conclusion:
Given the identified issues and the inability to correctly count bad cells along arbitrary paths, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
