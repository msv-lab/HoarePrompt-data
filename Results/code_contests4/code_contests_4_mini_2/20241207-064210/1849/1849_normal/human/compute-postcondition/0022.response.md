The value of `right` is decremented by the value of `ans[p]`. The previous values of `right`, `ans`, and `p` are not explicitly stated, but the operation affects `right` directly. Since `j` is 1 and `i` is the second character of `s`, the state of other variables is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of length between 1 and 100,000; `j` is 1; `i` is the second character in the string `s`; and `right` is decreased by `ans[p]`.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 100,000; `j` is 1; `i` is the second character in the string `s`; `right` is decreased by `ans[p]`**.
