Postcondition: ***If `i` is equal to ')', then `right` is decreased by 1, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 100,000, `j` is 2, and `i` is the third character of `s`. Otherwise, `right` is decreased by `ans[p]`, `s` remains a string of length between 1 and 100,000, `j` is 2, `i` is the third character of `s`, and `p` is increased by 1.***
