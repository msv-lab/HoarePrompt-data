Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length between 1 and 100,000. `left` is unchanged, `right` is greater than `left`, `sh` is unchanged, `ans` remains unchanged, `p` is either 0 or 1, and `j` is 0. If `i` is '(', then `left` is decreased by 1; if `i` is ')', then `right` is decreased by 1; if `i` is neither '(' nor ')', then `right` is decreased by the value of `ans[p]`.***
