Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length between 1 and 100,000. If `i` is equal to ')', then `right` is decreased by 1, while `left` remains the count of '(', `sh` is the count of '#', `ans` is either [0] or a list of 1's followed by a computed value based on `abs(right - sh - 1)`, `p` is 0, and `j` is 0. Otherwise, `left` remains the count of '(', `right` is decreased by the value of `ans[p]`, `sh` is the count of '#', `ans` remains the same, `p` is set to 1, `j` is 0, and `i` is not equal to ')'.***
