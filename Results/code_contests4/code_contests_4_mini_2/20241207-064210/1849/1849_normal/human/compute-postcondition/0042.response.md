Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` consisting of characters '(', ')', and '#' and processes it to determine how many '#' can be replaced to ensure that the string can represent a valid parentheses configuration. If it finds that the number of unmatched ')' exceeds the number of unmatched '(', it prints -1 and exits. Finally, it prints a list of integers representing valid replacements for each '#' character or computes a single value based on the unmatched counts. The function does not return a boolean value but instead outputs the results directly. **
