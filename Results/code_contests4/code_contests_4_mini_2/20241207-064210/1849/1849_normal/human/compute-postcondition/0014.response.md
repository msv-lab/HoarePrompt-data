Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length between 1 and 100,000. If `i` is '(', then `left` is decreased by 1, while `right`, `sh`, and `ans` remain unchanged, with `p` as 0 and `j` as 0. If `i` is ')', then `right` is decreased by 1, while `left`, `sh`, and `ans` remain unchanged, with `p` as 0 and `j` as 0. If `i` is neither '(' nor ')', then `left` remains unchanged, `right` is decreased by the value of `ans[p]`, `sh` remains unchanged, `ans` remains the same, `p` is set to 1, `j` is 0, and `i` is not equal to ')'.***
