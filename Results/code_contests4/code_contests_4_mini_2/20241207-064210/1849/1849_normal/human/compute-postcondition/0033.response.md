The value of `p` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `p` is unknown, so we can only state that it is increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `right` is decreased by `ans[p]`, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 100,000, `j` is 2, `i` is the third character of `s`, and `p` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`right` is decreased by `ans[p]`, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 100,000, `j` is 2, `i` is the third character of `s`, and `p` is increased by 1.**
