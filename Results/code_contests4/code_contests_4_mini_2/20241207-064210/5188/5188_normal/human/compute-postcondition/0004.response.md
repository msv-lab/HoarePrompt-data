The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers with the constraints that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9. 

- In Case_1, if `a` is greater than `b`, the function returns the difference between `a` and `b`, which results in a positive integer value. 
- In Case_2, if `b` is greater than or equal to `a`, the function returns the difference between `b` and `a`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `a` and `b` and return the absolute difference between them, ensuring that the result is a positive integer based on the values of `a` and `b`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns the difference between `a` and `b` if `a` is greater than `b`, or the difference between `b` and `a` if `b` is greater than or equal to `a`.**
