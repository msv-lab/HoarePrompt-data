Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem requires a function that calculates the number of valid initial grids for the game Sirtet, given the constraints on the number of cubes in each cell of the grid (L ≤ a_{i,j} ≤ R) and the dimensions of the grid (n × m). 

The program, however, defines a function `func_1(a, b)` that simply computes the absolute difference between two integers `a` and `b`. This function does not address the core problem of determining how many valid grid configurations exist where all cells can be made the same height through the allowed operations. 

Furthermore, there is no logic in the program that considers the grid size, the range of cubes, or the operations described in the problem. Thus, it fails to provide any meaningful solution to Alice's question about the game Sirtet.

In summary, the function is unrelated to the problem description, and it does not implement the required logic to count the valid grids that can be reached from the given constraints, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
