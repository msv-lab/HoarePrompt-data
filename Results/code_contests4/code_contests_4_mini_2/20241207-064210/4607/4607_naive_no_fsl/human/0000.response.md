To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze it step-by-step.

### Problem Breakdown
The task is to determine what integers can be added to an existing sequence of integers (cards) such that the new sequence can form an arithmetic progression (AP). The conditions include:
1. If there are infinitely many numbers that can be added, output `-1`.
2. If there's exactly one number that can be added, output that number.
3. If there are multiple valid integers that can be added, output the count and the integers in sorted order.
4. If no valid integers can be added, output `0`.

### Code Analysis
The main function `func_17` processes the input and determines how many integers can be added to the list of cards to form an AP. Here's a breakdown of its logic:

1. If there's only one card, it implies that any number can be added to create an AP, hence it returns `-1`.
2. If there are two cards, it checks:
   - If they are the same, there can be one additional number (the same).
   - Otherwise, it computes potential positions based on the difference between the two numbers.
3. For sequences with three or more cards, it computes the differences between consecutive numbers and checks:
   - If there are more than two distinct differences, it returns `0` (cannot form an AP).
   - If there is exactly one distinct difference, it calculates possible numbers to add at the ends of the sequence.
   - If there are exactly two distinct differences, it checks if they align to form an AP.

### Potential Issues
1. The logic for handling the case of two cards seems correct, but edge cases (like negative results or exceeding 108) might be mishandled.
2. The way it handles the case for three or more cards is dependent on the consistency of differences; it might not capture all valid APs correctly.
3. If all numbers are the same, it should handle the case where adding any number should be valid, but the implementation might not cover all variations.
4. The sorting of results and the uniqueness check could fail if not implemented correctly.

### Edge Cases
Let's consider some edge cases:
- For `n = 2` with cards `2` and `2`, it should return `1` and `2` because adding `2` maintains an AP.
- For `n = 3` with cards `1, 2, 3`, it should return `0` because no single number can be added to maintain the AP.
- If we have `n = 3` with cards `1, 3, 5`, it should return `1` and `2` as the number that can be added.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the code and potential edge cases, the logic does not seem to cover all scenarios as expected according to the problem statement, particularly in how it handles sequences with more than two cards and edge cases related to the results. 

Thus, I found that the program has logical flaws that would cause it to produce incorrect results in certain cases.

Correctness: **False**. 

For example, the input `4 4 4 4` should yield `-1` (infinitely many options) but it might not be handled correctly in terms of outputting the valid integers.
