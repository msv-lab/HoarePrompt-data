Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement regarding generating a new card value that can be added to Alexander's cards to form an arithmetic progression.

### Reasons for Incorrectness:

1. **Lack of Core Logic**: The program consists predominantly of function definitions that do not collectively implement the necessary logic to solve the problem. Specifically, there is no function that processes the list of numbers on the cards, computes the necessary arithmetic progression conditions, or determines the valid values that can be written on the new card.

2. **Incorrect Functionality**: Functions such as `func_14` and `func_13` are designed for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) and some modular arithmetic, which are not relevant to constructing an arithmetic progression. The problem requires checking the differences between consecutive card values and determining if a new card can be inserted to maintain a consistent difference throughout the sequence.

3. **Absence of Output Handling**: The program lacks a mechanism to handle the outputs as specified in the problem statement. There are no print statements that correspond to the expected results based on the computations required to find the possible card values (either printing the count of valid numbers or returning `-1` for infinite possibilities).

4. **Inadequate Edge Case Handling**: The logic does not account for critical edge cases such as when there is only one card or when all cards have the same number. These cases require specific behavior that the current program does not implement.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements set out in the problem description, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
