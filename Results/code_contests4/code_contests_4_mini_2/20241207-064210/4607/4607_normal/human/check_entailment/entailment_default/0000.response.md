To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and the output hints, let's analyze the components step by step.

### Problem Description:
The program aims to help Arthur identify integers that can be written on a card so that the resulting sequence of cards (including the new card) forms an arithmetic progression.

### Functions and Their Outputs:
1. **Input Functions (func_1, func_2, func_3, etc.)**: These functions gather input but do not validate it. They assume the input follows the expected format and constraints without handling potential errors. While this might not directly affect the logic of the arithmetic progression, it could lead to unexpected behavior if the input is malformed, particularly for large values of `n`.

2. **Main Logic (func_17)**: This function processes the numbers to determine if they can form an arithmetic progression with the addition of one new integer. It includes various checks for different cases:
   - If `n == 1`, it returns `-1`, indicating infinite possibilities.
   - If `n == 2`, it checks if the two numbers are equal or computes potential new integers based on their difference.
   - For `n > 2`, it computes the differences between consecutive integers to determine if they can be made into an arithmetic progression by adding one integer.

### Edge Cases:
- If there are duplicates in the input, the program needs to handle this scenario correctly.
- The conditions where the differences between numbers are not handled correctly could result in incorrect outputs.
- The program does not validate the input effectively, which could lead to incorrect assumptions if the input does not match the expected format.

### Output Hints Check:
The output hints suggest various expected results based on specific inputs:
- For input `3 4 1 7`, the program outputs `2 -2 10`, which indicates that there are two valid integers that can be added to form an arithmetic progression.
- For input `1 10`, it suggests infinite possibilities, which the program handles correctly by outputting `-1`.
- The hints also indicate that for input `4 3 4 5`, the program would output `0`, which is correct since no integer can be added to form an arithmetic sequence.

### Conclusion:
The program logic seems to cover the primary cases outlined in the problem description. However, the lack of input validation poses a risk of handling unexpected inputs improperly. Furthermore, the complexity of correctly determining arithmetic progression could lead to missed edge cases, particularly when differences between numbers are not unique or when multiple integers can be added to achieve a valid progression.

Given the potential oversight in edge case handling and the reliance on unvalidated input, the final determination of correctness is:

Correctness: **False**.

### Reason for Incorrectness:
The program does not handle cases where the input does not meet the expected format effectively, and the logic for determining valid integers to form an arithmetic sequence could fail in certain scenarios, particularly when the differences are not unique or when duplicates exist.
