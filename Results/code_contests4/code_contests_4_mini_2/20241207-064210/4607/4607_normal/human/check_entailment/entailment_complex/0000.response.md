Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program must ensure that it can determine the correct integers that can be added to the sequence of cards to form an arithmetic progression. 

One case where the program fails is when there are two distinct integers in the input list. For example, given the input:

```
2
2 4
```

The expected output should be `3` and the integers `0 3 6`, which can be added to form an arithmetic progression. However, based on the annotations and the logic in `func_17`, the program may not correctly identify and output these integers due to incomplete checks and potential logic errors in handling differences.

Additionally, the annotations indicate that the program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when there are duplicate numbers or when the list has only one number. The annotations suggest that the program might not return the correct results for all potential cases and edge cases outlined in the problem description, leading to the conclusion that the implementation is incomplete or incorrect.

Thus, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, resulting in an overall correctness of **False**.
