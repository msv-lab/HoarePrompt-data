To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variable `n`, which is derived from the return value of `func_1()`. The loop will iterate from 0 to `n - 2`, which means `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute at least once.

Given that `a` is a sorted list and both `g` and `l` are empty lists, these states do not directly influence whether the loop can execute. The critical factor is the value of `n`.

Thus, for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2. We also need to initialize `i` for the first iteration.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time**
