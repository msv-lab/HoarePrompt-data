Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and `g` contains `n - 1` elements representing the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, where `l` is sorted and `a` is a sorted list with at least `n` elements. If the number of unique elements in `g` is 1, `func_18` is executed with the unpacked elements of `l`. If `n` is greater than 2 and all elements in `l` are equal, `func_18(1)` is called; otherwise, `func_18(0)` is called.***
