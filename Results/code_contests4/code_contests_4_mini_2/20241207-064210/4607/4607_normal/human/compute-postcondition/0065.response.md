According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is greater than 2, the loop will execute at least once. The variable `i` will start from 0 in the first iteration of the loop. 

Thus, for the loop to execute the first time, we need to ensure that `i` is initialized to 0. The condition `n > 2` is already satisfied, which means the loop can execute.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 0**
