The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2; `a` has one more element after appending the value calculated as `a[2] + (a[3] - a[2]) // 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
