According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 2, which means `i` can be incremented. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will increase by 1, resulting in `i` being 1. To ensure the loop can execute again, `n` must remain greater than 2 (which it already is) since `i` must still be less than `n - 1`. 

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
