The variable `x` is assigned the value of `a[i] + (a[i + 1] - a[i]) // 2`. The calculation involves the elements at index `i` and `i + 1` of list `a`. 

Given that `n` is greater than 2, we know that accessing `a[i]` and `a[i + 1]` is valid. The specific values of `a[i]` and `a[i + 1]` are not provided, but their difference is not equal to `gc`, which implies that the operation can proceed without issues.

The output state reflects the assignment to `x` based on the calculations mentioned. Therefore, while the exact value of `x` cannot be determined without specific values from list `a`, we can conclude the operation that was performed.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 0, and `x` is assigned the value `a[i] + (a[i + 1] - a[i]) // 2**
