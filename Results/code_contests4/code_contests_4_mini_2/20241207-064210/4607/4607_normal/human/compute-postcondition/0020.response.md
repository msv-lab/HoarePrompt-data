The code executes the `write` method on the `file` object, using the value returned from `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')`. This means that it will attempt to remove the 'end' key from the `kwargs` dictionary and return its value, or if 'end' does not exist, it defaults to `'\n'`. 

The initial state does not directly affect the function of `kwargs` and the `file` object. Therefore, we cannot ascertain any change to `n`, `args`, or `at_start` from this operation. 

The main effect is that a string (either the value of 'end' from `kwargs` or `'\n'`) will be written to `file`. Since there's no specific value provided for `kwargs`, we cannot determine the value that will be written.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of cards, `args` is an iterable containing elements, `file` contains the string representations of all elements in `args`, separated by `sep`, and `at_start` is False. A string has been written to `file` from `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')`.**
