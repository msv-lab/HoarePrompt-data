According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, which makes it 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 3 (since `n - 1` must be greater than `i`, which is now 2).

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 3**
