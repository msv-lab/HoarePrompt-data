According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n - 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 2, which means `n - 1` is at least 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be incremented by 1, leading to `i` being 2. However, since `n` is at least 2, it means that `n - 1` is at least 1, and `n` must be at least 3 for `i` to be less than `n - 2`.

State: **`n` is at least 3; `i` is 2; `g` is updated with the value of `a[i + 1] - a[i]`, `l` is updated with the absolute difference `abs(a[3] - a[2])`.**
