Output State: **`n` is assigned the value returned by `func_1()`, `a` is a sorted list, `g` is an empty list, and the program execution is terminated. If `n` equals 2, `l` is sorted with duplicates removed based on `2 * a[1] - a[0]` and `func_18` is called with the length of `l`. If `n` is not 2, the values remain unchanged.**
