The variable `g` is updated by appending the value of `a[i + 1] - a[i]`. The value of `i` is 2, so we are looking at `a[3] - a[2]`. The initial state mentions that `n` is at least 3, which implies that `a` must have at least 4 elements (indices 0, 1, 2, and 3). The previous values of `g` are updated with the result of this calculation.

The value of `g` is modified to include `a[3] - a[2]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 3; `i` is 2; `g` is updated with the value of `a[3] - a[2]`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3; `i` is 2; `g` is updated with the value of `a[3] - a[2]**
