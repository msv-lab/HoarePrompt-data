According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `args`. If `args` is an iterable and contains at least one element, the loop can execute. The current state indicates that `n` is an integer representing the number of cards, but this does not directly affect the loop execution unless it is used to determine the number of elements in `args`. The variable `at_start` being `True` does not influence the loop execution either.

For the loop to be executed at least once, `args` must be an iterable with at least one element, and `x` will take the first element of that iterable during the first execution of the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of cards, for the loop to execute the first time `args` is an iterable containing at least 1 element, and `x` is the first element in `args`**
