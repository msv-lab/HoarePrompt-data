The function `func_18(0)` is called, which may perform operations based on the provided input but the specific behavior and output of the function are not defined in the provided context. Given the initial state, we know that `n` is a positive integer, `g` contains `n - 1` elements, `l` contains `n - 1` elements, `a` is a sorted list, and there are more than 2 unique elements in `g`. However, since the output of the function is unknown and depends on its internal implementation which isn't provided, we can only state that `func_18(0)` has been called. 

Therefore, the output state will reflect that the function was executed but without any changes to the other variables or values, as the outcome of `func_18` is not specified.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `g` contains `n - 1` elements representing the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `l` contains `n - 1` elements representing the absolute differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `a` is a sorted list with at least `n` elements, and the number of unique elements in `g` is greater than 2; `func_18(0)` has been called.**
