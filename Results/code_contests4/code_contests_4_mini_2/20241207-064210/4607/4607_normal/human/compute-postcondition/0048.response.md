The function `func_18` is called with the argument `len(l)`, which represents the length of the sorted list `l`. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer, so `len(l)` will return a non-negative integer. Other variables `g` and `a` are not directly affected by this function call. Therefore, the output state remains focused on the fact that we are calling a function with the length of `l`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `g` contains `n - 1` elements representing the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `l` is sorted, `a` is a sorted list with at least `n` elements, and the number of unique elements in `g` is 1; `len(l)` has been passed to `func_18`.**
