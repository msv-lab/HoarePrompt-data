Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `g` contains `n - 1` elements representing the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `l` contains `n - 1` elements representing the absolute differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `a` is a sorted list with at least `n` elements, the number of unique elements in `g` is greater than 1. If 0 is an element in `l`, `func_18` has been called with an argument of 0 and the program exits. Otherwise, the program continues executing without any specific action defined for the else case.***
