The state of the variable `a` is affected by the `sort()` method. This method sorts the elements of the list `a` in ascending order. Since `n` is greater than 2, we can infer that `a` may contain multiple elements, but the exact contents of `a` are not specified. The variable `gc` remains unchanged as stated.

After the execution of the sorting operation, the output state reflects the sorted order of `a`, while `n` and `gc` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2; `a` is sorted; `gc` remains unchanged.**
