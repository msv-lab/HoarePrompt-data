The function `func_17` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer constrained such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\). Additionally, the function operates on a sequence of integers on Alexander's cards, represented as a list of positive integers, where each integer does not exceed \(10^8\). The function's output has not been specified in the provided details, so we cannot describe specific return values or behaviors. Therefore, based on the given information, the functionality of the function is to accept an integer `n` and a sequence of integers, but the exact behavior and return value are not detailed.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and a sequence of positive integers (each ≤ 10^8), but the specific return value is not provided.**
