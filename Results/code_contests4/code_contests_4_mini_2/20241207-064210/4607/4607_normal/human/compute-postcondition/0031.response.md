According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop condition `i in range(n - 1)` means that the loop can run as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is at least 2, which means the loop has the potential to execute again. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 1. For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be at least 2, so that `n - 1` is at least 1.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be at least 2**
