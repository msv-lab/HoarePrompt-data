Since the program execution is terminated and there are no changes to `n`, `a`, or `g`, and `l` is initialized as an empty list without further operations affecting it, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables.

Output State: **`n` is assigned the value returned by `func_1()`, `a` is a sorted list, `g` is an empty list, `l` is an empty list.**
