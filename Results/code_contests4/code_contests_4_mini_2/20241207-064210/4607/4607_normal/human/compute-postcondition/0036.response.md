The value of `l` is updated by appending the absolute difference between `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]`. Given that `i` is 2, this means we're calculating `abs(a[3] - a[2])`. The variable `g` has already been updated with the value of `a[3] - a[2]`, but this does not directly affect the operation performed in this line of code. 

Thus, the output state reflects the existing state of the variables and the new operation performed:

Output State: **`n` is at least 3; `i` is 2; `g` is updated with the value of `a[3] - a[2]; `l` is updated by appending abs(a[3] - a[2])**
