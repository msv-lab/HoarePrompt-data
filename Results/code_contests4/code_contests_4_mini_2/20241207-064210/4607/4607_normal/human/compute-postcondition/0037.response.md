To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, let's analyze the provided loop code and its behavior.

Given:

- `n` is assigned the value returned by `func_1()`, which means `n` is a positive integer.
- `a` is a sorted list with at least `n` elements (since the loop runs for `n-1` iterations).
- `g` is an empty list that will store the differences between consecutive elements of `a`.
- `l` is an empty list that will store the absolute differences between consecutive elements of `a`.

The loop iterates `n - 1` times, starting from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2`. In each iteration, the loop calculates the difference between consecutive elements in the sorted list `a`, appending the difference to list `g` and the absolute difference to list `l`.

After all iterations of the loop have executed:
- `g` will contain `n - 1` elements representing the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, specifically `g` will contain values like `a[1] - a[0]`, `a[2] - a[1]`, ..., `a[n-1] - a[n-2]`.
- `l` will also contain `n - 1` elements, which are the absolute values of the differences, but since `a` is sorted, it will simply be the same values as `g` in this case.

In the case where `n` is less than 2, the loop does not execute, and `g` and `l` remain empty.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `g` contains `n - 1` elements representing the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `l` contains `n - 1` elements representing the absolute differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `a` is a sorted list with at least `n` elements.**
