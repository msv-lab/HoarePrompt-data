To analyze the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we can summarize the information as follows:

1. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `len(l) - 1`. This means it will execute for each element in the list `l` starting from the second element (`l[1]`) to the last element (`l[len(l) - 1]`).
2. The variable `gc` is initialized with the value of `l[0]` and is updated in each iteration to the result of `func_14(gc, l[i])` for `i` ranging from 1 to `len(l) - 1`.
3. Since `n` is a positive integer and `g` and `l` contain `n - 1` elements, `len(l)` will be `n - 1`. Thus, the loop will execute `n - 2` times (as `i` starts at 1 and ends at `len(l) - 1`).

After all iterations of the loop have been completed, the following conditions can be confirmed:
- `n` remains greater than 2 (since it's a positive integer).
- `gc` will hold the value resulting from applying `func_14` iteratively on the elements of the list `l` starting from `l[0]` through to `l[len(l) - 1]`.
- The final value of `gc` will be the result after the last execution of `func_14(gc, l[n - 2])`.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop is as follows:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `gc` is assigned the value returned by `func_14` applied cumulatively to the elements of `l` from index 0 to `len(l) - 1`.**
