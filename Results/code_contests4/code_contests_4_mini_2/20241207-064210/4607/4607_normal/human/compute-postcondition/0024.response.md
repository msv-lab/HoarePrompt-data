The function `func_18` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers. The integer `n` represents the number of cards and is constrained to be between 1 and 100,000 (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). The second parameter is a list containing `n` positive integers, each of which does not exceed 100,000,000 (10^8). 

The function's output is not explicitly provided, but we can infer based on the constraints and relationships described. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n representing the number of cards and a list of n positive integers, and it processes this input according to its internal logic.**
