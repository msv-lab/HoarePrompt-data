The code appends the result of `a[i + 1] - a[i]` to the list `l`. The value of `i` is 0, so we refer to `a[1] - a[0]`. Since `n` is greater than 2, it implies that the list `a` has at least 3 elements, allowing us to safely access `a[1]` and `a[0]`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 0, and `l` now has an additional element which is the result of `a[1] - a[0]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 0, `l` has an additional element which is `a[1] - a[0]**
