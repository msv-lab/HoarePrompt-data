Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and a sorted list of positive integers. It processes the list in various ways depending on the value of `n` and the differences between elements. If `n` equals 1, it calls `func_18(-1)` and exits. If `n` equals 2, it checks if the two numbers are equal and either returns 1 and the number if they are the same, or computes potential elements based on their difference. For `n` greater than 2, it computes the differences between consecutive elements in the list and checks the uniqueness of these differences. If there is more than one unique difference, it may return 0. If all differences are equal, it returns 1 and a computed value. If 0 is among the differences and there are at least two unique differences, it calls `func_18(0)` and exits. The function handles various edge cases, including potentially adding new elements to the list based on the differences, and ultimately calls `func_18` with different arguments based on the conditions evaluated. **
