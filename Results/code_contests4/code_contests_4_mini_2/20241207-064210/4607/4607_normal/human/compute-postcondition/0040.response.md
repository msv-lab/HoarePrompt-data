The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. As a result, no variables are modified, and the program stops its execution. Therefore, the output state reflects that no changes occurred due to the execution of the code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `g` contains `n - 1` elements representing the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `l` contains `n - 1` elements representing the absolute differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `a` is a sorted list with at least `n` elements, and the number of unique elements in `g` is greater than 2; the program has been terminated by exit().**
