The code appends the value of `a[-1] + (a[1] - a[0])` to the list `l`. The current state of `l` contains one element which is `2 * a[0] - a[1]`. The elements in the list `a` are sorted and contain at least `n` elements. 

The calculation process is as follows:
1. `a[-1]` refers to the last element of the list `a`.
2. `a[1] - a[0]` calculates the difference between the second and the first elements of `a`.

Since the number of unique elements in `g` is 1, it implies that the differences between consecutive elements of `a` are constant, which means that `a` forms an arithmetic sequence. Thus, we can determine that the value of `a[1] - a[0]` will give a consistent difference.

After executing the code, the list `l` will now contain two elements: the original element `2 * a[0] - a[1]` and the newly calculated value `a[-1] + (a[1] - a[0])`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `g` contains `n - 1` elements representing the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `l` now contains two elements, including the original one and a new value calculated from the last and second elements of `a`, `a` is a sorted list with at least `n` elements, and the number of unique elements in `g` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `g` contains `n - 1` elements representing the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `l` now contains two elements, `a` is a sorted list with at least `n` elements, and the number of unique elements in `g` is 1.**
