The value of `at_start` is assigned to `False`, but it is already `False`. Therefore, the state of the other variables remains unchanged. The previous values of `n`, `args`, `x`, and `file` are still intact as described in the initial state. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of cards, `args` is an iterable containing at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in `args`, `file` contains the string representation of `x` followed by the string representation of `x`, and `at_start` is False.**
