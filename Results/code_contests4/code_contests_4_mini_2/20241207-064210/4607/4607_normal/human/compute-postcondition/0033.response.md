The variable `l` has a method `append` which adds a value to it. The value being added is the absolute difference between `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]`. Given that `i` is 1, we need to consider `a[2]` and `a[1]` for the calculation. Other variables (`n`, `g`) are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2; `i` is 1; `g` is updated with the value of `a[i + 1] - a[i]`; `l` is updated with the absolute difference `abs(a[2] - a[1])`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2; `i` is 1; `g` is updated with the value of `a[i + 1] - a[i]`; `l` is updated with the absolute difference `abs(a[2] - a[1])`.**
