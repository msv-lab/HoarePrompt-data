The code `file.write(sep)` executes a write operation on the `file` object, writing the value of `sep` to it. However, the value of `sep` is not provided in the initial state or the code snippet, so we cannot determine its specific content. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state only describes the action taken.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of cards, `args` is an iterable containing at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in `args`, `file` now contains the string representation of `x`, `at_start` is False, and `sep` is written to the file.**
