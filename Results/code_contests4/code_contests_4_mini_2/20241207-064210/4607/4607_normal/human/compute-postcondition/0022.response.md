The `file.flush()` method is called, which clears the internal buffer of the file `file`, ensuring that all data written to the file is actually written to the underlying storage. The variables `n`, `args`, and `at_start` are not affected by this operation, and their states remain unchanged. The variable `file` is used to perform the flush operation, but its content or state is not altered; it simply ensures that any buffered data is written out.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of cards, `args` is an iterable containing elements, `file` contains the string representations of all elements in `args`, separated by `sep`, and `at_start` is False; the file's buffer has been flushed.**
