The function accepts an integer `x`, an integer `y`, and an integer `p`. It calculates and returns the result of `x` raised to the power of `y` modulo `p` using exponentiation by squaring. The list `y` is not utilized in the computation, which may be a logical error, as it is expected to represent the number of cards. The function does not handle cases where `p` is zero, which would lead to a division by zero error in the modulus operation.
