The function accepts a positive integer `n` entered by the user, which should be within the range of 1 to 100000. However, the function does not handle any invalid input or exceptions that may arise if the input is not an integer or is outside the specified range. Therefore, the actual behavior of the function is to return whatever integer the user inputs without validation, which could lead to unexpected results if the input is invalid.
