The function accepts a list of integers where the first element is a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), followed by `n` positive integers, and returns the list sorted based on the criteria defined in the function `getKey`. The function relies on `getKey` for sorting, which must be defined elsewhere for the function to work as intended. If `getKey` is not defined, a NameError will occur.
