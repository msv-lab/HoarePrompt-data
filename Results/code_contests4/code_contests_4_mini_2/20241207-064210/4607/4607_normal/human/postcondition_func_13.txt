The function accepts an integer `x` representing the number of cards and a list `y` of integers, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the integers in the list `y`. It should be noted that if `y` is empty, the function will result in an infinite loop since the while condition will never be satisfied. Additionally, the return annotation incorrectly states that the program returns the GCD when `y` is currently 0; instead, it actually returns the GCD of the original list of integers in `y`, which is computed before the loop ends.
