The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a list `m` of `n` positive integers, and an integer `num`. It returns a 2D list with `n` inner lists, each containing the integer `num` repeated `m` times. However, the annotations incorrectly describe the output as containing integers from list `m` instead of repeating `num`.
