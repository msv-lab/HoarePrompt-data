The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters and returns a list generated by the function `func_3()`. This list is expected to be based on the processing of a sequence of positive integers, constrained by the conditions that `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and that each integer does not exceed 10^8. However, since the implementation of `func_3()` is not provided, the exact contents of the returned list and any potential edge cases related to its processing cannot be determined.
