The function accepts input from the user, returning it as a string. It does not explicitly validate the input to ensure it is a sequence of integers, nor does it enforce any conditions on the integers regarding their maximum value or positivity. Therefore, it simply collects and returns whatever input is provided as a sequence, regardless of whether it meets the stated conditions.
