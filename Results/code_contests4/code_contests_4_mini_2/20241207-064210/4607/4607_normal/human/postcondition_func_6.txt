The function accepts a tuple `item`, where the first element is an integer `n` (representing the number of cards) and the second element is a list of `n` positive integers. It returns the list of positive integers from the second element of the tuple. This function does not perform any validation on the input tuple or the integers within the list, so if the structure of the tuple is not as expected, it may lead to an error.
