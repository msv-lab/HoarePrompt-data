The function accepts a positive integer `n` and determines if `n` is a prime number. It returns `False` if `n` is less than or equal to 1, returns `True` if `n` is 2 or 3, returns `False` if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3, and then checks for factors of `n` from 5 upwards, incrementing by 6 in each iteration. If any factors are found, it returns `False`. If no factors are found and all checks pass, it returns `True`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.
