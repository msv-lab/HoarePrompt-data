Postcondition: ***`N` and `M` are positive integers; `K` is a positive integer; `A` is a list of integers of length `N`; `B` is a list of integers of length `M`; `n` and `m` are positive integers. If `A[ptr1]` is less than `B[ptr2]` and the sum of `totaltime` and `A[0]` is less than or equal to `K`, then `ptr1` is incremented to 1, `ptr2` remains 0, `totaltime` increases by `A[0]`, `check` remains True, and `count` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ptr1` remains 0, `ptr2` remains 0, `totaltime` is reset to 0, `check` is set to False, and `count` is set to 0. If `A[ptr1]` is not less than `B[ptr2]` and the sum of `totaltime` and `B[ptr2]` is less than or equal to `K`, then `ptr2` is incremented to 1, `totaltime` is updated to include `B[0]`, `check` remains True, and `count` is incremented to 1. Otherwise, `ptr1` remains 0, `ptr2` is reset to 0, `totaltime` is 0, `check` is set to False, `count` is still 0.***
