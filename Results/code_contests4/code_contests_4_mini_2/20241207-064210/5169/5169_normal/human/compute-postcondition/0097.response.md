The variable `check` is assigned the value `False`. The previous states of `ptr1` and `ptr2` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `ptr1` and `ptr2`, along with the new value of `check`.

Output State: **`ptr1` is equal to `n`, `ptr2` is less than `m`, `check` is False**
