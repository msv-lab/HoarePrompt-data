Functionality: ** The function accepts two lists of positive integers representing reading times for books on Desk A and Desk B, a time limit K, and counts how many books can be read from both desks without exceeding the time limit. It attempts to read the books in order of their reading times, prioritizing the shorter reading time first. If the total reading time exceeds K, the function stops counting and prints the number of books read up to that point. If it can read all the books from one desk without exceeding K, it then attempts to read the remaining books from the other desk. The function outputs the total count of books read from both desks. **
