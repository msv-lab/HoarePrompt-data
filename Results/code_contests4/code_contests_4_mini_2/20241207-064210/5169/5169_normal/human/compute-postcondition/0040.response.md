Postcondition: ***`N` and `M` are positive integers; `K` is a positive integer; `A` is a list of integers of length `N`; `B` is a list of integers of length `M`; `n` and `m` are positive integers; if `totaltime + b[ptr2]` is less than or equal to `K`, then `totaltime` is increased by `b[ptr2]`, `count` is increased by 1, and `ptr2` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `check` is set to False, and other variables remain unchanged, with `ptr1` remaining less than `n` and `ptr2` remaining less than `m`, breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
