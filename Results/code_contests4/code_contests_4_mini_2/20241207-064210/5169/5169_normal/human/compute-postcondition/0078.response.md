The value of `count` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `count` is unknown. The other variables, `ptr1` and `totaltime`, are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `ptr1` is an integer less than `n`; `totaltime` is updated to `totaltime + a[ptr1]`; `count` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`ptr1` is an integer less than `n`; `totaltime` is updated to `totaltime + a[ptr1]`; `count` is increased by 1**
