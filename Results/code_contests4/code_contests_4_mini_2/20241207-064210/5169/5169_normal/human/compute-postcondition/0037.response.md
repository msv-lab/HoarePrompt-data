The value of `ptr2` is incremented by 1. The previous state indicates that `ptr2` is less than `m`, and therefore its new value will be one more than its previous value. The other variables, `totaltime` and `count`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `totaltime` is increased by `b[ptr2]`, where `ptr2` is less than `m`; `count` is increased by 1; `ptr2` is now incremented by 1.

Output State: **`totaltime` is increased by `b[ptr2]`, where `ptr2` is less than `m`; `count` is increased by 1; `ptr2` is now incremented by 1.**
