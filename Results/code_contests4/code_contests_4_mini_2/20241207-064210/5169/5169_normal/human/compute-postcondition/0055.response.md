Postcondition: ***`N` and `M` are positive integers; `K` is a positive integer; `A` is a list of integers of length `N`; `B` is a list of integers of length `M`; if `A[ptr1]` is less than `B[ptr2]` and `totaltime + A[ptr1]` is less than or equal to `K`, then `ptr1` is incremented by 1, `totaltime` is increased by the value of `A[ptr1 - 1]`, and `count` is increased by 1. If `A[ptr1]` is less than `B[ptr2]` but `totaltime + A[ptr1]` exceeds `K`, `check` is set to False. Otherwise, if `A[ptr1]` is not less than `B[ptr2]` and `totaltime + B[ptr2]` is less than or equal to `K`, then `ptr2` is incremented by 1, `totaltime` is increased by `B[ptr2]`, and `count` is increased by 1. If `A[ptr1]` is not less than `B[ptr2]` but `totaltime + B[ptr2]` exceeds `K`, `check` is set to False.***
