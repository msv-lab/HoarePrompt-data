The function `func_22` accepts the following parameters: 

- `N`: a positive integer representing the number of books on Desk A.
- `M`: a positive integer representing the number of books on Desk B.
- `K`: a positive integer representing the maximum time available in minutes.
- `A`: a list of integers of length `N`, where each value represents the reading time for the books on Desk A. All values in `A` are positive integers.
- `B`: a list of integers of length `M`, where each value represents the reading time for the books on Desk B. All values in `B` are positive integers.

The function evaluates the combinations of books from Desk A and Desk B to determine if they can be read within the available time `K`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters N, M, K, A, and B, and determines combinations of reading times from lists A and B that can be completed within the time limit K.**
