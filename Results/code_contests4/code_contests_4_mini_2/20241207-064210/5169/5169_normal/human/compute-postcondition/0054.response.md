Postcondition: ***`N` and `M` are positive integers; `K` is a positive integer; `A` is a list of integers of length `N`; `B` is a list of integers of length `M`; `ptr1` is less than `N`; if `totaltime + b[ptr2]` is less than or equal to `K`, then `ptr2` is incremented by 1, `totaltime` is increased by `b[ptr2]`, and `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `check` is set to False and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
