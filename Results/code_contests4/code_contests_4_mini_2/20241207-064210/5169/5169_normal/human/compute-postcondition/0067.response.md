Output State: **`ptr1` is less than `n`, `totaltime` is the sum of the selected elements from lists `A` and `B` that do not exceed `K`, `count` is the total number of elements from lists `A` and `B` that have been added to `totaltime`, `check` is False, `totaltime + a[ptr1]` is greater than `k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
