The value of `totaltime` is incremented by `a[ptr1]`. Since `ptr1` is an integer less than `n`, and the condition for the loop to execute again is that `totaltime + a[ptr1]` must be less than or equal to `K`, this means that `totaltime` will now be updated to its previous value plus the value at index `ptr1` of the array `a`. Other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`ptr1` is an integer less than `n`; `totaltime` is updated to `totaltime + a[ptr1]`**.
