Postcondition: ***`ptr1` is equal to `n` and `ptr2` is less than `m`. If `totaltime + b[ptr2]` is less than or equal to `k`, then `ptr2` is incremented by 1, `totaltime` is increased by `b[ptr2]`, and `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `check` is set to False, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
