Output State: **`N` and `M` are positive integers; `K` is a positive integer; `A` is a list of integers of length `N`; `B` is a list of integers of length `M`; `n` and `m` are positive integers; `ptr1` is 0; `ptr2` is 0; `totaltime` is the previous value plus the element at `B[ptr2]`; `check` is True; `count` is 1; the element at index `ptr1` of list `A` is greater than or equal to the element at index `ptr2` of list `B`; and the sum of `totaltime` and the element at index `ptr2` of list `B` is less than or equal to `K.**
