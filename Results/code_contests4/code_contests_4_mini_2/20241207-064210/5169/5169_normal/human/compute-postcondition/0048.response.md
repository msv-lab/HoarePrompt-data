Postcondition: ***`N` and `M` are positive integers; `K` is a positive integer; `A` is a list of integers of length `N`; `B` is a list of integers of length `M`; if `totaltime + A[ptr1]` is less than or equal to `K`, then `ptr1` is incremented by 1, `totaltime` is increased by the value of `A[ptr1 - 1]`, and `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `check` is set to False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
