The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop that we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `ptr1` is less than `n`, for the loop to execute again `totaltime + a[ptr1]` is less than or equal to K; `check` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
