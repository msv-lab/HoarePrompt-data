To determine whether the `while` loop can execute, we need to analyze the condition `ptr2 < m`. For the loop to execute at least once, the value of `ptr2` must be less than `m`.

The provided state indicates that `ptr1` is equal to `n`, but there is no mention of `ptr2` or `m`. Therefore, we cannot ascertain whether `ptr2` is currently less than `m`. If `ptr2` is already equal to or greater than `m`, the loop will not execute.

To ensure that the loop can execute, we need to establish a condition that guarantees `ptr2 < m`. If we assume that `ptr2` is initialized to a value less than `m`, we can proceed. However, since we don't have an explicit value for `ptr2` or `m`, we must consider the general adjustment that can guarantee the loop's execution.

Thus, we can modify the state as follows:

State: **`ptr1` is equal to `n`, for the loop to execute the first time then `ptr2` must be less than `m`**
