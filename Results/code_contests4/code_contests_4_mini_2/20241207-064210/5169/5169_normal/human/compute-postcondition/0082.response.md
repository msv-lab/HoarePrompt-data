Postcondition: ***`ptr1` is an integer less than `n`. If `totaltime + a[ptr1]` is less than or equal to `K`, then `totaltime` is updated to `totaltime + a[previous ptr1]`, and `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ptr1` remains an integer less than `n`, `check` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
