Output State: **`N` and `M` are positive integers; `K` is a positive integer; `A` is a list of integers of length `N`; `B` is a list of integers of length `M`; `n` and `m` are positive integers; `ptr1` is 0; `ptr2` is 0; `totaltime` is the previous value of `totaltime` plus the first element of `A` at index `ptr1`; `check` is True; `count` is 0; the value of the first element of `A` at index `ptr1` is less than the value of the first element of `B` at index `ptr2`; and the sum of `totaltime` and the first element of `A` at index `ptr1` is less than or equal to `K`.**
