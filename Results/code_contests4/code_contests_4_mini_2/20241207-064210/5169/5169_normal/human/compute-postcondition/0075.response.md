Postcondition: ***`ptr1` is an integer less than `n`. If `totaltime + a[ptr1]` is less than or equal to `K`, then `ptr1` is increased by 1, `totaltime` is increased by `a[ptr1]`, and `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `ptr1` is still less than `n` and the loop can execute again, `check` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
