Postcondition: ***`N` and `M` are positive integers; `K` is a positive integer; `A` is a list of integers of length `N`; `B` is a list of integers of length `M`; `n` and `m` are positive integers. If the sum of `totaltime` and the first element of `A` at index 0 is less than or equal to `K`, then `ptr1` is incremented to 1, `ptr2` remains 0, `totaltime` increases by the value of `A[0]`, `check` remains True, and `count` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ptr1` remains 0, `ptr2` remains 0, `totaltime` is reset to 0, `check` is set to False, and `count` is set to 0, with the condition that the sum of `totaltime` and the value of `A[ptr1]` exceeds `K`, leading to a break from the most internal loop or if statement.***
