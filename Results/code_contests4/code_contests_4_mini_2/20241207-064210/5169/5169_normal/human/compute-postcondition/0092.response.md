Postcondition: ***`ptr1` is equal to `n`, `ptr2` is less than `m`. If the sum of `totaltime` and `b[ptr2]` is less than or equal to `k`, then `totaltime` is increased by `b[ptr2]`, `count` is increased by 1, and `ptr2` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `check` is set to False and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
