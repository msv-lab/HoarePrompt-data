The variable `check` is assigned the value `False`. The initial states of `ptr1` and `ptr2` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `ptr1` is equal to `n`, `ptr2` is less than `m`, and `check` is False.

Output State: **`ptr1` is equal to `n`, `ptr2` is less than `m`, and `check` is False**
