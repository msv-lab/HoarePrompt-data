Postcondition: ***`ptr1` is less than `n`. If `totaltime + a[ptr1]` is less than or equal to `K`, then `ptr1` is increased by 1, `totaltime` remains the sum of the selected elements from lists `A` and `B` that do not exceed `K`, `count` is increased by 1, and `check` is True. Otherwise, `check` is False, and `totaltime + a[ptr1]` is greater than `K`, leading to a break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
