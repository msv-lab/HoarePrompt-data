`ptr2` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ptr2` is less than `m`, so after execution, `ptr2` will now be equal to its previous value plus 1. The other variables (`ptr1`, `totaltime`, and `count`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ptr1` is equal to `n`, `ptr2` is now incremented by 1 (which is still less than `m`), `totaltime` is increased by `b[ptr2]`, and `count` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`ptr1` is equal to `n`, `ptr2` is now incremented by 1 (which is still less than `m`), `totaltime` is increased by `b[ptr2]`, and `count` is increased by 1.**
