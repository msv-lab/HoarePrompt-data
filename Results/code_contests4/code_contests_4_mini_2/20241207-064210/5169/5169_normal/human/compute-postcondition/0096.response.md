The value of `ptr2` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `ptr2` is unknown as it is only stated that it is less than `m`. The values of `ptr1`, `totaltime`, and `count` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ptr1` is equal to `n`, `ptr2` is now one greater than its previous value, `totaltime` is increased by `b[ptr2]`, and `count` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`ptr1` is equal to `n`, `ptr2` is now one greater than its previous value, `totaltime` is increased by `b[ptr2]`, `count` is increased by 1**
