Postcondition: ***`N` and `M` are positive integers; `K` is a positive integer; `A` is a list of integers of length `N`; `B` is a list of integers of length `M`; if `a[ptr1] < b[ptr2]`, `totaltime` is increased by `A[ptr1]` if `totaltime + A[ptr1]` is less than or equal to `K`, and `count` is increased by 1 with `ptr1` incremented by 1. If the condition is not met, `check` is set to False. Otherwise, if `totaltime + b[ptr2]` is less than or equal to `K`, then `totaltime` is increased by `b[ptr2]`, `count` is increased by 1, and `ptr2` is incremented by 1. If this condition is not met, `check` is set to False, and `ptr1` and `ptr2` remain unchanged, with both pointers still less than their respective limits `n` and `m`.***
