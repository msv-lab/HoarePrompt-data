The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `check` is set to False; other variables remain unchanged: `N` and `M` are positive integers; `K` is a positive integer; `A` is a list of integers of length `N`; `B` is a list of integers of length `M`; `n` and `m` are positive integers; `ptr1` is less than `n` and `ptr2` is less than `m`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
