The variable `check` is assigned the value `False`. The previous value of `check` was `True`, and the other variables (`ptr1`, `totaltime`, `count`, `K`, and the elements of lists `A` and `B`) remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State reflects the updated value of `check` while maintaining the previous states of the other variables.

Output State: **`ptr1` is less than `n`, `totaltime` is the sum of the selected elements from lists `A` and `B` that do not exceed `K`, `count` is the total number of elements from lists `A` and `B` that have been added to `totaltime`, `check` is False, and the value of `totaltime + a[ptr1]` is greater than `k`.**
