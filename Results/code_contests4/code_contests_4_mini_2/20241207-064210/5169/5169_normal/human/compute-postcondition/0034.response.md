Postcondition: ***`N` and `M` are positive integers; `K` is a positive integer; `A` is a list of integers of length `N`; `B` is a list of integers of length `M`; `totaltime` is increased by `A[ptr1]` if `totaltime + A[ptr1]` is less than or equal to `K`, while `count` is increased by 1 and `ptr1` is incremented by 1. If the condition is not met, `check` is set to False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
