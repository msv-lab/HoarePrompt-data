Postcondition: ***`ptr1` is equal to `n` or `ptr2` is equal to `m`. If `check` is False, it indicates that the loop exited due to exceeding `K`, and the `totaltime` is the sum of the selected elements from lists `A` and `B` that do not exceed `K`, with `count` being the total number of elements from both lists that were added to `totaltime`, and the value of `count` has been printed. If `check` is True, then `ptr1` is equal to `n`, `ptr2` is equal to `m` (if all elements in `b` were added to `totaltime` without exceeding `K`), or `ptr2` is less than `m`. In this case, `check` is False, `totaltime` is the sum of the elements added from `b` that do not exceed `K`, and `count` is the total number of elements from `b` that have been added to `totaltime`, with `count` also being printed.***
