The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` and `M` are positive integers; `K` is a positive integer; `A` is a list of integers of length `N`; `B` is a list of integers of length `M`; `n` and `m` are positive integers; `ptr1` is 0; `ptr2` is 0; `totaltime` is 0; `check` is False; `count` is 0; the value of the first element of `A` at index `ptr1` is less than the value of the first element of `B` at index `ptr2`; the sum of `totaltime` and the value of `A[ptr1]` is greater than `K` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
