The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` and `M` are positive integers; `K` is a positive integer; `A` is a list of integers of length `N`; `B` is a list of integers of length `M`; `n` and `m` are positive integers; `ptr1` is 0; `ptr2` is 0; `totaltime` is 0; `check` is False; `count` is 0; the element at index `ptr1` of list `A` is greater than or equal to the element at index `ptr2` of list `B`; and the sum of `totaltime` and the element at index `ptr2` of list `B` is greater than `K`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
