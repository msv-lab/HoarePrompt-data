You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those output hints describes certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: We have two desks: A and B. Desk A has a vertical stack of N books on it, and Desk B similarly has M books on it.

It takes us A_i minutes to read the i-th book from the top on Desk A (1 \leq i \leq N), and B_i minutes to read the i-th book from the top on Desk B (1 \leq i \leq M).

Consider the following action:

* Choose a desk with a book remaining, read the topmost book on that desk, and remove it from the desk.



How many books can we read at most by repeating this action so that it takes us at most K minutes in total? We ignore the time it takes to do anything other than reading.

Constraints

* 1 \leq N, M \leq 200000
* 1 \leq K \leq 10^9
* 1 \leq A_i, B_i \leq 10^9
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N M K
A_1 A_2 \ldots A_N
B_1 B_2 \ldots B_M


Output

Print an integer representing the maximum number of books that can be read.

Functions with output description for each function:
Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(mod=mod):
    """ returns two lists, factorial and inverse factorial modulo argument by default 10**9 +7 """
    fact = [1]
    for i in range(1, 200005):
        fact.append(fact[-1] * i % mod)
    ifact = [0] * 200005
    ifact[200004] = pow(fact[200004], mod - 2, mod)
    for i in range(200004, 0, -1):
        ifact[i - 1] = i * ifact[i] % mod
    return (fact, ifact)
''' 

 Output decription for function1:  The function accepts a positive integer `mod` and returns two lists: `fact`, which contains the factorials of all integers from 0 to 200004 computed modulo `mod`, and `ifact`, which contains the modular inverses of those factorials. The function does not handle cases where `mod` is not a positive integer, but it assumes that it will be provided a valid positive integer as input.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(n, p):
    """ returns N inverse modulo p """
    return pow(n, p - 2, p)
''' 

 Output decription for function2:  The function accepts an integer `n`, which is the first element of a tuple, and a tuple `p` containing two lists of integers. It calculates and returns the value of `n` raised to the power of `(p - 2) modulo p`, effectively returning the modular inverse of `n` with respect to `p`. The function does not account for cases where `n` is zero or `p` is less than or equal to `n`, which could lead to undefined behavior in modular arithmetic.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(n, r, fact, ifact):
    """ takes 4 arguments: n , r and factorial and inverse factorial lists"""
    t = fact[n] * (ifact[r] * ifact[n - r]) % MOD % MOD
    return t
''' 

 Output decription for function3:  The function accepts two non-negative integers `n` and `r`, along with two lists of integers `fact` and `ifact`, and returns the value of `t`, which is calculated as \((fact[n] \times (ifact[r] \times ifact[n - r]) \mod MOD) \mod MOD\). The function assumes that `n` is greater than or equal to `r` to avoid index errors when accessing `ifact[n - r]`. If `n` is less than `r`, it could result in an IndexError.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(Sum):
    """this function returns the maximum n for which Summation(n) <= Sum"""
    ans = (-1 + sqrt(1 + 8 * Sum)) // 2
    return ans
''' 

 Output decription for function4:  The function accepts a tuple `Sum` containing three elements: the number of books on Desk A (`N`), the number of books on Desk B (`M`), and the maximum allowed reading time in minutes (`K`). It calculates and returns the maximum integer `n` such that the summation of the first `n` natural numbers does not exceed `K`, using the formula `(-1 + sqrt(1 + 8 * K)) // 2`. The function does not utilize the values of `N` or `M` in its calculations.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5(n):
    """ returns a list of prime numbers till n """
    if n < 2:
        return list()
    prime = [True for _ in range(n + 1)]

    r = [2]
    for p in range(3, n + 1, 2):
        if prime[p]:
            r.append(p)
    return r
''' 

 Output decription for function5:  The function accepts a tuple `n` containing integers N, M, K, and two lists of integers. It returns an empty list if N is less than 2. If N is 2 or greater, it returns a list of all prime numbers from 2 up to N. However, the logic for handling N being less than 2 is not consistent with the annotations, as the function should return an empty list for any N less than 2, not just 9. Additionally, it does not handle cases where N is 1. The function should also include 2 as a valid prime number in its results.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6(n, start=1):
    """ returns a list of all divisors till n """
    divisors = []
    for i in range(start, int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)):
        if n % i == 0:
            if n / i == i:
                divisors.append(i)
            else:
                divisors.extend([i, n // i])
    return divisors
''' 

 Output decription for function6:  The function accepts two positive integers, `n` and `start`, and returns a list of all positive divisors of `n` starting from the integer `start`. If `start` is greater than the square root of `n`, the function will return an empty list since it will not find any divisors in that range. The list contains each divisor found, including both the divisor and its complementary divisor unless they are the same (in the case of perfect squares).
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7(n, primes):
    """ returns the number of divisors, two arguments n and the sieve till n """
    divs_number = 1
    for i in primes:
        if n == 1:

        t = 1
        while n % i == 0:
            t += 1
            n //= i
        divs_number *= t
''' 

 Output decription for function7:  The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of integers `primes`, and returns the total number of divisors of `n` calculated via its prime factorization. If `n` is 1, the function immediately returns 1. If `n` is greater than 1 and not divisible by any primes in the list, it returns the value of `divs_number`, which represents the product of the counts of each prime factor in `n`, indicating the total number of divisors including 1. It does not account for cases where `n` could be a prime number itself, returning an inaccurate divisor count in such scenarios.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(d, x, default=-1):
    """ Takes 2 arguments an iterable and an element. returns a tuple (firstoccurence,lastoccurence) -1 if not found """

            right = i
    if left == -1:
        return (default, default)
    else:
        return (left, right)
''' 

 Output decription for function8:  The function accepts a list of integers `d`, a non-negative integer `x`, and a value `default`. It returns a tuple containing `default` twice if `x` is not found in the list `d`. If `x` is found, it returns a tuple with the indices of the first and last occurrences of `x` in the list `d`. If `d` is empty or `x` is not present, it returns `default` for both indices.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9(x, y):
    """ returns greatest common divisor of x and y """
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
''' 

 Output decription for function9:  The function accepts a tuple `x` containing three integers and a tuple `y` containing two lists of integers A and B. It calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the elements in these lists. However, the implementation does not actually compute the GCD of the elements in lists A and B; it only returns the input value `x` as the GCD without processing the values of A and B. Therefore, it does not fulfill its intended purpose as described.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10(a):
    """ returns True/False """
    for i in range(len(a) - 1):
        if a[i] > a[i + 1]:
            return False
    return True
''' 

 Output decription for function10:  The function accepts a tuple `a` containing three elements: the number of books on desk A (N), the number of books on desk B (M), and the total available reading time in minutes (K). It also expects two lists of integers representing the reading times for each book on desks A and B, respectively. The function checks if the reading times in the list `a` are in non-decreasing order. If they are, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False. Notably, the function does not utilize the reading times for desks A and B, nor does it consider the reading time limit (K) in its logic.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11(n, k=1):
    return n // k + (n % k != 0)
''' 

 Output decription for function11:  The function accepts two non-negative integers, `n` (representing the total number of books) and `k` (representing the maximum allowed reading time in minutes). It calculates and returns the number of complete reading sessions possible with the total number of books given the maximum allowed reading time. If there are leftover books that do not fill a complete session, it adds an additional session for them. In cases where `k` is 0, the function would return infinity since dividing by zero is not handled, which should be noted as a potential edge case.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
''' 

 Output decription for function12:  The function does not accept any parameters and returns a string input read from standard input, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace. It does not handle any potential errors that may arise from reading input (e.g., EOFError) or from input being empty.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13():
    return int(func_12())
''' 

 Output decription for function13:  The function accepts no parameters and returns an integer value produced by the function `func_12()`, which operates based on the lists `A` and `B`, and the integers `N`, `M`, and `K`.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14():
    return map(int, func_12().split())
''' 

 Output decription for function14:  The function accepts no parameters and returns a map object containing integers, which are the result of converting the split output of the function `func_12()` into integers. It is important to note that the actual data type returned is a map object and not a list, meaning it may need to be explicitly converted to a list if that format is required for further use.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15():
    return list(map(int, func_12().split()))
''' 

 Output decription for function15:  The function accepts no parameters and returns a list of integers, which are obtained by splitting the string output of the `func_12()` function and converting each split element to an integer.
Function number 16 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_16():
    return func_12().split()
''' 

 Output decription for function16:  The function accepts no parameters and returns a list of strings obtained by splitting the result of the function `func_12()`.
Function number 17 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_17(a, b):
    return abs(a * b) // func_9(a, b)
''' 

 Output decription for function17:  The function accepts a tuple `a` containing three integers (N, M, K) and a tuple `b` containing two lists of integers, representing the reading times for books on Desk A and Desk B. It computes the absolute value of the product of the elements in tuple `a` and tuple `b`, and divides this product by the result of another function `func_9` that also takes `a` and `b` as arguments. However, the function does not explicitly handle potential division by zero errors from the `func_9` output, which could lead to runtime errors if `func_9` returns zero.
Function number 18 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_18(a, sep=' ', end='\n'):
    print(sep.join(map(str, a)), end=end)
''' 

 Output decription for function18:  The function accepts a string `a` containing space-separated integers, a string `sep` for output separation, and a string `end` for output termination. It prints the elements of `a` joined by the separator `sep`, followed by the termination string `end`. The function does not return a formatted string; it directly prints the output instead.
Function number 19 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_19():
    return defaultdict(int)
''' 

 Output decription for function19:  The function accepts no parameters and returns a defaultdict of type int, which is a dictionary that defaults to 0 for any key that is accessed but not yet set. It does not utilize the parameters N, M, K, A, or B as described in the annotations.
Function number 20 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_20():
    return defaultdict(list)
''' 

 Output decription for function20:  The function accepts no parameters and returns an empty defaultdict of lists, which can be used to group items based on keys, but does not perform any specific grouping or initialization of contents.
Function number 21 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_21(s):
    return sys.stdout.write(s)
''' 

 Output decription for function21:  The function accepts a string `s` containing structured data with the first line including three integers N, M, and K, followed by two lines of integers. It writes the same string `s` to the standard output but does not return it as an output value; instead, the output is sent directly to the console or standard output stream.

 Output decription for function22:  The function accepts two lists of positive integers representing reading times for books on Desk A and Desk B, a time limit K, and counts how many books can be read from both desks without exceeding the time limit. It attempts to read the books in order of their reading times, prioritizing the shorter reading time first. If the total reading time exceeds K, the function stops counting and prints the number of books read up to that point. If it can read all the books from one desk without exceeding K, it then attempts to read the remaining books from the other desk. The function outputs the total count of books read from both desks.



First I want you to try to see if the program (including all the functions) does what the description says. Look at only the code and the description and make an initial assesment.Try to think of any edge cases that the code might not be handling.

Then I want you to see if the output hints agree with the code. Sometimes the output hints hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the output hints says are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to make a more informed decision and detrmine if the code is correct or not.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code.
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
