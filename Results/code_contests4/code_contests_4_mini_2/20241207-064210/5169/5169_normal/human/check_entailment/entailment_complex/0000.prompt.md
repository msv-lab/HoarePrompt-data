You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: We have two desks: A and B. Desk A has a vertical stack of N books on it, and Desk B similarly has M books on it.

It takes us A_i minutes to read the i-th book from the top on Desk A (1 \leq i \leq N), and B_i minutes to read the i-th book from the top on Desk B (1 \leq i \leq M).

Consider the following action:

* Choose a desk with a book remaining, read the topmost book on that desk, and remove it from the desk.



How many books can we read at most by repeating this action so that it takes us at most K minutes in total? We ignore the time it takes to do anything other than reading.

Constraints

* 1 \leq N, M \leq 200000
* 1 \leq K \leq 10^9
* 1 \leq A_i, B_i \leq 10^9
* All values in input are integers.

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N M K
A_1 A_2 \ldots A_N
B_1 B_2 \ldots B_M

Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N and M are positive integers representing the number of books on Desk A and Desk B respectively, K is a positive integer representing the maximum time allowed for reading, A is a list of integers where each integer represents the reading time for each book on Desk A, and B is a list of integers where each integer represents the reading time for each book on Desk B. The lengths of A and B are equal to N and M respectively. All reading times in A and B are positive integers.
def func_1(mod):
    """ returns two lists, factorial and inverse factorial modulo argument by default 10**9 +7 """
    fact = [1]

        fact.append(fact[-1] * i % mod)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `fact` is a list containing factorials of all integers from 0 to 200004, each computed modulo `mod`.
    ifact = [0] * 200005
    ifact[200004] = pow(fact[200004], mod - 2, mod)
    for i in range(200004, 0, -1):
        ifact[i - 1] = i * ifact[i] % mod
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `fact` is a list containing factorials of all integers from 0 to 200004 modulo `mod`; `ifact` is a list containing the modular inverses of the factorials of all integers from 0 to 200004; `i` is 0.
    return fact, ifact
    #The program returns the list 'fact' containing factorials of all integers from 0 to 200004 modulo 'mod', and the list 'ifact' containing the modular inverses of the factorials of all integers from 0 to 200004.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `mod` and returns two lists: `fact`, which contains the factorials of all integers from 0 to 200004 computed modulo `mod`, and `ifact`, which contains the modular inverses of those factorials. The function does not handle cases where `mod` is not a positive integer, but it assumes that it will be provided a valid positive integer as input.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a tuple containing three integers N, M, and K, where 1 <= N, M <= 200000 and 1 <= K <= 10^9; p is a tuple of two lists of integers A and B, where A contains N positive integers representing the reading times for the books on Desk A and B contains M positive integers representing the reading times for the books on Desk B. Each value in A and B is between 1 and 10^9.
def func_2(n, p):
    """ returns N inverse modulo p """
    return pow(n, p - 2, p)
    #The program returns the value of n raised to the power of (p - 2) modulo p, which is the inverse of n modulo p
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n`, which is the first element of a tuple, and a tuple `p` containing two lists of integers. It calculates and returns the value of `n` raised to the power of `(p - 2) modulo p`, effectively returning the modular inverse of `n` with respect to `p`. The function does not account for cases where `n` is zero or `p` is less than or equal to `n`, which could lead to undefined behavior in modular arithmetic.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer representing the number of books on Desk A, r is a non-negative integer representing the number of books on Desk B, and fact and ifact are lists of integers representing the reading times for the books on each desk, where both lists have lengths n and r respectively, and all reading times are positive integers.

    return t
    #The program returns the value of t, which is calculated as (fact[n] * (ifact[r] * ifact[n - r]) % MOD) % MOD.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two non-negative integers `n` and `r`, along with two lists of integers `fact` and `ifact`, and returns the value of `t`, which is calculated as \((fact[n] \times (ifact[r] \times ifact[n - r]) \mod MOD) \mod MOD\). The function assumes that `n` is greater than or equal to `r` to avoid index errors when accessing `ifact[n - r]`. If `n` is less than `r`, it could result in an IndexError.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Sum is a tuple containing three elements: N (the number of books on Desk A), M (the number of books on Desk B), and K (the maximum allowed reading time in minutes), where 1 <= N, M <= 200000 and 1 <= K <= 10^9. The second element of the tuple is a list of N integers representing the reading times for each book on Desk A, and the third element is a list of M integers representing the reading times for each book on Desk B, with each reading time being a positive integer up to 10^9.
def func_4(Sum):
    """this function returns the maximum n for which Summation(n) <= Sum"""
    ans = (-1 + sqrt(1 + 8 * Sum)) // 2
    return ans
    #The program returns the value of ans, which is calculated as (-1 + sqrt(1 + 8 * K)) // 2, where K is the maximum allowed reading time in minutes.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `Sum` containing three elements: the number of books on Desk A (`N`), the number of books on Desk B (`M`), and the maximum allowed reading time in minutes (`K`). It calculates and returns the maximum integer `n` such that the summation of the first `n` natural numbers does not exceed `K`, using the formula `(-1 + sqrt(1 + 8 * K)) // 2`. The function does not utilize the values of `N` or `M` in its calculations.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a tuple containing three elements: the first element is an integer N (1 <= N <= 200000), the second element is an integer M (1 <= M <= 200000), and the third element is an integer K (1 <= K <= 10^9). The fourth element is a list of N integers representing the reading times A_i (1 <= A_i <= 10^9), and the fifth element is a list of M integers representing the reading times B_i (1 <= B_i <= 10^9).

    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is a tuple containing N (where N is greater than or equal to 9), M, K, a list of N integers representing the reading times A_i, and a list of M integers representing the reading times B_i; `prime` is a list of boolean values indicating the primality of indices from 0 to N; `p` is greater than the square root of N, specifically increased by 2 for each iteration until the condition `p * p <= n` is no longer satisfied.

    return r
    #The program returns the list 'r' containing all prime numbers from 3 up to N, where N is greater than or equal to 9.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `n` containing integers N, M, K, and two lists of integers. It returns an empty list if N is less than 2. If N is 2 or greater, it returns a list of all prime numbers from 2 up to N. However, the logic for handling N being less than 2 is not consistent with the annotations, as the function should return an empty list for any N less than 2, not just 9. Additionally, it does not handle cases where N is 1. The function should also include 2 as a valid prime number in its results.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the total number of books on Desk A and Desk B, and start is a positive integer starting from 1.
def func_6(n, start):

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `start` is 1, and `divisors` is a list containing all positive divisors of `n`.
    return divisors
    #The program returns the list containing all positive divisors of the positive integer n
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers, `n` and `start`, and returns a list of all positive divisors of `n` starting from the integer `start`. If `start` is greater than the square root of `n`, the function will return an empty list since it will not find any divisors in that range. The list contains each divisor found, including both the divisor and its complementary divisor unless they are the same (in the case of perfect squares).

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of books on desk A and primes is a list of integers representing the reading times for each book on both desks, where the first N values correspond to desk A and the next M values correspond to desk B. The total number of books (N + M) is less than or equal to 400,000.

    divs_number = 1

        t = 1

            n //= i
        
        divs_number *= t
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1 that is not divisible by any primes in the list, `divs_number` is the product of the counts of each prime factor in `n`, `primes` is a list of integers representing the primes, `i` is the last integer processed in the primes list, and `t` is 1 for the last prime as it did not divide `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of integers `primes`, and returns the total number of divisors of `n` calculated via its prime factorization. If `n` is 1, the function immediately returns 1. If `n` is greater than 1 and not divisible by any primes in the list, it returns the value of `divs_number`, which represents the product of the counts of each prime factor in `n`, indicating the total number of divisors including 1. It does not account for cases where `n` could be a prime number itself, returning an inaccurate divisor count in such scenarios.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a list of integers representing the reading times for books on two desks, with the first N elements being the reading times for Desk A and the next M elements for Desk B; x is a non-negative integer representing the maximum total reading time K, where 1 <= N, M <= 200000 and 1 <= K <= 10^9.
def func_8(d, x, default):

    if (left == -1) :
        return default, default
        #The program returns the values 'default' and 'default'
    else :
        return left, right
        #The program returns the indices left and right, where left is the index of the first occurrence of x in list d and right is the index of the last occurrence of x in list d.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `d`, a non-negative integer `x`, and a value `default`. It returns a tuple containing `default` twice if `x` is not found in the list `d`. If `x` is found, it returns a tuple with the indices of the first and last occurrences of `x` in the list `d`. If `d` is empty or `x` is not present, it returns `default` for both indices.

#Function 9:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a tuple containing three integers N, M, and K where 1 <= N, M <= 200000 and 1 <= K <= 10^9; y is a tuple containing two lists of integers A and B where A has N integers (1 <= A_i <= 10^9) and B has M integers (1 <= B_i <= 10^9).

    return x
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor 'x' of the elements in lists A and B contained in tuple 'y'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `x` containing three integers and a tuple `y` containing two lists of integers A and B. It calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the elements in these lists. However, the implementation does not actually compute the GCD of the elements in lists A and B; it only returns the input value `x` as the GCD without processing the values of A and B. Therefore, it does not fulfill its intended purpose as described.

#Function 10:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a tuple containing three elements: N (an integer representing the number of books on desk A), M (an integer representing the number of books on desk B), and K (a non-negative integer representing the total available reading time in minutes), followed by two lists of integers A and B representing the reading times for each book on desks A and B, respectively, where the lengths of A and B are N and M.

    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `a` containing three elements: the number of books on desk A (N), the number of books on desk B (M), and the total available reading time in minutes (K). It also expects two lists of integers representing the reading times for each book on desks A and B, respectively. The function checks if the reading times in the list `a` are in non-decreasing order. If they are, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False. Notably, the function does not utilize the reading times for desks A and B, nor does it consider the reading time limit (K) in its logic.

#Function 11:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer representing the total number of books on desks A and B, k is a non-negative integer representing the maximum allowed reading time in minutes, and the reading times for the books on desk A and desk B are lists of positive integers where the length of the lists corresponds to n and m respectively, and each reading time is between 1 and 10^9.

    #The program returns the number of complete reading sessions possible with the total number of books 'n' given the maximum allowed reading time 'k', plus an additional session if there are leftover books that do not fill a complete session.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two non-negative integers, `n` (representing the total number of books) and `k` (representing the maximum allowed reading time in minutes). It calculates and returns the number of complete reading sessions possible with the total number of books given the maximum allowed reading time. If there are leftover books that do not fill a complete session, it adds an additional session for them. In cases where `k` is 0, the function would return infinity since dividing by zero is not handled, which should be noted as a potential edge case.

def func_12():

    #The program returns a string input read from standard input, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and returns a string input read from standard input, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace. It does not handle any potential errors that may arise from reading input (e.g., EOFError) or from input being empty.

#Function 13:

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two lists of positive integers representing reading times for books on Desk A and Desk B, a time limit K, and counts how many books can be read from both desks without exceeding the time limit. It attempts to read the books in order of their reading times, prioritizing the shorter reading time first. If the total reading time exceeds K, the function stops counting and prints the number of books read up to that point. If it can read all the books from one desk without exceeding K, it then attempts to read the remaining books from the other desk. The function outputs the total count of books read from both desks.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
