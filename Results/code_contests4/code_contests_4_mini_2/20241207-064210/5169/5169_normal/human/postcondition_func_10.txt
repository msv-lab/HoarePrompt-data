The function accepts two non-negative integers, `n` (representing the total number of books) and `k` (representing the maximum allowed reading time in minutes). It calculates and returns the number of complete reading sessions possible with the total number of books given the maximum allowed reading time. If there are leftover books that do not fill a complete session, it adds an additional session for them. In cases where `k` is 0, the function would return infinity since dividing by zero is not handled, which should be noted as a potential edge case.
