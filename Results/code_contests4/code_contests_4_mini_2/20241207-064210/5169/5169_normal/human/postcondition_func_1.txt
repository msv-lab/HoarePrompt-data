The function accepts an integer `n`, which is the first element of a tuple, and a tuple `p` containing two lists of integers. It calculates and returns the value of `n` raised to the power of `(p - 2) modulo p`, effectively returning the modular inverse of `n` with respect to `p`. The function does not account for cases where `n` is zero or `p` is less than or equal to `n`, which could lead to undefined behavior in modular arithmetic.
