The function accepts a tuple `a` containing three integers (N, M, K) and a tuple `b` containing two lists of integers, representing the reading times for books on Desk A and Desk B. It computes the absolute value of the product of the elements in tuple `a` and tuple `b`, and divides this product by the result of another function `func_9` that also takes `a` and `b` as arguments. However, the function does not explicitly handle potential division by zero errors from the `func_9` output, which could lead to runtime errors if `func_9` returns zero.
