n is a tuple containing three elements: the first element is an integer N (1 <= N <= 200000), the second element is an integer M (1 <= M <= 200000), and the third element is an integer K (1 <= K <= 10^9). The fourth element is a list of N integers representing the reading times A_i (1 <= A_i <= 10^9), and the fifth element is a list of M integers representing the reading times B_i (1 <= B_i <= 10^9).
