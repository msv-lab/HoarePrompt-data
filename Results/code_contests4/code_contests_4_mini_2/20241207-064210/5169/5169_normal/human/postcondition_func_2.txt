The function accepts two non-negative integers `n` and `r`, along with two lists of integers `fact` and `ifact`, and returns the value of `t`, which is calculated as \((fact[n] \times (ifact[r] \times ifact[n - r]) \mod MOD) \mod MOD\). The function assumes that `n` is greater than or equal to `r` to avoid index errors when accessing `ifact[n - r]`. If `n` is less than `r`, it could result in an IndexError.
