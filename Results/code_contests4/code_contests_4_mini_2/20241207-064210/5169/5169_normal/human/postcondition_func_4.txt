The function accepts a tuple `n` containing integers N, M, K, and two lists of integers. It returns an empty list if N is less than 2. If N is 2 or greater, it returns a list of all prime numbers from 2 up to N. However, the logic for handling N being less than 2 is not consistent with the annotations, as the function should return an empty list for any N less than 2, not just 9. Additionally, it does not handle cases where N is 1. The function should also include 2 as a valid prime number in its results.
