a is a string containing space-separated integers where the first three integers represent N, M, and K respectively, and the following integers represent the reading times for books on desks A and B; N and M are positive integers such that 1 <= N, M <= 200000, K is a positive integer such that 1 <= K <= 10^9, and each reading time A_i and B_i is a positive integer such that 1 <= A_i, B_i <= 10^9.
