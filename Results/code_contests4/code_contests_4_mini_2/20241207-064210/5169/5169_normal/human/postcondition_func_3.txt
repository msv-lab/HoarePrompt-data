The function accepts a tuple `Sum` containing three elements: the number of books on Desk A (`N`), the number of books on Desk B (`M`), and the maximum allowed reading time in minutes (`K`). It calculates and returns the maximum integer `n` such that the summation of the first `n` natural numbers does not exceed `K`, using the formula `(-1 + sqrt(1 + 8 * K)) // 2`. The function does not utilize the values of `N` or `M` in its calculations.
