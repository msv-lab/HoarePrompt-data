a is a tuple containing three elements: N (an integer representing the number of books on desk A), M (an integer representing the number of books on desk B), and K (a non-negative integer representing the total available reading time in minutes), followed by two lists of integers A and B representing the reading times for each book on desks A and B, respectively, where the lengths of A and B are N and M. All reading times are positive integers.
