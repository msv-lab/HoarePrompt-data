The function accepts a positive integer `mod` and returns two lists: `fact`, which contains the factorials of all integers from 0 to 200004 computed modulo `mod`, and `ifact`, which contains the modular inverses of those factorials. The function does not handle cases where `mod` is not a positive integer, but it assumes that it will be provided a valid positive integer as input.
