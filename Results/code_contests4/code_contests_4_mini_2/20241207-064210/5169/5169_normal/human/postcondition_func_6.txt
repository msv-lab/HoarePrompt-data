The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of integers `primes`, and returns the total number of divisors of `n` calculated via its prime factorization. If `n` is 1, the function immediately returns 1. If `n` is greater than 1 and not divisible by any primes in the list, it returns the value of `divs_number`, which represents the product of the counts of each prime factor in `n`, indicating the total number of divisors including 1. It does not account for cases where `n` could be a prime number itself, returning an inaccurate divisor count in such scenarios.
