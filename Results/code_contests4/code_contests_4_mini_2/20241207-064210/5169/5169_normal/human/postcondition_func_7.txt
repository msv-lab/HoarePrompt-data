The function accepts a list of integers `d`, a non-negative integer `x`, and a value `default`. It returns a tuple containing `default` twice if `x` is not found in the list `d`. If `x` is found, it returns a tuple with the indices of the first and last occurrences of `x` in the list `d`. If `d` is empty or `x` is not present, it returns `default` for both indices.
