Sum is a tuple containing three elements: N (the number of books on Desk A), M (the number of books on Desk B), and K (the maximum allowed reading time in minutes), where 1 <= N, M <= 200000 and 1 <= K <= 10^9. The second element of the tuple is a list of N integers representing the reading times for each book on Desk A, and the third element is a list of M integers representing the reading times for each book on Desk B, with each reading time being a positive integer up to 10^9.
