The function accepts a tuple `a` containing three elements: the number of books on desk A (N), the number of books on desk B (M), and the total available reading time in minutes (K). It also expects two lists of integers representing the reading times for each book on desks A and B, respectively. The function checks if the reading times in the list `a` are in non-decreasing order. If they are, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False. Notably, the function does not utilize the reading times for desks A and B, nor does it consider the reading time limit (K) in its logic.
