N and M are integers representing the number of books on Desk A and Desk B respectively, where 1 <= N, M <= 200000; K is a non-negative integer representing the maximum time allowed in minutes, where 1 <= K <= 10^9; A is a list of integers representing the reading times for books on Desk A, where each A_i (1 <= i <= N) is a positive integer and 1 <= A_i <= 10^9; B is a list of integers representing the reading times for books on Desk B, where each B_i (1 <= i <= M) is a positive integer and 1 <= B_i <= 10^9.
