The function accepts two positive integers, `n` and `start`, and returns a list of all positive divisors of `n` starting from the integer `start`. If `start` is greater than the square root of `n`, the function will return an empty list since it will not find any divisors in that range. The list contains each divisor found, including both the divisor and its complementary divisor unless they are the same (in the case of perfect squares).
