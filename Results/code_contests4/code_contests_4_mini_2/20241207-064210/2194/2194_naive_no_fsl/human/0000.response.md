To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the given problem description, we need to analyze the code and check if it accounts for all possible cases related to forming a number that is divisible by 25 through adjacent swaps.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. The program checks if the input number `n` is already divisible by 25. If yes, it prints `0`, indicating no moves are needed.
2. The program counts the occurrences of the digits `0`, `5`, `2`, and `7` since a number is divisible by 25 if it ends with `00`, `25`, `50`, or `75`.
3. It computes the minimum number of adjacent swaps needed to arrange the digits to form a valid ending for divisibility by 25.
4. The program handles multiple scenarios based on the presence of the relevant digits and calculates the number of swaps required to bring them into position.

### Edge Cases:
Let's consider some potential cases that might not be correctly handled by the program:

1. **Case with No Valid Ending:**
   - Input: `123456` (There are no `0`s, `5`s, `2`s, or `7`s to form a valid number ending for divisibility by 25.)
   - Expected Output: `-1`
   - The program correctly identifies that no swaps can yield a divisible number and returns `-1`.

2. **Case with Non-Adjacent Required Digits:**
   - Input: `705` (The number already ends with a `5` but has a `0` that is not adjacent.)
   - Expected Output: `1` (The `0` can be moved next to `5` with one swap.)
   - The program correctly identifies that only one swap is needed.

3. **Case with Leading Zeros:**
   - Input: `500` (Can easily form `500`, which is divisible by 25.)
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - The program correctly identifies that no swaps are required.

4. **Case with All Zeros and a Five:**
   - Input: `5000` (Can form `5000` easily.)
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - The program correctly identifies that no swaps are required.

5. **Complex Case:**
   - Input: `70700` (Requires multiple swaps to form `700`.)
   - Expected Output: `3` (It takes three swaps to move the `0` next to `5`.)
   - The program should correctly compute the swaps.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program and considering various edge cases, it appears that the program handles all scenarios as described in the problem statement. It correctly returns `-1` when no valid number can be formed, and it calculates the number of swaps accurately when it is possible to achieve a number that is divisible by 25.

Therefore, we conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
