According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `n`, and `j`. The loop executes as long as `j` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Since `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 1`, `j` is at least 1 and less than `n - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must become `j + 1`, which will be `j + 1` (the new value of `j` will be `i + 2`), and `j` must be less than `n - 1`. This requires `n` to be greater than `i + 2`.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 1`, `ans` is 2, `j` is `i + 2`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `i + 2`**
