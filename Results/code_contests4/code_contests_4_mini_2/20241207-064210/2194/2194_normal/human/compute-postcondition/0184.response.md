The code assigns the value of `temp` to `t[j]`, where `j` is equal to `n`. The value of `temp` is currently equal to `t[n + 1]`. Therefore, `t[n]` will be updated to the value of `t[n + 1]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `ans` is `n - i + 2`, `j` is `n`, `temp` is now equal to `t[n + 1]`, `t[n - 2]` is equal to `t[n - 1]`, `t[n]` is now equal to `t[n - 1]`, `t[n - 1]` remains unchanged, `t[n + 1]` is now equal to `t[n - 1]`, `t[n]` is updated to `t[n + 1]`.**
