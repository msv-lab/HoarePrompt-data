According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0`, which means `n` must be at least `1` for the loop to execute at least once. If `n` is `0`, the loop will not execute. Additionally, the variable `i` will start at `n - 1`. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute for the first time, `n` must be greater than `0`, and `i` should be initialized to `n - 1` (the last index of the string `s`).

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`**
