According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i`. The loop iterates with `i` starting from `n - 1` and decreasing until it reaches `-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1, resulting in `i` becoming `n - 2`. 

Additionally, since `n` is greater than 0, the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, after this iteration, `i` must be `n - 2` for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 2` for the loop to execute a second time.**
