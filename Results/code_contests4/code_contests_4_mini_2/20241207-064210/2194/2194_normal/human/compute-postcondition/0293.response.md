Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, inclusive, with no leading zeroes. If `int(s) % 25 == 0`, the output is 0. Otherwise, if `fin` is greater than 10^10, -1 is printed with no changes to `ans` or `fin`. If `fin` is less than or equal to 10^10, then `ans` is set to 1000000000000000 if `n` is 3, or `n - 2` if `n` is greater than 3, with no changes to `ans` or `fin` if `zero` is less than 1 or `five` is less than 1.***
