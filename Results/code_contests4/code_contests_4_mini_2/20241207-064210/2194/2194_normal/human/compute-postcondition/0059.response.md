According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the range defined by `n`. The loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decreased by 1. Therefore, `i` will become `n - 3`.

Additionally, since `n` is greater than 0, `i` will still be within the valid range for the loop when it becomes `n - 3`. There is also a condition related to `t[i]` being equal to '5', which may lead to breaking out of the loop, but since it's specified that there is no else part, we focus only on the loop execution.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 3`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be at least 0**
