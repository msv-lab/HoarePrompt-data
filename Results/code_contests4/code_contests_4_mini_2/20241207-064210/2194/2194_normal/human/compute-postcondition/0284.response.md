Postcondition: ***`ans` is equal to 1000000000000000 if `n` is 3, `t` is the modified list after all swaps have been executed, `j` is 1, and `i` is at least 0 and less than 1, with the first element of `t` being '0'. Otherwise, if `n` is greater than 3, `ans` is equal to `n - 2`, `t` remains the modified list after all swaps have been executed, `j` is `n - 2`, `n` is at least 2, `i` is at least `n - 3`, and the first element of `t` is '0'.***
