The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cnt` is unknown, but it is increased in this operation. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `ans`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `n - 2`; `ans` is increased by 1; `cnt` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `i` is `n - 2`; `ans` is increased by 1; `cnt` is increased by 1.**
