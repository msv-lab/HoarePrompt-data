The expression `ans += n - 2 - i` updates the value of `ans` by adding the result of the calculation `n - 2 - i`. Since `i` is defined as `n - 2`, we can substitute `i` in the equation. Thus, we have:

```
ans += n - 2 - (n - 2)
```

This simplifies to:

```
ans += n - 2 - n + 2
```

Which further simplifies to:

```
ans += 0
```

This means that the value of `ans` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 2`, and `ans` remains unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 2`, and `ans` remains unchanged.**
