Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2. If `n` equals 3, then `ans` is set to 10, and the first element of `t` is '0'; the elements of `t` from index `i` to `n - 2` are shifted one position to the right, and `t[j]` (where `j` is `n - 2`) is equal to the value that was originally at `t[i + 1]`. If `n` is at least 4, then `ans` is equal to `ans_initial + (n - 2 - i) + k`, where `k` is the number of iterations where `t[i]` was '0', `j` is `n - 2`, and `t[j]` remains the value originally at `t[i + 1]`.***
