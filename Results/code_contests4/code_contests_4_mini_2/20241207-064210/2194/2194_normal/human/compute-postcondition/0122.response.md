The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. The initial state of `ans` is `ans_initial + (n - 2 - 1) + 1 + 1`, which simplifies to `ans_initial + (n - 2) + 1`. After adding 1, the new value of `ans` becomes `ans_initial + (n - 2) + 2`. The values of the other variables `n`, `i`, `j`, and `t[j]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 4, `i` is 2, `ans` is `ans_initial + (n - 2) + 2`, `j` is `n - 2`, and `t[j]` is the value originally at `t[1 + 1]`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 2, `ans` is `ans_initial + (n - 2) + 2`, `j` is `n - 2`, and `t[j]` is the value originally at `t[1 + 1]**
