The value of `t[j + 1]` is assigned the value of `t[j]`. With `j` being equal to `i`, which is less than `n - 2`, the assignment updates the element at index `j + 1` of the list `t` to the value of the element at index `j`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `i` is such that `i < n - 2`, `j` is `i`, `ans` is 2, and `t[j + 1]` is now equal to `t[j]`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is such that `i < n - 2`, `j` is `i`, `ans` is 2, and `t[j + 1]` is now equal to `t[j]**
