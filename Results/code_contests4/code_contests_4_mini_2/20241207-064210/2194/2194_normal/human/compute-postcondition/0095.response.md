According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n - 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `i`, and `i` is such that `i < n - 2`. Since the loop iterates with `j` starting from `i`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will be `i + 1`. 

To determine the conditions for the loop to execute again, `i` must remain such that `i < n - 2`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be `i + 1` and `n` must still be at least 2.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is such that `i < n - 2`, `j` is `i + 1`, `ans` is 2, and `t[j]` is now equal to `temp`.**
