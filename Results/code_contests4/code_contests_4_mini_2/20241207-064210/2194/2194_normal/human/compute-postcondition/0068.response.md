According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j`, `i`, and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n - 1`, which means `j` was set to `i`, and after the loop body executes, `j` would be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

Since `n` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than `n - 1`. If `j` starts at `i`, and since we are incrementing `j` after each iteration, it will be `i + 1` for the next iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute once more, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n - 1`; `ans` is increased by 1, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`, which now equals `t[j]`; `t[j]` is now equal to `t[j + 1]`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, and `j` will be `i + 1`.**
