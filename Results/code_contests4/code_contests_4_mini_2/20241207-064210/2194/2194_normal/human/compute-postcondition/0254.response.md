The code assigns the value of `temp` to `t[j]`. The variable `temp` holds the value of `t[n - 1]`, and `t[n - 1]` was previously set to `t[n - 2]`. Therefore, the value of `t[j]` will now be the value that was in `t[n - 1]` before the assignment. The other variables remain unaffected.

Given that `j` is `n - 2`, we can conclude that the list `t` is modified at the index `n - 2`. The output state reflects this change.

Output State: **`ans` is incremented by 1; `t` is the modified list after swaps; `j` is `n - 2; `n` is at least 2; `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 2; `temp` is assigned the value of `t[n - 1]` and `t[n - 1]` is now equal to `t[n - 2]; `t[j]` is now equal to `temp`.**
