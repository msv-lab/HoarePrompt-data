The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. Since `ans` is initially 3, after execution, `ans` becomes 4. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `i` is such that `i < n - 2`, `j` is `i + 2`, `ans` is 4, `t[j]` is now equal to `temp`, and `t[j + 1]` is now equal to `t[j]`, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than `n - 2`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is such that `i < n - 2`, `j` is `i + 2`, `ans` is 4, `t[j]` is now equal to `temp`, and `t[j + 1]` is now equal to `t[j]`, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than `n - 2.**
