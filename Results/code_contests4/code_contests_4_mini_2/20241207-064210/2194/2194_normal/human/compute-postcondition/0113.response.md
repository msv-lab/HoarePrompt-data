Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 4, `i` is 0, `ans` is equal to `ans_initial + (n - 2 - i)`, `j` is `n - 2`, `t[j]` is the value that was originally at `t[i + 1]`, and the elements of `t` from index `i` to `n - 2` are shifted one position to the right. The first element of `t` is '0'. If `t[i]` is not '0', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
