The value of `t[j + 1]` is assigned the value of `t[j]`. This means that the element at index `j + 1` in the list `t` now holds the same value as the element at index `j`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `ans` do not change, and there are no other variables directly impacted. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment operation.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n - 1`; `ans` is increased by 1; `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`, which now equals `t[j]`.**
