The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 4, `i` is 2, `ans` is `ans_initial + (n - 2 - 1) + 1 + 1`, `j` is `n - 2`, and `t[j]` is the value originally at `t[1 + 1]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
