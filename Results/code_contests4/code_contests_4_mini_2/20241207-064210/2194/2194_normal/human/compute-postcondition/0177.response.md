The value of `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`. The variable `j` is equal to `n - 1`, so `j + 1` is `n`. Therefore, `temp` is now equal to `t[n]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `ans` is `n - i + 1`, `j` is `n - 1`, `temp` is `t[n]`, `t[n - 2]` is equal to `t[n - 1`**.
