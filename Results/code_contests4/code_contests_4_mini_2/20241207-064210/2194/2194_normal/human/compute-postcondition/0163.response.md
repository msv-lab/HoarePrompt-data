To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the current values of `i`, `n`, and any other relevant variables based on the provided context.

1. The loop is defined as `for i in xrange(n - 2, -1, -1)`, which means it will iterate from `n - 2` down to `0`, decrementing `i` by 1 in each iteration.
2. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least `0` (as per the provided state), meaning the loop has either just executed for `i = 0` or has not yet reached that value.
3. The next value of `i` for the loop to execute again will be the previous value of `i` decremented by `1`. Since `i` is at least `0`, this means in the next iteration, `i` will be `i - 1`.
4. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` remains `-1`. If `i` becomes `-1`, the loop will terminate.

Since `i` is at least `0`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will decrease to `-1`. Additionally, since `ans` is defined as `n - 1 - i`, we need to adjust `ans` accordingly for the next iteration.

Now, let's summarize the adjusted state:

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is at least -1, `ans` is equal to `n - 1 - (-1)`, `j` is `n - 2`, `temp` is equal to `t[n - 1]`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be at least -1.**
