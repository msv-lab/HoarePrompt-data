The code assigns the value of `t[j]` to `t[j + 1]`. Given that `j` is `n`, this means `t[n + 1]` will be assigned the value of `t[n]`. The previous state indicates that `t[n]` is equal to `t[n - 1]`, and `t[n - 1]` remains unchanged. Hence, `t[n + 1]` will now take on the value of `t[n - 1]`. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `ans` is `n - i + 2`, `j` is `n`, `temp` is now equal to `t[n + 1]`, `t[n - 2]` is equal to `t[n - 1]`, `t[n]` is now equal to `t[n - 1]`, `t[n - 1]` remains unchanged, `t[n + 1]` is now equal to `t[n - 1]`.**
