According to the code, the loop is designed to execute while `i` iterates from `n - 1` down to `0`. In the last iteration, `i` is `n - 2`, which means the loop has executed once for `i = n - 1` and once for `i = n - 2`. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be decremented by 1. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 2`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be `n - 3`. 

Since `n` is greater than 0, `i` will still be valid when it becomes `n - 3`. 

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 3` for the loop to execute a third time.**
