According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop continues to execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 3`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 4. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

After the last iteration, `i` is incremented from 1 to 2. For the loop to execute a second time, `i` (which is now 2) must still be less than `n - 3`. Since `n` is at least 4, `n - 3` is at least 1. Therefore, `i` being 2 is valid for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 2, `ans` is `ans_initial + (n - 2 - 1) + 1 + 1`, `j` is `n - 2`, and `t[j]` is the value originally at `t[1 + 1]` for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than `n - 3` (which is at least 1)**
