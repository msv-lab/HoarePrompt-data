To analyze the given code snippet, we note that `i` is defined as `n - 3`, which means it will depend on the value of `n`. Since `n` is greater than 0, `i` will be at least `-2` (if `n` is 3). 

The expression `ans += n - 2 - i` will update the value of `ans` based on the values of `n` and `i`. 

We can simplify the expression:
- Substitute `i` with `n - 3`: 
  - `ans += n - 2 - (n - 3)`
  - `ans += n - 2 - n + 3`
  - `ans += 1`

Hence, `ans` is incremented by 1. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `i` is `n - 3; ans` is incremented by 1**.
