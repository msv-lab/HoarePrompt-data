`ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` is `n - i`, so after execution, the new value of `ans` is `n - i + 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `ans` is `n - i + 1`, `j` is `n - 1`, `temp` is equal to `t[n - 1]`, and `t[n - 2]` is now equal to `t[n - 1]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `ans` is `n - i + 1`, `j` is `n - 1`, `temp` is equal to `t[n - 1]`, and `t[n - 2]` is now equal to `t[n - 1]**
