Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2. If `n` equals 3, `ans` is set to 10, the first element of `t` is '0', and the elements of `t` from index `i` to `n - 2` are shifted one position to the right, with `t[j]` equal to the value originally at `t[i + 1]`. If `n` is at least 4, `ans` is updated to `ans_initial + (n - 2 - i) + k`, where `k` is the number of iterations where `t[i]` was '0', and `j` is `n - 2`, with `t[j]` remaining the value originally at `t[i + 1]`.***
