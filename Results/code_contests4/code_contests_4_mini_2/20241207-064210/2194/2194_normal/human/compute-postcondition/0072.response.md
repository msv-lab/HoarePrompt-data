The value of `t[j]` is assigned the value of `temp`, which holds the value of `t[j]` before this assignment. This operation does not change the value of `temp` or any other variables. Therefore, the output state reflects that the value of `t[j]` is unchanged, but the operation is performed nonetheless.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n - 1`, `ans` is increased by 1, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j]`, and `t[j]` is now equal to `temp`.**
