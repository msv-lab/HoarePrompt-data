Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `i` is `n - 2`, and `t` is a list with at least 1 element. If the element at index `i` of list `t` is '0', the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. However, as per the precondition, the element at index `i` of list `t` is guaranteed not to be '0'.***
