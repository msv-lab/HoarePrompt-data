According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop continues as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1`, and for the loop to execute again, `i` must be decremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be `n - 2` in the next iteration. Since `n` is at least 1, `i` can be at least `-1` (if `n` is 1). 

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we have the following states:
- `ans` remains initialized to 0.
- `i` is decremented to `n - 2`.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is initialized to 0.**
