The variable `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`. Given that `j` is equal to `n`, `temp` will be assigned the value of `t[n + 1]`. The initial values of the other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `ans` is `n - i + 2`, `j` is `n`, `temp` is now equal to `t[n + 1]`, `t[n - 2]` is equal to `t[n - 1]`, `t[n]` is now equal to `t[n - 1]`, and `t[n - 1]` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `ans` is `n - i + 2`, `j` is `n`, `temp` is now equal to `t[n + 1]`, `t[n - 2]` is equal to `t[n - 1]`, `t[n]` is now equal to `t[n - 1]`, and `t[n - 1]` remains unchanged.**
