The variable `ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` was `n - i + 1`. Therefore, after executing the code, the new value of `ans` is `n - i + 1 + 1`, which simplifies to `n - i + 2`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `ans` is `n - i + 2`, `j` is `n`, `temp` is `t[n]`, `t[n - 2]` is equal to `t[n - 1]`, `t[n]` is now equal to `t[n - 1]`, and `t[n - 1]` remains unchanged.**
