Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 5, `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is now 5, `j` is `n - 2`, `temp` is equal to `t[n - 1]`, `t[n - 2]` is now equal to `t[n - 1]`, `t[n - 1]` is unchanged, `t[n]` is equal to `t[n - 1]`, the first element of `t` is equal to '0', `n` is not equal to 3. If `t[i]` is not '0', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
