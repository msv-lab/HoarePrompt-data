`ans` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `ans` is unknown. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `j`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `i` is -1, `j` is -1, and `ans` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is -1, `j` is -1, and `ans` is increased by 1**
