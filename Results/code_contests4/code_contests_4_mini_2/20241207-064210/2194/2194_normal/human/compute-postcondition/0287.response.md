Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18. If `zero` is at least 1 and `five` is at least 1, then `fin` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `ans`, where `ans` is either 1000000000000000 (if `n` is 3) or `n - 2` (if `n` is greater than 3). If `zero` is less than 1 or `five` is less than 1, no changes are made to `ans` or `fin`.***
