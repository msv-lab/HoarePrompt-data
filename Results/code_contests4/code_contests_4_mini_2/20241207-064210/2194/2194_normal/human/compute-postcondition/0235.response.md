The variable `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`. Since `j` is 1, this means `temp` will be assigned the value of `t[2]`. The previous values of the affected variables do not change, and since `t` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of `temp`. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment operation and the state of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is -1, `j` is 1, `ans` is at least 3, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[2]`, and `t[0]` is equal to `t[0]**
