In the given code, `t[j]` is assigned the value of `temp`. Since `j` is 0, this means `t[0]` will be assigned the value of `temp`. The variable `temp` was previously assigned the value of `t[1]`, which is equal to `t[0]`. Thus, after this execution, `t[0]` will now hold the same value it had before (since `temp` is equal to `t[0]`).

The output state will reflect that `t[0]` remains unchanged, and the states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `j`, `ans`, and `temp`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is -1, `j` is 0, `ans` is at least 2, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[1]`, and `t[0]` is equal to `t[0]**
