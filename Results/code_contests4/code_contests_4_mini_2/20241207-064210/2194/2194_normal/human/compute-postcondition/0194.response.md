`ans` is incremented by 1, and its previous value is `n - i + (n - 2 - i)`. Since `n` is at least 4 and `i` is less than `n - 2`, the new value of `ans` will be `n - i + (n - 2 - i) + 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 4, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `ans` is now `n - i + (n - 2 - i) + 1`, `j` is `n - 2`, `temp` is equal to `t[n - 1]`, `t[n - 2]` is now equal to `t[n - 1]`, `t[n - 1]` is unchanged, `t[n]` is equal to `t[n - 1]`, and the first element of `t` is equal to '0', `n` is not equal to 3, and if `t[i]` is not '0', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `ans` is now `n - i + (n - 2 - i) + 1`, `j` is `n - 2`, `temp` is equal to `t[n - 1]`, `t[n - 2]` is now equal to `t[n - 1]`, `t[n - 1]` is unchanged, `t[n]` is equal to `t[n - 1]`, and the first element of `t` is equal to '0', `n` is not equal to 3, and if `t[i]` is not '0', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
