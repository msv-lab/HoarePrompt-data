According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is -1, `j` is -1, and `n` is at least 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1. Therefore, `j` will be 0. Since `n` is at least 2, `n - 1` is at least 1, meaning the loop can execute again when `j` is 0.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is -1, `j` is 0, `ans` is increased by 1, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[0]`, and `t[-1]` is assigned the value of `temp`, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than `n - 1` (which is at least 1)**.
