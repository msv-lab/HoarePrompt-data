According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 2, `i` is `n - 3`, and `ans` is 1. 

To determine the next state, we note the following:
- Since `i` is currently `n - 3`, the next value of `i` will be `n - 4` after the next iteration.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be greater than or equal to 0, which means `n` must be at least 4 (because if `n` is 3, `i` would become -1 on the next iteration, which would stop the loop).

In summary, we adjust `i` to `n - 4`, and state that for the loop to continue executing, `n` must be at least 4.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n - 4`, and `ans` is `1`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be at least 4.**
