Postcondition: ***`ans` is `n`, `t` is the modified list after all swaps have been executed, `j` is `n - 2`, `n` is at least 5, `i` is 2, and the first element of `t` is '0'. If `t[i]` is not '0', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `t[i]` is '0', no action is taken in this block.***
