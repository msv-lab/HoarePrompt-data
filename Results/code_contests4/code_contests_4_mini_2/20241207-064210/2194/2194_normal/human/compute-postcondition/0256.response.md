The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` is unknown, but it is increased by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is incremented by 1; `t` is the modified list after swaps; `j` is `n - 2`; `n` is at least 2; `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 2`; `temp` is assigned the value of `t[n - 1]` and `t[n - 1]` is now equal to `t[n - 2]; `t[j]` is now equal to `temp`.

Output State: **`ans` is incremented by 1; `t` is the modified list after swaps; `j` is `n - 2; `n` is at least 2; `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 2; `temp` is assigned the value of `t[n - 1]` and `t[n - 1]` is now equal to `t[n - 2]; `t[j]` is now equal to `temp`**.
