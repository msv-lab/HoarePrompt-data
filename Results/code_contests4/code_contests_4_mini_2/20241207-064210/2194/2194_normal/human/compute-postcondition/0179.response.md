The variable `temp` is assigned the value of `t[n]`, which is initially equal to `t[n - 1]`. The value of `j` is `n - 1`, so `t[j]` (which is `t[n - 1]`) is now assigned the value of `temp`. This means that `t[n - 1]` is now equal to the previous value of `t[n]`, which was also equal to `t[n - 1]`. Therefore, the state of `t[n - 1]` does not change, while `t[n]` retains its previous value.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `ans` is `n - i + 1`, `j` is `n - 1`, `temp` is `t[n]`, `t[n - 2]` is equal to `t[n - 1]; `t[n]` is now equal to `t[n - 1]`, and `t[n - 1]` remains unchanged.**
