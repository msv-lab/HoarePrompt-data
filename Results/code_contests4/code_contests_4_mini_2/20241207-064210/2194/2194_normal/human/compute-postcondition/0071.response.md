The code assigns the value of `t[j]` to `t[j + 1]`. This operation does not change the values of `n`, `i`, `ans`, or `temp`, but it modifies the list `t` at index `j + 1`. The previous values of the affected variables are not specified, but we can infer that `t[j + 1]` will now hold the same value as `t[j]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n - 1`, `ans` is increased by 1, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]` which is now equal to `t[j]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n - 1`, `ans` is increased by 1, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j]`, and `t[j + 1]` is now equal to `t[j]`.**
