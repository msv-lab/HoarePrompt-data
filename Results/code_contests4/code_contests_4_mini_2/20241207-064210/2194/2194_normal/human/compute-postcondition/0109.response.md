Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `i` is such that `i < n - 2`, `ans` is equal to `ans_initial + (n - 2 - i)`, `j` is `n - 2`, `t[j]` is equal to the value that was originally at `t[i + 1]`, the elements of `t` from index `i` to `n - 2` are shifted one position to the right, the first element of `t` is '0', and `n` is not equal to 3.***
