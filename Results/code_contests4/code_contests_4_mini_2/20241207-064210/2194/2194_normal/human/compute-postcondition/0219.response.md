According to the code, the loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0`. The loop variable `i` starts at `n - 1` and decreases by `1` each iteration until it reaches `-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 2`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be decreased by `1`, which means `i` will now be `n - 3`. 

The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`. Since `n` is at least `1`, `i` will also be `0` or greater during the next iteration. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `n - 3`. 

State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is `n - 3`, and `t` is a list with at least 1 element. For the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be at least 0.**
