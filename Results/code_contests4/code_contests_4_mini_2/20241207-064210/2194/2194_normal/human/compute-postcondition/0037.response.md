To evaluate the code snippet, we first analyze the impact of the expression `ans += n - 1 - i`. 

1. The variable `i` is defined as `n - 3`, which means that `i` is dependent on the value of `n`.
2. The expression `n - 1 - i` can be simplified:
   - Substitute `i` with `n - 3`: 
   - `n - 1 - (n - 3) = n - 1 - n + 3 = 2`.
3. Thus, `ans` is incremented by `2`.

Now, we summarize the output state:
- Since `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is defined as `n - 3`, the calculation results in `ans` being increased by `2`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 3`, `ans` is increased by 2**.
