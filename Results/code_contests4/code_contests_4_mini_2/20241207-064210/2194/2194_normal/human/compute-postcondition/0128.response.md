Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18. `two` is at least 1, `five` is at least 1, and `seven` is at least 1. If `n` equals 3, then `ans` is set to 10; if `n` is at least 4, then `ans` is updated to `ans_initial + (n - 2 - i) + k`. The variable `fin` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `ans`. If `two` is less than 1 or `five` is less than 1, no changes are made in the `ans` or `fin` variables.***
