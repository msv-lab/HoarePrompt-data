The value of `ans` is incremented by 1, and since `ans` is initially equal to `n - 1 - i`, the new value of `ans` becomes `n - 1 - i + 1`, which simplifies to `n - i`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `ans` is `n - i`, `j` is `n - 2`, `temp` is equal to `t[n - 1]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `ans` is `n - i`, `j` is `n - 2`, `temp` is equal to `t[n - 1]**
