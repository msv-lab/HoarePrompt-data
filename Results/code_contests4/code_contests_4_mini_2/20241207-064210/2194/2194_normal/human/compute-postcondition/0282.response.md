`ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` is `n`, so after execution, `ans` becomes `n + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is `n + 1`, `t` is the modified list after all swaps have been executed, `j` is `n - 2`, `n` is at least 5, `i` is 2, and the first element of `t` is '0'.

Output State: **`ans` is `n + 1`, `t` is the modified list after all swaps have been executed, `j` is `n - 2`, `n` is at least 5, `i` is 2, and the first element of `t` is '0'**.
