According to the code, the loop executes while the variable `i` iterates from `n - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 2`. For the loop to execute again, `i` will be decremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become `n - 3`. 

Since `t[i]` is checked during each iteration, if `t[i]` is not '5', the loop will continue executing without making any changes to `ans`. Since the value of `ans` remains unchanged and is initialized to 0, it will still be 0 in the next iteration.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `i` is `n - 3`. Also, `n` must be at least 1 (which it is) to ensure the loop can execute again.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is `n - 3`, and `ans` is still 0 for the loop to execute one more time.**
