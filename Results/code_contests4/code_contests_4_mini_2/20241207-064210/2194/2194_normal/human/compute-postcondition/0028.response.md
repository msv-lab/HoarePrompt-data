The variable `ans` is incremented by the value of `n - 1 - i`. Given that `i` is `n - 2`, we can substitute `i` to get the expression: `n - 1 - (n - 2)`, which simplifies to `1`. Therefore, `ans` is increased by `1`. The other variables `n` and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `i` is `n - 2`; `ans` is increased by 1.**
