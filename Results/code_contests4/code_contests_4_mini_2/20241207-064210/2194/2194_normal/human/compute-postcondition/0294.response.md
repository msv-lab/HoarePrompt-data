The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to work with an integer `n`, which is provided in the constraints as being between 1 and \(10^{18}\), inclusive, with no leading zeroes. However, since there are no parameters explicitly listed in the function definition, we can conclude that the function likely relies on some other means to obtain this integer value. 

The output of the function is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact functionality without further details on what the function does with the integer `n`.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters explicitly and operates on an integer n, which is constrained to be between 1 and 10^18, inclusive, with no leading zeroes. The exact return value is not specified.**
