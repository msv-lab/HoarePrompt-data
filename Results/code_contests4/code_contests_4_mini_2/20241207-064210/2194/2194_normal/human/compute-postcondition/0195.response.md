According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop executes as long as `i` is less than `n - 3`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 4 and `i` is less than `n - 2`, which means `i` can currently be at most `n - 3`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, after the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than `n - 3`. 

Since `i` is currently less than `n - 2`, that implies `i` can be at most `n - 3`. So after the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`, which must still be less than `n - 3`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute again, `n` must remain at least 4, and `i` must now be `n - 3`. 

State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is now `n - 3`, `ans` is now `n - (n - 3) + (n - 2 - (n - 3)) + 1`, `j` is `n - 2`, `temp` is equal to `t[n - 1]`, `t[n - 2]` is now equal to `t[n - 1]`, `t[n - 1]` is unchanged, `t[n]` is equal to `t[n - 1]`, and the first element of `t` is equal to '0', `n` is not equal to 3, and if `t[i]` is not '0', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
