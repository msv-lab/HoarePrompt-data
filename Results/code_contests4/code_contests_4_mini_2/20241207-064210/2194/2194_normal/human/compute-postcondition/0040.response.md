The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cnt` is unknown, but we know that `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is `n - 3`. The variable `ans` has been incremented by 1, but no further details are provided about `cnt`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `n - 3; ans` is incremented by 1; `cnt` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `i` is `n - 3; ans` is incremented by 1; `cnt` is incremented by 1.**
