The expression `ans += n - 1 - i` updates the value of `ans` by adding the result of the calculation `n - 1 - i` to it. 

Given that `i` is `n - 1`, the calculation can be simplified:
- `n - 1 - i` becomes `n - 1 - (n - 1)`, which equals `0`.

Therefore, `ans` is incremented by `0`, meaning its value remains unchanged. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, the element at index `i` of `t` is '0', `cnt` is equal to 0, and `ans` remains unchanged.**
