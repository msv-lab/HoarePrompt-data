Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1. If `n` is equal to 3, then `i` is less than `n - 2`, `ans` is set to 1000000000000000, `j` is `n - 2`, `temp` is equal to `t[n - 1]`, `t[n - 2]` is now equal to `t[n - 1]`, `t[n - 1]` is unchanged, `t[n]` is equal to `t[n - 1]`, and the first element of `t` is equal to '0'. If `n` is at least 4, then `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is equal to `n - i + (n - 2 - i) + (number of zeros before index i)`, `j` is `n - 2`, `temp` is equal to `t[n - 1]`, `t[n - 2]` is now equal to `t[n - 1]`, `t[n - 1]` is unchanged, `t[n]` is equal to `t[n - 1]`, and the first element of `t` is equal to '0'.***
