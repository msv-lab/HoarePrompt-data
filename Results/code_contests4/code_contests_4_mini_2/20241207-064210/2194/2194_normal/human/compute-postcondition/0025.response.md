Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, and the element at index `i` of `t` is '0'. If `cnt` is 0, then `cnt` is set to 1 and `ans` remains unchanged. If `cnt` is greater than 0, then if `cnt` is equal to 1, `cnt` is updated to 2, `ans` is decreased by 1, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
