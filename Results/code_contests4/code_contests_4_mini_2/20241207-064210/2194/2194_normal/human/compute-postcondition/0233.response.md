According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `i`, and `n`. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` will increase by 1, so `j` will be 1. Since `n` is at least 2, `n - 1` is at least 1, allowing the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is -1, `j` is 1, `ans` is at least 2, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[1]`, and `t[0]` is equal to `t[0]`**
