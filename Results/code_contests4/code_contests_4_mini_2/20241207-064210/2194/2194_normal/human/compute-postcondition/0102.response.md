The assignment `temp = t[j + 1]` assigns the value of `t[j + 1]` to the variable `temp`. The value of `j` is `i + 2`, and since `i < n - 2`, we can conclude that `j` is less than `n`. Therefore, `j + 1` is also within bounds, and `t[j + 1]` can be accessed. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `ans`, `t`, etc.) are not affected. 

The output state is: `n` is at least 2, `i` is such that `i < n - 2`, `j` is `i + 2`, `ans` is 4, `t[j]` is now equal to `temp`, and `t[j + 1]` is now equal to `t[j]`, and `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is such that `i < n - 2, `j` is `i + 2`, `ans` is 4, `t[j]` is now equal to `temp`, `t[j + 1]` is now equal to `t[j]`, `temp` is now equal to `t[j + 1]`.**
