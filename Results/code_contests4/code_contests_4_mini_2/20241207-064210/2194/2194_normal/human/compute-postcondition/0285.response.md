Postcondition: ***`ans` is equal to 1000000000000000 if `n` is 3 and the first element of `t` is '0'. If `n` is greater than 3 and the first element of `t` is '0', then `ans` is equal to `n - 2`, `t` remains the modified list after all swaps have been executed, `j` is `n - 2`, `n` is at least 2, and `i` is at least `n - 3`.***
