According to the code, the loop iterates from `n - 2` down to `0`. The current state shows that `i` is `n - 2`, which is the starting point of the loop. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 2`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must become `n - 3`. Additionally, since the loop continues as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`, `n` must be at least `3` to ensure that `i` can be `n - 3` and still be valid.

State: **`ans` is equal to the number of iterations executed from `i` to `n - 2`, `t` is the modified list after swaps, `j` is `n - 2`, `n` is at least 3, and `i` is `n - 3`.**
