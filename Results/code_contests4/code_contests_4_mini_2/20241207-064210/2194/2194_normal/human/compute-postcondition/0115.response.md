According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. The loop condition `i < n - 3` means that for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n - 3`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is at least 4. Therefore, `n - 3` is at least 1, which means the loop can execute again as `i` (which is 0) is indeed less than `n - 3`.

After the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time after that, `i` must still be less than `n - 3`, which means `n` must be greater than 4.

State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 1, `ans` is equal to `ans_initial + (n - 2 - 1) + 1, `j` is `n - 2`, `t[j]` is the value originally at `t[1 + 1]`, and the elements of `t` from index `1` to `n - 2` are shifted one position to the right.**
