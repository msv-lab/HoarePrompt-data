The value of `t[j + 1]` is assigned the value of `t[j]`. Since `j` is `i + 1`, this means `t[j + 1]` is being updated to the value that is currently held in `t[i + 1]`. The values of `n`, `i`, `ans`, and `temp` remain unchanged in this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `i` is such that `i < n - 2`, `j` is `i + 1`, `ans` is 3, `t[j]` is now equal to `temp`, and `t[j + 1]` is now equal to `t[j]`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is such that `i < n - 2`, `j` is `i + 1`, `ans` is 3, `t[j]` is now equal to `temp`, `t[j + 1]` is now equal to `t[j]`.**
