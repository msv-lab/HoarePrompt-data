The statement `t[j] = temp` assigns the value of `temp` to the index `j` of the list `t`. The variable `j` is calculated as `n - 2`, and `temp` is already assigned the value of `t[n - 1]`. Thus, the value of `temp` is the same as the value of `t` at the last index `n - 1`. 

The values of `ans` and `j` do not change as a result of this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `ans` is incremented by 1; `j` is `n - 2`; `temp` is assigned the value of `t[n - 1]`; and `t[j]` is updated to the value of `temp`.

Output State: **`ans` is incremented by 1; `j` is `n - 2`; `temp` is assigned the value of `t[n - 1]`; `t[j]` is updated to the value of `temp`.**
