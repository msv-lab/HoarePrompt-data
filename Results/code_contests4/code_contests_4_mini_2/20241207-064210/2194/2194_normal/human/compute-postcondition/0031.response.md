The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `cnt` is unknown. The values of `n`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` remains unchanged, and `cnt` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` remains unchanged, and `cnt` is increased by 1.**
