The value of `t[j + 1]` is assigned the value of `t[j]`. Given that `j` is 1, this means we are assigning `t[2]` the value of `t[1]`. The values of `n`, `i`, `ans`, and `temp` remain unchanged in this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `i` is -1, `j` is 1, `ans` is at least 3, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[2]`, and `t[2]` is now equal to `t[1]`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is -1, `j` is 1, `ans` is at least 3, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[2]`, and `t[2]` is now equal to `t[1]**
