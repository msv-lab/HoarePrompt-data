The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `n - 3`; `ans` is incremented by 1; `cnt` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
