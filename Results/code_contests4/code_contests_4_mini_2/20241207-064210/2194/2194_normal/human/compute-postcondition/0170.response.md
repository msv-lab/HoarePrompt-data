According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the value of `i` and the range specified in the for loop. The loop will execute for `j` starting from `i` and ending at `n - 2`. 

For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be less than `n - 2`. Given that `i` is at least -1, we need to ensure that `i` is within a valid range for the loop to execute. 

Considering the provided states:
1. `n` is greater than 1, meaning `n - 2` is at least -1.
2. Since `i` is at least -1, if `i` is -1, then `j` will start at -1 and the loop will run until `n - 2`, thus executing.
3. If `i` is equal to or greater than `n - 2`, the loop will not execute, so `i` must be adjusted to be less than `n - 2`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure `i` is less than `n - 2`.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is less than `n - 2, ans` is equal to `n - 1 - i`, `j` is `n - 2`, `temp` is equal to `t[n - 1]`**
