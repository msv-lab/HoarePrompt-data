The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `ans` is initialized to 0, and the element at index `i` of the list `t` is equal to '5' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
