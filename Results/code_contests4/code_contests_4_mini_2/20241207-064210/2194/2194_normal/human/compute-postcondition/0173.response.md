The statement `t[j + 1] = t[j]` assigns the value of `t[j]` to `t[j + 1]`. Since `j` is equal to `n - 2`, we can substitute to find that `j + 1` is equal to `n - 1`. This means `t[n - 1]` will now hold the value of `t[n - 2]`. 

The values of `n`, `i`, `ans`, and `temp` are not directly affected by this assignment, and we are not given specific values for `t`, so we describe the change in state based on the assignment operation.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `ans` is `n - i`, `j` is `n - 2`, `temp` is equal to `t[n - 1]`, and `t[n - 1]` is now equal to `t[n - 2]`.**
