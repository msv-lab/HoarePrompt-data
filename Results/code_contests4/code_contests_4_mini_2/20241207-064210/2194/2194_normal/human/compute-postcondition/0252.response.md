The value of `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`. Since `j` is `n - 2`, `j + 1` equals `n - 1`. This means `temp` will hold the value of `t[n - 1]`. The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is incremented by 1; `t` is the modified list after swaps; `j` is `n - 2`; `n` is at least 2; `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 2; `temp` is assigned the value of `t[n - 1]`.

Output State: **`ans` is incremented by 1; `t` is the modified list after swaps; `j` is `n - 2; `n` is at least 2; `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 2; `temp` is assigned the value of `t[n - 1]`.**
