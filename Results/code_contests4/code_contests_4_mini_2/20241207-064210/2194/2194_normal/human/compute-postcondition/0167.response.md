The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is at least 0, `ans` is equal to `n - 1 - 0`, `j` is `n - 2`, and `temp` is equal to `t[n - 1]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
