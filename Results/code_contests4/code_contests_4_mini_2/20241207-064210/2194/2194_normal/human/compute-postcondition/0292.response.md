Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18. If `fin` is greater than 10^10, then no changes are made to `ans` or `fin`, and -1 is printed. Otherwise, `fin` is less than or equal to 10^10, `ans` is either 1000000000000000 if `n` is 3, or `n - 2` if `n` is greater than 3, and no changes are made to `ans` or `fin` if `zero` is less than 1 or `five` is less than 1.***
