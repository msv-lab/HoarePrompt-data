The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or conditional statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 4, `i` is 0, `ans` is equal to `ans_initial + (n - 2 - i)`, `j` is `n - 2`, `t[j]` is equal to the value that was originally at `t[i + 1]`, the elements of `t` from index `i` to `n - 2` are shifted one position to the right, the first element of `t` is '0', `n` is not equal to 3, and `t[i]` is not '0' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
