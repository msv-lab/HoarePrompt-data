According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `n`, and `j`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n - 1`, which means `j` is currently equal to `i` for the first iteration and will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n - 1`, which means after the next iteration, `j` will be `i + 1`. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must remain greater than `i + 1`. 

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n - 1`, `ans` is increased by 1, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j]`, and `j` is now `i + 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.**
