The variable `t[j]` is assigned the value of `temp`. The previous value of `t[j]` is `t[j]` is now equal to `temp`, so after execution, `t[j]` will remain the same. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `i` is such that `i < n - 2`, `j` is `i + 1`, `ans` is 3, `t[j]` is now equal to `temp`, and `t[j + 1]` is now equal to `t[j]`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is such that `i < n - 2`, `j` is `i + 1`, `ans` is 3, `t[j]` is now equal to `temp`, and `t[j + 1]` is now equal to `t[j]`.**
