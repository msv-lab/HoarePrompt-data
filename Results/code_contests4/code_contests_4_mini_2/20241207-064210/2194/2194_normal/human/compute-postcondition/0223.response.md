According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j`, `i`, and `n`. The loop will execute if `i` is less than `n - 1`. Since `i` is -1 when all elements are non-'0', the condition `i < n - 1` will be true as long as `n` is greater than 1. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 2 (so that `i` can be -1 and still allow the loop to run). At the start of the loop, `j` will take the value of `i`, which is -1.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is -1, `j` is -1 for the loop to execute the first time**
