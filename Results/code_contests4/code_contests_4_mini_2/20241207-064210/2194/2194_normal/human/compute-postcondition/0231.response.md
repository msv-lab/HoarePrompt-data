The code assigns the value of `t[j]` to `t[j + 1]`. Given that `j` is 0, this means `t[1]` is assigned the value of `t[0]`. The variable `temp` is already assigned the value of `t[1]`, but after this assignment, `t[1]` will hold the value of `t[0]`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `i` is -1, `j` is 0, `ans` is at least 2, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[1]`, and now `t[1]` is equal to `t[0]`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is -1, `j` is 0, `ans` is at least 2, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[1]`, and now `t[1]` is equal to `t[0]**.
