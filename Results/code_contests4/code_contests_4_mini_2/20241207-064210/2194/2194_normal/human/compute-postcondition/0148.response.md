According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop starts at `j = i` and continues while `j < n - 1`. Given that at the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `i`, and `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 1`, it indicates that `j` is currently less than `n - 1`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `i + 1`. 

For the loop to continue executing, `j` must still be less than `n - 1`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `i + 1` is still less than `n - 1`, which implies that `n` must be greater than `i + 2`.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 1`, `ans` is 1, `j` is `i + 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `i + 2`.**
