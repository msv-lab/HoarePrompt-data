The value of `temp` is assigned the value of `t[n - 1]`, which is currently equal to `t[n - 2]`. The line `t[j] = temp` assigns this value to `t[j]`, where `j` is equal to `n - 2`. Therefore, `t[n - 2]` will now hold the value that was previously in `t[n - 1]`, which is also equal to `t[n - 2]`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `ans`, and `j`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `ans` is `n - i`, `j` is `n - 2`, `temp` is equal to `t[n - 1]`, and `t[n - 2]` is now equal to `t[n - 1]`**.
