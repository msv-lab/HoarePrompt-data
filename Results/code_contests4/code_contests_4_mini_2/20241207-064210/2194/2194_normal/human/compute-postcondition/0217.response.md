The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `t` is a list with at least 1 element, and the element at index `i` of list `t` is not '0', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
