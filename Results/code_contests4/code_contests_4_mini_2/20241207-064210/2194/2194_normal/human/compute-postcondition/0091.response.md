The variable `ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` is 1, so after execution, `ans` becomes 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `i` is such that `i < n - 2`, `j` is `i`, `ans` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is such that `i < n - 2`, `j` is `i`, `ans` is 2**
