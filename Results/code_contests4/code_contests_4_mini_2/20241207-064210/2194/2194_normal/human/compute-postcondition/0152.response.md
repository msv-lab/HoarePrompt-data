In the provided code snippet, `t[j]` is assigned the value of `temp`. The variable `temp` was previously assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`. Therefore, after this assignment, `t[j]` will hold the value that was in `t[j + 1]`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `ans`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

The Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 1`, `ans` is 2, `j` is `i + 1`, `t[j]` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`, and `t[j + 1]` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 1`, `ans` is 2, `j` is `i + 1`, `t[j]` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`, and `t[j + 1]` remains unchanged.**
