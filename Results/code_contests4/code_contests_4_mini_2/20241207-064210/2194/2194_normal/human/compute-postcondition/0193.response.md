Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 4, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `ans` is equal to `n - i + (n - 2 - i)`, `j` is `n - 2`, `temp` is equal to `t[n - 1]`, `t[n - 2]` is now equal to `t[n - 1]`, `t[n - 1]` is unchanged, `t[n]` is equal to `t[n - 1]`, the first element of `t` is equal to '0', `n` is not equal to 3, and if `t[i]` is not '0', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
