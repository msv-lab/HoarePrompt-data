The value of `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`. The variable `j` is equal to `n - 2`, which means `j + 1` is equal to `n - 1`. Therefore, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[n - 1]`. The values of `ans`, `t`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. Thus, the Output State is: `ans` is incremented by 1; `t` is the modified list after swaps; `j` is `n - 2; `n` is at least 2; `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 2; `temp` is assigned the value of `t[n - 1]`.

Output State: **`ans` is incremented by 1; `t` is the modified list after swaps; `j` is `n - 2; `n` is at least 2; `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 2; `temp` is assigned the value of `t[n - 1]`**
