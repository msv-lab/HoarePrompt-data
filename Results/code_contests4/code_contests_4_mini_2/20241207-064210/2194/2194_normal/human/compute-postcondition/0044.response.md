Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0 and `i` is `n - 3`. If `t[i]` is '0' and `cnt` equals 0, `ans` is increased by 2 and `cnt` is incremented by 1. If `cnt` equals 1, `ans` is incremented by 1 and `cnt` is incremented by 1, then the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
