The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is now `n - 1`, `t` is the modified list after all swaps have been executed, `j` is `n - 2`, `n` is at least 4, `i` is 1, and the first element of `t` is '0' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
