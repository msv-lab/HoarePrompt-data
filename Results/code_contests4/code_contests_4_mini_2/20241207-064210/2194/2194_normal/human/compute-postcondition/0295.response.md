Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer input as a string (n) between 1 and 10^18, inclusive, and checks if n is divisible by 25. If it is, the function outputs 0. If not, it counts occurrences of the digits '0', '5', '2', and '7' in the string. The function attempts to calculate how many moves are needed to rearrange the digits to form a number that is divisible by 25, specifically by manipulating the positions of '0's, '5's, and '2's. If the calculated minimum number of moves (fin) exceeds 10^10, it prints -1; otherwise, it prints the calculated minimum moves. The function may not handle all possible rearrangements correctly, particularly for cases that involve more complex digit combinations or additional digits beyond the specified ones.**
