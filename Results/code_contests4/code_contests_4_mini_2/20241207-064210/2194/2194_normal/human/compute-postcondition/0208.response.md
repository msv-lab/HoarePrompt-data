Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18. `two` is at least 1, `five` is at least 1, `seven` is at least 1. `fin` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `ans`. Additionally, `zero` is at least 1, and `five` is at least 1. If `two` is less than 1 or `five` is less than 1, no changes are made in the `ans` or `fin` variables.***
