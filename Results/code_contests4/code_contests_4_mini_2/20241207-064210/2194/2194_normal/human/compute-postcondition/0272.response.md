The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is equal to `n - 2 - i`, `t` is the modified list after all swaps have been executed, `j` is `n - 2`, `n` is at least 4, `i` is 0, the first element of `t` is '0', `n` is not equal to 3, and `t[i]` is not '0', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
