Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0 and `i` is `n - 2`. If `cnt` equals 0, `ans` is increased by 1 and `cnt` is increased by 1. If `cnt` equals 1, `ans` remains unchanged, `cnt` is increased by 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cnt` is not equal to 1, no changes are made to `ans` or `cnt`.***
