The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. Given that `ans` was initially 2, after executing `ans += 1`, the new value of `ans` becomes 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `i` is such that `i < n - 2`, `j` is `i + 1`, `ans` is 3, and `t[j]` is now equal to `temp`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is such that `i < n - 2`, `j` is `i + 1`, `ans` is 3, and `t[j]` is now equal to `temp`**.
