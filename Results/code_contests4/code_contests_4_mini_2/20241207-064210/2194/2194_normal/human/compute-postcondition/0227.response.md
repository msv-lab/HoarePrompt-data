The variable `temp` is assigned the value of `t[0]`, and `j` is currently -1. The assignment `t[j] = temp` means that `t[-1]` (the last element of the list `t`) will be updated to the value stored in `temp`. The previous state of `ans` was increased by 1, but it doesn't affect the current assignment. Therefore, the impact of the code modifies the list `t` without changing `n`, `i`, or `ans`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is -1, `j` is -1, `ans` is increased by 1, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[0]`, and `t[-1]` is assigned the value of `temp`.**
