According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` starts at `n - 2` and decrements down to `0`. Given that `n` is greater than `0`, `i` is initialized to a value that is valid for the loop condition (`i >= 0`), and `ans` is computed based on `i`, the loop can execute correctly from its starting point.

At the start of the loop:
- `i` must be `n - 2`, which is a valid index as long as `n` is at least `2`.
- `ans` will be `n - 1 - (n - 2) = 1`, which ensures it's correctly calculated.

The initial state provided indicates that `i` is already less than `n - 1`, which means it can start from `n - 2`.

So for the loop to execute for the first time:
- `n` must be at least `2` (to ensure `i` can be `0` or above).
- `i` is initialized to `n - 2`.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is `1`**.
