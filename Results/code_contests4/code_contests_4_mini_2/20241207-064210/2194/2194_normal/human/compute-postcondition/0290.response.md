Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18. If `zero` is at least 1 and `five` is at least 1, then `fin` remains unchanged and is less than or equal to 10^10; if `n` is 3, then `ans` is 1000000000000000; if `n` is greater than 3, then `ans` is `n - 2`. If `zero` is less than 1 or `five` is less than 1, then no changes are made to `ans` or `fin`.***
