The value of `j` is `n - 2`, which means `j + 1` is `n - 1`. The code assigns the value of `t[n - 1]` to `temp`. However, since the loop cannot execute a next iteration, the previous values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is incremented by 1; `j` is `n - 2`; `temp` is assigned the value of `t[n - 1]`.

Output State: **`ans` is incremented by 1; `j` is `n - 2`; `temp` is assigned the value of `t[n - 1]**
