The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is equal to the number of iterations executed from `i` to `n - 2`, `t` is the modified list after swaps, `j` is `n - 2`, `n` is at least 3, and `i` is `n - 3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
