`ans` is incremented by 1, and since the previous value of `ans` is 2, after execution, `ans` becomes 3. The values of `n`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 1`, `ans` is 3, `j` is `i + 2`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 1`, `ans` is 3, `j` is `i + 2**
