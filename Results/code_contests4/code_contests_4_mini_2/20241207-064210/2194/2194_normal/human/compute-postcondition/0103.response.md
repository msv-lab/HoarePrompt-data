The value of `t[j + 1]` is assigned the value of `t[j]`. Since `t[j]` is equal to `temp` (as stated in the initial state), `t[j + 1]` will also now hold the value of `temp`. The values of `n`, `i`, `j`, and `ans` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `i` is such that `i < n - 2`, `j` is `i + 2`, `ans` is 4, `t[j]` is now equal to `temp`, `t[j + 1]` is now equal to `temp`, and `temp` is now equal to `t[j + 1]`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is such that `i < n - 2, `j` is `i + 2`, `ans` is 4, `t[j]` is now equal to `temp`, `t[j + 1]` is now equal to `temp`, and `temp` is now equal to `t[j + 1]`.**
