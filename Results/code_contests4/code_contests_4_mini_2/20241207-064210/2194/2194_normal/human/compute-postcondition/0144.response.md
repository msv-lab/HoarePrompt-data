The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` was 0, so after execution, `ans` becomes 1. The values of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 1`, `ans` is 1, `j` is `i`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 1`, `ans` is 1, `j` is `i`**
