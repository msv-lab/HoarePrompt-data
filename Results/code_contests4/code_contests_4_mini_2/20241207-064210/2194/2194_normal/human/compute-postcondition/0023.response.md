The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, the element at index `i` of `t` is '0', `cnt` is now 2, and `ans` is decreased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
