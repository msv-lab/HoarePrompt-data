The value of `t[j + 1]` is assigned the value of `t[j]`. Since `j` is `i + 1`, this means `t[i + 1 + 1]` or `t[i + 2]` is assigned the value of `t[i + 1]`. The previous values of `t[j]` and `t[j + 1]` will change accordingly. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n - 1`, `ans` is increased by 1, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j]`, `j` is now `i + 1`, `t[i + 2]` is assigned the value of `t[i + 1]`**
