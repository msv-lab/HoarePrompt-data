The variable `ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` is `ans_initial + (n - 2 - 1) + 1`. The other variables `n`, `i`, `j`, and `t[j]` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 4, `i` is 1, `ans` is `ans_initial + (n - 2 - 1) + 1 + 1`, `j` is `n - 2`, and `t[j]` is the value originally at `t[1 + 1]`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 1, `ans` is `ans_initial + (n - 2 - 1) + 1 + 1`, `j` is `n - 2`, and `t[j]` is the value originally at `t[1 + 1]`**
