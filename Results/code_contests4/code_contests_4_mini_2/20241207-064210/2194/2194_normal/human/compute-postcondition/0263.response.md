The value of `t[j + 1]` is assigned the value of `t[j]`. Since `j` is `n - 2`, it means we are accessing the value of `t[n - 2]` and assigning it to `t[n - 1]`. The previous values of `ans`, `j`, and `temp` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is incremented by 1; `j` is `n - 2`; `temp` is assigned the value of `t[n - 1]` before the assignment takes place.

Output State: **`ans` is incremented by 1; `j` is `n - 2`; `temp` is assigned the value of `t[n - 1]` before the assignment takes place.**
