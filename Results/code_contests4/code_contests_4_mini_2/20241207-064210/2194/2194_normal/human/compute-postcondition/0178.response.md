The statement `t[j + 1] = t[j]` assigns the value of `t[j]` to `t[j + 1]`. Given that `j` is `n - 1`, it follows that `t[j]` is `t[n - 1]`. Hence, `t[j + 1]` becomes `t[n]`. The other variables are unaffected by this assignment.

Thus, the output state reflects the assignment but does not alter the values of `n`, `i`, `ans`, and `temp`. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `ans` is `n - i + 1`, `j` is `n - 1`, `temp` is `t[n]`, `t[n - 2]` is equal to `t[n - 1]; `t[n]` is now equal to `t[n - 1]`.**
