The variable `t[j]` is assigned the value `temp`. The values of `n`, `i`, `j`, and `ans` remain unchanged, as this assignment only affects `t[j]`. The value of `t[j]` now equals `temp`, and since `j` is equal to `i`, the assignment impacts the element at the index `j`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `i` is such that `i < n - 2`, `j` is `i`, `ans` is 2, and `t[j]` is now equal to `temp`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is such that `i < n - 2`, `j` is `i`, `ans` is 2, and `t[j]` is now equal to `temp`.**
