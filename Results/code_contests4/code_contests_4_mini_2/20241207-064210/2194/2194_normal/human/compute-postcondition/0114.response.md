The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` is `ans_initial + (n - 2 - i)`, and after executing `ans += 1`, the new value of `ans` becomes `ans_initial + (n - 2 - i) + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 4, `i` is 0, `ans` is equal to `ans_initial + (n - 2 - i) + 1`, `j` is `n - 2`, `t[j]` is the value originally at `t[i + 1]`, and the elements of `t` from index `i` to `n - 2` are shifted one position to the right. The first element of `t` is '0'. If `t[i]` is not '0', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
