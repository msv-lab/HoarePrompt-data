The value of `t[j + 1]` is assigned the value of `t[j]`. The previous state indicates that `j` is `i + 2`, which is at least 2 (since `i` is at least 0). Thus, `t[j + 1]` refers to `t[i + 3]`, and `t[j]` refers to `t[i + 2]`. The operation updates the value at index `j + 1` to be equal to the value at index `j`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 1`, `ans` is 3, `j` is `i + 2`, and `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`, which is now equal to `t[j]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 1`, `ans` is 3, `j` is `i + 2`, and `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`, which is now equal to `t[j]`.**
