The variable `t[j]` is assigned the value of `temp`, which was previously assigned the value of `t[j]`. The value of `j` is `i + 1`, and since `i` is in the range from 0 to `n - 2`, `j` will also be valid in the list `t`. The previous state of `t[j]` will now be replaced by `temp`, which holds the value of `t[j]` before this assignment. The states of `n`, `i`, `ans`, and `temp` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n - 1`, `ans` is increased by 1, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j]`, `j` is now `i + 1`, and `t[j]` is assigned the previous value of `t[j]`**.
