The variable `ans` is assigned the value `10 ** 15`, which is \(10\) raised to the power of \(15\). This results in \(1000000000000000\). The values of the other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1 and equal to 3, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `ans` is equal to 1000000000000000, `j` is `n - 2`, `temp` is equal to `t[n - 1]`, `t[n - 2]` is now equal to `t[n - 1]`, `t[n - 1]` is unchanged, `t[n]` is equal to `t[n - 1]`, and the first element of `t` is equal to '0'.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1 and equal to 3, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `ans` is equal to 1000000000000000, `j` is `n - 2`, `temp` is equal to `t[n - 1]`, `t[n - 2]` is now equal to `t[n - 1]`, `t[n - 1]` is unchanged, `t[n]` is equal to `t[n - 1]`, and the first element of `t` is equal to '0'.**
