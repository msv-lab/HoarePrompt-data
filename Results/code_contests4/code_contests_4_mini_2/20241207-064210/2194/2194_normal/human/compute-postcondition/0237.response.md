The value of `temp` is assigned the value of `t[2]`. The statement `t[j] = temp` assigns the value of `temp` (which is equal to `t[2]`) to `t[j]`. Since `j` is 1, `t[1]` will be updated to the value of `t[2]`. The values of `n`, `i`, `ans`, and `temp` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `i` is -1, `j` is 1, `ans` is at least 3, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[2]`, and `t[1]` is now equal to `t[2]`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is -1, `j` is 1, `ans` is at least 3, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[2]`, and `t[1]` is now equal to `t[2]**
