To analyze the provided code snippet, we first look at the variables involved and their initial states:

- `n` is greater than 0 (let's denote it as `n > 0`)
- `i` is `n - 1`
- The element at index `i` of `t` is '0' (this does not affect the calculation)
- `cnt` is greater than 0, and specifically, `cnt` is equal to 1

Now, let's break down the code snippet:

```
ans += n - 2 - i
```

1. First, we calculate the value of `i`:
   - Since `i = n - 1`, we can substitute this into the equation.
   
2. Next, we substitute `i` into the expression:
   - The expression becomes: `ans += n - 2 - (n - 1)`

3. Simplifying the expression:
   - `ans += n - 2 - n + 1`
   - This simplifies to `ans += -1`

The variable `ans` is updated, but we do not have its initial value. However, we can conclude that `ans` decreases by 1.

Since the values of `n`, `i`, and `cnt` remain unaffected by the operation, the output state focuses on the new state of `ans`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, the element at index `i` of `t` is '0', `cnt` is greater than 0, and `cnt` is equal to 1; `ans` is decreased by 1.**
