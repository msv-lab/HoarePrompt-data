The variable `ans` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `ans` is 5, so after execution, `ans` becomes 6. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 5, `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is 6, `j` is `n - 2`, `temp` is equal to `t[n - 1]`, `t[n - 2]` is now equal to `t[n - 1]`, `t[n - 1]` is unchanged, `t[n]` is equal to `t[n - 1]`, the first element of `t` is equal to '0', `n` is not equal to 3.

Output State: **`n` is at least 5, `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is 6, `j` is `n - 2`, `temp` is equal to `t[n - 1]`, `t[n - 2]` is now equal to `t[n - 1]`, `t[n - 1]` is unchanged, `t[n]` is equal to `t[n - 1]`, the first element of `t` is equal to '0', `n` is not equal to 3.**
