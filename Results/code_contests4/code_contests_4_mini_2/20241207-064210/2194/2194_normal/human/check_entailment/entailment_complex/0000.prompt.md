You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given an integer n from 1 to 10^{18} without leading zeroes.

In one move you can swap any two adjacent digits in the given number in such a way that the resulting number will not contain leading zeroes. In other words, after each move the number you have cannot contain any leading zeroes.

What is the minimum number of moves you have to make to obtain a number that is divisible by 25? Print -1 if it is impossible to obtain a number that is divisible by 25.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^{18}). It is guaranteed that the first (left) digit of the number n is not a zero.

Output

If it is impossible to obtain a number that is divisible by 25, print -1. Otherwise print the minimum number of moves required to obtain such number.

Note that you can swap only adjacent digits in the given number.

Examples

Input

5071


Output

4


Input

705


Output

1


Input

1241367


Output

-1

Note

In the first example one of the possible sequences of moves is 5071 → 5701 → 7501 → 7510 → 7150.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer input as a string (n) between 1 and 10^18, inclusive, and checks if n is divisible by 25. If it is, the function outputs 0. If not, it counts occurrences of the digits '0', '5', '2', and '7' in the string. The function attempts to calculate how many moves are needed to rearrange the digits to form a number that is divisible by 25, specifically by manipulating the positions of '0's, '5's, and '2's. If the calculated minimum number of moves (fin) exceeds 10^10, it prints -1; otherwise, it prints the calculated minimum moves. The function may not handle all possible rearrangements correctly, particularly for cases that involve more complex digit combinations or additional digits beyond the specified ones.

The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
