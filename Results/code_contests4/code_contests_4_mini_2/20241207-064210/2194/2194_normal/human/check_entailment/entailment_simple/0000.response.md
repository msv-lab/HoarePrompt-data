Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Divisibility by 25**: The problem states that the resulting number must be divisible by 25. A number is divisible by 25 if it ends with "00", "25", "50", or "75". The program only checks for pairs of '0's and '5's, and counts moves assuming that the configurations leading to these pairs will be sufficient. It does not correctly consider the need for combinations of digits forming the necessary endings for divisibility by 25.

2. **Logic Flaws**: The program logic appears to focus heavily on counting the occurrences of certain digits ('0', '5', '2', '7') and swaps without ensuring that the final number formed can actually be one of the valid endings for divisibility by 25. For example, the logic about finding '2' and '5' does not guarantee that they will end up in valid positions to form "25" or "75".

3. **Handling of Leading Zeroes**: The program has specific checks for leading zeroes but does not comprehensively ensure that all configurations maintain the requirement of not having leading zeroes after the required swaps.

4. **Output for Impossible Cases**: The handling of the output for cases where it is impossible to achieve a number divisible by 25 is incorrect. The program uses an arbitrary high value (10^15) for certain conditions, rather than directly checking for the impossibility based on the configurations of digits available.

5. **Inefficient Logic**: The implementation of the logic through repeated counting and swapping does not efficiently or correctly simulate the conditions and constraints of the problem description.

Overall, the program fails to implement a correct and comprehensive approach to determining the minimum number of moves to rearrange the digits of the integer `n` to meet the conditions specified in the problem description. Consequently, it does not fulfill the requirements as set forth.
