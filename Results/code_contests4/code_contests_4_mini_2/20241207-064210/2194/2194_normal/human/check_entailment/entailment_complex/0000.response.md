Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic needed to determine the minimum number of adjacent swaps required to rearrange a number so that it becomes divisible by 25. Here are the specific issues that lead to this conclusion:

1. **Divisibility by 25**: A number is divisible by 25 if it ends in either 00, 25, 50, or 75. The program appears to only check for the presence of '0's and '5's, but it doesn't correctly assess the necessary conditions for forming valid endings that make the number divisible by 25.

2. **Inadequate Move Calculation**: The approach taken in the program does not adequately account for all possible numbers that can be formed by swapping. For example, it does not consider the implications of needing to have both a '2' and a '5' in the right positions to form '25', or a '7' and a '5' to form '75'. The code does not handle the fact that simply counting digits does not guarantee that a valid arrangement can be made with the required swaps.

3. **Handling of Leading Zeros**: The program contains logic that might lead to invalid states where a leading zero could occur after swaps, which violates the problem's requirement that the resulting number must not have leading zeroes.

4. **Output Logic**: The program seems to have a flawed logic in determining when to print `-1`. It uses an arbitrary threshold (`10 ** 10`) to decide when a solution is impossible, rather than ensuring that all conditions for forming a valid divisible number have been checked properly.

5. **Example Analysis**: The output for certain test cases does not follow the expected results. For instance, the program does not account for all combinations of digits correctly, leading to the possibility of returning incorrect minimum moves or failing to recognize when it's impossible to create a valid number.

Overall, the program's implementation and logic do not align with the requirements of the problem description, particularly in ensuring that any resultant number is valid and correctly determining the minimum number of moves required.
