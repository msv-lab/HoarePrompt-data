The function accepts variable arguments and keyword arguments, printing the arguments to a specified file with a customizable separator and end character. It handles printing without leading separators and can flush the output if requested. The function does not directly utilize the parameters `t`, `n`, `x`, and `a` as described in the annotations, which are irrelevant to its actual functionality.
