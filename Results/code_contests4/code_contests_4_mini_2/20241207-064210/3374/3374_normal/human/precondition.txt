t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases; for each test case, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the array, and x is an integer (2 ≤ x ≤ 10^9); a is an array of integers with length n where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The total length of all arrays across test cases does not exceed 10^5.
