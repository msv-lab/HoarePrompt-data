You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You have given an array a of length n and an integer x to a brand new robot. What the robot does is the following: it iterates over the elements of the array, let the current element be q. If q is divisible by x, the robot adds x copies of the integer q/x to the end of the array, and moves on to the next element. Note that the newly added elements could be processed by the robot later. Otherwise, if q is not divisible by x, the robot shuts down.

Please determine the sum of all values of the array at the end of the process.

Input

The first input line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 2 ≤ x ≤ 10^9) — the length of the array and the value which is used by the robot.

The next line contains integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the initial values in the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

Output

For each test case output one integer — the sum of all elements at the end of the process.

Example

Input


2
1 2
12
4 2
4 6 8 2


Output


36
44

Note

In the first test case the array initially consists of a single element [12], and x=2. After the robot processes the first element, the array becomes [12, 6, 6]. Then the robot processes the second element, and the array becomes [12, 6, 6, 3, 3]. After the robot processes the next element, the array becomes [12, 6, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3], and then the robot shuts down, since it encounters an element that is not divisible by x = 2. The sum of the elements in the resulting array is equal to 36.

In the second test case the array initially contains integers [4, 6, 8, 2], and x=2. The resulting array in this case looks like  [4, 6, 8, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1].
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) indicating the number of test cases; for each test case, n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the array, and x is an integer (2 ≤ x ≤ 10^9); the array a contains n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, x = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = [int(ai) for ai in input().split()]
        
        pow_x = [0] * n
        
        for i, ai in enumerate(a):
            cnt = 0
            while ai % x == 0:
                cnt += 1
                ai //= x
            pow_x[i] = cnt
        
        min_pow = min(pow_x)
        
        min_idx = pow_x.index(min_pow)
        
        func_2(sum(a) * (min_pow + 1) + sum(a[:min_idx]))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `a` is a list of integers of length `n`, `pow_x` is a list of integers where each element represents the count of how many times the corresponding element in `a` can be divided by `x`, `min_pow` is the minimum value from `pow_x`, `min_idx` is the index of the first occurrence of `min_pow` in `pow_x`, and `func_2` is called with the argument `sum(a) * (min_pow + 1) + sum(a[:min_idx])`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` (the length of an array) and `x`, followed by an array `a` of `n` integers. It calculates how many times each element in `a` can be divided by `x` and tracks the minimum count. Finally, it calls another function `func_2` with a calculated value based on the sum of the array and the minimum count. The function does not return any results directly but invokes `func_2`, which is expected to handle the final output.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 10^9; a is a list of integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The total sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func_2():
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        
        file.write(str(x))
        
        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `at_start` is False, `args` is a list of arguments, `x` has been written to the file for each element in `args`, and a separator has been written before each element except the first.
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`at_start` is False, `args` is a list of arguments, `x` has been written to the file for each element in `args`, a separator has been written before each element except the first, and the value written from `kwargs` is either the value of `end` or a newline character. If `flush` was True, the flush operation has been executed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts variable arguments and keyword arguments, printing the arguments to a specified file with a customizable separator and end character. It handles printing without leading separators and can flush the output if requested. The function does not directly utilize the parameters `t`, `n`, `x`, and `a` as described in the annotations, which are irrelevant to its actual functionality.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
