`ai` is updated by performing integer division with `x`. The value of `ai` before this operation is not given explicitly, but since `ai % x` must equal 0 for the loop to execute, we know `ai` is a multiple of `x`. After the operation, `ai` will be reduced by a factor of `x`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `pow_x` is updated at index 1 to the value of `cnt`, which is 0; `cnt` is 1; `a` must have at least 3 elements; `i` is 2; `ai` is updated by integer division with `x`.

Output State: **`pow_x` is updated at index 1 to the value of `cnt`, which is 0; `cnt` is 1; `a` must have at least 3 elements; `i` is 2; `ai` is updated by integer division with `x`.**
