`cnt` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cnt` is 2, so after execution, `cnt` becomes 3. The states of the other variables `i` and `ai` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `cnt` is 3; `i` is incremented by the total number of iterations executed; `ai` is adjusted to be greater than or equal to `x`.

Output State: **`cnt` is 3; `i` is incremented by the total number of iterations executed; `ai` is adjusted to be greater than or equal to `x**
