The function `func_1` accepts parameters as follows: `t` is an integer indicating the number of test cases, `n` is an integer representing the length of the array, `x` is an integer, and `a` is an array of integers. The constraints are: `1 ≤ t ≤ 100`, `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`, `2 ≤ x ≤ 10^9`, and `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9` for each element in the array `a`.

The function processes multiple test cases and returns different outputs based on the conditions defined within the function. Specifically:

Case_1: If a certain condition related to `x` and the elements in the array `a` is satisfied, the function will return a specific result for that test case.

Case_2: If another condition is met, the function will return a different result for that test case.

If none of the conditions are met, the function may return a default or error message.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `t`, an integer `n`, an integer `x`, and an array `a`, and to return results based on specific conditions evaluated for each test case. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, an integer `n` for the length of the array, an integer `x`, and an array `a` of integers. It evaluates conditions for each test case and returns results based on those conditions.**
