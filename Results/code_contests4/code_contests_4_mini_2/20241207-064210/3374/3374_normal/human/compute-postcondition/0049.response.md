The code snippet takes input for the variables `n` and `x`, which are assigned integer values after being parsed from a string input. The previous state of the other variables remains unchanged, as they are not affected by this input operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `a` is a list of integers, `pow_x` is a list of integers, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `min_pow` is the minimum value from `pow_x`, `min_idx` is the index of `min_pow` in `pow_x`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer.**
