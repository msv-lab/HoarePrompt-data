The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `i`, and the condition regarding `ai` and `x`) remain unchanged, so the output state reflects the updated value of `cnt`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `a` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `cnt` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `a` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `cnt` is increased by 1.**
