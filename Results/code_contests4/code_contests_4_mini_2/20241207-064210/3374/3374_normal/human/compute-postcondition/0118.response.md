The variable `cnt` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cnt` is not specified, but since it is being incremented, the new value will be whatever `cnt` was plus 1. The states of the other variables (`pow_x`, `i`, and `ai`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `pow_x` is a list with `cnt` at index `i` (1) incremented by 1; `i` is 1; `ai` is now a multiple of `x` reduced by a factor of `x, and for the loop to execute again `ai` must be greater than or equal to `x`.
