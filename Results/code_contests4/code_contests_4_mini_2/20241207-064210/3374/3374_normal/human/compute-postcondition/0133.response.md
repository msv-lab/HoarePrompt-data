According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `ai` and `x`. The loop will continue executing as long as `ai % x` equals 0. At the end of the last iteration, `ai` has been adjusted with `ai //= x`. Given that `i` is 2 and `cnt` is 2, we need to ensure that after the last division, `ai` is still divisible by `x` for the loop to execute again.

Since `ai` was adjusted to `ai //= x`, we need to ensure that `ai` is still a multiple of `x`. Therefore, `ai` must be greater than or equal to `x` before the next iteration to ensure that `ai % x` remains 0. 

Thus, to allow the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the condition regarding `ai`. 

State: **`pow_x` is updated at index 1 to the value of `cnt`, which is 2; `cnt` is 2; `a` still has at least 3 elements; `i` is 2; for the loop to execute again, `ai` must be greater than or equal to `x`**.
