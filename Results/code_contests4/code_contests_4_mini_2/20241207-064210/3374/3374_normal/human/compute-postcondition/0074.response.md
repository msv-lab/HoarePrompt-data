The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The values of `ai` and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `ai` is now `ai // x`, `cnt` is 3, `i` is now `i + 1`, and for the loop to execute again `ai` must have been at least `x * x` before the last division.

Output State: **`ai` is now `ai // x`, `cnt` is 3, `i` is now `i + 1`, and for the loop to execute again `ai` must have been at least `x * x` before the last division.**
