According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `ai` and `x`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `ai` is divisible by `x` (i.e., `ai % x` equals 0). At the end of the last iteration, `ai` has been modified to `ai // x`, which means `ai` has been reduced. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `ai` must still be divisible by `x`. Therefore, after the last iteration, we need to ensure that `ai // x` is still divisible by `x`. This can be expressed as:

1. The original `ai` must have been at least `x * x` before the division, so that after dividing by `x`, the result is still divisible by `x`.

Thus, the adjustment that needs to be made is to ensure that `ai` must be at least `x * x` after the last division, which means we can express it as:

State: **`ai` is now `ai // x`, `cnt` is 1, `i` is now `i + 1` and for the loop to execute again, `ai` must have been at least `x * x` before the last division**.
