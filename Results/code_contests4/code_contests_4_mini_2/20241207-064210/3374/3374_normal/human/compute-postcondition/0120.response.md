According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ai`. If `ai` is a multiple of `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ai` is now a multiple of `x`, reduced by a factor of `x`. For the loop to execute again, `ai` must be greater than or equal to `x`. Since `ai` was previously a multiple of `x` and has been reduced by a factor of `x`, it is currently less than `x`. Therefore, for the loop to execute once more, `ai` needs to be adjusted to be at least equal to `x`. 

State: **`pow_x` is a list with `cnt` at index `i` (1) incremented by 1; `i` is 1; `ai` is now a multiple of `x` reduced by a factor of `x; and for the loop to execute again, `ai` must be adjusted to be greater than or equal to `x`**.
