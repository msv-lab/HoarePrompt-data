According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `ai` and `x`. The loop will continue as long as `ai` is divisible by `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `ai` has been adjusted with `ai //= x`. This means that for the loop to execute again, `ai` must still be divisible by `x` after the division. 

Since `ai` has been modified, we need to ensure that the new value of `ai` is still divisible by `x`. Therefore, `ai` must be adjusted to be equal to `k * x` for some integer `k` greater than or equal to 1, where `k` is the quotient of `ai` before the last iteration divided by `x`.

State: **`pow_x` is a list of zeros with length `n`, `cnt` is 2, `i` is 0, and for the loop to execute again `ai` must be adjusted to be greater than 0 and divisible by `x`**
