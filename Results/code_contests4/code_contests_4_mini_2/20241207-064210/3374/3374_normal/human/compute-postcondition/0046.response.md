The variable `min_idx` is assigned the index of the minimum value in the list `pow_x`, which is represented by `min_pow`. The previous values of `pow_x` and `min_pow` are not directly affected, but `min_idx` will hold the position of `min_pow` in the list. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `a` is a list of integers, `pow_x` is a list of integers, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `min_pow` is the minimum value from `pow_x`, and `min_idx` is the index of `min_pow` in `pow_x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `a` is a list of integers, `pow_x` is a list of integers, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `min_pow` is the minimum value from `pow_x`, `min_idx` is the index of `min_pow` in `pow_x`**.
