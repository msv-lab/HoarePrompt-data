The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value from 1 to 2. The values of the other variables, specifically `i` and `ai`, are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `cnt` is 2, `i` is incremented by the total number of iterations executed, and for the loop to execute again `ai` must be a multiple of `x` (i.e., `ai` must be greater than or equal to `x`).

Output State: **`cnt` is 2, `i` is incremented by the total number of iterations executed, and for the loop to execute again `ai` must be a multiple of `x` (i.e., `ai` must be greater than or equal to `x`.**
