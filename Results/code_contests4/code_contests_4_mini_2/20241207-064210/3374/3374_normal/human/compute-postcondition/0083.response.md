According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ai` and its relationship to `x`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `ai` is divisible by `x` (i.e., `ai % x == 0`). At the end of the last iteration, `ai` has been assigned the value `ai // x`, which means that `ai` has been reduced. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `ai` must still be divisible by `x` after the last iteration. This means that the value of `ai` before the last iteration must have been such that, when divided by `x`, the result is still divisible by `x`.

Since `ai` is now reduced, it could be that it is no longer divisible by `x`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `ai` to ensure that it is divisible by `x`. The minimum requirement for `ai` to be divisible by `x` after the last iteration is that `ai` must have been at least `x` before the last division.

State: **`cnt` is 1, `i` is incremented by the total number of iterations executed, and for the loop to execute again `ai` must be a multiple of x (i.e., `ai` must be greater than or equal to `x`)**
