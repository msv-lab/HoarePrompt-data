The value of `ai` is updated by performing integer division by `x`, which means `ai` is divided by `x` and the result is rounded down to the nearest integer. However, the initial values of `ai` and `x` are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value of `ai` after this operation. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `pow_x` is a list of zeros with length `n`, `cnt` is 2, `i` is 0, and `ai` has been adjusted to `ai //= x`.

Output State: **`pow_x` is a list of zeros with length `n`, `cnt` is 2, `i` is 0, and `ai` has been adjusted to `ai //= x**
