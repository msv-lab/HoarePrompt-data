The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value from 0 to 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is not directly modified by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `cnt` is 1, `i` is incremented by the total number of iterations executed, for the loop to execute the first time `ai` must be divisible by `x` and `a` must have at least `i + 1` elements.
