The `file.write(str(x))` function writes the string representation of `x` to the file. Since `at_start` is True, the program does not write `sep` to the file, but it will write `x` to the file. The previous values of the variables are not affected by this operation, and since `x` is the first element in `args`, its value is defined but not specified in the initial state.

Therefore, the Output State is: `at_start` is True, `args` is a list with at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in `args`, and `x` is written to the file.

Output State: **`at_start` is True, `args` is a list with at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in `args`, and `x` is written to the file.**
