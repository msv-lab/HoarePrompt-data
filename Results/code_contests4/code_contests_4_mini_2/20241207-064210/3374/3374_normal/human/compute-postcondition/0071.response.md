The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, where its previous value is 1. Thus, after execution, `cnt` becomes 2. The other variables `ai` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ai` is now `ai // x`, `cnt` is 2, `i` is now `i + 1`, and `ai` must have been at least `x * x` before the last division for the loop to execute again.

Output State: **`ai` is now `ai // x`, `cnt` is 2, `i` is now `i + 1`, and `ai` must have been at least `x * x` before the last division for the loop to execute again.**
