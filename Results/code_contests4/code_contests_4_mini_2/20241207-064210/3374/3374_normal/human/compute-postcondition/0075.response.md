The value of `ai` is updated by performing integer division with `x`, which means `ai` is now `ai // x`. The previous condition stated that for the loop to execute again, `ai` must have been at least `x * x` before the last division, which indicates that `ai` was sufficiently large to allow for this division. The values of `cnt` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ai` is now `ai // x`, `cnt` is 3, `i` is now `i + 1`.

Output State: **`ai` is now `ai // x`, `cnt` is 3, `i` is now `i + 1**
