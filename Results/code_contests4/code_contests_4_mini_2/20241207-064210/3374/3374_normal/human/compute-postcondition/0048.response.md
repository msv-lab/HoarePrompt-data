According to the code, the loop iterates `t` times. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, indicating the total number of times the loop is supposed to run. The variable `_` serves as a placeholder for the loop counter, which is not typically used in the loop body.

At the end of the last iteration, the loop has completed one iteration, so we need to increment the loop counter. Since the loop is designed to iterate `t` times, and given that `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `min_pow` is the minimum value from `pow_x`, and `min_idx` is the index of `min_pow` in `pow_x`, these variables remain unchanged for the next iteration.

To execute the loop one more time, the loop counter (which is not explicitly tracked in this context) would need to be effectively incremented to reflect the next iteration. Therefore, the state must indicate that one additional iteration will occur. 

State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `a` is a list of integers, `pow_x` is a list of integers, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `min_pow` is the minimum value from `pow_x`, `min_idx` is the index of `min_pow` in `pow_x`, and `func_2` is called with the argument `sum(a) * (min_pow + 1) + sum(a[:min_idx])` for the loop to execute a second time.**
