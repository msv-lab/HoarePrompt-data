Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `a` is a list of integers of length `n`, `pow_x` is a list of integers where each element represents the count of how many times the corresponding element in `a` can be divided by `x`, `min_pow` is the minimum value from `pow_x`, `min_idx` is the index of the first occurrence of `min_pow` in `pow_x`, and `func_2` is called with the argument `sum(a) * (min_pow + 1) + sum(a[:min_idx])`.**
