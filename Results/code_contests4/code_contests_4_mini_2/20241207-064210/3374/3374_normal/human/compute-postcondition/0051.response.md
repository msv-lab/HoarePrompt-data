The value of `pow_x` is assigned a new list containing `n` zeros, as `[0] * n` creates a list of length `n`, all initialized to 0. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `pow_x` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `min_pow` is the minimum value from `pow_x`, `min_idx` is the index of `min_pow` in `pow_x`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is the list of integers from input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `pow_x` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `min_pow` is the minimum value from `pow_x`, `min_idx` is the index of `min_pow` in `pow_x`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is the list of integers from input.**
