The value at index `i` (which is 1) of the list `pow_x` is assigned the value of `cnt`. The initial state specifies that `cnt` represents the number of times `ai` was divisible by `x`, but since `ai` is now not divisible by `x`, we can infer that `cnt` is likely 0. Therefore, after executing the code, `pow_x[1]` will be updated to the value of `cnt`.

The output state would be: `pow_x` is updated at index 1 to the value of `cnt`, which is 0.

Output State: **`pow_x` is updated at index 1 to the value of `cnt`, which is 0.**
