According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the contents of the `args` list. Since `args` has at least 1 element, the loop has executed at least once. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is the first element in `args`, which means that the loop is currently at the start of the list. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `args` must have at least 2 elements, and `x` would then be the second element in the list. The index of the current element `x` will be incremented.

State: **`at_start` is False, `args` is a list with at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in `args`**
