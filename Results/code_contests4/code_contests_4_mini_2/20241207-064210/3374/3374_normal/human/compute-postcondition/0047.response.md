To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state:

1. **Variables Defined**:
   - `t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100).
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `pow_x` is a list of integers.
   - `i` is equal to the length of `a`.
   - `min_pow` is the minimum value from `pow_x`.
   - `min_idx` is the index of `min_pow` in `pow_x`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The expression `sum(a)` calculates the total sum of the integers in the list `a`.
   - The expression `min_pow + 1` computes the value of `min_pow` increased by 1.
   - The expression `sum(a[:min_idx])` calculates the sum of the elements in `a` from the start up to (but not including) the index `min_idx`.

3. **Impact on Output**:
   - The function `func_2` is called with the argument that results from the entire expression `sum(a) * (min_pow + 1) + sum(a[:min_idx])`.
   - No variables are modified directly; rather, a computation occurs based on the existing variables.

Considering the above points, the output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `a` is a list of integers, `pow_x` is a list of integers, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `min_pow` is the minimum value from `pow_x`, `min_idx` is the index of `min_pow` in `pow_x`, and `func_2` is called with the argument `sum(a) * (min_pow + 1) + sum(a[:min_idx])`.**
