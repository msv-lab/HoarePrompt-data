The variable `pow_x` at index `i` is assigned the value of `cnt`. The value of `cnt` is equal to the number of times `a[2]` was divisible by `x`, and `i` is 2. Therefore, `pow_x[2]` is assigned the value of `cnt`. Since the initial values of `t`, `a`, `i`, and `cnt` do not change during this operation, the output state reflects this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `a` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `cnt` is equal to the number of times `a[2]` was divisible by `x`, and `pow_x[2]` is assigned the value of `cnt`.**
