The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables (`t`, `pow_x`, `i`, `min_pow`, `min_idx`, `n`, `ai`) are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `pow_x` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `i` is 0, `min_pow` is the minimum value from `pow_x`, `min_idx` is the index of `min_pow` in `pow_x`, `n` is an input integer, and `cnt` is increased by 1.
