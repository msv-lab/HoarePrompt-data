The values of the variables do not change, but we are extracting `sep` and `file` from `kwargs` with default values of `' '` and `sys.stdout`, respectively. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5 and `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^9; `a` is a list of integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; the total sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5; `sep` is the value obtained from `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, and `file` is the value obtained from `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)`.
