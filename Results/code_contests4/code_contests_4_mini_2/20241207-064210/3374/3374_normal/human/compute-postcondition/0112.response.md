According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `a`. If `i` is less than the length of `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `ai` is adjusted to the value after all possible divisions by `x`. For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` will be 1, and `ai` will be the second element in the list `a`.

State: **`pow_x` is a list with `cnt` at index `i`, `cnt` is equal to the number of times `ai` can be divided by `x`, `i` is 1, and `ai` is the second element in the list `a`**
