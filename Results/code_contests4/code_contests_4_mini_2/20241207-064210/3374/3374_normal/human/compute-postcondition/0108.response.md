The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, so it changes from 2 to 3. The previous values of the other variables (`pow_x`, `i`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `pow_x` is a list of zeros with length `n`, `cnt` is 3, `i` is 0, and for the loop to execute again `ai` must be adjusted to be greater than 0 and divisible by `x`.

Output State: **`pow_x` is a list of zeros with length `n`, `cnt` is 3, `i` is 0, and for the loop to execute again `ai` must be adjusted to be greater than 0 and divisible by `x`**.
