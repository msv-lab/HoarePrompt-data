The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `cnt` is unknown. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `i`) remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `a` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `cnt` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `a` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `cnt` is increased by 1**
