`ai` is updated by performing integer division with `x`. Since `ai` is divisible by `x`, the result of `ai //= x` will be a whole number. The variable `cnt` is not affected, and `i` is updated to `i + 1`, but that change is not reflected in this specific code snippet. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `ai` after the integer division, which remains divisible by `x`, alongside the unchanged values of `cnt` and `i`.

Output State: **`ai` is now `ai // x`, `cnt` is 1, `i` is now `i + 1**
