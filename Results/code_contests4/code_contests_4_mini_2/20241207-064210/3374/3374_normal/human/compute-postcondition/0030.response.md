The variable `pow_x[i]` is assigned the value of `cnt`. The variable `cnt` represents the total number of times `ai` was divisible by `x`, and `i` is currently 1. Therefore, after execution, `pow_x[1]` will equal `cnt`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `ai` is the value of the second element of `a` after all possible divisions by `x`, `cnt` is the total number of times `ai` was divisible by `x`, `pow_x[0]` remains equal to `cnt`, `pow_x[1]` is equal to `cnt`.**
