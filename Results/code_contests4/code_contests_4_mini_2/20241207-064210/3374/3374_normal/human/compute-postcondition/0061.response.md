The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cnt` is unknown, but it is increased by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `pow_x` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `i` is 0, `min_pow` is the minimum value from `pow_x`, `min_idx` is the index of `min_pow` in `pow_x`, `n` is an input integer, `cnt` is increased by 1, and for the loop to execute again `ai` is adjusted to be divisible by `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `pow_x` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `i` is 0, `min_pow` is the minimum value from `pow_x`, `min_idx` is the index of `min_pow` in `pow_x`, `n` is an input integer, `cnt` is increased by 1, and for the loop to execute again `ai` is adjusted to be divisible by `x`.**
