The variable `cnt` is assigned the value `0`. The previous value of `cnt` is unspecified, but it's being reset to `0`. The values of `pow_x`, `i`, and `ai` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `pow_x` is a list with `cnt` at index `i`, `cnt` is now 0, `i` is 1, and `ai` is the second element in the list `a`.

Output State: **`pow_x` is a list with `cnt` at index `i`, `cnt` is now 0, `i` is 1, and `ai` is the second element in the list `a**.
