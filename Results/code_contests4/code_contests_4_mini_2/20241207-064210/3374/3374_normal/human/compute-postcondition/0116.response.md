The variable `ai` is assigned the value of `ai // x`, where `//` denotes integer division. The initial state specifies that `ai` is a multiple of `x`, which means that `ai // x` will yield a whole number, reducing `ai` by a factor of `x`. The other variables, `pow_x`, `cnt`, and `i`, remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `pow_x` is a list with `cnt` at index `i` (1) incremented by 1; `i` is 1; `ai` is now a multiple of `x` reduced by a factor of `x`.

Output State: **`pow_x` is a list with `cnt` at index `i` (1) incremented by 1; `i` is 1; `ai` is now a multiple of `x` reduced by a factor of `x.**
