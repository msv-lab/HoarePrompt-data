The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `cnt` is unknown (it is currently at index `i` which is 1, and that value is not specified). However, since `cnt` is being incremented, we can say that it will be increased by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `pow_x` is a list with `cnt` at index `i` (1), which is incremented by 1; `i` is 1; `ai` is a multiple of `x`.

Output State: **`pow_x` is a list with `cnt` at index `i` (1) incremented by 1; `i` is 1; `ai` is a multiple of `x**.
