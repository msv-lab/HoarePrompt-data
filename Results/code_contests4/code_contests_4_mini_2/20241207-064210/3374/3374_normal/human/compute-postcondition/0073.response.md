According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ai` and `x`. The loop continues to execute as long as `ai` is divisible by `x` (i.e., `ai % x` equals 0). At the end of the last iteration, `ai` is now `ai // x`, which implies that `ai` has been reduced by a factor of `x`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `ai` must still be divisible by `x`. Since `ai` has already been divided by `x`, we need to ensure that the current value of `ai` after the division is still divisible by `x`. This can be achieved if the value of `ai` before the division was at least `x` (i.e., `ai` was `>= x`), and after the division, we need to ensure that `ai // x` is still divisible by `x` or `ai` is still greater than or equal to `x` after the operation.

Thus, for the loop to continue, we can conclude that before the division, `ai` should have been at least `x * x` (to still be divisible by `x` after being divided once). 

State: **`ai` is now `ai // x`, `cnt` is 2, `i` is now `i + 1` and for the loop to execute again `ai` must have been at least `x * x` before the last division**
