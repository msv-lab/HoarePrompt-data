`min_idx` is assigned the index of the first occurrence of `min_pow` in the list `pow_x`. The values of `pow_x`, `n`, and `min_pow` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `pow_x` is a list where each element at index `i` contains the count of how many times the corresponding element in `a` can be divided by `x`; `n` is the length of list `a`; `min_pow` is the minimum value from `pow_x`; `min_idx` is the index of the first occurrence of `min_pow` in `pow_x`.
