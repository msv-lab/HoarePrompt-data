`pow_x[i]` is assigned the value of `cnt`. The variable `cnt` represents the total number of times `ai` was divisible by `x`, and `i` is 2. The previous value at index 1 of `pow_x` has been updated. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `pow_x` is updated at index 2 to the value of `cnt`, `cnt` is the total number of times `ai` was divisible by `x`, `a` still has at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, and `ai` is the final value after all divisions by `x`.

Output State: **`pow_x` is updated at index 2 to the value of `cnt`, `cnt` is the total number of times `ai` was divisible by `x`, `a` still has at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `ai` is the final value after all divisions by `x`.**
