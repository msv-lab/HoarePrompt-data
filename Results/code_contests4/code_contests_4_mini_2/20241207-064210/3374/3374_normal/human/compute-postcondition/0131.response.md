The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, and since the previous value of `cnt` is 1, after execution, `cnt` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `pow_x` is updated at index 1 to the value of `cnt`, which is now 2; `cnt` is 2; `a` still has at least 3 elements; `i` is 2; and `ai` must be adjusted to ensure `ai % x == 0`.
