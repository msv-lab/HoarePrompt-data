The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The other variables `pow_x`, `a`, and `i` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `pow_x` is updated at index 1 to the value of `cnt`, which is 2; `cnt` is 3; `a` still has at least 3 elements; `i` is 2; for the loop to execute again, `ai` must be greater than or equal to `x`.
