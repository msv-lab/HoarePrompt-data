`cnt` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cnt` is 0, so after execution, `cnt` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `ai` is divisible by `x`, `cnt` is 1, `i` is now `i + 1`.

Output State: **`ai` is divisible by `x`, `cnt` is 1, `i` is now `i + 1**
