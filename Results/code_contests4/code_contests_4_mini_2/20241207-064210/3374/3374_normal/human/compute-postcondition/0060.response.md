According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ai` and `x`. The loop can execute again if `ai` is divisible by `x`, which means `ai % x` must equal 0. At the end of the last iteration, `ai` has been divided by `x`, thus it may not be guaranteed that `ai` is still divisible by `x`. 

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `ai` must be adjusted to a value that is still divisible by `x`. Therefore, we need to set `ai` to a value that, when divided by `x`, still results in a remainder of 0.

State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `pow_x` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `i` is 0, `min_pow` is the minimum value from `pow_x`, `min_idx` is the index of `min_pow` in `pow_x`, `n` is an input integer, `cnt` is increased by 1, and for the loop to execute again `ai` is adjusted to be divisible by `x`**
