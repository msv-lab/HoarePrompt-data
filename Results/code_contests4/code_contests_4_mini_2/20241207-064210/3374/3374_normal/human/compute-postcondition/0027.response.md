The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The other variables `t`, `a`, `i`, and `pow_x[0]` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `cnt` is 3, and `pow_x[0]` remains 2.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `cnt` is 3, and `pow_x[0]` remains 2.**
