Output State: **`pow_x` is a list where each element at index `i` contains the count of how many times the corresponding element in `a` can be divided by `x`; `n` is the length of list `a`; `min_pow` is the minimum value from `pow_x`; `min_idx` is the index of the first occurrence of `min_pow` in `pow_x`; the result of `func_2(sum(a) * (min_pow + 1) + sum(a[:min_idx]))` is calculated based on these values.**
