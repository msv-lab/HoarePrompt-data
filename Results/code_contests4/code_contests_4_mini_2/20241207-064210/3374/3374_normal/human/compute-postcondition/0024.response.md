The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, `x`, and `a`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, indicating the number of elements in the list.
- `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, which likely serves as a threshold or divisor.
- `a` is a list of integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the values to be processed in the test cases.

Based on the output description, the function likely processes these inputs to produce results based on certain conditions or computations related to the values in `a`, but the exact nature of these computations is not specified.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept multiple test case parameters, including an integer `t`, an integer `n`, an integer `x`, and a list of integers `a`, and perform operations based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters t (number of test cases), n (number of elements in the list), x (an integer threshold), and a (a list of integers), and processes them to produce results based on the inputs.**
