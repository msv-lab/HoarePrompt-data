The statement `ai //= x` means that the element at index `i` of list `a` will be divided by `x` using integer division and assigned back to that element. The value of `x` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the specific result of the operation. However, `cnt` has already been noted to be increased by 1, but its previous value is unknown.

Given the above information, the output state will reflect the change in the list `a` and the increment of `cnt`, but we cannot specify the exact value of `ai` post-operation due to the lack of information about `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `a` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `cnt` is increased by 1, and `ai` has been updated to `ai // x`.**
