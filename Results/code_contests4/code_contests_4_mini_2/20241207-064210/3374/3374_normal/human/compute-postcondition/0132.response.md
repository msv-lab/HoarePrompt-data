`ai` is reassigned to the value of `ai // x`. The initial value of `ai` is not provided, but we know that it must be adjusted to ensure `ai % x == 0`. This operation performs integer division, which will change the value of `ai` based on its previous value and the value of `x`. However, since we don't know the specific values of `ai` or `x`, we cannot determine the exact new value of `ai`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`pow_x` is updated at index 1 to the value of `cnt`, which is 2; `cnt` is 2; `a` still has at least 3 elements; `i` is 2; `ai` is adjusted as `ai //= x`**.
