According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ai` and the value of `x`. The loop will continue as long as `ai` is a multiple of `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `ai` is currently a multiple of `x` reduced by a factor of `x`. To determine if the loop can execute again, we need to check if `ai` is still a multiple of `x`. 

Since `ai` was a multiple of `x` and has been reduced by a factor of `x`, it is now `ai / x`. For the loop to execute one more time, `ai` must still be a multiple of `x` after this reduction. This means that `ai` must currently be greater than or equal to `x` (i.e., `ai` should be at least `x` so that when it is divided by `x`, it remains a non-zero integer).

State: **`pow_x` is a list with `cnt` at index `i` (1) incremented by 1; `i` is 1; ai is now a multiple of `x` reduced by a factor of `x, and for the loop to execute again ai must be greater than or equal to x**
