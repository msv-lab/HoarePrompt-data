According to the code, the loop is governed by the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than the current iteration count, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `pow_x` remains unchanged, `min_pow` is the minimum value in `pow_x`, and `min_idx` is the index of `min_pow` in `pow_x`. Since the loop uses `_` as the loop variable, it does not affect any state directly. For the loop to execute one more time, the iteration count must be less than `t`.

Assuming that the loop has executed `k` times so far, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than `t`. We will increment the loop iteration count, which is implicit in the use of `_`.

State: **`pow_x` remains unchanged, `min_pow` is the minimum value in `pow_x`, `min_idx` is the index of `min_pow` in `pow_x`, for the loop to execute a second time the iteration count must be less than `t`.**
