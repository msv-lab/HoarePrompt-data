The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` (the length of an array) and `x`, followed by an array `a` of `n` integers. It calculates how many times each element in `a` can be divided by `x` and tracks the minimum count. Finally, it calls another function `func_2` with a calculated value based on the sum of the array and the minimum count. The function does not return any results directly but invokes `func_2`, which is expected to handle the final output.
