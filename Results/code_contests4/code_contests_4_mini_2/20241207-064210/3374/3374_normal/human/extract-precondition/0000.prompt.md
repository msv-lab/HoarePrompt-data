You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: You have given an array a of length n and an integer x to a brand new robot. What the robot does is the following: it iterates over the elements of the array, let the current element be q. If q is divisible by x, the robot adds x copies of the integer q/x to the end of the array, and moves on to the next element. Note that the newly added elements could be processed by the robot later. Otherwise, if q is not divisible by x, the robot shuts down.

Please determine the sum of all values of the array at the end of the process.

Input

The first input line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 2 ≤ x ≤ 10^9) — the length of the array and the value which is used by the robot.

The next line contains integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the initial values in the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

Output

For each test case output one integer — the sum of all elements at the end of the process.

Example

Input


2
1 2
12
4 2
4 6 8 2


Output


36
44

Note

In the first test case the array initially consists of a single element [12], and x=2. After the robot processes the first element, the array becomes [12, 6, 6]. Then the robot processes the second element, and the array becomes [12, 6, 6, 3, 3]. After the robot processes the next element, the array becomes [12, 6, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3], and then the robot shuts down, since it encounters an element that is not divisible by x = 2. The sum of the elements in the resulting array is equal to 36.

In the second test case the array initially contains integers [4, 6, 8, 2], and x=2. The resulting array in this case looks like  [4, 6, 8, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1].
