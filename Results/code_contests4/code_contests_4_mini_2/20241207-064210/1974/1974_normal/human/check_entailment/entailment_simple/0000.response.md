Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements specified in the problem description. Here are the issues with the program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `input()` and `raw_input()`, which are not appropriate for handling integer and list inputs in Python 3. Furthermore, the program does not correctly parse the integers into a list format.

2. **Logic Flaw in Rearrangement**: The program tries to rearrange the statues by manipulating strings. It replaces '0' with spaces and attempts to find the index of the first statue in the desired order (`ff`), but this approach does not account for the adjacent movement rules specified in the problem. The islanders can only move statues from adjacent islands, but the program checks for string equality after shifting the string, which does not reflect the actual movement rules. 

3. **Inadequate Handling of the Empty Pedestal**: The current implementation does not properly manage the state of the empty pedestal and how it interacts with the statue movements. The logic fails to determine whether a statue can be moved to the empty pedestal based on its adjacency.

4. **Output Logic**: The output is solely based on string comparison, which does not capture the essence of the problem where rearrangements must follow the movement rules.

Due to these issues, the program does not reliably determine if the statues can be rearranged into the desired order based on the adjacency constraints set by the problem description. Hence, it fails to meet the requirements.
