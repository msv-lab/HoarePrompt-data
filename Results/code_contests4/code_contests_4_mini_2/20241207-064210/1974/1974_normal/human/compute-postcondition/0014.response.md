Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` and two lists of distinct integers `ai` and `bi`. It modifies these lists by removing the occurrence of the integer `0` and checks if the modified version of the second list `s` can be made equal to the modified version of the first list `f` by rotating it. If they are equal, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not handle inputs outside of the specified constraints and relies on the input format being correct, which may lead to unexpected behavior if the constraints are not met. **
