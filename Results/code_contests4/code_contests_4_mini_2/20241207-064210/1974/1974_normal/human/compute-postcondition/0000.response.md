The variable `n` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts an input from the user. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer between 2 and 200,000. Since `input()` will convert this to a string, and we are not performing any conversion or further operations, the value of `n` remains as it is provided by the user. The lists `ai` and `bi` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` is now a string input from the user.

Output State: **`n` is an input string; `ai` is a list of n distinct integers; `bi` is a list of n distinct integers.**
