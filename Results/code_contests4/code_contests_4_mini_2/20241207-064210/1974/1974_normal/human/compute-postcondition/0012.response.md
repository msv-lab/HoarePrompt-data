Postcondition: ***`n` is an input string; `ai` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `bi` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `f` has had '0' replaced with ' '; `s` is now a modified string; `ff` is the substring of `f` starting from index 1; `ss` is the index of the first occurrence of `ff` in `s` or -1 if not found. If `s` is equal to `f`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if `s` is not equal to `f`, 'NO' is printed.***
