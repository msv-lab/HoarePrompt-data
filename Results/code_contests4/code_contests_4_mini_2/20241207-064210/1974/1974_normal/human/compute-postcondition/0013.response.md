The function `func` accepts two parameters: `ai` and `bi`. `ai` is a list of `n` distinct integers, where each integer is between 0 and `n-1`. `bi` is also a list of `n` distinct integers with the same constraints. The parameter `n` is an integer that must be between 2 and 200,000. Both `ai` and `bi` contain exactly one occurrence of 0, indicating the position of the empty pedestal. The function processes these inputs and produces an output based on the relationships between the two lists. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: a list `ai` of n distinct integers and a list `bi` of n distinct integers, both having specific constraints, and processes them to produce an output based on the relationship between the two lists.**
