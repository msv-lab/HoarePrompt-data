To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and see if it can handle all potential cases as described.

The problem requires us to determine whether the statues can be rearranged in a circular arrangement based on the allowed movements. The approach taken by the program involves manipulating the input strings representing the current and desired state of the statues.

### Analyzing the Code

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The first input (`n`) is read but not converted to an integer, which is a minor issue but doesn't affect logic.
   - The second and third lines are read as strings and spaces are replaced to facilitate easier manipulation.

2. **Logic**:
   - The code identifies the first non-zero statue in the current arrangement and finds its position in the desired arrangement.
   - It then creates a new string `s` that is a rearrangement starting from the position of that statue in the desired arrangement.
   - Finally, it compares this newly arranged string with the cleaned-up current arrangement string.

### Potential Cases

1. **Case with All Statues**:
   - If we check a case where all statues are present and can be rearranged, the logic seems to work. For example:
   ```
   Input:
   3
   1 2 0
   0 1 2
   Output: YES
   ```
   The program would correctly identify the movements.

2. **Case with Empty Pedestal at Beginning**:
   - Consider the input:
   ```
   Input:
   3
   0 1 2
   1 0 2
   Output: YES
   ```
   The program would incorrectly output "NO" because it doesn't handle the circular nature properly for cases where the empty pedestal is at the start.

3. **Case with Complex Rearrangement**:
   - If we analyze the case provided in the problem:
   ```
   Input:
   4
   1 2 3 0
   0 3 2 1
   Output: NO
   ```
   The program will not be able to detect that the arrangement is impossible with its logic, leading to incorrect results.

### Conclusion

The program does not cover all potential cases, especially when the empty pedestal's initial position affects the possible movements. Specifically, it fails when the empty pedestal is not positioned to facilitate the desired rearrangement or when trying to manipulate statues that are not adjacent.

**Correctness: False** 

The program does not handle edge cases correctly, particularly when the empty pedestal is at the beginning or when the arrangement requires more complex movements.
