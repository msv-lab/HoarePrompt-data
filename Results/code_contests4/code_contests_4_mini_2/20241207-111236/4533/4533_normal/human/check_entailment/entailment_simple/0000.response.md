To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the key elements of the program and how they relate to the requirements.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Input**:
   - An integer `n` (number of houses).
   - A list of integers representing the number of floors in each house.

2. **Output**:
   - A list where each entry at index `i` gives the number of floors that need to be added to the `i-th` house to make it luxurious.

3. **Definition of Luxury**:
   - A house is luxurious if it has more floors than all houses to its right.

### Program Analysis
- **Input Handling**:
  - The program correctly reads `n` and the list of floor counts.

- **Logic**:
  - It iterates through the list of houses in reverse order (right to left).
  - It maintains a variable `m` which keeps track of the maximum number of floors seen so far from the right.
  - For each house, it calculates how many floors need to be added to make it luxurious:
    - If `m` (maximum from the right) is greater than or equal to the current house's floors `h`, it calculates how many more floors are needed.
    - The expression `m - h + 1` gives the additional floors needed, and it ensures that if the house is already luxurious, it returns `0`.

- **Output**:
  - The results are stored in a list `s`, which is printed in the correct order (by reversing the order of collection).

### Correctness Evaluation
1. **Correct Calculation**:
   - The calculation of how many floors to add is correct based on the definition of luxury, as it checks against the maximum floors of the houses to the right.
   - The adjustment `m - h + 1` correctly determines the additional floors needed, ensuring it is `0` if the house is already luxurious.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the smallest input sizes (n = 1) correctly.
   - It also handles cases where multiple houses have the same height or where all houses are increasing or decreasing in height.

3. **Efficiency**:
   - The algorithm runs in O(n) time due to a single pass through the list, which is efficient given the input constraints.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic required to determine how many floors need to be added to each house to make it luxurious according to the problem description. It accurately checks the conditions and outputs the results in the proper format.

Therefore, the final evaluation of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
