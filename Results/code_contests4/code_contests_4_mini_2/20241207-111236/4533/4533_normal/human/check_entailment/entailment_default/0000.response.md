To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the provided code and the hints.

### Problem Description Review:
The problem states that we need to determine how many additional floors need to be added to each house in a row of houses to make it luxurious. A house is considered luxurious if its number of floors is strictly greater than any house to its right.

### Program Review:
Here's what the program does:
1. It reads an integer `n` for the number of houses.
2. It reads the list of floor counts for each house.
3. It processes the floor counts in reverse order (from the last house to the first).
4. For each house, it calculates how many floors need to be added to make it luxurious by comparing it to the maximum number of floors seen so far to the right (`m`).
5. It builds a list of results, ensuring no negative values are returned (if the house is already luxurious, it returns 0).
6. Finally, it prints the results in the original order.

### Output Hints Review:
The output hints state:
- The function calculates the difference between the maximum floors encountered so far and the current number of floors.
- It ensures that it does not return negative values.
- It assumes valid input is always provided.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
1. **Single House**: If `n = 1`, the output should be `0` since the only house is inherently luxurious.
2. **All Houses Same**: If all houses have the same number of floors (e.g., `1 1 1`), the output should be a list of positive integers indicating how many floors to add to each (e.g., `1 1 1`).
3. **Sorted List**: If the list of houses is sorted in descending order (e.g., `4 3 2 1`), the output should yield a list of counts to make each house luxurious (e.g., `0 1 2 3`).
4. **Maximum Input Values**: Consider if `hi` takes the maximum value of `10^9`. The program logic should still hold.

### Conclusion:
The program seems to handle the main requirements well. The edge cases mentioned above align with the expected behavior of the program, and it correctly addresses the main task of determining how many floors need to be added for luxury status across all potential cases considered.

### Final Assessment:
After analyzing the code against the problem description and output hints, as well as considering potential edge cases, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic required to determine how many floors should be added to each house to make it luxurious, covering all necessary cases outlined in the problem description.
