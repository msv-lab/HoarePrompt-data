To determine the correctness of the given annotated Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the requirements and the implementation step-by-step.

### Problem Description Requirements:
1. The program must read a number of houses `n` and a list of their respective floor counts `h`.
2. For each house, it needs to calculate how many floors must be added to make that house "luxurious," which means it should have strictly more floors than any house to its right.
3. The output should be a list of integers where each integer represents the additional floors required for each house to be luxurious. If a house is already luxurious, the output should be `0` for that house.

### Annotated Program Analysis:
1. The function starts by reading an integer `n` and a list of integers representing the number of floors in each house.
2. It initializes `m` to `0`, which will be used to keep track of the maximum number of floors seen from the right end of the list as it processes the houses in reverse order.
3. The program iterates through the list of floors in reverse:
   - For each house, it calculates the difference between `m` (the maximum number of floors seen so far) and the current house's floor count `h`. 
   - It appends `m - h + 1` to the result list `s`, which indicates how many floors must be added to make the current house luxurious, ensuring that it does not go below `0`.
   - It updates `m` to be the maximum of the current house's floors and the previous maximum `m`.
4. Finally, the list `s` is reversed before printing to maintain the original order of the houses.

### Correctness Evaluation:
- The program correctly identifies the maximum number of floors to the right of each house and computes how many floors need to be added to make each house luxurious.
- The use of `max(h, m)` ensures that `m` always holds the highest floor count seen so far, which is crucial for determining if the current house is luxurious.
- The calculation `m - h + 1` correctly determines the number of floors to add, and the use of `max(0, m - h + 1)` ensures that if a house is already luxurious, it outputs `0`.

### Conclusion:
The implementation follows the problem description accurately and handles all cases as specified. It processes the input correctly and produces the expected output for each house according to the luxurious condition.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
