The variable `floors` is assigned the result of `map(int, sys.stdin.next().split(' '))`. This means that `floors` will be a map object containing integers converted from a space-separated string input from the standard input. The previous values of `n` and `hi` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is now a positive integer representing the number of houses based on input; `hi` remains unchanged as a list of positive integers; `floors` is a map object containing integers from input.

Output State: **`n` is now a positive integer representing the number of houses based on input; `hi` remains unchanged as a list of positive integers; `floors` is a map object containing integers from input.**
