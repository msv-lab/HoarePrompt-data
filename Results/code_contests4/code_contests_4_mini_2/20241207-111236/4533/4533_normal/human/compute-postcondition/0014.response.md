Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `floors` is a map object containing at least 1 integer; `h` is the first element of `floors`; `s` contains values calculated as `m - h + 1` or `0` for each element in `floors`, in reverse order; `m` is assigned the maximum value from all elements in `floors`; the output is the string representation of the elements of `s` joined by spaces and stripped of leading/trailing whitespace.**
