Functionality: ** The function reads a positive integer `n` representing the number of houses and a list of `n` positive integers indicating the number of floors in each house. It calculates the difference between the maximum floors encountered so far and the current number of floors, ensuring that it does not return negative values. The results are printed in the order corresponding to the original input of floors. The function does not handle cases where the input might be invalid or where `n` is 0, as it assumes valid input is always provided. **
