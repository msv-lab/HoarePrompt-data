The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `hi`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer representing the number of houses, constrained between 1 and 100,000 (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). The parameter `hi` is a list of `n` positive integers, where each integer represents the number of floors in each house, constrained between 1 and 1,000,000,000 (1 ≤ hi ≤ 10^9). 

The function does not have any explicit return statements provided in the output description. Therefore, we can infer that the function processes the input values in some way, but without specific return values given, we cannot determine what it returns. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of houses and a list `hi` of `n` positive integers representing the number of floors in each house.**
