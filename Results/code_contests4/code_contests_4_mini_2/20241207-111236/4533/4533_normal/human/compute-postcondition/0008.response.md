The value of `s` is updated by appending a formatted string to it. The new value appended to `s` is determined by the expression `m - h + 1 if m - h + 1 > 0 else 0`. The values of `m` and `h` are checked to compute this expression.

1. If `m - h + 1` is greater than 0, the value appended to `s` is `m - h + 1`.
2. If `m - h + 1` is not greater than 0, the value appended to `s` is `0`.

The rest of the variables (`n`, `floors`, and `h`) remain unchanged in this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated state of `s` after the append operation based on the condition.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `floors` is a map object containing at least 1 integer; `h` is the second last element of `floors`; `s` is updated with either `m - h + 1` or `0` based on the condition.**
