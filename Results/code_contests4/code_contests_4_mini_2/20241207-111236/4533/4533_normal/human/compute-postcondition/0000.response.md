The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(sys.stdin.next())`, where `sys.stdin.next()` accepts an input representing the number of houses. Other variables are not affected, so the output state reflects that `n` is now defined based on the input. 

Output State: **`n` is now a positive integer representing the number of houses based on input; `hi` remains unchanged as a list of positive integers.**
