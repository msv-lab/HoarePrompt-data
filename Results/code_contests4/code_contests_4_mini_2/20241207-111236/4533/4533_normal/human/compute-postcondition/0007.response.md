According to the code, the loop iterates over the `floors` map object in reverse order. The current state at the end of the last iteration indicates that `h` is the last element of `floors`, and the loop has processed the current `h`. To execute the loop one more time, it must proceed to the next element in the reversed `floors`. 

Since `floors` is a map object containing at least one integer, it means there are still elements left that can be iterated over. The last value of `h` is updated to the next element in the reverse iteration of `floors`.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `h` should now correspond to the next element in the reversed `floors`. If `floors` has at least 2 elements, then `h` will be the second last element, and `s` will be updated again based on the condition.

State: **`n` is a positive integer; `floors` is a map object containing at least 1 integer; `h` is the second last element of `floors`; `s` is updated with either `m - h + 1` or `0` based on the condition; `m` is assigned the maximum value between `h` and `m`.**
