To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze it in relation to the problem description.

The problem states that a house is considered luxurious if the number of floors in it is strictly greater than in all the houses to its right. We need to calculate how many floors need to be added to each house to make it luxurious.

The program reads the number of houses and their respective floor counts, processes them in reverse order, and calculates the number of floors needed to make each house luxurious. The logic involves keeping track of the maximum number of floors seen so far from the right and comparing each house's floors to this maximum.

Let's analyze the program step by step:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of houses and their respective floor counts.
2. **Reversal for Calculation**: The program processes the list of floors in reverse order to easily keep track of the maximum floors encountered so far.
3. **Luxurious Condition Check**: For each house, it checks how many floors need to be added:
   - If the current house's floors are less than or equal to the maximum seen so far, it calculates the difference and adds 1 to make it strictly greater.
   - If the current house's floors are already greater than the maximum, it appends `0`, indicating no floors need to be added.
4. **Output**: The results are reversed back to the original order before printing.

Now, let's consider potential edge cases:

- **Case of All Houses with Same Floors**: If all houses have the same number of floors, the last house will be luxurious (0 floors needed), while all previous ones will need to add enough floors to exceed that height. For example, with input `3 3 3`, the expected output should be `1 1 0`, indicating that the first two houses need 1 floor added each.
  
- **Case of Increasing Floors**: If the input is strictly increasing, such as `1 2 3 4`, each house should output `0` since they are already luxurious.

- **Case of Decreasing Floors**: For input `4 3 2 1`, the output should be `0 1 2 3`, because each house needs to add floors to exceed the previous house's height.

After carefully considering these edge cases, the program fails for the case where all houses have the same number of floors. For the input `3 3 3`, the program will incorrectly output `0 0 0` instead of the expected `1 1 0`.

Thus, since we found a case where the program does not work as expected, we conclude that:

Correctness: **False**.
