To evaluate the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let's analyze both the requirements and the implementation.

### Problem Requirements
The program is tasked with determining the minimum number of Jedi Knights that must be removed from a sequence so that a contiguous subsequence exists with exact counts of Jedi Knights of specified colors. If such a configuration cannot be achieved, the program should return -1.

### Program Analysis
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the values of `n` (the number of Jedi), `m` (the number of colors), the list of colors of the Jedi's lightsabers, and the desired counts of each color.

2. **Initialization**: 
   - It initializes a count array `c` for tracking the occurrences of each color in the current window.
   - It uses two pointers, `l` and `r`, to maintain the current window of Jedi being considered.

3. **First While Loop**: 
   - Expands the right pointer `r` until it has enough Jedi of each color according to the desired counts.
   - It decrements `t` (a tracker for how many colors have met their desired counts) as colors reach their required count.

4. **Early Exit**: 
   - If after attempting to expand the window, `t` is still greater than 0, it means the desired counts could not be fulfilled, and it prints `ans`, which is initialized to -1.

5. **Second While Loop**: 
   - This loop tries to minimize the window size while still meeting the color requirements.
   - It updates `ans` with the current window size minus the total desired counts, which gives the number of Jedi that would need to be removed to achieve the counts.

6. **Output the Result**: 
   - Finally, it prints the value of `ans`, which represents the minimum number of Jedi to remove, or the result of -1 if it's impossible.

### Correctness Evaluation
- The program correctly attempts to find a contiguous subsequence of Jedi that matches the required counts of each color.
- It uses a sliding window approach, which is appropriate for this type of problem.
- It ensures that if it cannot find such a contiguous subsequence, it appropriately returns -1.
- The calculation of `ans` is correctly done by considering the size of the window minus the required counts, thereby giving the minimum removals needed.

### Conclusion
After thorough analysis, the program meets the specifications outlined in the problem description. It handles all edge cases, including the scenario where it's impossible to find a valid interval.

Correctness: **True**
