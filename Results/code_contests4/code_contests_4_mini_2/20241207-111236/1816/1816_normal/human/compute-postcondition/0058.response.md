Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `r` is at least `l + k` (where k is the total number of iterations the loop executed), `l` is at least `initial l + k`, and `c[a[r]]` is incremented by k. The loop exits when either `r + 1` is no longer less than `n` or `c[a[l]]` is no longer less than `b[a[l]]`.**
