Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m`; `a` is a list of integers obtained by subtracting 1 from each integer input; `b` is a map object containing integers from the input; `s` is the sum of the integers in `b`; `c` is a list of integers with frequencies corresponding to the counts of integers in `b`; `l` is 0; `r` is the last index processed (where `r` will be equal to `n - 1` if `t` reaches 0); `ans` is the final answer; `t` is greater than 0 (indicating that not all elements have been processed as required by `b`).***
