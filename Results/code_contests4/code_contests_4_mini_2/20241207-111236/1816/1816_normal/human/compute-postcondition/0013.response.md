Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`; `a` is a list of integers obtained by subtracting 1 from each integer input; `b` is a map object containing integers from the input; `s` is the sum of the integers in `b`; `c` is a list of integers with one element increased by 1; `l` is 0; `r` is 0; `ans` is -1; `t` is `m - 1`. If `c[a[r]]` is equal to `b[a[r]]`, then `t` is updated to `m - 1`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
