In this case, `t` is assigned the value of `m`. The value of `m` is known and can be any integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive). Therefore, `t` will take the same value as `m`, which is between 1 and `n`. Other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`; `a` is a list of integers obtained by subtracting 1 from each integer input; `b` is a map object containing integers from the input; `s` is the sum of the integers in `b`; `c` is a list of zeros with length `m`; `l` is 0; `r` is -1; `ans` is -1; `t` is equal to `m`.**
