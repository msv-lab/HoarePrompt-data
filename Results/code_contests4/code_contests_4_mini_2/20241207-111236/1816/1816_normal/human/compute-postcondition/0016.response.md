The code increments the value of `c[a[r]]` by 1. The current value of `r` is increased by 1, which means it references the next index of the array `a`. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are not changed by this operation, but the value at index `a[r]` in array `c` is influenced, causing it to increase by 1. Since the exact current value of `a[r]` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact change in `c`, only that it has been incremented.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m`; `r` is now `r + 1; c[a[r]]` is incremented by 1.**
