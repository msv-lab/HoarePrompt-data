The value of `r` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `r` is at least `l + 2`, and since `l` is at least 3, `r` is at least 5. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `r` is at least `l + 2 + 1`, `l` is at least 3, `c[a[r]]` is incremented by 1, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 6 and `c[a[l]]` must be less than `b[a[l]]`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `r` is at least `l + 3`, `l` is at least 3, `c[a[r]]` is incremented by 1, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 6 and `c[a[l]]` must be less than `b[a[l]]`.**
