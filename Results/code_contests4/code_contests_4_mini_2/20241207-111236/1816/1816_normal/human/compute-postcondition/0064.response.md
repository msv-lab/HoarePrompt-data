According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `r`. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is at least `initial l + k` and `r` is at least `l + k`, which implies that `l` is less than or equal to `r`. 

Since `l` must be less than or equal to `r` for the loop to proceed, and given that `l` is incremented by 1 in the previous iteration, we need to ensure that `l` remains less than or equal to `r`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `r` is at least equal to the new value of `l` after the increment. 

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure `r` is at least `initial l + k + 1`.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `r` is at least `l + k`, `l` is at least `initial l + k`, `c[a[r]]` is incremented by `k`, `l` is incremented by 1, and for the loop to execute again `r` is at least `initial l + k + 1`**
