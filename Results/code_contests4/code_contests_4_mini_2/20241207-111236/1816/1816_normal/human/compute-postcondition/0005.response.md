The variables `l` and `r` are initialized to 0 and -1, respectively. The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `s`, and `c` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the assignment of `l` and `r`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`; `a` is a list of integers obtained by subtracting 1 from each integer input; `b` is a map object containing integers from the input; `s` is the sum of the integers in `b`; `c` is a list of zeros with length `m`; `l` is 0; `r` is -1.
