Postcondition: ***`r` is at least `l + k + m` where `m` is the number of times the loop executed, `l` is at least `initial l + k`, `c[a[r]]` is incremented by `m`, `n` remains at least 2, `c[a[l]]` is less than `b[a[l]]`, and the loop terminates when `c[a[l]]` is no longer less than `b[a[l]]` or `r + 1` is not less than `n`.***
