The code assigns values to `n` and `m` by reading a line of input, splitting it, and converting the parts into integers. The previous values of `n` and `m` are unknown because they depend on user input. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` and `m` are integers assigned through the input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`**
