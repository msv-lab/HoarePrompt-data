The value of `r` is incremented by 1, and its previous value is -1. Therefore, after execution, `r` becomes 0. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`; `a` is a list of integers obtained by subtracting 1 from each integer input; `b` is a map object containing integers from the input; `s` is the sum of the integers in `b`; `c` is a list of zeros with length `m`; `l` is 0; `r` is 0; `ans` is -1; `t` is equal to `m`**
