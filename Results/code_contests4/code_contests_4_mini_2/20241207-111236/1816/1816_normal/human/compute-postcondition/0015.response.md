The value of `r` is incremented by 1. The previous values of `r`, `n`, and `m` are not provided, but it is stated that for the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than 1 and `r` must be less than or equal to `n - 2`. Since we are incrementing `r`, it will now be `r + 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m`; `r` is now `r + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m`; `r` is now `r + 1**
