The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `r` is at least `l + k`, `l` is at least `initial l + k`, `c[a[r]]` is incremented by `k`, and `c[a[l]]` is less than `b[a[l]]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
