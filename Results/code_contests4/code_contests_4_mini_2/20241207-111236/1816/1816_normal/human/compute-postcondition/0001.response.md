The variable `a` is assigned the result of applying the `map` function to the input received from `raw_input()`. The `raw_input()` function reads a line of input, which is then split into individual string elements. Each element is converted to an integer and decremented by 1 using the lambda function. The specific values of the elements are not known, but they will be integers that are in the range of 0 to `n - 1` because `m` can range from 1 to `n`.

Thus, the output state reflects that `a` will contain a list of integers, each of which is one less than the corresponding integers entered by the user. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`; `a` is a list of integers obtained by subtracting 1 from each integer input.**
