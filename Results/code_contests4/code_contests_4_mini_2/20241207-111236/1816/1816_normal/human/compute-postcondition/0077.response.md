The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `r` is at least `l + k + m` where `m` is the number of times the loop executed, `l` is at least `initial l + k`, `c[a[r]]` is incremented by `m`, `n` remains at least 2, `c[a[l]]` is less than `b[a[l]]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
