The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2; `r` is the maximum index such that `r + 1 < n`; `c[a[l]]` is less than `b[a[l]]`; `c[a[r]]` has been incremented for each iteration of the loop; `c[a[l]]` remains decremented by 1; and `c[a[l]]` is still less than `b[a[l]]` after entering the if condition, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
