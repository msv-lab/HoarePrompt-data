Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `m`, followed by two lines of input: a list of `n` integers representing Jedi Knight lightsaber colors (where each color is represented by an integer from 1 to `m`), and a list of `m` integers indicating the desired counts of Jedi Knights for each color. It calculates the minimum number of Jedi Knights needed to satisfy the color requirements as specified in the second input list. If the requirements cannot be met, it outputs the initial value of `ans`, which is set to -1. Finally, it prints the calculated minimum value or -1 if the requirements are not achievable. **
