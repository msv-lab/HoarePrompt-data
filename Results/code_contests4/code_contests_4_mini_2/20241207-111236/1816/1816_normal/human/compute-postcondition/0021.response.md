The code `c[a[r]] += 1` increments the value at index `a[r]` in the array `c` by 1. The variable `r` is incremented by 1 prior to this operation, meaning it now points to the next index in array `a`. The previous value of `r` before incrementing is unknown, but we know `r` was incremented.

Since `n` and `m` are not directly affected by this line of code, they remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m`; `r` is incremented by 1; and `c[a[r]]` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m`; `r` is incremented by 1; `c[a[r]]` is increased by 1.**
