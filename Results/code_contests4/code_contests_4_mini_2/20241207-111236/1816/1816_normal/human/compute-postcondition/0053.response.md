The value of `r` is incremented by 1. Since `r` is already at least `l + 1`, it will now be at least `l + 2`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `l`, and any potential values in `c` and `b`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `r` is at least `l + 2`, `l` is incremented by 1, and the conditions for the loop to execute again are still valid.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `r` is at least `l + 2`, `l` is incremented by 1.**
