Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m`; `a` is a list of integers obtained by subtracting 1 from each integer input; `b` is a map object containing integers from the input; `s` is the sum of the integers in `b`; `c` is a list of integers with frequencies corresponding to the counts of integers in `b`; `l` is 0; `r` is the last index processed; `ans` is the final answer; `t` is 0 or greater; if `t` is greater than 0, the value of `ans` is printed and the program exits.***
