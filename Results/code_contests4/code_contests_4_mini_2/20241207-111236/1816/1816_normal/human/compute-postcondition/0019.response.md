To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we analyze the loop condition:

The loop will execute as long as both `t > 0` and `r + 1 < n` hold true. 

At the end of the last iteration, we have the following conditions:
- `t` is a non-negative integer (since it is decremented by 1 within the loop).
- `r` is an integer such that `r + 1 < n` must be satisfied, which means `r` must be less than `n - 1`.

Since we know:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000.
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m`.
- If `c[a[r]]` equals `b[a[r]]`, then `r` is incremented by 1, which means `r` may have changed.

Now, for the loop to execute one more time:
1. We need `t` to be greater than 0. If `t` was 1 at the end of the last iteration, it would need to be adjusted to be greater than 1.
2. We need `r + 1` to be less than `n`, meaning `r` needs to be less than `n - 1`. If `r` was at its maximum possible value such that `r + 1` is equal to `n`, then `r` must be adjusted to be less than `n - 1`.

Therefore, if `t` is currently 1 and `r` is equal to `n - 1`, we need to adjust both.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m`; if `c[a[r]]` equals `b[a[r]]`, then `r` is incremented by 1, `c[a[r]]` is incremented by 1, and for the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 1 and `r` must be less than `n - 1.**
