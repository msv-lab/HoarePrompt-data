The provided program appears to be designed for handling multiple queries about selecting two distinct integers from two given segments on the x-axis. However, upon closer inspection, the actual implementation in `func_15()` is incomplete and does not correctly handle the required logic to select and print the distinct integers `a` and `b`.

Here's the breakdown of the issues:

1. The function `func_15()` calls `func_16(l1, r2)`, which attempts to print `l1` and `r2`. This does not guarantee that the integers `a` and `b` are selected from the respective segments `[l_1; r_1]` and `[l_2; r_2]` such that `a ≠ b`.
2. It is possible that `l1` (which is in `[l_1; r_1]`) and `r2` (which is in `[l_2; r_2]`) could be equal, violating the requirement that `a` and `b` must be distinct integers.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
1 2 1 2
```
The output from the current implementation would be `1 2`, which does not satisfy `a ≠ b` since both integers are equal to `1` and `2`.

Thus, the program does not correctly implement the required logic for all possible cases, particularly when the endpoints of the segments overlap.

Correctness: **False**. 

The implementation fails to guarantee that the two selected integers are distinct, which is a requirement stated in the problem description.
