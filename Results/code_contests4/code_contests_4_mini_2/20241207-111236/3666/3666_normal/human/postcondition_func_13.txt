The function accepts an integer `x` and a non-negative integer `y`. It calculates `x` raised to the power of the number of 1s in the binary representation of `y`. If `y` is 0, the function returns 1, as there are no 1s in its binary representation. The list of tuples `y` is not used in the calculation, making the expected behavior of the function misleading based on the annotations.
