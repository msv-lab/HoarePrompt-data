The function accepts an integer `x`, which represents the number of queries, and a list `y` of tuples, each containing four integers (l1, r1, l2, r2). The function computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the integer `x` and the list `y`, which is expected to be treated as an integer under modulo operation. However, since `y` is a list, the operation `x % y` is not valid, leading to potential errors. If the function were to execute correctly, it would return the original list `y` as the output. Overall, the function appears to be incorrectly implemented as it does not handle the expected operations on the tuples contained in `y`.
