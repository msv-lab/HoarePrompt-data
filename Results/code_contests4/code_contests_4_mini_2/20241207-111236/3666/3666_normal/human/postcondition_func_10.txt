The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of queries. It returns `False` if `n` is less than or equal to 1, if `n` is less than or equal to 3, or if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3. It performs a check for primality by testing divisibility with integers starting from 5, incrementing by 6 each iteration. If `n` passes all checks, it returns `True`, indicating that `n` is a prime number greater than 3. Thus, the function primarily determines whether `n` is a prime number.
