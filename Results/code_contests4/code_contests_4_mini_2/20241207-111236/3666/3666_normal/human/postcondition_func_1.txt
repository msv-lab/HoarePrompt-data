The function accepts no parameters and simply returns the input provided by the user. The expected input is in the form of integers l1, r1, l2, r2, which should satisfy the conditions of being integers within specified ranges (1 ≤ l1 < r1 ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ l2 < r2 ≤ 10^9). However, since the function directly returns the input without validation, it does not enforce these constraints, potentially allowing invalid input.
