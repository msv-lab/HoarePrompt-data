The function does not accept any parameters but reads an integer `q` followed by `q` lines of four integers each, representing the endpoints of two segments on the x-axis. It returns a list of results obtained from executing `func_3()` based on these input segments. The exact behavior of `func_3()` is not specified in the provided code, so the nature of the results in the returned list is unknown without further context about `func_3()`.
