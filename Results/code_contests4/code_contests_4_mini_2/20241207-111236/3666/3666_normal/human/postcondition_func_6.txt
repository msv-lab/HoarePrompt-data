The function accepts a positive integer `n` and calculates the sum of its digits. It iterates through each digit of `n`, adding them together until `n` becomes 0, at which point it returns the calculated sum. If `n` is 0, the function will return 0, but since the input is always a positive integer, the function will always return the sum of its digits.
