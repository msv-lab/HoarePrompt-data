The function accepts no parameters and returns a map object containing four integers l1, r1, l2, and r2 read from the input. These integers are expected to satisfy the constraints 1 ≤ l1 < r1 ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ l2 < r2 ≤ 10^9. However, there is no validation implemented in the function to ensure that the input meets these constraints, so it relies on the user to provide valid input.
