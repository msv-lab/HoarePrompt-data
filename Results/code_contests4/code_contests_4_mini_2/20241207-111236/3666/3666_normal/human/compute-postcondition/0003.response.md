According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `args`. If `args` contains at least one tuple, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `sep`, `file`, and `at_start` do not influence the execution of the loop directly. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `args` must be a list containing at least one tuple, and `x` will be the first tuple in `args`.

State: **`sep` is either a provided separator or a space, `file` is either a provided file stream or sys.stdout, `at_start` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `args` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, and `x` is the first tuple in the list**.
