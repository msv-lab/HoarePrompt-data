Postcondition: ***`sep` is either a provided separator or a space; `file` is either a provided file stream or sys.stdout; `at_start` is False; `args` is a list of tuples; `x` is the last tuple in the list; something has been written to `file`. If `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` returns True, then the output buffer has been flushed.***
