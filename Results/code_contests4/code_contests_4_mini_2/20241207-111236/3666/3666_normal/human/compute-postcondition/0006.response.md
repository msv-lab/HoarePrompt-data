Postcondition: ***`sep` is either a provided separator or a space; `file` is either a provided file stream or sys.stdout; if `at_start` is False, the content of `sep` is written to `file`; `args` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, and `x` is the first tuple in the list. If `at_start` is True, no action is performed.***
