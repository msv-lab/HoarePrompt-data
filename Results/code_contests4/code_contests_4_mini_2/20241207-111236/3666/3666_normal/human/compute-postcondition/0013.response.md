The value of `at_start` is assigned `False`, but the previous value of `at_start` is already `False`, so the state of this variable remains unchanged. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is either a provided separator or a space; `file` is either a provided file stream or sys.stdout; `at_start` is False; `args` must be a list of tuples with at least 2 tuples; `x` is the second tuple in the list.
