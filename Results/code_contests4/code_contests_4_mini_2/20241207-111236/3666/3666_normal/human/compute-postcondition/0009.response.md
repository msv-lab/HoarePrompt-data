According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `args` list. If the list has more tuples, the loop will execute one more time for the next tuple in the list. At the end of the last iteration, `args` has at least 1 tuple, `x` is the first tuple in the list, and `at_start` is False. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `args` must have at least 2 tuples, `x` must be updated to the second tuple in the list, and the current position of iteration (which is not explicitly stated but can be inferred) will increment.

State: **`sep` is either a provided separator or a space; `file` is either a provided file stream or sys.stdout; `at_start` is False; for the loop to execute a second time `args` must be a list of tuples with at least 2 tuples, `x` is the second tuple in the list**.
