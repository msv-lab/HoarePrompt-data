According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `args` list. If the list has at least 3 tuples, the loop can execute again for the third tuple. At the end of the last iteration, `args` must contain at least 2 tuples, and `x` is the second tuple in the list. To execute the loop one more time, `args` must have at least 3 tuples, and `x` will then be the third tuple in the list.

State: **`sep` is either a provided separator or a space; `file` is either a provided file stream or sys.stdout; `at_start` is False; `args` must be a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples; `x` is the third tuple in the list.**
