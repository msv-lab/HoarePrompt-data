The function `func_16` accepts a parameter `args`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple consists of four integers: `l1`, `r1`, `l2`, and `r2`, with the constraints that 1 ≤ l1 < r1, 1 ≤ l2 < r2 ≤ 10^9. The number of tuples in the list is between 1 and 500. After executing the function body, the output is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, the exact return value is unclear based on the given details.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `args`, which is a list of tuples, each containing four integers, and operates on these tuples based on specified constraints. The exact return value is not specified.**
