Postcondition: ***`sep` is either a provided separator or a space; `file` is either a provided file stream or sys.stdout; `at_start` is False; for the loop to execute a second time `args` must be a list of tuples with at least 2 tuples, `x` is the second tuple in the list. If `at_start` is False, the value of `sep` is written to `file` using `file.write(sep)`.***
