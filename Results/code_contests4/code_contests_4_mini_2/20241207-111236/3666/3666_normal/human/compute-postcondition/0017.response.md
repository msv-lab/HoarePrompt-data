The value of `x` is assigned to be written to the file stream. Since `x` is the third tuple in the list `args`, it holds a specific value that can be converted to a string using `str(x)`. The values of `sep`, `file`, and `at_start` remain unchanged, but the file stream will now contain the string representation of `x`. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is either a provided separator or a space; `file` is either a provided file stream or sys.stdout; `at_start` is False; `args` must be a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples; `x` is the third tuple in the list which is written to the file.
