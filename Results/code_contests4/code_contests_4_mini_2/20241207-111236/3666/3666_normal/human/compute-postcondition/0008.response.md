The value of `at_start` is assigned `False`, and since it was already `False`, there is no change to the variable. The states of the other variables remain unchanged as well. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is either a provided separator or a space; `file` is either a provided file stream or sys.stdout; `at_start` is False; the content of `sep` is written to `file`; `args` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple; `x` is the first tuple in the list; `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to `file`.
