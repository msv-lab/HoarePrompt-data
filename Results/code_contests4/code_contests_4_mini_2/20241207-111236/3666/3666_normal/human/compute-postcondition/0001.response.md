The `kwargs` dictionary is being modified by popping the `sep` and `file` keys. If `sep` is not provided in `kwargs`, it defaults to a space (' '), and if `file` is not provided, it defaults to `sys.stdout`. The initial state of `args` is not directly affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State remains focused on the changes made to the `kwargs`.

Output State: **`sep` is either a provided separator or a space; `file` is either a provided file stream or sys.stdout; `args` remains a list of tuples.**
