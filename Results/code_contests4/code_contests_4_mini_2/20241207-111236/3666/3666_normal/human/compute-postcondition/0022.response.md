The `file.flush()` method is called, which flushes the output buffer of the file stream, ensuring that all data written to `file` is actually output. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged, but the output buffer for `file` is now clear. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is either a provided separator or a space; `file` is either a provided file stream or sys.stdout; `at_start` is False; `args` is a list of tuples; `x` is the last tuple in the list; something has been written to `file`; `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` returns True, indicating that the output buffer has been flushed.
