The function accepts two lists of integers `a` and `b`. If `a` is empty (i.e., `a == 0`), it returns the list `b` along with the values 0 and 1. Otherwise, it calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (gcd) along with two coefficients `x` and `y` derived from the Extended Euclidean algorithm applied recursively using the elements of `a` and `b`.
