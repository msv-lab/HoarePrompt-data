The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters and starts a new thread to execute the `main` function. It sets a high recursion limit and stack size to accommodate potentially deep recursive calls or heavy processing in the `main` function. The function does not return any output or results directly; instead, it relies on the `main` function to handle processing based on a series of queries defined by four integers for each query. However, the handling of these queries is not shown in the provided code, and thus the specific behavior or results based on the queries remains undefined in this context.
