The function accepts no parameters and processes queries based on conditions specified by the constraints for integers q, l_1, r_1, l_2, and r_2. However, the code does not implement the actual logic for processing these queries, as it only redirects standard input to read from 'input.txt', making it unclear how the queries are handled. Therefore, the function does not perform any query processing or return any results based on the defined constraints.
