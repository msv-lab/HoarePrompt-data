To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description and the functions, let's break down the task step by step:

### Problem Description:
The goal is to find two distinct integers \( a \) and \( b \) such that:
- \( l_1 \leq a \leq r_1 \)
- \( l_2 \leq b \leq r_2 \)
- \( a \neq b \)

### Functions Overview:
1. **Function func_1()**: Reads an integer from input.
2. **Function func_2()**: Reads input but does not validate it.
3. **Function func_3()**: Reads four integers but does not validate them.
4. **Function func_5()**: Reads multiple queries but its exact behavior relies on func_3().
5. **Function func_15()**: Reads the queries and calls another function (func_16).
6. **Function func_16()**: Prints the values but does not process or validate the values further.

### Analysis:
The key functions responsible for processing the segments are func_15() and func_16(). However, the actual logic for selecting \( a \) and \( b \) based on the segments is not implemented in the provided code. Instead, func_15() simply calls func_16() with parameters \( l1 \) and \( r2 \), which does not satisfy the requirement of selecting distinct integers from the specified ranges.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Same Endpoints**: If \( r_1 \) is equal to \( l_2 \), both segments could lead to the same integer, violating \( a \neq b \).
2. **Adjacent Segments**: If \( r_1 = l_2 \) (though distinct as per the problem), it needs careful handling to ensure distinct integers are selected.
3. **Identical Segments**: If segments are the same, the program does not handle this situation to select distinct integers.

### Output Hints Agreement:
The output hints do not address the logic necessary to ensure \( a \neq b \). The hints suggest that the function simply returns integers without ensuring they are distinct. The absence of checks for distinct integers means the solution could incorrectly handle cases where the numbers chosen from the segments are equal.

### Conclusion:
The program does not implement the necessary logic to guarantee distinct integers \( a \) and \( b \) from the two segments, which is a fundamental requirement as per the problem statement. Given the analysis and the potential edge cases where the program could fail, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**.

**Reason**: The program lacks the logic to select distinct integers from the segments, which is essential for meeting the problem's requirements.
