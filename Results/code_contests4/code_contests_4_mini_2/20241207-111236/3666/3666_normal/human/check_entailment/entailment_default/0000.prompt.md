You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those output hints describes certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given two segments [l_1; r_1] and [l_2; r_2] on the x-axis. It is guaranteed that l_1 < r_1 and l_2 < r_2. Segments may intersect, overlap or even coincide with each other.

<image> The example of two segments on the x-axis.

Your problem is to find two integers a and b such that l_1 ≤ a ≤ r_1, l_2 ≤ b ≤ r_2 and a ≠ b. In other words, you have to choose two distinct integer points in such a way that the first point belongs to the segment [l_1; r_1] and the second one belongs to the segment [l_2; r_2].

It is guaranteed that the answer exists. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.

You have to answer q independent queries.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 500) — the number of queries.

Each of the next q lines contains four integers l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i} and r_{2_i} (1 ≤ l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, r_{2_i} ≤ 10^9, l_{1_i} < r_{1_i}, l_{2_i} < r_{2_i}) — the ends of the segments in the i-th query.

Output

Print 2q integers. For the i-th query print two integers a_i and b_i — such numbers that l_{1_i} ≤ a_i ≤ r_{1_i}, l_{2_i} ≤ b_i ≤ r_{2_i} and a_i ≠ b_i. Queries are numbered in order of the input.

It is guaranteed that the answer exists. If there are multiple answers, you can print any.

Functions with output description for each function:
Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output decription for function1:  The function accepts no parameters and returns an integer value that is input by the user during the execution of the program. The function does not handle multiple queries or specific integer ranges as indicated in the annotations. It simply reads and returns a single integer from user input.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return input()
''' 

 Output decription for function2:  The function accepts no parameters and simply returns the input provided by the user. The expected input is in the form of integers l1, r1, l2, r2, which should satisfy the conditions of being integers within specified ranges (1 ≤ l1 < r1 ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ l2 < r2 ≤ 10^9). However, since the function directly returns the input without validation, it does not enforce these constraints, potentially allowing invalid input.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().split(' '))
''' 

 Output decription for function3:  The function accepts no parameters and returns a map object containing four integers l1, r1, l2, and r2 read from the input. These integers are expected to satisfy the constraints 1 ≤ l1 < r1 ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ l2 < r2 ≤ 10^9. However, there is no validation implemented in the function to ensure that the input meets these constraints, so it relies on the user to provide valid input.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    return map(str, input().split(' '))
''' 

 Output decription for function4:  The function accepts no parameters and reads a single line of input. It splits the input string by spaces and returns a map object containing the string representations of the values. The function does not specifically handle the integer queries or their endpoints as described in the annotations, and it does not perform any validation on the input values.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return list(func_3())
''' 

 Output decription for function5:  The function does not accept any parameters but reads an integer `q` followed by `q` lines of four integers each, representing the endpoints of two segments on the x-axis. It returns a list of results obtained from executing `func_3()` based on these input segments. The exact behavior of `func_3()` is not specified in the provided code, so the nature of the results in the returned list is unknown without further context about `func_3()`.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1000000)
    threading.stack_size(1024000)
    thread = threading.Thread(target=main)
    thread.start()
''' 

 Output decription for function6:  The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters and starts a new thread to execute the `main` function. It sets a high recursion limit and stack size to accommodate potentially deep recursive calls or heavy processing in the `main` function. The function does not return any output or results directly; instead, it relies on the `main` function to handle processing based on a series of queries defined by four integers for each query. However, the handling of these queries is not shown in the provided code, and thus the specific behavior or results based on the queries remains undefined in this context.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7(n):
    sum = 0
    while n > 0:
        sum += int(n % 10)
        n = int(n / 10)
    return sum
''' 

 Output decription for function7:  The function accepts a positive integer `n` and calculates the sum of its digits. It iterates through each digit of `n`, adding them together until `n` becomes 0, at which point it returns the calculated sum. If `n` is 0, the function will return 0, but since the input is always a positive integer, the function will always return the sum of its digits.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(x):
    return x and (not x & x - 1)
''' 

 Output decription for function8:  The function accepts an integer `x` and returns `True` if `x` is a power of two (i.e., `x` is greater than 0 and has exactly one bit set in its binary representation); otherwise, it returns `False`. If `x` is 0, it will return `False`.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
''' 

 Output decription for function9:  The function accepts an integer `x`, which represents the number of queries, and a list `y` of tuples, each containing four integers (l1, r1, l2, r2). The function computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the integer `x` and the list `y`, which is expected to be treated as an integer under modulo operation. However, since `y` is a list, the operation `x % y` is not valid, leading to potential errors. If the function were to execute correctly, it would return the original list `y` as the output. Overall, the function appears to be incorrectly implemented as it does not handle the expected operations on the tuples contained in `y`.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10(a, b):
    if a == 0:
        return (b, 0, 1)
    (gcd, x1, y1) = func_10(b % a, a)
    x = y1 - b // a * x1
    y = x1
    return (gcd, x, y)
''' 

 Output decription for function10:  The function accepts two lists of integers `a` and `b`. If `a` is empty (i.e., `a == 0`), it returns the list `b` along with the values 0 and 1. Otherwise, it calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (gcd) along with two coefficients `x` and `y` derived from the Extended Euclidean algorithm applied recursively using the elements of `a` and `b`.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i = i + 6
    return True
''' 

 Output decription for function11:  The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of queries. It returns `False` if `n` is less than or equal to 1, if `n` is less than or equal to 3, or if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3. It performs a check for primality by testing divisibility with integers starting from 5, incrementing by 6 each iteration. If `n` passes all checks, it returns `True`, indicating that `n` is a prime number greater than 3. Thus, the function primarily determines whether `n` is a prime number.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(n):
    if n == 0:
        return (0, 1)
    p = func_12(n >> 1)
    c = p[0] * (2 * p[1] - p[0])
    d = p[0] * p[0] + p[1] * p[1]
    if n & 1:
        return c + 2 * d
    else:
        return c + d
''' 

 Output decription for function12:  The function `func_12` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns a tuple (0, 1) if `n` is 0. For positive values of `n`, it recursively calculates values `c` and `d` based on previously computed results for half of `n`, and returns either `c + 2 * d` if `n` is odd, or `c + d` if `n` is even. The specific calculations for `c` and `d` are determined by the formulas involving the results from the recursive call. The function does not handle negative values or zero as input directly, as it assumes `n` is always positive based on the initial state described.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13():
    sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
''' 

 Output decription for function13:  The function accepts no parameters and processes queries based on conditions specified by the constraints for integers q, l_1, r_1, l_2, and r_2. However, the code does not implement the actual logic for processing these queries, as it only redirects standard input to read from 'input.txt', making it unclear how the queries are handled. Therefore, the function does not perform any query processing or return any results based on the defined constraints.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14(x, y):
    res = 1
    while y > 0:
        if y & 1:
            res = res * x
        x = x * x
        y >>= 1
    return res
''' 

 Output decription for function14:  The function accepts an integer `x` and a non-negative integer `y`. It calculates `x` raised to the power of the number of 1s in the binary representation of `y`. If `y` is 0, the function returns 1, as there are no 1s in its binary representation. The list of tuples `y` is not used in the calculation, making the expected behavior of the function misleading based on the annotations.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15():
    q = func_1()
    for i in range(q):
        (l1, r1, l2, r2) = func_3()
        func_16(l1, r2)
''' 

 Output decription for function15:  The function reads multiple queries consisting of four integers (l1, r1, l2, r2) from standard input, where each query is subject to the constraints 1 ≤ l1 < r1 ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ l2 < r2 ≤ 10^9. It processes these queries by calling another function, func_16, with the parameters l1 and r2 for each query. The function does not return any value, and it is assumed to execute func_16 without any visible output or error handling for edge cases.
Function number 16 :

First I want you to try to see if the program (including all the functions) does what the description says. Look at only the code and the description and make an initial assesment.Try to think of any edge cases that the code might not be handling.

Then I want you to see if the output hints agree with the code. Sometimes the output hints hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the output hints says are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to make a more informed decision and detrmine if the code is correct or not.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code.
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
