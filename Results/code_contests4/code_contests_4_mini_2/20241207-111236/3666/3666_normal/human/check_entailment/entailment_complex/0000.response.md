Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The problem requires finding two integers \( a \) and \( b \) such that \( l_1 \leq a \leq r_1 \), \( l_2 \leq b \leq r_2 \), and \( a \neq b \). However, the code does not actually implement the necessary logic for this computation.

1. Functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`, and `func_15` are primarily focused on reading input but do not perform any calculations or logic related to selecting distinct integers \( a \) and \( b \) from the given segments.
2. The crucial function `func_16`, which is supposed to handle the output, is also not designed to determine \( a \) and \( b \) according to the conditions specified in the problem description.
3. The code does not contain any logic that checks for the distinctness of the integers selected from the two segments, which is a critical requirement.

For example, consider the input:

```
1
1 3 2 4
```

The expected output could be:

```
1 2
```

However, since the actual implementation does not define how to select \( a \) and \( b \) based on the conditions of the problem, there is no guarantee that the outputs will meet the requirements outlined in the problem description.

Therefore, since the code fails to implement the necessary logic to guarantee that \( a \neq b \) and that both values are within their respective ranges, it is incorrect.
