You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given two segments [l_1; r_1] and [l_2; r_2] on the x-axis. It is guaranteed that l_1 < r_1 and l_2 < r_2. Segments may intersect, overlap or even coincide with each other.

<image> The example of two segments on the x-axis.

Your problem is to find two integers a and b such that l_1 ≤ a ≤ r_1, l_2 ≤ b ≤ r_2 and a ≠ b. In other words, you have to choose two distinct integer points in such a way that the first point belongs to the segment [l_1; r_1] and the second one belongs to the segment [l_2; r_2].

It is guaranteed that the answer exists. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.

You have to answer q independent queries.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 500) — the number of queries.

Each of the next q lines contains four integers l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i} and r_{2_i} (1 ≤ l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, r_{2_i} ≤ 10^9, l_{1_i} < r_{1_i}, l_{2_i} < r_{2_i}) — the ends of the segments in the i-th query.

Output

Print 2q integers. For the i-th query print two integers a_i and b_i — such numbers that l_{1_i} ≤ a_i ≤ r_{1_i}, l_{2_i} ≤ b_i ≤ r_{2_i} and a_i ≠ b_i. Queries are numbered in order of the input.

It is guaranteed that the answer exists. If there are multiple answers, you can print any.

The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
