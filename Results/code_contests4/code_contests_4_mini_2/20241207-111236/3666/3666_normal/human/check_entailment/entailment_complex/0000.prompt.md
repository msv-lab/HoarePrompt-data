You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given two segments [l_1; r_1] and [l_2; r_2] on the x-axis. It is guaranteed that l_1 < r_1 and l_2 < r_2. Segments may intersect, overlap or even coincide with each other.

<image> The example of two segments on the x-axis.

Your problem is to find two integers a and b such that l_1 ≤ a ≤ r_1, l_2 ≤ b ≤ r_2 and a ≠ b. In other words, you have to choose two distinct integer points in such a way that the first point belongs to the segment [l_1; r_1] and the second one belongs to the segment [l_2; r_2].

It is guaranteed that the answer exists. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.

You have to answer q independent queries.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 500) — the number of queries.

Each of the next q lines contains four integers l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i} and r_{2_i} (1 ≤ l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, r_{2_i} ≤ 10^9, l_{1_i} < r_{1_i}, l_{2_i} < r_{2_i}) — the ends of the segments in the i-th query.

Output

Print 2q integers. For the i-th query print two integers a_i and b_i — such numbers that l_{1_i} ≤ a_i ≤ r_{1_i}, l_{2_i} ≤ b_i ≤ r_{2_i} and a_i ≠ b_i. Queries are numbered in order of the input.

It is guaranteed that the answer exists. If there are multiple answers, you can print any.

Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function will handle multiple queries, where each query consists of four integers l1, r1, l2, and r2 such that 1 ≤ l1 < r1 ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ l2 < r2 ≤ 10^9. The number of queries q is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 500.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer value input by the user, which is expected to be provided during the execution of the program.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns an integer value that is input by the user during the execution of the program. The function does not handle multiple queries or specific integer ranges as indicated in the annotations. It simply reads and returns a single integer from user input.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: q is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 500, and for each query, l1, r1, l2, r2 are integers satisfying 1 ≤ l1 < r1 ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ l2 < r2 ≤ 10^9.
def func_2():
    return input()
    #The program returns the input provided by the user, which is expected to be in the form of integers l1, r1, l2, r2 within the specified ranges.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and simply returns the input provided by the user. The expected input is in the form of integers l1, r1, l2, r2, which should satisfy the conditions of being integers within specified ranges (1 ≤ l1 < r1 ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ l2 < r2 ≤ 10^9). However, since the function directly returns the input without validation, it does not enforce these constraints, potentially allowing invalid input.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function func_3 does not take any input parameters, but it processes multiple queries where each query consists of four integers l1, r1, l2, and r2 such that 1 ≤ l1 < r1 ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ l2 < r2 ≤ 10^9. The number of queries q is between 1 and 500.
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().split(' '))
    #The program returns a map object containing four integers l1, r1, l2, and r2 from the input, where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ l1 < r1 ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ l2 < r2 ≤ 10^9.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns a map object containing four integers l1, r1, l2, and r2 read from the input. These integers are expected to satisfy the constraints 1 ≤ l1 < r1 ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ l2 < r2 ≤ 10^9. However, there is no validation implemented in the function to ensure that the input meets these constraints, so it relies on the user to provide valid input.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function processes an integer q representing the number of queries (1 ≤ q ≤ 500), and for each query, it takes four integers l1, r1, l2, and r2 (1 ≤ l1 < r1, 1 ≤ l2 < r2 ≤ 10^9) representing the endpoints of two segments on the x-axis.
def func_4():
    return map(str, input().split(' '))
    #The program returns a list of strings obtained by splitting the input values for l1, r1, l2, and r2 based on space, representing the endpoints of two segments as strings.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and reads a single line of input. It splits the input string by spaces and returns a map object containing the string representations of the values. The function does not specifically handle the integer queries or their endpoints as described in the annotations, and it does not perform any validation on the input values.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function does not take any input parameters, but it reads an integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 500) followed by q lines, each containing four integers l1, r1, l2, r2 (1 ≤ l1 < r1, 1 ≤ l2 < r2 ≤ 10^9) representing the endpoints of two segments on the x-axis.
def func_5():
    return list(func_3())
    #The program returns a list of results from executing func_3() based on the input segments defined by the integer q and the pairs of endpoints (l1, r1) and (l2, r2).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters but reads an integer `q` followed by `q` lines of four integers each, representing the endpoints of two segments on the x-axis. It returns a list of results obtained from executing `func_3()` based on these input segments. The exact behavior of `func_3()` is not specified in the provided code, so the nature of the results in the returned list is unknown without further context about `func_3()`.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: q is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 500, and for each query i, l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, r_{2_i} are integers such that 1 ≤ l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, r_{2_i} ≤ 10^9, l_{1_i} < r_{1_i}, and l_{2_i} < r_{2_i}.
def func_6():
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1000000)
    threading.stack_size(1024000)
    thread = threading.Thread(target=main)
    thread.start()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters and starts a new thread to execute the `main` function. It sets a high recursion limit and stack size to accommodate potentially deep recursive calls or heavy processing in the `main` function. The function does not return any output or results directly; instead, it relies on the `main` function to handle processing based on a series of queries defined by four integers for each query. However, the handling of these queries is not shown in the provided code, and thus the specific behavior or results based on the queries remains undefined in this context.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of queries, and each query contains four integers l1, r1, l2, r2 such that 1 ≤ l1 < r1 ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ l2 < r2 ≤ 10^9.
def func_7(n):
    sum = 0
    while n > 0:
        sum += int(n % 10)
        
        n = int(n / 10)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is 0, `sum` is the sum of all digits of the original value of `n`
    return sum
    #The program returns the sum of all digits of the original value of n, which is 0, so the sum is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and calculates the sum of its digits. It iterates through each digit of `n`, adding them together until `n` becomes 0, at which point it returns the calculated sum. If `n` is 0, the function will return 0, but since the input is always a positive integer, the function will always return the sum of its digits.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer representing the number of queries, followed by 4 integers for each query: l1, r1, l2, and r2, where (1 ≤ l1 < r1 ≤ 10^9) and (1 ≤ l2 < r2 ≤ 10^9).
def func_8(x):
    return x and not x & x - 1
    #The program returns the value of x and the expression 'not x & x - 1', which evaluates the bitwise AND of x with x - 1, and then applies the logical NOT operator to the result.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `x` and returns `True` if `x` is a power of two (i.e., `x` is greater than 0 and has exactly one bit set in its binary representation); otherwise, it returns `False`. If `x` is 0, it will return `False`.

#Function 9:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer representing the number of queries (1 ≤ x ≤ 500), and y is a list of tuples where each tuple contains four integers (l1, r1, l2, r2) such that (1 ≤ l1 < r1 ≤ 10^9) and (1 ≤ l2 < r2 ≤ 10^9).
def func_9(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is a non-empty list of tuples containing four integers each (l1, r1, l2, r2); `y` is 0 after the loop executes completely.
    return x
    #The program returns the non-empty list of tuples `x`, each containing four integers (l1, r1, l2, r2)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `x`, which represents the number of queries, and a list `y` of tuples, each containing four integers (l1, r1, l2, r2). The function computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the integer `x` and the list `y`, which is expected to be treated as an integer under modulo operation. However, since `y` is a list, the operation `x % y` is not valid, leading to potential errors. If the function were to execute correctly, it would return the original list `y` as the output. Overall, the function appears to be incorrectly implemented as it does not handle the expected operations on the tuples contained in `y`.

#Function 10:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers where each element represents the left and right ends of a segment on the x-axis for multiple queries (1 ≤ a[i][0] < a[i][1] ≤ 10^9), and b is a list of integers where each element represents the left and right ends of another segment on the x-axis for the same queries (1 ≤ b[i][0] < b[i][1] ≤ 10^9). Each segment pair in the queries is guaranteed to have at least one distinct integer that can be selected from each segment.
def func_10(a, b):
    if (a == 0) :
        return b, 0, 1
        #The program returns the list of integers 'b' and the values 0 and 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` is a list of integers where each element represents the left and right ends of a segment on the x-axis for multiple queries (1 ≤ a[i][0] < a[i][1] ≤ 10^9), and `b` is a list of integers where each element represents the left and right ends of another segment on the x-axis for the same queries (1 ≤ b[i][0] < b[i][1] ≤ 10^9). The variable `a` is not equal to 0. Each segment pair in the queries still has at least one distinct integer that can be selected from each segment.
    gcd, x1, y1 = func_10(b % a, a)
    x = y1 - b // a * x1
    y = x1
    return gcd, x, y
    #The program returns the values of gcd, x, and y, where gcd is derived from the function func_10 with parameters b % a and a, x is calculated as y1 - b // a * x1, and y is assigned the value of x1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two lists of integers `a` and `b`. If `a` is empty (i.e., `a == 0`), it returns the list `b` along with the values 0 and 1. Otherwise, it calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (gcd) along with two coefficients `x` and `y` derived from the Extended Euclidean algorithm applied recursively using the elements of `a` and `b`.

#Function 11:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of queries, and each query consists of four integers l1, r1, l2, r2 where 1 ≤ l1 < r1 ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ l2 < r2 ≤ 10^9.
def func_11(n):
    if (n <= 1) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer greater than 1 representing the number of queries, and each query consists of four integers `l1`, `r1`, `l2`, `r2` where 1 ≤ `l1` < `r1` ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ `l2` < `r2` ≤ 10^9.
    if (n <= 3) :
        return True
        #The program returns True, indicating that the conditions of the queries are satisfied.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer greater than 1 representing the number of queries and `n` is greater than 3. Each query consists of four integers `l1`, `r1`, `l2`, `r2` where 1 ≤ `l1` < `r1` ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ `l2` < `r2` ≤ 10^9.
    if (n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer greater than 1 and greater than 3, and `n` is not divisible by 2 and not divisible by 3. Each query consists of four integers `l1`, `r1`, `l2`, `r2` where 1 ≤ `l1` < `r1` ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ `l2` < `r2` ≤ 10^9.
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        
        i = i + 6
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is 25, `i` is 11.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of queries. It returns `False` if `n` is less than or equal to 1, if `n` is less than or equal to 3, or if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3. It performs a check for primality by testing divisibility with integers starting from 5, incrementing by 6 each iteration. If `n` passes all checks, it returns `True`, indicating that `n` is a prime number greater than 3. Thus, the function primarily determines whether `n` is a prime number.

#Function 12:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of queries, and each query consists of four integers l1, r1, l2, r2 such that 1 ≤ l1 < r1 ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ l2 < r2 ≤ 10^9.
def func_12(n):
    if (n == 0) :
        return 0, 1
        #The program returns the tuple (0, 1)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer representing the number of queries, and each query consists of four integers `l1`, `r1`, `l2`, `r2` such that 1 ≤ `l1` < `r1` ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ `l2` < `r2` ≤ 10^9. Additionally, `n` is greater than 0.
    p = func_12(n >> 1)
    c = p[0] * (2 * p[1] - p[0])
    d = p[0] * p[0] + p[1] * p[1]
    if (n & 1) :
        return c + 2 * d
        #The program returns c plus 2 times d, where c is calculated as p[0] * (2 * p[1] - p[0]) and d is p[0] * p[0] + p[1] * p[1].
    else :
        return c + d
        #The program returns the sum of c and d, where c is calculated as p[0] * (2 * p[1] - p[0]) and d is p[0] * p[0] + p[1] * p[1], based on the values derived from p obtained from func_12(n >> 1).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns a tuple (0, 1) if `n` is 0. For positive values of `n`, it recursively calculates values `c` and `d` based on previously computed results for half of `n`, and returns either `c + 2 * d` if `n` is odd, or `c + d` if `n` is even. The specific calculations for `c` and `d` are determined by the formulas involving the results from the recursive call. The function does not handle negative values or zero as input directly, as it assumes `n` is always positive based on the initial state described.

#Function 13:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: q is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 500, and for each query, l_1, r_1, l_2, r_2 are integers such that 1 ≤ l_1 < r_1, 1 ≤ l_2 < r_2 ≤ 10^9.
def func_13():
    sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and processes queries based on conditions specified by the constraints for integers q, l_1, r_1, l_2, and r_2. However, the code does not implement the actual logic for processing these queries, as it only redirects standard input to read from 'input.txt', making it unclear how the queries are handled. Therefore, the function does not perform any query processing or return any results based on the defined constraints.

#Function 14:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer representing the number of queries (1 ≤ x ≤ 500), and y is a list of tuples where each tuple contains four integers (l1, r1, l2, r2) such that 1 ≤ l1 < r1, 1 ≤ l2 < r2 ≤ 10^9.
def func_14(x, y):
    res = 1
    while y > 0:
        if y & 1:
            res = res * x
        
        x = x * x
        
        y >>= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `y` is 0, `res` is equal to the original value of `x` raised to the power of the number of 1s in the binary representation of the original value of `y`, and `x` is equal to the original value of `x` squared raised to the power of the number of times the loop executed.
    return res
    #The program returns res which is equal to the original value of x raised to the power of the number of 1s in the binary representation of y, where y is 0, resulting in res being equal to 1 (since y has 0 ones in its binary representation).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `x` and a non-negative integer `y`. It calculates `x` raised to the power of the number of 1s in the binary representation of `y`. If `y` is 0, the function returns 1, as there are no 1s in its binary representation. The list of tuples `y` is not used in the calculation, making the expected behavior of the function misleading based on the annotations.

#Function 15:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function is called without parameters, and it will read multiple queries from standard input. Each query contains four integers l1, r1, l2, r2 where 1 ≤ l1 < r1 ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ l2 < r2 ≤ 10^9. There are up to 500 queries.
def func_15():
    q = func_1()
    for i in range(q):
        l1, r1, l2, r2 = func_3()
        
        func_16(l1, r2)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `q` is a non-negative integer, `i` is equal to `q`, `l1`, `r1`, `l2`, and `r2` are the last values returned by `func_3()`, and `func_16` has been called `q` times with varying `l1` and `r2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple queries consisting of four integers (l1, r1, l2, r2) from standard input, where each query is subject to the constraints 1 ≤ l1 < r1 ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ l2 < r2 ≤ 10^9. It processes these queries by calling another function, func_16, with the parameters l1 and r2 for each query. The function does not return any value, and it is assumed to execute func_16 without any visible output or error handling for edge cases.

#Function 16:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four integers (l1, r1, l2, r2) such that 1 ≤ l1 < r1, 1 ≤ l2 < r2 ≤ 10^9, and the number of tuples is between 1 and 500.
def func_16():
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        
        file.write(str(x))
        
        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sep` is either a provided separator or a space; `file` is either a provided file stream or sys.stdout; `at_start` is False; `args` is a list of tuples; `x` is the last tuple in the list; the content of all tuples in `args` has been written to `file`, separated by `sep` if `args` contains more than one tuple.
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`sep` is either a provided separator or a space; `file` is either a provided file stream or sys.stdout; `at_start` is False; `args` is a list of tuples; `x` is the last tuple in the list; something has been written to `file`. If `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` returns True, then the output buffer has been flushed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of tuples `args`, where each tuple contains four integers. It prints each tuple to a specified output stream, separated by a defined separator (defaulting to a space), followed by a specified end character (defaulting to a newline). If the `flush` argument is set to True, it flushes the output buffer. The function does not return any value.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
