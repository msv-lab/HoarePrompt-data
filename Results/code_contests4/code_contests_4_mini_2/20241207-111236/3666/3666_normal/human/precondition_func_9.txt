a is a list of integers where each element represents the left and right ends of a segment on the x-axis for multiple queries (1 ≤ a[i][0] < a[i][1] ≤ 10^9), and b is a list of integers where each element represents the left and right ends of another segment on the x-axis for the same queries (1 ≤ b[i][0] < b[i][1] ≤ 10^9). Each segment pair in the queries is guaranteed to have at least one distinct integer that can be selected from each segment.
