The function `func_12` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns a tuple (0, 1) if `n` is 0. For positive values of `n`, it recursively calculates values `c` and `d` based on previously computed results for half of `n`, and returns either `c + 2 * d` if `n` is odd, or `c + d` if `n` is even. The specific calculations for `c` and `d` are determined by the formulas involving the results from the recursive call. The function does not handle negative values or zero as input directly, as it assumes `n` is always positive based on the initial state described.
