The function reads multiple queries consisting of four integers (l1, r1, l2, r2) from standard input, where each query is subject to the constraints 1 ≤ l1 < r1 ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ l2 < r2 ≤ 10^9. It processes these queries by calling another function, func_16, with the parameters l1 and r2 for each query. The function does not return any value, and it is assumed to execute func_16 without any visible output or error handling for edge cases.
