Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not correctly implement the logic required to select two distinct integers `a` and `b` from the given segments. Specifically, the function `func_15()` attempts to call `func_16(l1, r2)` which does not select appropriate values from the segments. This would lead to potentially selecting the same value for `a` and `b` if `l1` equals `r2`. 

For example, consider the input:

```
1
1 2 1 2
```

Here, both segments are `[1; 2]`. If the program selects `a = 2` (from segment `[1, 2]`) and `b = 2` (from segment `[1, 2]`), it does not satisfy the condition that `a â‰  b`. 

Thus, the program fails to ensure that the selected integers are distinct in all cases, leading to incorrect outputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
