Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of soldiers that can be placed on the rectangular field without causing conflicts. The program outputs `(n * m) / 2`, which is incorrect for several cases. 

For example, consider the input:

```
3 4
```

The correct maximum number of soldiers that can be placed without conflicts is 6, as specified in the problem description. However, the program calculates `(3 * 4) / 2`, which equals 6. This seems correct, but let's consider another example:

For the input:

```
1 1
```

The correct output should be `1`, since there is only one space for one soldier. However, the program would calculate `(1 * 1) / 2`, which equals `0.5`, and when printed, this would not give a valid soldier count.

Additionally, consider a case such as:

```
2 2
```

The correct maximum is `2` since you can place soldiers at positions (1,1) and (2,2), but the program would output `(2 * 2) / 2`, which is `2`, which is correct. 

However, the logic of simply dividing by 2 does not account for all configurations and edge cases properly, especially for larger fields or odd dimensions. 

Thus, the program fails to handle edge cases correctly, leading to an incorrect overall solution.
