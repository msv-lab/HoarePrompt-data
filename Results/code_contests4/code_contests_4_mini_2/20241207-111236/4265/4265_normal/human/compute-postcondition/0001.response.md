The code calculates the product of `n` and `m`, then divides the result by 2, and prints that value. Since `n` and `m` are assigned integer values from input within the range of 1 to 1000, the output will be the result of `(n * m) / 2`.

After executing the code, the value of `n * m` is computed first, and then that result is divided by 2, but the exact values of `n` and `m` are not specified. Therefore, the output state will reflect the calculation without specific values.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are assigned integer values from input; the printed result is (n * m) / 2.**
