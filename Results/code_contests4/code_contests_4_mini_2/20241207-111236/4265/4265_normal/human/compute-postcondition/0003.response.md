Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters, reads two integers `n` and `m` from standard input, computes their product and divides it by 2, but incorrectly uses the print function which will lead to a TypeError. The intended output is the value of `(n * m) / 2`, but due to the erroneous print statement, the function does not return or print any usable result. **
