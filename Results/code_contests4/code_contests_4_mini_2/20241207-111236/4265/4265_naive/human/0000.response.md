Correctness: **False**.

The provided program has a major flaw in its logic. It calculates the maximum number of soldiers that can be placed on the field as `(n * m) / 2`, which does not account for the specific curse conditions described in the problem statement. 

For instance, consider the input `2 2`. The program would output `2`, suggesting that two soldiers can be placed without conflict. However, based on the rules of the curse, if one soldier is placed at (1, 1), placing another at (2, 2) would not cause a conflict, but the program doesn't evaluate the specific placements, leading to incorrect results.

Moreover, the algorithm does not address various configurations of the grid. For example, on a `3 x 4` grid, it does not capture the necessary placements that would allow six soldiers to fit without conflict, as demonstrated in the problem description.

Thus, the formula used is not a valid solution, and there are multiple configurations where the number of soldiers placed would not align with the output given by the program.
