To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the program logic and check if it meets the requirements.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to calculate the minimum distance that Sasha and Dima need to walk to buy tiers of cakes from houses arranged in a row. Each tier must be collected in sequential order (from size 1 to size n), and both Sasha and Dima start at the first house.

### Program Analysis
1. The program reads the integer `n` and a list of integers `a` representing the sizes of tiers available at each house.
2. It sorts this list of tiers along with their corresponding positions in the house.
3. The program calculates the total distance for both Sasha and Dima to acquire the tiers:
   - It first calculates the distance for Sasha to pick up all tiers from the sorted list at even indices (representing the first occurrence of each tier).
   - Then it calculates the distance for Dima to pick up all tiers from the sorted list at odd indices (representing the second occurrence of each tier).

### Potential Issues
- The program assumes that Sasha will always take the first available tier of each size and Dima will take the second. However, this does not account for strategic movement. For example, if Dima is closer to the second tier of size 1, he should take it instead of moving away from it.
  
- The program does not explicitly handle cases where the optimal strategy might require one person to pick up a tier that would minimize the overall walking distance based on their respective positions after each tier collection.

### Test Case Reasoning
Consider this test case:
```
Input:
3
1 2 1 3 2 3

Expected Output:
7
```

- Here, if both Sasha and Dima proceed to pick tiers as the program suggests, Sasha might be forced to walk back and forth in a non-optimal way. The program does not consider that they can overlap paths and that the order of picking the tiers can lead to different total distances.

### Conclusion
Due to the lack of consideration for optimal movement strategies and the potential for a non-optimal collection order leading to increased walking distances, the program does not fulfill the problem's requirements across all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.
