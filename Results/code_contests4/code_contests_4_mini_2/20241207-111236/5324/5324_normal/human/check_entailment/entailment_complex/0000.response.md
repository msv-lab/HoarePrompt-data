Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly implement the logic of the problem as described. The problem states that Sasha and Dima need to buy tiers of sizes 1 to n in ascending order, but the code only calculates the total distance based on the first and second occurrences of each size without ensuring that the two characters follow the required order of purchasing tiers.

For example, consider the input:

```
3
1 2 1 3 2 3
```

In this case, Sasha could start at house 1 and buy tier 1, then move to house 3 to buy tier 1 (which is not allowed as both should buy in order). The current implementation does not account for the requirement that they must buy the tiers in a specific order and does not check if both Sasha and Dima can buy their respective tiers without violating the order.

The distance calculation in the code does not reflect the optimal paths they could take while adhering to the constraints of the problem, leading to incorrect results. Thus, the code fails to meet the requirements in the problem description for every potential case.
