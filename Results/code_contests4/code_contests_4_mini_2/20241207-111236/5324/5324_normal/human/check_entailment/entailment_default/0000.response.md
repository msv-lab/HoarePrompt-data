To assess the correctness of the provided code against the problem description, we need to analyze both the logic of the code and the output descriptions.

### Problem Description Recap
1. Sasha and Dima want to buy two n-tier cakes, with sizes from 1 to n.
2. They start at the leftmost house (position 1).
3. They can only buy the tiers in ascending order.
4. The goal is to calculate the minimum distance they need to walk to collect all the tiers.

### Function Analysis
#### Function 1 - `func_1(x, y)`
- **Purpose**: Computes the greatest common divisor (GCD).
- **Analysis**: Irrelevant to the main problem of calculating distances for cake tiers. It does not contribute to solving the primary problem.

#### Function 2 - `func_2()`
- **Purpose**: Calculates the total distance Sasha and Dima walk to collect the cake tiers.
- **Logic**:
  - It reads the number of tiers `n` and an array of size `2n` which contains the sizes of the tiers available in each house.
  - It sorts the pairs of (size, index) to determine the order in which they should collect the tiers.
  - It then calculates the distance for Sasha to collect the first occurrences of each tier and for Dima to collect the second occurrences.

### Edge Cases & Output Description Analysis
1. **Sorting and Positioning**: The code sorts the available tiers by size and index, which is correct. However, it does not account for the fact that Sasha and Dima can choose their paths strategically. They could potentially minimize their total distance by picking closer tiers first rather than just following the sorted order.
  
2. **Initial Positions**: Both start at the first house, but the logic assumes sequential collection without considering the possibility of optimizing their paths based on proximity to the next required tier.

### Output Hints
- The output description states that the function computes the total distance by first moving to the positions of the first occurrences and then to the positions of the second occurrences. 
- This approach does not guarantee the minimal distance because it does not allow for the possibility that Dima could have collected a tier closer to where Sasha just collected, thereby potentially reducing the total distance.

### Conclusion
The code and the output hint do not correctly capture the optimal strategy for minimizing distance. There are potential cases where Sasha and Dima could choose different paths that would yield a shorter total distance, which the current implementation does not accommodate.

Thus, based on the analysis:

Correctness: **False**. 

**Reason**: The function does not account for the possibility of optimizing the paths taken by Sasha and Dima, leading to potentially longer distances than necessary.
