The provided program attempts to calculate the minimum distance that Sasha and Dima need to walk to buy their cakes, based on the ordering of the tiers available in various houses. However, upon analysis, it is clear that the program does not fulfill the requirements set forth in the problem description. 

### Explanation of Issues in the Program:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Walking Distances**:
   - The program calculates the distance for each person (Sasha and Dima) separately based on the sorted list of available tiers and their positions. However, it does not account for the fact that both Sasha and Dima can potentially be at the same house simultaneously and may need to coordinate their movements effectively to minimize the total distance traveled.
   - The program simply adds the distances traveled by Sasha and Dima without considering the optimal strategy that would minimize the overall distance. It assumes they will always take the shortest path based on their individual tiers, which may not yield the minimum total distance.

2. **Lack of Coordination**:
   - The problem allows for both individuals to be at the same house at the same time, but the program does not implement any logic for coordinating their purchases. For example, Sasha could go for tier 1 in one house while Dima goes for tier 1 in another house, and they could then move together to the next tier instead of one waiting for the other.

3. **No Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not consider different arrangements of the tiers in the houses or how those arrangements can affect the total distance. For instance, if the tiers are arranged such that the closest tiers for both individuals are further away, the program does not account for this in an optimal way.

### Conclusion:
Because of these flaws, the program does not guarantee the minimum walking distance based on the problem description's requirements.

Correctness: **False**
