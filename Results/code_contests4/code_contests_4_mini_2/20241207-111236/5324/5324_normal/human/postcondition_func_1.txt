The function accepts a positive integer `n` and calculates the total distance traversed by moving to the positions of a list of 2*n integers, where each integer appears exactly twice. It computes the distance by first moving to the positions of the first occurrences and then to the positions of the second occurrences of the integers in the sorted list. Finally, it prints the total distance.
