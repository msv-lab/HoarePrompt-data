`prev` is assigned the value of `pos`. The value of `pos` is already defined as `a[2][1]`, and the previous value of `prev` is not specified, so the output state will reflect that `prev` now holds the value of `pos`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `pos` is assigned the value of `a[2][1]`, `dist` is increased by `abs(pos - prev)`, and `prev` is now equal to `pos`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `pos` is assigned the value of `a[2][1]`, `dist` is increased by `abs(pos - prev)`, and `prev` is now equal to `pos.**
