The value of `pos` is assigned the value from the array `a` at the index `[2 * i + 1][1]`. Given that `i` is 1, we calculate the index as follows: `2 * i + 1` becomes `2 * 1 + 1`, which equals `3`. Therefore, `pos` is updated to `a[3][1]`. The other variables are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `pos` is equal to `a[3][1]`, `dist` is updated to `dist + abs(a[1][1] - 1)`, `prev` is equal to `a[1][1]`**.
