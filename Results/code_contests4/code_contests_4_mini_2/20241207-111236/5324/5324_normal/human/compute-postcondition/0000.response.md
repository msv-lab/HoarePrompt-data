The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which accepts an integer input. The initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, so after this line executes, `n` will hold the positive integer value provided by the user. The variable `a` remains unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer provided by input, `a` is a list of 2*n integers where each integer a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) appears exactly twice.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer provided by input, `a` is a list of 2*n integers where each integer a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) appears exactly twice.**
