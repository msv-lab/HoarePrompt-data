According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute while `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, after the next iteration, `i` will be 1, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `pos` is equal to `a[1][1]`, `dist` is updated to `dist + abs(a[1][1] - 1)`, `prev` is equal to `a[1][1]`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
