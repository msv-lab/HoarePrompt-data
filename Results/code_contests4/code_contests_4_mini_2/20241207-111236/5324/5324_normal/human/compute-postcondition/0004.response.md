According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer provided by input, it means that `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute. 

Before the loop starts, the value of `dist` and `prev` does not affect the execution of the loop, but the loop variable `i` will start at 0 during the first iteration. 

To summarize, for the loop to be executed the first time, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0**
