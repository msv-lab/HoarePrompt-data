The variable `prev` is assigned the value of `pos`. The previous value of `pos` is retained, and there are no other changes to the program or other variables. Therefore, the Output State reflects the new value of `prev` as equal to `pos`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `pos` is assigned the value of `a[2 * 2][1], `dist` is increased by `abs(pos - prev)`, `prev` is now equal to `pos`.**
