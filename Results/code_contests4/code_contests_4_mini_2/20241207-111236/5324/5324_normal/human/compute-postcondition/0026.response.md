According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to be executed again, `i` will be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` being 2. Therefore, to execute the loop for a second time, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
