The variable `prev` is assigned the value of `pos`. The value of `pos` is already assigned as `a[0][1]`, which is not specified in the initial state but is known to exist. The other variables (`n`, `i`, and `dist`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `pos` is assigned the value of `a[0][1]`, `dist` is increased by `abs(pos - prev)`, and `prev` is now equal to `pos`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `pos` is assigned the value of `a[0][1]`, `dist` is increased by `abs(pos - prev)`, `prev` is now equal to `pos`**.
