The variable `prev` is assigned the value of `pos`, which is equal to `a[1][1]`. The previous value of `prev` was 1, but now it will take on the value of `pos`. The states of the other variables (such as `n`, `i`, `dist`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `pos` is equal to `a[1][1]`, `dist` is updated to `dist + abs(a[1][1] - 1)`, `prev` is equal to `a[1][1]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `pos` is equal to `a[1][1]`, `dist` is updated to `dist + abs(a[1][1] - 1)`, `prev` is equal to `a[1][1]**
