The variable `a` is assigned the value of a sorted list created by zipping the integers from the input (converted to integers) with their corresponding indices ranging from 1 to 2*n. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer provided by input and `a` is a list of 2*n integers, where each integer appears exactly twice. The final state of `a` will depend on the specific input values provided.

Since the value of `n` is not specified here, I will state that `a` is a sorted list of tuples, where each tuple consists of an integer from the input and its corresponding index.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer provided by input; `a` is a sorted list of tuples (integer from input, index) based on the input values.**
