The variable `prev` is assigned the value 1. The other variables `n`, `a`, and `dist` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer provided by input; `a` is a sorted list of tuples (integer from input, index); `dist` is 0; `prev` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer provided by input; `a` is a sorted list of tuples (integer from input, index); `dist` is 0; `prev` is 1**
