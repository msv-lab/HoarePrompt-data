The variable `dist` is initialized to 0. The previous values of `n` and `a` are not affected by this line of code, as it only assigns a value to `dist`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer provided by input; `a` is a sorted list of tuples (integer from input, index); `dist` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer provided by input; `a` is a sorted list of tuples (integer from input, index); `dist` is 0**
