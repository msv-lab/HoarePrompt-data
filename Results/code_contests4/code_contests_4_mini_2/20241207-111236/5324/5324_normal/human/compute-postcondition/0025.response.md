The variable `prev` is assigned the value of `pos`. The previous value of `pos` is `a[3][1]`, and since other variables (`n`, `i`, `dist`) are not directly affected by this assignment, the output state reflects the updated value of `prev`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `pos` is equal to `a[3][1]`, `dist` is updated to `dist + abs(a[1][1] - 1)`, `prev` is equal to `a[3][1]**
