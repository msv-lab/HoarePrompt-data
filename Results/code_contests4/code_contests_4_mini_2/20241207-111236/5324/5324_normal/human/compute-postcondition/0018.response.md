According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range of `n`. Given that `n` is a positive integer and `i` is initialized to `n`, the loop will not execute at all because the range for `i` is from `0` to `n-1`. 

To ensure the loop executes at least once, `i` needs to be set to a value that is within the range of `0` to `n-1`. Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to `0` to allow the loop to execute for the first time. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `pos` is equal to `a[2 * (n - 1)][1]`, `dist` is the total distance calculated, `prev` is equal to 1**
