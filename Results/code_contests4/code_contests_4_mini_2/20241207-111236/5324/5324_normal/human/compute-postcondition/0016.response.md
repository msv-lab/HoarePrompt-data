The loop iterates `n` times, and in each iteration, it calculates the position from the sorted list of tuples `a`, updates the `dist` variable by adding the absolute difference between the current position and the previous position, and then updates the `prev` variable to the current position. 

After all iterations of the loop have executed, the following states will be established:

- `n` remains a positive integer as provided in the initial state.
- `i` will have reached `n`, which means it will be equal to `n`.
- `pos` will be assigned the value of `a[2 * (n - 1)][1]`, since the last executed value of `i` will be `n - 1`.
- `dist` will be the cumulative sum of the absolute differences for each position calculated in the loop.
- `prev` will be equal to `pos`, which is `a[2 * (n - 1)][1]`.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop are complete will be:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `pos` is equal to `a[2 * (n - 1)][1]`, `dist` is the total distance calculated, `prev` is equal to `pos`.**
