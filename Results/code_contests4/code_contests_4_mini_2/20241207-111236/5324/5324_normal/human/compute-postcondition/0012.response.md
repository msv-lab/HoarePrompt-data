According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must become 2, thus `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute a second time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `pos` is assigned the value of `a[2][1]`, `dist` is increased by `abs(pos - prev)`, and `prev` is now equal to `pos.**
