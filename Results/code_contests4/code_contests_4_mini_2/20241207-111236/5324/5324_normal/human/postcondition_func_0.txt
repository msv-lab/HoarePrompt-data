The function accepts two integers `x` and `y`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `x` and `y`. The function operates correctly for any pair of non-negative integers, including cases where either `x` or `y` is zero. If `x` is zero, the GCD returned will be the absolute value of `y`, and if both are zero, it conventionally returns zero, although the behavior of GCD(0, 0) is mathematically undefined.
