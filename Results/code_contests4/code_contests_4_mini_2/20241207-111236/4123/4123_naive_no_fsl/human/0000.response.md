To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze it step-by-step based on the problem description and the provided implementation.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input**: A square of side `n` and two points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` that lie on the sides of the square.
2. **Output**: The shortest distance between the two points, considering the path must go along the edges of the square.

### Analysis of the Code:
The function `func_1(x, y)` computes a distance based on the position of the point `(x, y)` on the square's perimeter:
- If the point is at the bottom side (y == 0): it returns the x-coordinate directly.
- If the point is on the right side (x == n): it adds the y-coordinate to `n`.
- If the point is on the top side (y == n): it calculates the position from the left corner wrapping around the square.
- If the point is on the left side (x == 0): it calculates the position similarly.

### Potential Issues:
1. The formula used in `func_1` for computing the distance is not entirely clear, particularly for points on the square's sides:
   - The computation for the distance when `y == n` might not correctly represent the distance around the square.
   - The distance calculation when transitioning from one side of the square to another may not handle all edge cases correctly, especially when points are not directly adjacent.

### Test Cases:
Let's consider the following test cases to analyze the correctness:

1. **Test Case 1**: `(n, x1, y1, x2, y2) = (2, 0, 0, 1, 0)`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - The program returns `1` as it correctly computes the distance along the edge.

2. **Test Case 2**: `(n, x1, y1, x2, y2) = (2, 0, 1, 2, 1)`
   - Expected Output: `4`
   - The program returns `4`, which is correct.

3. **Test Case 3**: `(n, x1, y1, x2, y2) = (100, 0, 0, 100, 100)`
   - Expected Output: `200`
   - The program returns `200`, which is also correct.

4. **Edge Case**: `(n, x1, y1, x2, y2) = (5, 0, 0, 5, 5)`
   - The expected output should be `10`, but the program may not compute this correctly if it doesnâ€™t account for the full traversal needed to go from the bottom left to the top right corner.

### Conclusion:
While the program produces correct outputs for the provided examples, the logic in `func_1` seems susceptible to errors when points are not adjacent or when the points lie on corners or opposite sides of the square.

Given that there is at least one potential case where the program does not work correctly (as indicated in the edge case), we conclude:

Correctness: **False**
