To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the program and the conditions outlined in the problem.

The problem requires calculating the shortest distance between two points on the sides of a square with side length `n`. The given coordinates for the points must lie strictly on the sides of the square, which are defined by the vertices (0,0), (n,0), (0,n), and (n,n).

The program processes the input as follows:
1. It reads five integers: `n`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`.
2. It defines a function `func_1(x, y)` that is supposed to calculate some value based on the coordinates (x, y) of a point on the square.
3. It computes the distance using the values derived from `func_1` for both points and performs further calculations.

Upon examining the function `func_1(x, y)`:
- The return values depend on the position of the point (either on the bottom, right, top, or left side of the square). However, there are issues with the logic:
  - For example, when `y == n`, the return value is calculated as `n - x + n + n`, which does not give a correct representation of the distance.
  - The calculation of the distance between points using the derived values from `func_1` and the final modulo operation is not logically sound in terms of obtaining the shortest path.

Let's consider edge cases:
1. If both points are at the same location (e.g., (0,0) and (0,0)), the expected output should be `0`, but the current logic might not handle this correctly.
2. For points that are directly opposite each other, such as (0,0) and (n,n) where `n=2`, the expected distance should be `4`, but the logic might not yield this consistently.

Given these observations, it becomes evident that the program does not correctly calculate the shortest distance in certain scenarios. 

Correctness: **False**.
