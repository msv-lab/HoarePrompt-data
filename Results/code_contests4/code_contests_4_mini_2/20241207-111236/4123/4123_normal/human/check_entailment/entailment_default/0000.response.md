To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's first analyze the program and its logic.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to find the shortest distance between two points on the sides of a square of size `n`, where the points are defined by their coordinates. The square has vertices at (0, 0), (n, 0), (0, n), and (n, n). The points are guaranteed to lie on the sides of the square.

### Program Analysis:
```python
(n, x1, y1, x2, y2) = map(int, raw_input().split())

def func_1(x, y):
    if y == 0:
        return x
    if x == n:
        return y + n
    if y == n:
        return n - x + n + n
    return n - y + n + n + n

print(func_1(x2, y2) - func_1(x1, y1) + 4 * n) % (4 * n)
```

1. **Function `func_1(x, y)`**:
   - Returns `x` if `y == 0` (on the bottom side).
   - Returns `y + n` if `x == n` (on the right side).
   - Returns `n - x + 3n` if `y == n` (on the top side).
   - Returns `n - y + 3n` if on the left side.

2. **Distance Calculation**:
   - It calculates the distance by taking the difference of the values returned by `func_1` for points `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)` and adds `4 * n`, then takes the modulo with `4 * n`.

### Edge Case Consideration:
- The function does not handle cases where `x` or `y` are outside the specified range of 0 to `n`. However, the problem guarantees that the points will lie on the sides of the square, so this specific edge case may not be a concern for this input.

### Output Hints:
The output hints state that the function does not handle cases where `x` or `y` are outside the specified range of 0 to `n`, which could lead to unexpected results. This could imply that if the program is used outside the provided constraints, it might not behave correctly.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis:
- The program seems to follow the logic of calculating the shortest path along the edges of the square based on the provided points.
- However, the output hints raise a valid concern regarding the handling of inputs that may not strictly adhere to the problem constraints, even though the problem guarantees that the points will be between `0` and `n`.
- The potential failure case arises from the lack of input validation, which could lead to unexpected results if inputs were outside the constraints.

Given that the program does not handle all potential cases robustly (specifically regarding input validation), I conclude that it does not fully meet the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
