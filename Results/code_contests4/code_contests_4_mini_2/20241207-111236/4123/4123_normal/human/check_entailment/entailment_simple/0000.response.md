Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the shortest distance between two points on the sides of a square as specified in the problem description. 

Here are the reasons why it is incorrect:

1. **Path Calculation**: The program appears to only handle specific cases based on the coordinates being on certain sides of the square (i.e., it checks if `y` is `0`, `x` is `n`, or `y` is `n`). However, it does not properly account for all possible configurations of points on the square's perimeter. For example, if both points are on the left side (where `x` is `0`), or if they are on different sides (e.g., one on the bottom and the other on the right), the program would not correctly calculate the required distance.

2. **Distance Logic**: The logic for calculating distances between points is not following a consistent method to determine the shortest path. The description specifies that the path should go through the square's sides, which means the total distance should be calculated considering all possible routes along the perimeter. The existing logic does not evaluate multiple paths to find the minimum distance, which is essential for the shortest path calculation.

3. **Output Handling**: The function does not seem to return the distance between two points (`(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`), but rather works only with a single set of coordinates passed to it. The problem requires calculating the distance based on two pairs of coordinates, which is not implemented.

In summary, the program fails to implement the necessary logic to check all possible paths between two points on the perimeter of the square and does not handle varying configurations of points correctly. Thus, it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description.
