The provided program is intended to calculate the shortest distance between two points on the sides of a square based on the coordinates provided. However, upon analyzing the logic in the annotated function, it becomes clear that the function does not correctly calculate the distance between the points on the square's perimeter.

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Distance Calculation**:
   - The function does not account for all possible cases of points located on the sides of the square and how they relate to each other. The distance between two points should consider both clockwise and counterclockwise paths around the perimeter of the square.
   - The logic currently implemented is only considering specific cases based on the values of `x` and `y` without considering the actual coordinates of both points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` together.

2. **Handling of Points**:
   - The function only seems to handle the coordinates of a single point rather than comparing two points. The distance calculation between two points is not properly implemented.

3. **Lack of Comprehensive Distance Calculation**:
   - The program does not compute the total distance by traversing around the square's edges. For instance, if one point is on the bottom edge and the other on the right edge, the function does not correctly calculate the full distance by considering both paths.

### Example Case where it Fails:
Consider the following points:
- Point 1: `(0, 0)`
- Point 2: `(0, 2)` for `n = 2`

The expected shortest distance is 2 units (going from `(0, 0)` to `(0, 2)` directly along the left edge). However, the current implementation does not account for how to calculate the distance correctly for this scenario.

### Conclusion:
Given that the function does not accurately implement the necessary logic to calculate the shortest distance between two points on the square's perimeter based on the problem description, we conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
