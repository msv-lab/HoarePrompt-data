The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are integers, with `x` representing the x-coordinate and `y` representing the y-coordinate on the side of a square defined by the vertices at (0, 0), (n, 0), (0, n), and (n, n), where `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000. 

The function has multiple return cases:
- Case 1: If the condition for this case is met, the function returns the value of `x`, which is the x-coordinate.
- Case 2: If the condition for this case is met, the function returns `y` plus `n`, where `y` is greater than 0.
- Case 3: If the condition for this case is met, the function returns `n - x + 3n`, where `x` is less than `n`.
- Case 4: If the condition for this case is met, the function returns `n - y + 3n`, where `y` is greater than 0 and less than `n`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integer parameters `x` and `y` (representing coordinates) and return different values based on specific conditions involving these parameters and the positive integer `n`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters x and y, and returns: x if a specific condition is met; y + n if y is greater than 0; n - x + 3n if x is less than n; n - y + 3n if y is greater than 0 and less than n.**
