The `numbers` list is sorted in ascending order. The values of `x_1`, `x_2`, `x_3`, and `x_4` are not directly affected, but they are part of the `numbers` list. Since `numbers` contains these integers, after sorting, the smallest value will be `x_1` and the largest will be `x_4`, assuming they were initially arranged in ascending order.

Output State: **`x_1`, `x_2`, `x_3`, and `x_4` are four positive integers such that 2 ≤ `x_i` ≤ 10^9 for i = 1, 2, 3, 4; `numbers` is sorted in ascending order.**
