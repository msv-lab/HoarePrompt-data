The code snippet is printing formatted values based on the `numbers` list, which contains the values of `x_1`, `x_2`, `x_3`, and `x_4`. Since `numbers` is sorted in ascending order, we can assume:

- `numbers[0]` is the smallest value (let's denote it as `min`).
- `numbers[1]`, `numbers[2]`, and `numbers[3]` are the second smallest, third smallest, and the largest value respectively (let's denote it as `max`).

The output of the print statement calculates the differences between the largest value and the other three values. The calculations are as follows:

- The first value is `numbers[3] - numbers[0]` (which is `max - min`).
- The second value is `numbers[3] - numbers[1]` (which is `max - second smallest`).
- The third value is `numbers[3] - numbers[2]` (which is `max - third smallest`).

Given that `x_1`, `x_2`, `x_3`, and `x_4` are all positive integers within the specified range, we don't have specific values, but we can denote the results generally based on their relationships.

Therefore, the output state reflects the computed differences:

Output State: **`x_1`, `x_2`, `x_3`, and `x_4` are four positive integers such that 2 ≤ `x_i` ≤ 10^9 for i = 1, 2, 3, 4; `numbers` is sorted in ascending order; output values are (max - min), (max - second smallest), (max - third smallest)**.
