To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze both the problem requirements and the program's logic.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. We have three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).
2. Four integers are given: the pairwise sums \(a+b\), \(a+c\), \(b+c\), and the total sum \(a+b+c\).
3. The task is to deduce the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) from these four integers.

### Given Example Inputs/Outputs:
- For input `3 6 5 4`, valid outputs could be `2 1 3`.
- For input `40 40 40 60`, valid outputs could be `20 20 20`.
- For input `201 101 101 200`, valid outputs could be `1 100 100`.

### Analyzing the Program:
The program reads four integers, sorts them, and then computes three values based on the sorted order:

```python
numbers = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
numbers.sort()
print('{0} {1} {2}'.format(numbers[3] - numbers[0], numbers[3] - numbers[1], numbers[3] - numbers[2]))
```

1. **Sorting**: The program sorts the input numbers. Let's assume after sorting, the numbers are represented as:
   - \(n_1\) (smallest)
   - \(n_2\)
   - \(n_3\)
   - \(n_4\) (largest)

2. **Calculating the Results**:
   - The program calculates:
     - \(a = n_4 - n_1\)
     - \(b = n_4 - n_2\)
     - \(c = n_4 - n_3\)

3. **Expected Logic**: 
   - We know that \(n_4\) should be the total sum \(a + b + c\).
   - The other three \(n_i\) should correspond to the pairwise sums.

### Correctness Check:
Given the definitions:
- \( a + b + c = n_4 \)
- \( a + b = n_1 \)
- \( a + c = n_2 \)
- \( b + c = n_3 \)

From these, we can derive:
- \(c = n_4 - n_1\),
- \(b = n_4 - n_2\),
- \(a = n_4 - n_3\).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly computes \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) based on the inputs since it:
- Sorts the values
- Correctly identifies the total sum and derives the pairwise sums from the sorted values.

Thus, the program accurately meets the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
