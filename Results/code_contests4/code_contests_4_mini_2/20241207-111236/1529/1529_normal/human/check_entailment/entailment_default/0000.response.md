The program reads four integers which represent the pairwise sums and the total sum of three unknown integers \( a, b, \) and \( c \). It sorts these integers and computes the differences between the largest integer and the other three, intending to derive the values of \( a, b, \) and \( c \).

Let's break down the logic:

1. **Sorting**: The input integers are sorted, which is a reasonable step to ensure that the largest integer is easily identifiable.

2. **Calculating Differences**: The program calculates:
   - \( a = \text{largest} - \text{second largest} \)
   - \( b = \text{largest} - \text{third largest} \)
   - \( c = \text{largest} - \text{smallest} \)

Given the nature of the problem, these computations should yield the correct values for \( a, b, \) and \( c \) since they derive from the sums provided.

### Edge Cases
- The program should handle cases where all three numbers are equal, as specified in the problem statement (like \( 20, 20, 20, 60 \)). In this case, the output should be \( 20, 20, 20 \), which the program can handle correctly since it will still compute the differences properly.
- The program should also handle cases where the numbers are not distinct. For instance, if the input is \( 3, 6, 5, 4 \), the sorted list will be \( 3, 4, 5, 6 \), and it computes \( 6 - 3 = 3 \), \( 6 - 4 = 2 \), \( 6 - 5 = 1 \), which correctly yields \( 2, 1, 3 \).

### Output Hints
The output hints mention that the function accepts four integers, sorts them, and prints the differences between the largest integer and each of the other three. This accurately describes the program's functionality.

### Conclusion
The code correctly implements the logic required to derive \( a, b, \) and \( c \) from the given sums, and it handles edge cases as per the problem description. Since the program covers all potential cases without any omissions or errors:

Correctness: **True**.
