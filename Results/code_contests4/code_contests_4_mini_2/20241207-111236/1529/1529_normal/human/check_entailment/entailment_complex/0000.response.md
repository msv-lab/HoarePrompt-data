To evaluate the correctness of the provided annotated program against the problem description, we need to analyze both the requirements laid out in the problem description and the implementation in the annotated program.

### Problem Description Breakdown:
1. **Input**: Four positive integers (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4) representing pairwise sums (a+b, a+c, b+c) and the total sum (a+b+c).
2. **Output**: The integers a, b, and c such that the input integers correspond to the sums described.

### Annotated Program Analysis:
- The program reads four integer inputs and sorts them.
- It then calculates and prints the differences between the largest integer (which must be a+b+c) and each of the other three integers (which would be the pairwise sums).

### Correctness Assessment:
- The largest number after sorting, `numbers[3]`, represents the total sum (a+b+c).
- The other three numbers represent the pairwise sums:
  - `numbers[0]` corresponds to the smallest pairwise sum (a+b or a+c or b+c).
  - `numbers[1]` and `numbers[2]` correspond to the other two pairwise sums.
  
By subtracting the smallest pairwise sum from the total, we can correctly deduce the individual values of a, b, and c. 

### Example Clarification:
For the input example `3, 6, 5, 4`:
- After sorting, we get `[3, 4, 5, 6]`.
- Here `6` is `a+b+c`, and:
  - `6 - 3 = 3` (one of a, b, or c),
  - `6 - 4 = 2` (another of a, b, or c),
  - `6 - 5 = 1` (the last of a, b, or c).
  
Thus, the output would be `3, 2, 1`, which matches the requirements of the problem.

### Conclusion:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to derive a, b, and c from the given sums. It handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement and adheres to the output requirements.

Correctness: **True**
