To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code:

**Problem Description Recap:**
We need to guess three positive integers \( a, b, c \) from four numbers that represent their pairwise sums and the total sum. The four numbers are \( a+b, a+c, b+c, \) and \( a+b+c \).

**Given Program:**
```python
numbers = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
numbers.sort()
print('{0} {1} {2}'.format(numbers[3] - numbers[0], numbers[3] - numbers[1], numbers[3] - numbers[2]))
```

**Analysis of the Program:**
1. The program reads four integers and stores them in a list called `numbers`.
2. It sorts the list.
3. The output is computed using:
   - \( a = \text{numbers[3]} - \text{numbers[0]} \)
   - \( b = \text{numbers[3]} - \text{numbers[1]} \)
   - \( c = \text{numbers[3]} - \text{numbers[2]} \)

**Expected Values:**
- After sorting, `numbers[0]` will be the smallest pairwise sum (either \( a+b, a+c, b+c \)).
- `numbers[3]` will be the total sum \( a+b+c \).

**Correctness Check:**
Now, let's check if the program correctly calculates \( a, b, \) and \( c \) for all potential cases, including edge cases:
- If we have numbers like \( 2, 2, 4, 6 \) (where \( 2 \) is both \( a+b \) and \( a+c \)).
  - Sorted: \( [2, 2, 4, 6] \)
  - Calculation:
    - \( a = 6 - 2 = 4 \)
    - \( b = 6 - 2 = 4 \)
    - \( c = 6 - 4 = 2 \)
  - This gives \( (4, 4, 2) \), which does not match the expected sums.

**Edge Case:**
- Consider the input \( 6, 6, 6, 12 \) (where all pairwise sums are equal).
  - Sorted: \( [6, 6, 6, 12] \)
  - Calculation:
    - \( a = 12 - 6 = 6 \)
    - \( b = 12 - 6 = 6 \)
    - \( c = 12 - 6 = 6 \)
  - This is consistent with the problem description.

However, for the input \( 2, 2, 4, 6 \), the output does not provide valid positive integers \( a, b, c \) that would yield the pairwise sums correctly.

Thus, the program does not handle cases where sums are equal correctly.

**Final Verdict:**
Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to correctly compute \( a, b, c \) for at least one potential case, specifically when there are duplicate values among the sums.
