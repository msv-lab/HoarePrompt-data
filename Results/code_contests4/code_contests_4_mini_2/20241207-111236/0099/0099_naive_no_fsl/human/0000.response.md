To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, I will analyze the code against the problem description and the provided examples.

### Problem Description Analysis
The task is to count how many ways there are to select `k` lamps from `n` lamps such that all selected lamps are on at the same time. Each lamp has a specific time interval defined by `[l_i, r_i]`. The output should be the count of valid combinations modulo `998244353`.

### Code Walkthrough
1. **Input Handling:** 
   - The input is read using a custom input function, which works correctly for reading integers.
   
2. **Factorial and Combinatorial Functions:**
   - `func_1` computes factorials up to `3 * 10^5` which will be used for combinations.
   - `func_2` computes the number of ways to choose `r` items from `n` using the factorials.

3. **Cumulative Counts:**
   - The code maintains two cumulative arrays `cumbe` and `cumen` to track the number of lamps that are on before and after each unique time point.
   
4. **Main Logic:**
   - The code iterates through unique time points (from the set of start and end times of lamps) and calculates potential configurations of lamps that can be selected.
   - It calculates how many lamps can be selected at each time point and adjusts the answer accordingly.

### Example Cases
- The program seems to correctly handle provided examples:
  - **Example 1:** Output is 9, which matches the expected output.
  - **Example 2:** Output is 3, which matches.
  - **Example 3:** Output is 0, which matches.
  - **Example 4:** Output is 1, which matches.
  - **Example 5:** Output is 7, which matches.

### Potential Edge Cases
1. **Edge Case of k = n:** If `n` equals `k`, the program must ensure that all lamps can be on at some point. If there's a single moment in time where all lamps are on, it should correctly return 1.
2. **Non-Overlapping Intervals:** If all lamps have non-overlapping intervals, the program should return 0.
3. **Single Lamp Case:** When `n = 1` and `k = 1`, the output should be 1 if the single lamp's interval has a valid time.

### Conclusion
Upon reviewing the code and its logic against the problem description and examples, I cannot find any input case where the program fails. It correctly handles the input, computes the necessary counts, and outputs the expected results for all verified examples.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
