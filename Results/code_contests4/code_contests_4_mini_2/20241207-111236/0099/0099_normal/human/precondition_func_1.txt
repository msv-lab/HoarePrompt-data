n is an integer representing the total number of lamps (1 ≤ n ≤ 300000), k is an integer representing the number of lamps that must be turned on simultaneously (1 ≤ k ≤ n), and r is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (l_i, r_i) representing the time period when the i-th lamp is turned on (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ 10^9) for all i from 1 to n.
