Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the total number of lamps (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5), `k` is an integer representing the number of lamps that must be turned on simultaneously (1 ≤ k ≤ n), `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ 10^9), and `sys.stdout` is now set to a `BytesIO` object. The `atexit` module registers a lambda function to write the contents of `sys.stdout` to standard output when the program exits.**
