Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers `arr`, representing lamp timings, and returns a list of cumulative sums of the elements in `arr`, starting from 0. If `arr` is empty, it returns [0]. However, it does not handle cases where `arr` contains tuples; it only processes the integer values directly, which may lead to incorrect behavior if tuples are passed instead of a flat list of integers.**
