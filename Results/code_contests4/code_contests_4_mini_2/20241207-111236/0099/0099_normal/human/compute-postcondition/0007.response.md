To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, letâ€™s analyze the code provided.

The loop iterates over the length of the `arr`, which is a list of tuples representing the on and off times of the lamps. The list `tem` starts with a single element `[0]`. In each iteration, the loop appends to `tem` the sum of the current value of `tem[i]` and the corresponding tuple `arr[i]`. 

After 0 iterations, `tem` is `[0]`.

After 1 iteration, `tem` becomes `[0, arr[0]]`.

After 2 iterations, `tem` becomes `[0, arr[0], arr[0] + arr[1]]`.

After 3 iterations, `tem` becomes `[0, arr[0], arr[0] + arr[1], arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2]]`.

Continuing this pattern, after all iterations of the loop (where `n` is the length of `arr`), `tem` will contain the cumulative sums of the elements of `arr`, resulting in:

- The first element is always `0`.
- The second element is `arr[0]`.
- The third element is `arr[0] + arr[1]`.
- ...
- The last element is the sum of all elements in `arr`.

If `arr` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `tem` remains `[0]`.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop will be:

Output State: **`tem` is the list of cumulative sums of the elements in `arr`, starting from 0; if `arr` is empty, `tem` is [0].**
