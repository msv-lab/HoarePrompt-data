According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `arr`. The loop will iterate as long as `i` is less than the length of `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. This means that for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 2 for the next iteration.

Additionally, for the loop to execute a third time, the length of `arr` must be greater than 2. Since `i` is currently 1, to execute the loop again, `len(arr)` must be greater than 2.

State: **`tem` is [0, arr[0], arr[0] + arr[1]], `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a third time `len(arr)` must be greater than 2**
