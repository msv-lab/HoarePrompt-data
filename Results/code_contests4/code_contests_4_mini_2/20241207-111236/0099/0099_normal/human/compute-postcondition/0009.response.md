The function `func_3` accepts a parameter `arr`. `arr` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the on and off times of the lamps, with the first element of the input being a list of two integers `n` and `k`. Here, `n` is the total number of lamps (1 ≤ n ≤ 300,000) and `k` is the number of lamps that must be turned on simultaneously (1 ≤ k ≤ n). After executing the function body, the function returns the list `tem`, which contains the cumulative sums of the elements in `arr`, starting from 0; if `arr` is empty, `tem` is [0]. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept a list of tuples representing lamp timings and return a list of cumulative sums based on the elements in the input. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of tuples `arr` representing lamp timings and returns a list of cumulative sums of the elements in `arr`, starting from 0; if `arr` is empty, it returns [0].**
