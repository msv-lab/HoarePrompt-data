You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Ori and Sein have overcome many difficult challenges. They finally lit the Shrouded Lantern and found Gumon Seal, the key to the Forlorn Ruins. When they tried to open the door to the ruins... nothing happened.

Ori was very surprised, but Sein gave the explanation quickly: clever Gumon decided to make an additional defence for the door.

There are n lamps with Spirit Tree's light. Sein knows the time of turning on and off for the i-th lamp — l_i and r_i respectively. To open the door you have to choose k lamps in such a way that there will be a moment of time when they all will be turned on.

While Sein decides which of the k lamps to pick, Ori is interested: how many ways there are to pick such k lamps that the door will open? It may happen that Sein may be wrong and there are no such k lamps. The answer might be large, so print it modulo 998 244 353.

Input

First line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) — total number of lamps and the number of lamps that must be turned on simultaneously.

Next n lines contain two integers l_i ans r_i (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ 10^9) — period of time when i-th lamp is turned on.

Output

Print one integer — the answer to the task modulo 998 244 353.

Note

In first test case there are nine sets of k lamps: (1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 4), (1, 2, 5), (1, 2, 6), (1, 3, 6), (1, 4, 6), (2, 3, 6), (2, 4, 6), (2, 6, 7).

In second test case k=1, so the answer is 3.

In third test case there are no such pairs of lamps.

In forth test case all lamps are turned on in a time 3, so the answer is 1.

In fifth test case there are seven sets of k lamps: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5).
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: be is a list of integers representing the start times l_i of n lamps, en is a list of integers representing the end times r_i of n lamps, where n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 300000, and for each lamp, 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(be, en):
    res = [1]
    for i in range(be, en + 1):
        res.append(mult(res[-1], i))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `res` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where `res[0]` is 1 and `res[i]` is equal to `mult(res[i - 1], i)` for `i` in the range from 1 to `n`.
    return res
    #The program returns the list 'res' containing n + 1 elements, where 'res[0]' is 1 and each 'res[i]' is computed as 'mult(res[i - 1], i)' for 'i' in the range from 1 to 'n'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the total number of lamps (1 ≤ n ≤ 300000), k is an integer representing the number of lamps that must be turned on simultaneously (1 ≤ k ≤ n), and r is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (l_i, r_i) representing the time period when the i-th lamp is turned on (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ 10^9) for all i from 1 to n.
def func_2(n, r):
    if (n < r) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer representing the total number of lamps (1 ≤ n ≤ 300000), `k` is an integer representing the number of lamps that must be turned on simultaneously (1 ≤ k ≤ n), and `r` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (l_i, r_i) representing the time period when the i-th lamp is turned on (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ 10^9). The value of `n` is greater than or equal to `r`.
    return div(facs[n], facs[n - r])
    #The program returns the result of the division of facs[n] by facs[n - r], where 'facs' is a list containing the factorial values up to n.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers (l_i, r_i) representing the on and off times of the i-th lamp, and the first element of the input must be a list of two integers n and k, where n is the total number of lamps (1 ≤ n ≤ 300,000) and k is the number of lamps that must be turned on simultaneously (1 ≤ k ≤ n).
def func_3(arr):
    tem = [0]
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        tem.append(tem[i] + arr[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `tem` is the list of cumulative sums of the elements in `arr`, starting from 0; if `arr` is empty, `tem` is [0].
    return tem
    #The program returns the list 'tem' which contains the cumulative sums of the elements in 'arr', starting from 0; if 'arr' is empty, 'tem' is [0].

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the total number of lamps (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5), k is an integer representing the number of lamps that must be turned on simultaneously (1 ≤ k ≤ n), and for each lamp i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), l_i and r_i are integers such that (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ 10^9).
def func_4():
    sys.stdout = BytesIO()
    atexit.register(lambda : os.write(1, sys.stdout.getvalue()))
    return BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline
    #The program returns the first line of input read from standard input, utilizing a BytesIO stream.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
