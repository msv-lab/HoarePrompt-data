Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Function Purpose**: The problem requires calculating the number of ways to choose `k` lamps that are all turned on at the same time based on their respective on and off times. However, the functions provided do not seem to directly address this requirement.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Function 1** (`func_1`): This function computes factorial values but does not utilize the lamp intervals at all. The problem requires working with the on and off times of the lamps rather than just calculating factorials.
   - **Function 2** (`func_2`): This function checks if `n < r` (which seems incorrect as `r` is used as the list of tuples). It also returns a division of factorials, which is unrelated to the logic needed to find overlapping lamp intervals.
   - **Function 3** (`func_3`): This function calculates cumulative sums on a list of tuples, but it does not appear to handle the lamp intervals correctly to determine if they overlap, which is critical for solving the problem.
   - **Function 4** (`func_4`): This function handles input reading but does not contribute to solving the core problem.

3. **Missing Logic**: The program lacks any logic to actually determine the overlap of the intervals of the lamps. The key to solving the problem lies in identifying time intervals where at least `k` lamps are on simultaneously and counting combinations of those lamps, none of which is implemented in the functions.

4. **Combination Counting**: The program does not implement the necessary combinatorial logic to count the valid sets of `k` lamps, which is essential for the solution.

In summary, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description, as it lacks the necessary logic to analyze time intervals and compute the valid combinations of lamps.
