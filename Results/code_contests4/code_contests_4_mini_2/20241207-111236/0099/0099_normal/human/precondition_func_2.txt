arr is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers (l_i, r_i) representing the on and off times of the i-th lamp, and the first element of the input must be a list of two integers n and k, where n is the total number of lamps (1 ≤ n ≤ 300,000) and k is the number of lamps that must be turned on simultaneously (1 ≤ k ≤ n).
