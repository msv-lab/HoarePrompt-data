The function accepts two parameters: `be`, which is expected to be the starting integer of a range, and `en`, which is the ending integer of the range. It returns a list `res` that contains `n + 1` elements, where `res[0]` is always 1, and each subsequent element `res[i]` is computed as `mult(res[i - 1], i)` for `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive). However, the input parameters `be` and `en` are not used correctly; instead of being lists, they should be integers representing the start and end of a range. The function does not handle cases where `be` is greater than `en`, nor does it check the validity of the inputs, leading to potential errors.
