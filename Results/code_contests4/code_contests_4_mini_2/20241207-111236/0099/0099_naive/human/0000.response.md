To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the program and see if it correctly implements the requirements mentioned.

The problem asks for the number of ways to select `k` lamps such that they all are turned on at the same time, given their activation times `[l_i, r_i]`. 

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads integers `n` and `k`, followed by `n` pairs of integers representing the activation times of the lamps.

2. **Unique Times**:
   - The program gathers and sorts unique activation times from the lamps into the set `disbe`.

3. **Cumulative Count**:
   - It computes cumulative counts of how many lamps are on by the start and end of their activation times, stored in `cumbe` and `cumen`.

4. **Main Logic**:
   - The program iterates through the unique sorted times (except the first and last) to calculate how many lamps can be turned on simultaneously at each time point.
   - It uses combinations to find how many ways to choose `k` lamps from those that can be turned on at the same time.

5. **Combination Calculation**:
   - The function `func_2` is used to calculate combinations using precomputed factorials.
   - It carefully considers the number of available lamps and how many can be selected.

### Potential Issues

- The program assumes that the cumulative counts are correctly calculated and that it correctly handles edge cases where no lamps can be selected.
- The logic for when to add or subtract combinations could potentially miss cases where the counts don't align with the conditions specified.

### Testing Edge Cases
1. **Single Lamp Case**: 
   - If `n = 1` and `k = 1`, the program should return `1` since the single lamp can be selected.
   
2. **All Lamps with Non-Overlapping Times**:
   - If all lamps have completely non-overlapping times, it should return `0` for any `k > 1`.

3. **k Equal to n**: 
   - If `k = n`, the program needs to check if all lamps can indeed be turned on at the same moment.

4. **Lamps with Same Start and End Time**: 
   - If multiple lamps have the same `l_i` and `r_i`, it should correctly count how many can be selected.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the code and considering potential edge cases, a specific case where the program might not work correctly can be identified:

- In the case where all lamps have non-overlapping times, the program may not correctly identify that there are `0` valid ways to select `k` lamps. If all lamps are such that `l_i > r_j` for all `i, j` where `i != j`, the program should return `0` for any `k > 1`, but it could incorrectly compute combinations based on the available counts.

Therefore, the program does not reliably account for all scenarios as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**.
