The function `func_5` accepts a parameter `n` which is a positive integer constrained between 1 and 100,000 (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). It also accepts a parameter `args`, which is a list containing `n` non-negative integers. Each integer in the list satisfies the condition that it is between 0 and 1,000,000,000 (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). 

The function does not have a specified output in the provided information, so we cannot describe what it returns. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_5` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list `args` of non-negative integers.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, which is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and a parameter args, which is a list of n non-negative integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).**
