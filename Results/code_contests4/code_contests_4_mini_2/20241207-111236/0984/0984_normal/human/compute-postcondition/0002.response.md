According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `args` list. The loop iterates over each element in `args`, and since `s` is the first element in `args`, it will be updated to the next element during the next iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is currently pointing to the first element in `args`, and since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, for the loop to execute again, there must be at least two elements in the list. 

If `s` is the first element in `args`, then for the loop to execute one more time, `s` will need to be updated to the second element in `args`, and the loop will iterate as long as there are elements remaining in the list.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `args` is a list of n non-negative integers, `s` is the second element in `args` (if n > 1), for the loop to execute a second time `args` must have at least 2 elements.**
