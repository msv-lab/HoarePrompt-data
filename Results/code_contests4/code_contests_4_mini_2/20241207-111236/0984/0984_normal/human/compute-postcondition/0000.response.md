According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `args` list. The loop iterates over each element in `args`, and since `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), this means that `args` must contain at least one element. At the end of the last iteration, `s` will hold the value of the last integer in the list. Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `args` is a list with at least 1 element, and during the first execution, `s` will be the first element in the list.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `args` is a list of n non-negative integers with at least 1 element, `s` is the first element in `args`**
