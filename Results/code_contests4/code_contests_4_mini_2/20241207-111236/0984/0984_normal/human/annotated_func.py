#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), and a is a list of n integers where each integer a[i] (0 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9).
def func_1():
    return int(sys.stdin.readline())
    #The program returns an integer read from standard input, which is expected to be a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000) based on the context provided.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a single integer from standard input and returns that integer. It is expected that this integer is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100,000 based on the context. However, the function does not enforce this constraint, and if the input is outside this range or not a valid integer, it could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i is in the range 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_2():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    #The program returns a list of integers read from the standard input, each integer is in the range 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a line of input from the standard input, which is expected to contain a positive integer `n` followed by `n` integers. It returns a map object of those integers, which can be converted into a list. Each integer is in the range 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. However, the function does not handle any potential input errors, such as if the input does not match the expected format or if `n` is not within the specified range.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i is non-negative and satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_3():
    return sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()
    #The program returns a line of input read from standard input, stripped of any trailing whitespace, which likely contains an integer or string representation.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns a line of input read from standard input, stripped of any trailing whitespace. This line can contain any string, including potentially an integer or other characters, but there are no validations or constraints applied to the content of the input.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a variable-length argument list containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) followed by n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array a.
def func_4():
    for s in args:
        sys.stdout.write(str(s) + ' ')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `args` is a variable-length argument list containing n integers, `s` is the last integer in `args`, and all integers in `args` have been written to standard output followed by spaces.
    sys.stdout.write('\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a variable-length argument list containing an integer `n` followed by `n` integers. It writes each integer to standard output followed by a space, and finally writes a newline character. The function does not return any value.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and args is a list of n non-negative integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `args` is a list of n non-negative integers; `s` is the last element in `args`, and all elements of `args` have been outputted as strings.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `args` of `n` non-negative integers, then outputs each integer in `args` as a string to standard output. It does not return any value.
