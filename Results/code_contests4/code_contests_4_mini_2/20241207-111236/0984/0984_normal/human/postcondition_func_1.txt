The function reads a line of input from the standard input, which is expected to contain a positive integer `n` followed by `n` integers. It returns a map object of those integers, which can be converted into a list. Each integer is in the range 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. However, the function does not handle any potential input errors, such as if the input does not match the expected format or if `n` is not within the specified range.
