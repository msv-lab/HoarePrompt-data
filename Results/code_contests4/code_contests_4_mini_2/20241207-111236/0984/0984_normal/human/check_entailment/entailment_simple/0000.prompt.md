You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. Find the subsegment a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) with maximum arithmetic mean (1)/(r - l + 1)∑_{i=l}^{r}{a_i} (in floating-point numbers, i.e. without any rounding).

If there are many such subsegments find the longest one.

Input

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — length of the array a.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the array a.

Output

Print the single integer — the length of the longest subsegment with maximum possible arithmetic mean.

Example

Input


5
6 1 6 6 0


Output


2

Note

The subsegment [3, 4] is the longest among all subsegments with maximum arithmetic mean.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), and a is a list of n integers where each integer a[i] (0 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9).
def func_1():
    return int(sys.stdin.readline())
    #The program returns an integer read from standard input, which is expected to be a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000) based on the context provided.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i is in the range 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_2():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    #The program returns a list of integers read from the standard input, each integer is in the range 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i is non-negative and satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_3():
    return sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()
    #The program returns a line of input read from standard input, stripped of any trailing whitespace, which likely contains an integer or string representation.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a variable-length argument list containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) followed by n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array a.
def func_4():
    for s in args:
        sys.stdout.write(str(s) + ' ')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `args` is a variable-length argument list containing n integers, `s` is the last integer in `args`, and all integers in `args` have been written to standard output followed by spaces.
    sys.stdout.write('\n')

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and args is a list of n non-negative integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_5():
    for s in args:
        sys.stdout.write(str(s))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `args` is a list of n non-negative integers; `s` is the last element in `args`, and all elements of `args` have been outputted as strings.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
