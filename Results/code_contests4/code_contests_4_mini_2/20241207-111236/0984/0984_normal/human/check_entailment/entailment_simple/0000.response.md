Correctness: **False**

The provided annotated program does not fulfill the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem requires finding the longest subsegment of an array with the maximum arithmetic mean. However, the program consists of several functions that deal only with reading input and writing output. 

1. **Input Handling**: The functions `func_1()` and `func_2()` are responsible for reading input values (the length of the array and the array elements, respectively), but they do not perform any computation related to finding subsegments or calculating means.

2. **No Computation**: There are no functions that analyze the array to find the subsegments with the maximum arithmetic mean or to determine their lengths. The main logic required to solve the problem—iterating through the array, calculating sums, and checking for maximum means—is completely missing.

3. **Output Handling**: While `func_4()` and `func_5()` are designed to write output, they do not output the length of the longest subsegment with the maximum arithmetic mean, as required by the problem statement.

In summary, the program lacks the necessary logic to compute the maximum arithmetic mean of subsegments and to find the length of the longest such subsegment, which are the core requirements of the problem. Therefore, it does not meet the specified requirements, leading to a conclusion of incorrectness.
