You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. Find the subsegment a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) with maximum arithmetic mean (1)/(r - l + 1)∑_{i=l}^{r}{a_i} (in floating-point numbers, i.e. without any rounding).

If there are many such subsegments find the longest one.

Input

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — length of the array a.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the array a.

Output

Print the single integer — the length of the longest subsegment with maximum possible arithmetic mean.

Example

Input


5
6 1 6 6 0


Output


2

Note

The subsegment [3, 4] is the longest among all subsegments with maximum arithmetic mean.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), and a is a list of n integers where each integer a[i] (0 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9).
def func_1():
    return int(sys.stdin.readline())
    #The program returns an integer read from standard input, which is expected to be a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000) based on the context provided.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a single integer from standard input and returns that integer. It is expected that this integer is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100,000 based on the context. However, the function does not enforce this constraint, and if the input is outside this range or not a valid integer, it could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i is in the range 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_2():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    #The program returns a list of integers read from the standard input, each integer is in the range 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a line of input from the standard input, which is expected to contain a positive integer `n` followed by `n` integers. It returns a map object of those integers, which can be converted into a list. Each integer is in the range 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. However, the function does not handle any potential input errors, such as if the input does not match the expected format or if `n` is not within the specified range.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i is non-negative and satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_3():
    return sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()
    #The program returns a line of input read from standard input, stripped of any trailing whitespace, which likely contains an integer or string representation.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns a line of input read from standard input, stripped of any trailing whitespace. This line can contain any string, including potentially an integer or other characters, but there are no validations or constraints applied to the content of the input.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a variable-length argument list containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) followed by n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array a.
def func_4():
    for s in args:
        sys.stdout.write(str(s) + ' ')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `args` is a variable-length argument list containing n integers, `s` is the last integer in `args`, and all integers in `args` have been written to standard output followed by spaces.
    sys.stdout.write('\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a variable-length argument list containing an integer `n` followed by `n` integers. It writes each integer to standard output followed by a space, and finally writes a newline character. The function does not return any value.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and args is a list of n non-negative integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_5():
    for s in args:
        sys.stdout.write(str(s))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `args` is a list of n non-negative integers; `s` is the last element in `args`, and all elements of `args` have been outputted as strings.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `args` of `n` non-negative integers, then outputs each integer in `args` as a string to standard output. It does not return any value.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
