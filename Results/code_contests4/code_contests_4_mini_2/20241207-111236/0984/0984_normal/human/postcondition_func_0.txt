The function reads a single integer from standard input and returns that integer. It is expected that this integer is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100,000 based on the context. However, the function does not enforce this constraint, and if the input is outside this range or not a valid integer, it could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
