The code `exit(0)` is executed, which terminates the program immediately. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and there is no output or return from the code because of the termination. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are floats, `a` is less than `b`, and the program has been terminated with exit code 0.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are floats, `a` is less than `b`, and the program has been terminated with exit code 0.**
