The values of `a` and `b` are replaced by the result of `map(float, raw_input().split())`, which takes input as a string, splits it into components, and converts those components to floats. Since `a` and `b` are initially positive integers, they will now be converted to floating-point numbers. Therefore, the output state is: `a` and `b` are now floats based on the input provided.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are now floats based on the input provided.**
