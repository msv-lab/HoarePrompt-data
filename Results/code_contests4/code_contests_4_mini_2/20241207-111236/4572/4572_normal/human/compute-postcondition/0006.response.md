The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Based on the provided constraints, it is implied that the function operates with positive integers `a` and `b`, where `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9`. However, since no specific output or behavior is described regarding how `a` and `b` influence the function's return value, we cannot deduce any return cases. Therefore, the functionality of the function is currently unclear.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. The behavior and return value of the function are not defined based on the provided information.**
