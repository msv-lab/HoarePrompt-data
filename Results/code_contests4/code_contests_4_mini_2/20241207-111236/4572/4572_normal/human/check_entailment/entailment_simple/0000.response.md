Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` which is not valid in Python 3 (it should be `input()`). However, assuming this is intended to be Python 2, the use of `raw_input()` is acceptable.

2. **Check for Condition**: The program checks if `a < b` and immediately returns `-1` in that case. This condition is not sufficient to determine if there exists a suitable `x`. The problem description does not state that `x` cannot exist if `a < b`. 

3. **Calculation of `x`**: The calculation performed by the program is incorrect. The expression `print(a + b) / (2 * math.floor((a + b) / (2 * b)))` does not take into account the specific geometric constraints of the polyline defined in the problem description. The formula should derive `x` based on the positions of the point `(a, b)` within the segments of the polyline, not just as a function of `a` and `b` combined.

4. **Missing Output Requirements**: The output must meet the precision requirement (with a relative or absolute error not exceeding \(10^{-9}\)), but the current code does not ensure this.

5. **No Handling for No Solution**: The program does not correctly handle situations where no valid `x` exists, as it does not explore the conditions that lead to the conclusion that there is no such `x`.

In conclusion, the program fails to implement the logic necessary to determine the minimum positive value of `x` as required by the problem description. Therefore, it does not fulfill the requirements specified.
