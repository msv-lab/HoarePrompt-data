You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: There is a polyline going through points (0, 0) – (x, x) – (2x, 0) – (3x, x) – (4x, 0) – ... - (2kx, 0) – (2kx + x, x) – .... 

We know that the polyline passes through the point (a, b). Find minimum positive value x such that it is true or determine that there is no such x.

Input

Only one line containing two positive integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 109).

Output

Output the only line containing the answer. Your answer will be considered correct if its relative or absolute error doesn't exceed 10 - 9. If there is no such x then output  - 1 as the answer.

Examples

Input

3 1


Output

1.000000000000


Input

1 3


Output

-1


Input

4 1


Output

1.250000000000

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    a, b = map(float, raw_input().split())
    if (a < b) :
        print - 1
        exit(0)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` and `b` are floats. If `a` is less than `b`, the program terminates with exit code 0.
    print(a + b) / (2 * math.floor((a + b) / (2 * b)))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two positive integers `a` and `b` from input. If `a` is less than `b`, it prints -1 and terminates the program. Otherwise, it calculates and prints the average of `a` and `b` divided by twice the largest integer less than or equal to the average divided by `b`. The function does not return any value, and its behavior is dependent on the input values.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
