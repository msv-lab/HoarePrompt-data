To assess the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze both the code and the provided output hints.

### Problem Description
The problem requires us to find the minimum positive value of `x` such that the polyline defined by the points (0, 0), (x, x), (2x, 0), (3x, x), ..., passes through a given point (a, b). If no such `x` exists, the program should return -1.

### Program Analysis
```python
import math

(a, b) = map(float, raw_input().split())
if a < b:
    print -1
    exit(0)
print(a + b) / (2 * math.floor((a + b) / (2 * b)))
```

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two positive integers `a` and `b`. If `a < b`, it immediately prints -1, which is correct because the polyline will never reach points where the y-coordinate exceeds the x-coordinate at any given x.

2. **Calculation**:
   - The expression `(a + b) / (2 * math.floor((a + b) / (2 * b)))` attempts to compute the minimum value of `x`.
   - The term `math.floor((a + b) / (2 * b))` calculates how many complete segments of height `b` can fit into half of the horizontal distance `(a + b)`, which is necessary for determining the segments of the polyline.

### Output Hints Review
The output hints describe that the function behaves as follows:
- It reads two positive integers `a` and `b`.
- If `a < b`, it outputs -1.
- Otherwise, it computes and outputs a specific value based on the provided formula.

### Edge Cases
1. **Case When a = b**: If `a` equals `b`, the program should return `1.0` because the polyline would touch the point (1, 1) at x = 1.
2. **Case When a and b are Large**: For large values of `a` and `b` (close to 10^9), the computation should still hold. The formula should handle the division without resulting in an error, but the potential for numerical inaccuracies in floating-point arithmetic should be considered.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic for determining the minimum `x` value under the described conditions. The output hints agree with the code's behavior, and there are no evident edge cases where the code fails to meet the problem's requirements.

Thus, after careful consideration of the code and the problem description, it appears that the program fulfills the requirements for all potential cases.

Correctness: **True**.
