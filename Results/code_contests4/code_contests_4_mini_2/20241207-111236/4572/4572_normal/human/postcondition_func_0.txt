The function reads two positive integers `a` and `b` from input. If `a` is less than `b`, it prints -1 and terminates the program. Otherwise, it calculates and prints the average of `a` and `b` divided by twice the largest integer less than or equal to the average divided by `b`. The function does not return any value, and its behavior is dependent on the input values.
