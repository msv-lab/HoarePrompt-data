To assess the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and the logic it implements.

1. The program takes two positive integers `a` and `b` as input.
2. It checks if `a < b`. If this condition is true, it prints `-1` and exits. According to the problem, if `b` is greater than `a`, it's impossible to find a positive `x`, and thus returning `-1` is appropriate.
3. Next, the program calculates `(a + b) / (2 * math.floor((a + b) / (2 * b)))`. 

Now, let's analyze the logic behind this calculation:
- The code attempts to find a minimum positive value for `x`. However, the formula used seems incorrect for finding `x`, as it does not relate correctly to the geometric properties of the polyline described in the problem statement.
- The expression `math.floor((a + b) / (2 * b))` may lead to incorrect calculations when `b` is not a divisor of `a + b`, potentially leading to a non-minimal or invalid `x`.

### Potential Counterexample
Consider the input `(2, 2)`. 
- According to the problem description, for `(a, b) = (2, 2)`, we are required to find a minimum positive `x` such that the point (2, 2) lies on the polyline.
- The polyline has segments that follow the pattern where `x` must be positive and `b` can be equal to `a`. 

In this case:
- The program would first check `if a < b`, which is false, and then proceed to calculate:
  ```python
  (2 + 2) / (2 * math.floor((2 + 2) / (2 * 2))) = 4 / (2 * math.floor(4 / 4)) = 4 / (2 * 1) = 4 / 2 = 2
  ```
- The program would output `2.0`, which is incorrect since there's no valid `x` such that (2, 2) lies on the polyline defined by the problem.

### Conclusion
The calculation logic does not account for all edge cases and does not guarantee finding the minimum positive `x` as required by the problem statement. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**
