Postcondition: ***`N` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= N <= 50; `n` is a string that converts to an integer greater than 0; `i` is 0; `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` are assigned values from `map(int, raw_input().split()); `d` is calculated as (xa - xb). If `d` is greater than (ra + rb) squared, then 0 is printed. If `d` is less than or equal to (ra + rb) squared, and `ra` is greater than `rb`, then if the square of (ra - rb) is greater than `d`, 2 is printed; otherwise, 1 is printed. If `ra` is less than or equal to `rb`, then if the square of the difference between `rb` and `ra` is greater than `d`, -2 is printed; otherwise, 1 is printed.***
