Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= N <= 50; `n` is a string that converts to an integer greater than or equal to 1; `i` is `N` - 1 after all iterations; `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` are assigned values from the input during the loop execution; `d` is calculated as (xa - xb) for each iteration; the printed outputs correspond to the conditions evaluated based on `d`, `ra`, and `rb` for each pair of inputs processed.**
