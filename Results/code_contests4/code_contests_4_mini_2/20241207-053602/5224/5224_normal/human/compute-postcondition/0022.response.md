The code snippet assigns the values from `raw_input()` split by space and converts them into integers, mapping them to the variables `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, and `rb`. The initial values of these variables are not specified, but they will now hold the integer values provided as input. The values of `N`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= N <= 50; `n` is a string that converts to an integer greater than 1; `i` is 1; `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` are assigned values from input.**
