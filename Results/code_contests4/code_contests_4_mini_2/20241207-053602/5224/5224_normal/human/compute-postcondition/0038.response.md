The code executes a print statement, which outputs the integer `1`. The values of the other variables remain unaffected as they are not modified by the code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= N <= 50; `n` is a string that converts to an integer greater than 2; `i` is 2; `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` are input values; `d` is calculated as (xa - xb); and we print `1`.
