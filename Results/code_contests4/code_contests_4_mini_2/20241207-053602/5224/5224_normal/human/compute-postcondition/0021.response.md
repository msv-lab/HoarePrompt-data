According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is a string that converts to an integer greater than 0, meaning `n` is at least 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

Since `i` is currently 0, it will be increased to 1 for the next iteration. For the loop to execute a second time, `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`N` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= N <= 50; `n` is a string that converts to an integer greater than 1; `i` is 1**
