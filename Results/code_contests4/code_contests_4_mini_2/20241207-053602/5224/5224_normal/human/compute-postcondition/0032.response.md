Postcondition: ***`N` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= N <= 50; `n` is a string that converts to an integer greater than 1; `i` is 1; `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` are input values; `d` is (xa - xb). If `d` is greater than (ra + rb) squared, the output is 0. Otherwise, if `ra > rb`, the corresponding statements for this condition are executed. If `rb > ra`, the program executes the statements for this condition.***
