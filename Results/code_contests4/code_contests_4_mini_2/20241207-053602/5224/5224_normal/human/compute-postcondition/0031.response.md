Postcondition: ***`N` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= N <= 50; `n` is a string that converts to an integer greater than 1; `i` is 1; `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` are input values; `d` is (xa - xb). If `ra > rb`, then the program executes the corresponding statements for this condition. Otherwise, if `rb > ra`, the program executes the statements for this condition.***
