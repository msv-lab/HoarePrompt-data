Postcondition: ***`N` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= N <= 50; `n` is a string that converts to an integer greater than 2; `i` is 2; `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` are input values; and `d` is calculated as (xa - xb). If `d` is greater than (ra + rb) squared, the output is 0. Otherwise, if `ra` is greater than `rb`, the program handles that case accordingly; otherwise, it processes the case where `rb` is greater than `ra`.***
