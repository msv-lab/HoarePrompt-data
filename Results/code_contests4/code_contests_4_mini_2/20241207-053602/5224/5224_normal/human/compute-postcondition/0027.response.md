Postcondition: ***`N` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= N <= 50; `n` is a string that converts to an integer greater than 1; `i` is 1; `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` are input values; `d` is (xa - xb). If (ra - rb) ** 2 > d, the output of the print statement is 2. Otherwise, the output is 1.***
