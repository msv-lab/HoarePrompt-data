Postcondition: ***`N` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= N <= 50; `n` is a string that converts to an integer greater than 0; `i` is 0; `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` are assigned values from `map(int, raw_input().split()); `d` is calculated as (xa - xb); the value of `d` is less than or equal to (ra + rb) squared; `ra` is greater than `rb`; and the square of (ra - rb) is greater than `d`.***
