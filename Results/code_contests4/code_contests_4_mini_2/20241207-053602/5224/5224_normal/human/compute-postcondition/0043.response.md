Postcondition: ***`N` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= N <= 50; `n` is a string that converts to an integer greater than 2; `i` is 2; `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` are input values; `d` is calculated as (xa - xb). If `ra` is greater than `rb`, the program handles the case accordingly; otherwise, if `rb` is greater than `ra`, it processes that case.***
