The function processes multiple datasets of two circles defined by their centers' coordinates and radii. For each dataset, it determines the relationship between the two circles and prints the following results: 0 if the circles are separate, 2 if circle A is completely inside circle B, -2 if circle B is completely inside circle A, and 1 if the circles overlap or touch. The function accepts a non-negative integer N as input, which specifies the number of datasets to process, and does not return any values; it directly prints the results for each dataset.
