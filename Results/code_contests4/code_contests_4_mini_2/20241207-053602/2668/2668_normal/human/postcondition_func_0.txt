The function accepts a positive integer `num`, a list of lists `lis1` where each sublist contains a positive integer and another positive integer, a positive integer `low`, and a positive integer `high`. It performs a binary search to find if `num` exists as the first element in any sublist of `lis1`. If `num` is found, it returns `True` and the second element of the corresponding sublist; if `num` is not found, it returns `False` and -1. The function assumes that `high` is greater than or equal to `low` and does not handle cases where `low` or `high` are out of bounds for the indices of `lis1`.
