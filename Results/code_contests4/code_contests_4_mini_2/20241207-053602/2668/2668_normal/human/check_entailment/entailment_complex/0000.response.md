Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not seem to correctly implement the logic required to meet the problem description's requirements in all potential cases. 

1. **Incorrect Handling of Inputs**: The code attempts to read inputs from a file or standard input, which adds unnecessary complexity and does not align with the simplicity required by the problem statement. The problem expects straightforward input handling, and the unnecessary conditional checks for file existence complicate the function without providing any added value.

2. **Binary Search Logic**: The `func_1` function is designed to perform a binary search but does not properly handle the case when the list `lis1` is not sorted according to the first element of each sublist. The usage of binary search implies that the input `lis1` should be sorted, but there is no guarantee in the code that `lis1` is sorted before the search is performed.

3. **Incorrect Return Values**: The annotations indicate that if `num` is not found, the function returns `False` and `-1`, but this is not sufficient to handle the logic needed by the main function, which expects specific outputs based on the satisfaction of scientists. The handling of return values from `func_1` does not properly propagate information about which movie index should be selected based on the number of satisfied scientists.

4. **Potential Index Errors**: The way the indices are managed when accessing elements from lists can lead to potential out-of-bounds errors, especially if the lengths of the lists `audio`, `subs`, or `uniques` do not align properly after any filtering or sorting operations.

5. **Satisfaction Logic**: The logic for determining the maximum number of "very pleased" and "almost satisfied" scientists is not fully implemented in the `func_2`. The current implementation lacks a comprehensive loop that would iterate through all movies and check against all scientists' known languages to compute the required counts. Instead, it appears to rely on a single match found via binary search, which does not cover all cases.

6. **Output Handling**: The way the output is set up, particularly with undefined values being written to output files or to standard output, could result in runtime errors or incorrect outputs, especially in cases where no valid movie index is found.

Given these observations, the code does not meet the requirements laid out in the problem description for all cases, and thus the correctness is determined to be false.
