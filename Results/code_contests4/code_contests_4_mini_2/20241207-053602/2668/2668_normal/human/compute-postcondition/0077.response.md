According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `uniques` list. The loop will execute if the length of `uniques` is greater than 0. The `templis` variable does not directly affect the execution of the loop as it is defined outside of the loop context and is not modified within it. Therefore, for the loop to be executed at least once, `uniques` must contain at least one element. 

State: **`templis` is a list of tuples, for the loop to execute the first time `uniques` is a list with at least 1 element, and `z` is 0**
