The code appends a new tuple to the list `templis`. The tuple consists of the element at index `y` of the list `subs` and the value `y + 1`. Given that `y` is 1, the value of `y + 1` will be 2. Therefore, the element appended from `subs` will be `subs[1]`. 

The previous state of `templis` is that it contains the tuple `(subs[0], 1)`, and now it will also contain the tuple `(subs[1], 2)` after the append operation. 

The output state reflects that `templis` now holds two tuples, the original one and the new one.

Output State: **`templis` is a list containing the tuples `(subs[0], 1)` and `(subs[1], 2)`, `subs` is a list with at least 1 element, `y` is 1.**
