According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `z` and the length of the list `uniques`. If `z` is less than the length of `uniques`, the loop can execute once more. At the end of the last iteration, `z` is 1, and `uniques` has at least 1 element, which means that the length of `uniques` is at least 2 for the loop to be executed a second time. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `z` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. 

State: **`templis` is a list of tuples, `uniques` is a list with at least 2 elements, `z` is 2, and `back` is the value returned by `func_1(uniques[2][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`**
