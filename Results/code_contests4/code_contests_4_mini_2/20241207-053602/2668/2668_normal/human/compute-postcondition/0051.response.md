Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `init` is a list with `n` elements sorted in reverse order, `counts` is a list of tuples with at least 2 tuples, if `counts[i][1]` is not equal to `counts[i + 1][1]`, then `i` remains 2, `x` is the third tuple in `counts`, and `uniques` includes `counts[2]`. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program.***
