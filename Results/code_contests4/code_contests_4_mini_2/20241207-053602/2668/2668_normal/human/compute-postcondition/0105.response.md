Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0; `init` is a list with `n` elements sorted in reverse order; `counts` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple; `uniques` contains at least 1 tuple where the second elements of consecutive tuples are not equal and is sorted in reverse order; `subs` is a list of integers derived from the input with at least 1 element; `res` is True; `anss` is the value of `back`; `templis` is an empty list; `z` is equal to the length of `uniques`; `audio2` is a sorted list of the original `audio` list; `i` is 1; `back` is the result of `func_1(uniques[1][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1); `y` is 0; and the first element of `audio` equals the second element of `uniques[i]`.***
