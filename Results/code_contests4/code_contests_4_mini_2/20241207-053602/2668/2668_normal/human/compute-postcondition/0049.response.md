Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `init` is a list with `n` elements sorted in reverse order, `counts` is a list of tuples with at least 2 tuples. If `i + 1` is equal to the length of `counts`, then `uniques` is updated to include both `counts[1]` and `counts[2]`, `i` remains 2, and `x` is the third tuple in `counts`, followed by breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
