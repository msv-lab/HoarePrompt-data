Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `subs` is a sorted list of tuples, `uniques` is a list with at least 2 elements, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `i` is 1, and `back` is assigned the result of `func_1(uniques[1][1], subs, 0, len(subs) - 1)`, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or block of code if the first element of `back` is True.***
