According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `uniques`. The loop will iterate based on the length of `uniques`. For the loop to execute at least once, `uniques` must contain at least one element. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `uniques` is a list with at least 1 element. Additionally, since `i` is the loop variable, it will start at 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `subs` is now a sorted list of tuples, for the loop to execute the first time `uniques` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0**
