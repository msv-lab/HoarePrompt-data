The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `templis` is a list of tuples, `uniques` is a list with at least 2 elements, `z` is 2, `back` is the value returned by `func_1(uniques[2][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
