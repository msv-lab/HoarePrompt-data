`anss` is assigned the value of `back`, which has already been updated to the result of `func_1(uniques[2][1], subs, 0, len(subs) - 1)`. The other variable states remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `subs` is a sorted list of tuples, `uniques` is a list with at least 3 elements, `res` is True, `anss` is the value of `back`, `i` is 2, `back` is the result of `func_1(uniques[2][1], subs, 0, len(subs) - 1)`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `subs` is a sorted list of tuples, `uniques` is a list with at least 3 elements, `res` is True, `anss` is the value of `back`, `i` is 2, `back` is the result of `func_1(uniques[2][1], subs, 0, len(subs) - 1)`**.
