The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `templis` is a list of tuples, `uniques` is a list with at least 1 element, `z` is 0, `back` is a tuple where the first element is true, `res` is True, and `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
