`audio` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the result of `input.readline().split()`. The `input.readline()` function reads a line of input, and `split()` breaks that line into components, which are then converted to integers. The states of the other variables (`n`, `init`, `counts`, and `uniques`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0; `init` is a list with `n` elements sorted in reverse order; `counts` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple; `uniques` contains all tuples from `counts` where the second elements of consecutive tuples are not equal, and `uniques` is now sorted in reverse order; `audio` is a list of integers derived from the input.
