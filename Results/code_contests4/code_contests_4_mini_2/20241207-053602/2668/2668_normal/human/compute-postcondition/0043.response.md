Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `init` is a list with `n` elements sorted in reverse order, `counts` is a list of tuples with at least 2 tuples, `uniques` is updated to include `counts[1]`, `i` is 1, and `x` is the second tuple in `counts` if `i + 1` equals the length of `counts`. If `i + 1` does not equal the length of `counts`, the state remains unchanged.***
