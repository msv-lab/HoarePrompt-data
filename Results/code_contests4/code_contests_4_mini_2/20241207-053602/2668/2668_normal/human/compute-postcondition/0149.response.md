According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `subs` list. If `subs` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `subs` has at least 2 elements, and `y` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` will be incremented by 1, making `y` equal to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `subs` must have at least 3 elements because `y` will need to be less than the length of `subs`, which is currently at least 2.

State: **`back` is assigned from `func_1(uniques[i][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1)`, `res` is True, `anss` is `back`, `templis` contains two elements: `(subs[y], 1)` and `(subs[y], 2)`, `subs` has at least 3 elements, and `y` is 2, if the first element of `audio` at index `y` is equal to `uniques[i][1]`.**
