The function `func_2` accepts the following parameters: 

- `n`: a positive integer representing the number of elements in the list `a` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000).
- `a`: a list of `n` positive integers where each element is between 1 and 10^9 (1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9).
- `m`: a positive integer representing the number of elements in the lists `b` and `c` (1 ≤ m ≤ 200000).
- `b`: a list of `m` positive integers where each element is between 1 and 10^9 (1 ≤ bj ≤ 10^9).
- `c`: a list of `m` positive integers where each element is between 1 and 10^9 (1 ≤ cj ≤ 10^9) and it is guaranteed that bj ≠ cj for each movie j.

The output of the function is not specified in the prompt. Therefore, based on the provided constraints and relationships, we can only outline the parameters without detailing the return value. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n, a list of n positive integers a, a positive integer m, and two lists of m positive integers b and c. Each list b and c contains distinct values for each index j.**
