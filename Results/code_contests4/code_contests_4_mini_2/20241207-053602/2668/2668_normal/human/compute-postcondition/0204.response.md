Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `subs` is a sorted list of tuples, `uniques` contains at least `len(uniques)` elements. If `res` is True, `anss` remains undefined, `i` is the last index checked (`len(uniques) - 1`), and the output is an undefined value since `anss` is undefined. Otherwise, `res` is still True, `anss` remains undefined, `i` is the last index checked (`len(uniques) - 1`), and the output is 1.***
