The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `init` is a list with `n` elements sorted in reverse order, `counts` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `uniques` now contains the first tuple from `counts`, `i` is 0, `x` is the first tuple in `counts` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
