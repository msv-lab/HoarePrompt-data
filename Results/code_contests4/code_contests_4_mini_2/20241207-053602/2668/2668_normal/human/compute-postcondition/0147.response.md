The code appends a new tuple to the list `templis`. The tuple consists of `subs[y]` and `y + 1`. Given the initial state, `y` is 1, so `y + 1` equals 2. The value of `subs[y]` is the second element of the `subs` list. 

The initial state mentions that `templis` already contains one element which is a tuple of `(subs[y], 1)`. After executing the code, `templis` will contain two elements: the original tuple and the new tuple `(subs[y], 2)`.

The other variables (`back`, `res`, `anss`, `subs`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`back` is assigned from `func_1(uniques[i][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1)`, `res` is True, `anss` is `back`, `templis` contains two elements: `(subs[y], 1)` and `(subs[y], 2)`, `subs` has at least 2 elements, and `y` is 1.**
