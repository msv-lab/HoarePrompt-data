Postcondition: ***If `back[0]` is True, then `back` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(uniques[z][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`, `z` is incremented by 1, `res` is set to True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
