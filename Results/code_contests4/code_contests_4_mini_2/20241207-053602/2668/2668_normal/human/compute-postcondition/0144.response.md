`templis` is an empty list, and we append a tuple containing the first element of `subs` (which is `subs[y]`), and `y + 1` (which is 1 since `y` is 0). The value of `subs[y]` is not specified, but it will be included in the final output. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `back` is assigned from `func_1(uniques[i][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1)`, `res` is True, `anss` is `back`, `templis` now contains one element which is a tuple of `(subs[y], 1)`, `subs` has at least 1 element, `y` is 0, and the first element of `audio` at index `y` is equal to `uniques[i][1]`.

Output State: **`back` is assigned from `func_1(uniques[i][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1)`, `res` is True, `anss` is `back`, `templis` now contains one element which is a tuple of `(subs[y], 1)`, `subs` has at least 1 element, `y` is 0, and the first element of `audio` at index `y` is equal to `uniques[i][1]`.**
