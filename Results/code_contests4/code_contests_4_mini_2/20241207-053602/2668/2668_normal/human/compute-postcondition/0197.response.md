Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `subs` is a sorted list of tuples, `uniques` is a list with at least 3 elements, `res` is True, `anss` is the value of `back`, `i` is 2, and `back` is the result of `func_1(uniques[2][1], subs, 0, len(subs) - 1). If `back[0]` is True, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
