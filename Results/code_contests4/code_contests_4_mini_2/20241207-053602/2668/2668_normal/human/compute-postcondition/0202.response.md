Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `subs` is a sorted list of tuples, `uniques` contains at least `len(uniques)` elements, `res` is True indicating that at least one iteration resulted in `back[0]` being True, `anss` remains undefined since there were no successful iterations, and `i` is the last index checked, which is `len(uniques) - 1`.***
