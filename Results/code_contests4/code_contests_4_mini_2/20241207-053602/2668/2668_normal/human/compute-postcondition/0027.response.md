The `counts` list is being appended with a new tuple. The first element of the tuple is calculated as `counts[len(counts) - 1][0] + 1`, which increments the first element of the last tuple in the `counts` list by 1. The second element of the tuple is `init[i]`, which is the element at index `i` of the `init` list. Since `i` is 2, this means `init[2]` will be used as the second element. The previous values of the variables are not changed; only the `counts` list is affected. Therefore, the output state will reflect the change in the `counts` list based on the existing values.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `init` is a list with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `x` is equal to `init[2]`, and `counts` is appended with a tuple of the incremented first element of the last tuple in `counts` and `init[2]`.**
