Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `subs` is a sorted list of tuples, `uniques` is a list with at least `len(uniques)` elements, `res` is True if at least one `back[0]` was True during the loop, otherwise False, `anss` contains the value of `back` from the last successful iteration where `back[0]` was True, and `i` is the last index checked, which is `len(uniques) - 1`.**
