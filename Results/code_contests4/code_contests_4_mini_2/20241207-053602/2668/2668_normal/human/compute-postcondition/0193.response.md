The value of `back` is assigned the result of `func_1(uniques[i][1], subs, 0, len(subs) - 1)`. The value of `i` is 2, so `uniques[i][1]` represents the second index of the `uniques` list. The function `func_1` is executed with this value along with the `subs` list and the indices 0 and `len(subs) - 1`. This changes the value of `back` to whatever `func_1` returns, but since we do not know the specific output of `func_1`, we can only state that `back` has now been updated. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `subs` is a sorted list of tuples, `uniques` is a list with at least 3 elements, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `i` is 2, and `back` has been updated to the result of `func_1(uniques[2][1], subs, 0, len(subs) - 1)**
