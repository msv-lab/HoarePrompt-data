Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `subs` is a sorted list of tuples, `uniques` contains at least `len(uniques)` elements, `res` is True, `anss` remains undefined, `i` is the last index checked (`len(uniques) - 1`), and we attempted to write an undefined value to 'output.txt' if it exists. Otherwise, the output remains undefined since `anss` is still undefined.***
