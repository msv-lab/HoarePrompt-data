Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `subs` is a sorted list of tuples, `uniques` is a list with at least 1 element, and `i` is 0. If the first element of `back` is true, then `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
