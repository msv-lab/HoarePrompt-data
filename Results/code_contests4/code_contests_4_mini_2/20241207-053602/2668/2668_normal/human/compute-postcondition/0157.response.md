The variable `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, which was previously assigned from the function `func_1`. Since `back` is a tuple where the first element is True, the value of `anss` will also be a tuple with the first element as True. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `back` is assigned from `func_1`, `res` is True, `anss` is a tuple with the first element True, `templis` contains all tuples of the form (subs[y], y + 1), `z` is 0, and `res` remains True.

Output State: **`back` is assigned from `func_1`, `res` is True, `anss` is a tuple with the first element True, `templis` contains all tuples of the form (subs[y], y + 1), `z` is 0, and `res` remains True.**
