Postcondition: ***`back` is the value returned by `func_1` for the last index processed. If `back[0]` is True, then `res` is True for any prior iteration, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `templis` contains all tuples of the form `(subs[y], y + 1)` for valid `y` indices, and `z` is equal to the length of `uniques`, resulting in a break from the most internal loop or if statement.***
