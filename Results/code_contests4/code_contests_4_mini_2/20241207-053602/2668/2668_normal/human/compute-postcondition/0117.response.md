Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `init` is a list with `n` elements sorted in reverse order, `counts` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `uniques` contains at least 1 tuple where the second elements of consecutive tuples are not equal and is sorted in reverse order, `subs` is a list of integers derived from the input, `res` is True, `anss` is the value of `back`, `templis` is a list of tuples containing pairs `(subs[y], y + 1)` for each `y` where `audio[y][0]` equals `uniques[i][1]`, `z` is equal to the length of `uniques`, `audio2` is a sorted list of the original `audio` list, `i` is 1, `back` is the result of `func_1(uniques[0][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1);`, `y` is equal to `len(subs) - 1` or `len(subs)` depending on if the loop executed at least once, `z` becomes the length of `uniques` after execution of `func_1`, and the first element of `back` is True.***
