Postcondition: ***`templis` is a list of tuples, `uniques` is a list with at least 2 elements, `z` is 2, and `back` is the value returned by `func_1(uniques[2][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`. If `back[0]` is True, then `res` is set to True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
