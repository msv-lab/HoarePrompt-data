The `templis` list is modified by appending a new tuple. The new tuple consists of the element at index `y` of the `subs` list and `y + 1`. Given that `y` is 2, `subs[y]` refers to `subs[2]`. Therefore, a new tuple `(subs[2], 3)` is appended to `templis`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `init` is a list with `n` elements sorted in reverse order; `counts` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple; `uniques` contains at least 1 tuple where the second elements of consecutive tuples are not equal and is sorted in reverse order; `subs` is a list of integers derived from the input with at least 3 elements; `res` is True; `anss` is the value of `back`; `templis` is now `[(subs[0], 1), (subs[1], 2), (subs[2], 3)]`; `z` is equal to the length of `uniques`; `audio2` is a sorted list of the original `audio` list; `i` is 1; `back` is the result of `func_1(uniques[1][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1);` and `y` is 2.**
