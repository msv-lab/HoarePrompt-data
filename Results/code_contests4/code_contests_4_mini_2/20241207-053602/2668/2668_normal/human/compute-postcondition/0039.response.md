Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `init` is a list with `n` elements sorted in reverse order, and `counts` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple. If the second element of the tuple at index `i` in `counts` is not equal to the second element of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `counts`, then the first tuple from `counts` is appended to `uniques`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `uniques`, `i` remains 0, and `x` is the first tuple in `counts`.***
