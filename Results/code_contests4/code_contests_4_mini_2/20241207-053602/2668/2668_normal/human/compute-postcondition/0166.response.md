According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `z` and the length of `uniques`. If `z` is less than `len(uniques) - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `back` is the value returned by `func_1(uniques[z][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`. If `back[0]` is True, it affects the variables `res` and `anss`, but it does not affect the loop variable `z`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `z` must be incremented by 1.

At the end of the last iteration, `z` is at its current value, and for the loop to execute again, `z` will be increased by 1. Thus, for the loop to execute a second time, `z` must be less than `len(uniques)`.

State: **`back` is the value returned by `func_1(uniques[z][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`, for the loop to execute a second time `z` must be less than `len(uniques)`, and `z` is incremented by 1.**
