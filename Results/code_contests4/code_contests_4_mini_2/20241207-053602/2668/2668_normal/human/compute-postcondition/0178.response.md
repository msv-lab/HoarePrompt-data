The `subs` list is sorted in ascending order. Since `subs` is a list of tuples with pairs `(subs[i], i + 1)`, after sorting, the order of the elements in `subs` will change based on the first element of each tuple, which is `subs[i]`. The variable `n` is not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0; `subs` is now a sorted list of tuples.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `subs` is now a sorted list of tuples.**
