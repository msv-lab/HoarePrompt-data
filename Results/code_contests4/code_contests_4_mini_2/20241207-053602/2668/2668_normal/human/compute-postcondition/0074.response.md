The code appends a new tuple to the list `templis`. The new tuple consists of the element at index `y` in the list `subs` and the value of `y + 1`. Given the initial state specifies that `y` is equal to 1, the element being accessed in `subs` will be `subs[1]`. The value of `y + 1` will therefore be `2`. 

As a result, the `templis` list will now contain an additional tuple `(subs[1], 2)`. The previous values of `templis`, which already contains the tuple `(subs[0], 1)`, are not affected beyond this addition.

Output State: **`templis` is a list containing the tuples `(subs[0], 1)` and `(subs[1], 2)`; `y` is 1**
