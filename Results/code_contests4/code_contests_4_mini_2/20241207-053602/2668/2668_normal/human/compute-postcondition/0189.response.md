The variable `anss` is assigned the value of `back`. The value of `back` is determined by the result of the function `func_1(uniques[1][1], subs, 0, len(subs) - 1)`. Since `back` is directly assigned to `anss`, the state of `anss` will reflect whatever the value of `back` is after the function call. The other variables are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `subs` is a sorted list of tuples, `uniques` is a list with at least 2 elements, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `i` is 1, `back` is assigned the result of `func_1(uniques[1][1], subs, 0, len(subs) - 1)`**
