Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `init` is a list with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, and `x` is equal to `init[2]`. If `init[i]` is equal to `init[i - 1]`, then `counts` is appended with a tuple of the incremented first element of the last tuple in `counts` and `init[2]`. Otherwise, `counts` is updated to include the tuple (1, init[2]).***
