Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `init` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, and `x` is equal to `init[0]`. If the element at index `i` of `init` is equal to the element at index `i - 1`, a new tuple is appended to `counts`. If the element at index `i` of `init` is not equal to the element at index `i - 1`, `counts` is updated to include the tuple (1, init[i]).***
