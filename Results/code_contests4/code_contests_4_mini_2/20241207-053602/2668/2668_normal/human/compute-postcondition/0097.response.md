The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `templis` is a list of tuples, `uniques` is a list with at least 0 elements, `z` is equal to the length of `uniques`, `res` is True if at least one `back[0]` was True, otherwise it is False, `anss` is the last `back` where `back[0]` was True or undefined, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
