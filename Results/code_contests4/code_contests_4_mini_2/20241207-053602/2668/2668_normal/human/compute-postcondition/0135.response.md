Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `init` is a list with `n` elements sorted in reverse order, `counts` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `uniques` contains at least 1 tuple where the second elements of consecutive tuples are not equal and is sorted in reverse order, `subs` is a list of integers derived from the input, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back` from the last iteration where `back[0]` was True, `templis` is a list of tuples containing pairs `(subs[y], y + 1)` for each `y` where `audio[y][0]` equals `uniques[i][1]`, `z` is equal to the length of `uniques`, `audio2` is a sorted list of the original `audio` list, `i` is 1, and `y` is equal to `len(subs) - 1` or `len(subs)` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
