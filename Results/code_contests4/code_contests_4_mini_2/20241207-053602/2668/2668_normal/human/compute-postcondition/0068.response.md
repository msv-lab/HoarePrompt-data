`templis` is an empty list initially. The code appends a tuple to `templis`, where the first element is `subs[y]` and the second element is `y + 1`. Given that `y` is 0, the first element of the tuple becomes `subs[0]`, and the second element becomes `0 + 1`, which is 1. Therefore, `templis` will now contain one element: the tuple `(subs[0], 1)`. The other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`templis` is now [(subs[0], 1)], `subs` is a list with at least 1 element, `y` is 0, and the first element of `audio` at index `y` is equal to the second element of `uniques` at index `i`.**
