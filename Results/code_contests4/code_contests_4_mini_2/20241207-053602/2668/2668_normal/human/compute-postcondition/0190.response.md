The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or block of code we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `subs` is a sorted list of tuples, `uniques` is a list with at least 2 elements, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `i` is 1, `back` is assigned the result of `func_1(uniques[1][1], subs, 0, len(subs) - 1)` and we break out of the most internal loop or block of code.
