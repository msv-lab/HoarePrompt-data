Given the initial state where `back` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(uniques[1][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`, we can conclude that `back` holds a specific value based on the function's return. Then the code snippet assigns this value to `anss`. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`templis` is a list of tuples, `uniques` is a list with at least 1 element, `z` is 1; `back` is the value returned by `func_1(uniques[1][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1); `res` is True; `anss` is assigned the value of `back`.**
