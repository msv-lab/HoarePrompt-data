The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `init` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and `x` is equal to `init[1]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
