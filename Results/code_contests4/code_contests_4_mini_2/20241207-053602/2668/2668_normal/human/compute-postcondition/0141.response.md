The code initializes an empty list `templis`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed by this line of code, and it does not affect `back`, `res`, or `anss`. Therefore, the Output State remains focused on the new variable initialized.

Output State: **`back` is assigned the value from `func_1(uniques[i][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1)`; `res` is assigned the value of True; `anss` is assigned the value of `back`; `templis` is an empty list.**
