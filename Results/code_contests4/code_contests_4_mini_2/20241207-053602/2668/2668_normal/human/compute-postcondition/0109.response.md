The variable `templis` is a list that currently contains one tuple: `[(subs[0], 1)]`. The code snippet `templis.append((subs[y], y + 1))` adds a new tuple to `templis`. The value of `y` is 1, so `subs[y]` refers to `subs[1]`, and `y + 1` evaluates to `2`. Therefore, the new tuple that will be appended is `(subs[1], 2)`.

After executing this line, `templis` will now contain two tuples: `[(subs[0], 1), (subs[1], 2)]`. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `init` is a list with `n` elements sorted in reverse order; `counts` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple; `uniques` contains at least 1 tuple where the second elements of consecutive tuples are not equal and is sorted in reverse order; `subs` is a list of integers derived from the input with at least 3 elements; `res` is True; `anss` is the value of `back`; `templis` is now `[(subs[0], 1), (subs[1], 2)]`; `z` is equal to the length of `uniques`; `audio2` is a sorted list of the original `audio` list; `i` is 1; `back` is the result of `func_1(uniques[1][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1);` and `y` is 1.**
