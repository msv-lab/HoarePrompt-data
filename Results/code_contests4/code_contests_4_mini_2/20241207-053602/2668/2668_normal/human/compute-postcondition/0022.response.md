The code appends a tuple `(1, init[i])` to the `counts` list. Here, `i` is 1, and `init` is a list with at least 2 elements. Therefore, `init[i]` will access the second element of the `init` list. The variable `n` remains greater than 0, `init` is unchanged, `i` remains 1, and `x` is still equal to `init[1]`. The `counts` list is modified by adding a new tuple.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `init` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `x` is equal to `init[1]`, and `counts` has a new tuple (1, init[1]) appended to it.**
