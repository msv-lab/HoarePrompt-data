Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `init` is a list with `n` elements sorted in reverse order, `counts` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `uniques` contains at least 3 tuples where the second elements of consecutive tuples are not equal and is sorted in reverse order, `subs` is a list of integers derived from the input, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `templis` is a list of tuples containing pairs `(subs[y], y + 1)` for each `y` where `audio[y][0]` equals `uniques[i][1]`, `z` is updated to the length of `uniques`, and `audio2` is a sorted list of the original `audio` list. If `back[0]` is True, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
