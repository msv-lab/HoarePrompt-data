Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `init` is a list with `n` elements sorted in reverse order, `counts` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `uniques` now contains the first tuple from `counts`, `i` is 0, `x` is the first tuple in `counts`, and the second element of the tuple at index `i` in `counts` is not equal to the second element of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `counts`.***
