The variable `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, which is the value returned by `func_1(uniques[z][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`. The value of `back` does not change, and `res` remains True. Therefore, the Output State is: `back` is the value returned by `func_1(uniques[z][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`; `res` is True; `anss` is assigned the value of `back`.

Output State: **`back` is the value returned by `func_1(uniques[z][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`; `res` is True; `anss` is assigned the value of `back`.**
