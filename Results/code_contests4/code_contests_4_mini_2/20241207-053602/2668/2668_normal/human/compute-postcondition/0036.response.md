Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `init` is a list with `n` elements sorted in reverse order, `counts` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `uniques` now contains the first tuple from `counts`, `i` is 0, and `x` is the first tuple in `counts`. This occurs if `i + 1` equals the length of `counts`, leading to a break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
