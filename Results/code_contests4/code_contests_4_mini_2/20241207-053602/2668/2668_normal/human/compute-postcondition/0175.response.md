Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `init` is a list with `n` elements sorted in reverse order; `counts` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple; `uniques` contains all tuples from `counts` where the second elements of consecutive tuples are not equal and is sorted in reverse order; `subs` is a list of integers derived from the input; `res` is True if at least one `back[0]` was True during any iteration, otherwise it is False; `anss` is the last `back` where `back[0]` was True or remains undefined if none were True; `templis` is a list of tuples containing pairs `(subs[y], y + 1)` for each valid `y` where `audio[y][0]` equals the last processed `uniques[i][1]`; `audio2` is a sorted list of the original `audio` list; and `i` is equal to the length of `uniques` (i.e., `i` will be equal to the number of iterations of the loop).**
