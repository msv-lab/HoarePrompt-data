The function `func_1` is called with parameters `uniques[i][1]`, `audio2`, `0`, and `len(audio2) - 1`. The values of `uniques[i][1]` and `audio2` will determine the behavior of `func_1`, while the last two parameters set the starting and ending indices for the function's operation. The output of `func_1` will be stored in `back`.

Since `res` is assigned the value of `back[0]` from the last iteration where `back[0]` was True, we can infer that the function is expected to return a tuple where the first element is boolean.

The output state will reflect the assignment of the `back` variable and its impact on `res`, but the specific contents of `back` and `res` are not known from the initial state. Therefore, we will indicate that `back` is assigned a value based on the `func_1` call, and `res` will be determined from that.

Output State: **`back` is assigned the value from `func_1(uniques[i][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1)`; `res` is assigned the value of `back[0]` from the last iteration where `back[0]` was True.**
