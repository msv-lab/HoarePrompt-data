Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `init` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and `x` is equal to `init[1]`. If `init[i]` is equal to `init[i - 1]`, then `counts` is updated with an appended tuple containing `(counts[len(counts) - 1][0] + 1, init[1])`. Otherwise, `counts` has a new tuple `(1, init[1])` appended to it.***
