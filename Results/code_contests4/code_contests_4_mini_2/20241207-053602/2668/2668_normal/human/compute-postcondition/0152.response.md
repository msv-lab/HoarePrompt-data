Output State: **`back` is assigned from `func_1(uniques[i][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1)`, `res` is True, `anss` is `back`, `templis` contains all tuples of the form `(subs[y], y + 1)` for each `y` where `audio[y][0]` is equal to `uniques[i][1]`, `subs` has at least as many elements as there are valid `y` indices, and `y` is the last index processed in the loop.**
