According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the length of `uniques`. Since `i` is currently 1 and `uniques` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute a second time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and for the loop to execute again, `uniques` must have at least 3 elements.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `subs` is a sorted list of tuples, `uniques` is a list with at least 3 elements, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `i` is 2, and `back` is assigned the result of `func_1(uniques[2][1], subs, 0, len(subs) - 1)`**
