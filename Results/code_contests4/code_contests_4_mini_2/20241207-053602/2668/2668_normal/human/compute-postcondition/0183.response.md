The variable `anss` is assigned the value of `back`. Since `back` has been previously assigned a value returned by `func_1(uniques[i][1], subs, 0, len(subs) - 1)` and the first element of `back` is true, `anss` will also be assigned this true value. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `subs` is a sorted list of tuples, `uniques` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `back` is a tuple where the first element is true, `res` is True, and `anss` is assigned the value of `back`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `subs` is a sorted list of tuples, `uniques` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `back` is a tuple where the first element is true, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`.**
