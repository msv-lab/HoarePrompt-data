Functionality: ** The function reads two lists of integers representing bus and trolley capacities, calculates the total cost based on given constraints (applying limits from constants c1, c2, and c3), and prints out the minimum of the calculated totals and a maximum limit c4. The function does not return any value but prints the result instead. **
