The values of `n` and `m` are assigned new integers based on input from `raw_input()`, but the previous values of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` remain unchanged, and `ai` and `bi` also remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4` are assigned new integer values based on input; `n` and `m` are assigned new integer values from input.

Output State: **`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4` are assigned new integer values based on input; `n` and `m` are assigned new integer values from input.**
