The values of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` are assigned based on the input received through `raw_input()`, which is split into separate values and converted into integers. The previous values of these variables are replaced by the input values. The variables `n`, `m`, `ai`, and `bi` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State will reflect the new values of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4`.

Output State: **`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4` are assigned new integer values based on input; `n`, `m`, `ai`, and `bi` remain unchanged.**
