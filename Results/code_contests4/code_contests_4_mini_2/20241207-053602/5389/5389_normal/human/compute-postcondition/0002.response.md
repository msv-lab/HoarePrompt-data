The variable `bus` is assigned a list of integers, where each integer is converted from a string input split by spaces. The values of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4` are new integer values based on input; `n` and `m` are new integer values from input; `bus` is a list of integers derived from input.

Output State: **`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4` are new integer values based on input; `n` and `m` are new integer values from input; `bus` is a list of integers derived from input.**
