You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Vasya often uses public transport. The transport in the city is of two types: trolleys and buses. The city has n buses and m trolleys, the buses are numbered by integers from 1 to n, the trolleys are numbered by integers from 1 to m.

Public transport is not free. There are 4 types of tickets: 

  1. A ticket for one ride on some bus or trolley. It costs c1 burles; 
  2. A ticket for an unlimited number of rides on some bus or on some trolley. It costs c2 burles; 
  3. A ticket for an unlimited number of rides on all buses or all trolleys. It costs c3 burles; 
  4. A ticket for an unlimited number of rides on all buses and trolleys. It costs c4 burles. 



Vasya knows for sure the number of rides he is going to make and the transport he is going to use. He asked you for help to find the minimum sum of burles he will have to spend on the tickets.

Input

The first line contains four integers c1, c2, c3, c4 (1 ≤ c1, c2, c3, c4 ≤ 1000) — the costs of the tickets.

The second line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000) — the number of buses and trolleys Vasya is going to use.

The third line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ 1000) — the number of times Vasya is going to use the bus number i.

The fourth line contains m integers bi (0 ≤ bi ≤ 1000) — the number of times Vasya is going to use the trolley number i.

Output

Print a single number — the minimum sum of burles Vasya will have to spend on the tickets.

Note

In the first sample the profitable strategy is to buy two tickets of the first type (for the first bus), one ticket of the second type (for the second bus) and one ticket of the third type (for all trolleys). It totals to (2·1) + 3 + 7 = 12 burles.

In the second sample the profitable strategy is to buy one ticket of the fourth type.

In the third sample the profitable strategy is to buy two tickets of the third type: for all buses and for all trolleys.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: c1, c2, c3, c4 are integers in the range [1, 1000]; n and m are integers in the range [1, 1000]; ai is a list of integers with length n where each integer is in the range [0, 1000]; bi is a list of integers with length m where each integer is in the range [0, 1000].
def func():
    c1, c2, c3, c4 = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    n, m = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    bus = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    trol = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    busc1 = []
    bussum = 0
    trolsum = 0
    for x in bus:
        bussum += min(x * c1, c2)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `bussum` is equal to the sum of min(x * c1, c2) for each integer x in the list `bus`; `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4` are new integer values; `n` and `m` are new integer values; `bus` is a list of integers; `busc1` is an empty list; `trolsum` is 0.
    for x in trol:
        trolsum += min(x * c1, c2)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `bussum` is equal to the sum of min(x * c1, c2) for each integer x in the list `bus`; `trolsum` is equal to the sum of min(x * c1, c2) for each integer x in the list `trol`.
    res = min(bussum, c3) + min(trolsum, c3)
    res = min(res, c4)
    print(res)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two lists of integers representing bus and trolley capacities, calculates the total cost based on given constraints (applying limits from constants c1, c2, and c3), and prints out the minimum of the calculated totals and a maximum limit c4. The function does not return any value but prints the result instead.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
