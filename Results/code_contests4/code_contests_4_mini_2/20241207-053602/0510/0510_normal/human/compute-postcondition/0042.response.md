Output State: **`N` and `H` are positive integers, `A` is a list containing `N` input integers, `B` is a reversed sorted list containing `N` input integers followed by -1, `i` is `N`, `a` is the last input integer, `b` is assigned the value of `B[bi]`, `am` is the maximum value in list `A`, and for the loop to execute again `h` must be less than `H`.**
