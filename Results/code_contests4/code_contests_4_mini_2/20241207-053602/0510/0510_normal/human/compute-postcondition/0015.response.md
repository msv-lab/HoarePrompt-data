The loop reads `N` pairs of integers and appends them to lists `A` and `B`. After all iterations of the loop, the following holds true:

- `N` is a positive integer.
- `H` is a positive integer.
- `A` is a list containing `N` input integers `a`.
- `B` is a list containing `N` input integers `b`.
- `i` will be equal to `N`.
- The last values of `a` and `b` are the last input integers read.

If `N` is 0, then the loop does not execute, and both `A` and `B` remain empty.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `H` is a positive integer, `A` is a list containing `N` input integers, `B` is a list containing `N` input integers, `i` is `N`, `a` is the last input integer, `b` is the last input integer.**
