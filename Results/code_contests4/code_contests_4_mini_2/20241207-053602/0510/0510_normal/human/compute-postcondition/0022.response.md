The variable `bi` is assigned the value `0`. Since there are no previous values of `bi` stated in the initial conditions, we simply state that `bi` is now `0`. The other variables (`N`, `H`, `A`, `B`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `am`, `h`, `c`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `H` is a positive integer, `A` is a list containing `N` input integers, `B` is a reversed sorted list containing `N` input integers followed by -1, `i` is `N`, `a` is the last input integer, `b` is the last input integer; `am` is the maximum value in list `A`; `h` is 0; `c` is 0; `bi` is 0.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `H` is a positive integer, `A` is a list containing `N` input integers, `B` is a reversed sorted list containing `N` input integers followed by -1, `i` is `N`, `a` is the last input integer, `b` is the last input integer; `am` is the maximum value in list `A`; `h` is 0; `c` is 0; `bi` is 0.**
