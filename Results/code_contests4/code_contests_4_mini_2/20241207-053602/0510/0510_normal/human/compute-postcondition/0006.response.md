The code `B.append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list `B`. Since `B` is initially an empty list and `b` is defined as an input integer, the state of `B` will change to contain the single element `b`. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `H` is a positive integer, `A` is a list containing the input integer `a`, `B` contains the input integer `b`, `i` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `H` is a positive integer, `A` is a list containing the input integer `a`, `B` contains the input integer `b`, `i` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer.**
