Postcondition: ***`N` and `H` are positive integers, `A` is a list containing `N` input integers, `B` is a reversed sorted list containing `N` input integers followed by -1, `i` is `N`, `a` is the last input integer, `b` is `B[bi]`, `am` is the maximum value in list `A`, and `h` is updated accordingly. If `b` is less than `am`, `c` is updated by adding `int(ceil((H - h) * 1.0 / am))` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `h` is updated to `h + b`, `c` is increased by 1, and `bi` is incremented by 1.***
