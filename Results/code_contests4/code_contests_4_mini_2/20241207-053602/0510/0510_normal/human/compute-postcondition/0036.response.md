Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `H` is a positive integer, `A` is a list containing `N` input integers, `B` is a reversed sorted list containing `N` input integers followed by -1, `i` is `N`, `a` is the last input integer, `b` is `B[bi]`, `am` is the maximum value in list `A`, `h` is updated accordingly, `c` is updated by adding `int(ceil((H - h) * 1.0 / am))` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
