Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer, `H` is a positive integer, `A` is a list containing `N` input integers, `B` is a reversed sorted list containing `N` input integers followed by -1, `i` is `N`, `a` is the last input integer, `b` is the first integer in list `B`, `am` is the maximum value in list `A`, and `h` is updated accordingly. If `b` is less than `am`, then `c` is updated to `c + int(ceil(H / am))` and `bi` remains 0. Otherwise, if `b` is greater than or equal to `am`, then `h` is updated to `h + b`, `c` is set to 1, and `bi` is set to 1.***
