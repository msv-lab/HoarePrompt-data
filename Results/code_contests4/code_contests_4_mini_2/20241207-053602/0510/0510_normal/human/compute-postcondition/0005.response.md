The variable `A` is an empty list initially, and the code appends the value of `a` to this list. Since `a` is an input integer (from `raw_input()`), after executing the code, `A` will contain one element which is the value of `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `H` is a positive integer, `A` is a list containing the input integer `a`, `B` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**
