The code initializes an empty list `A`. The values of the variables `N` and `H` are not affected by this operation. The initial state of `A` becomes an empty list, but `N` and `H` retain their positive integer values. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5), `H` is a positive integer (1 ≤ H ≤ 10^9), and `A` is an empty list.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5), `H` is a positive integer (1 ≤ H ≤ 10^9), and `A` is an empty list.**
