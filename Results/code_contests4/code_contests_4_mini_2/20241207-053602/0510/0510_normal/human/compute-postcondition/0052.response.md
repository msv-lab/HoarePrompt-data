Functionality: ** The function reads a list of katana power values and computes how many times a user can utilize these powers to reach a target value H. It does this by first determining the maximum power from the input list and then iterating through the sorted list of powers, incrementing a count based on the sum of powers used until the target H is reached. If the maximum power is not sufficient to meet the target, it calculates how many additional uses are needed based on the maximum power. The function ultimately returns the total number of uses needed to reach or exceed the target H. **
