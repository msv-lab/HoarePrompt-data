The value of `bi` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `bi` is 0. Therefore, after execution, `bi` becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `H` is a positive integer, `A` is a list containing `N` input integers, `B` is a reversed sorted list containing `N` input integers followed by -1, `i` is `N`, `a` is the last input integer, `b` is the first integer in list `B`, `am` is the maximum value in list `A`, `h` is h + b, `c` is 1, `bi` is 1; the value of `b` is greater than or equal to `am`.**
