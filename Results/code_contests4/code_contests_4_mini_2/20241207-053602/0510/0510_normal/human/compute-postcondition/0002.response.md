The variable `B` is assigned an empty list. The values of the other variables `N`, `H`, and `A` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5), `H` is a positive integer (1 ≤ H ≤ 10^9), `A` is an empty list, and `B` is an empty list.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5), `H` is a positive integer (1 ≤ H ≤ 10^9), `A` is an empty list, `B` is an empty list**.
