To analyze the impact of the given code snippet `c += int(ceil((H - h) * 1.0 / am))`, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Understanding Variable States:**
   - `H` is a positive integer.
   - `h` is currently 0 (as per the initial state).
   - `am` is the maximum value in the list `A`, which is also a positive integer.
   - `c` starts at 0.

2. **Calculation Steps:**
   - The expression `(H - h)` is calculated first. Since `h` is 0, this simplifies to `H`.
   - Next, we divide `H` by `am`, resulting in `(H / am)`. Since both `H` and `am` are positive integers, this division will yield a float.
   - We then multiply the result by `1.0` to ensure it remains a float (although it already is).
   - The `ceil` function is applied to round up the result to the nearest integer.
   - Finally, we convert this rounded value to an integer and add it to `c`.

3. **Final Output Calculation:**
   - The new value of `c` after this operation is `c + int(ceil(H / am))`.

4. **Output State Construction:**
   - `H` is a positive integer, `h` is 0, `am` is the maximum value in list `A`, and `c` is being updated based on the calculation. The exact numeric values of `H` and `am` are not provided, but we note that `c` is updated accordingly.

Based on this reasoning, the output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `H` is a positive integer, `A` is a list containing `N` input integers, `B` is a reversed sorted list containing `N` input integers followed by -1, `i` is `N`, `a` is the last input integer, `b` is the first integer in list `B`, `am` is the maximum value in list `A`, `h` is 0, `c` is updated to `c + int(ceil(H / am))`, `bi` is 0; and the value of `b` is less than the maximum value `am` in list `A`.**
