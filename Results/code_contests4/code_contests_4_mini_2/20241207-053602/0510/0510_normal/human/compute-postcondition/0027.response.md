The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `H` is a positive integer, `A` is a list containing `N` input integers, `B` is a reversed sorted list containing `N` input integers followed by -1, `i` is `N`, `a` is the last input integer, `b` is the first integer in list `B`, `am` is the maximum value in list `A`, `h` is 0, `c` is updated to `c + int(ceil(H / am))`, `bi` is 0; and the value of `b` is less than the maximum value `am` in list `A`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
