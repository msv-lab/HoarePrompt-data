The statement `B.append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list `B`. The values of `N`, `H`, `A`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new state of `B` with `b` added to it.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `H` is a positive integer, `A` is a list containing the input integer `a` followed by `a`, `B` now contains the input integer `b` appended to it, `i` is 1**
