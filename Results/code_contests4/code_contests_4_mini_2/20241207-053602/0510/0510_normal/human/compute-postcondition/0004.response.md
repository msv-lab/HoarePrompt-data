The variables `a` and `b` are assigned the values obtained from `raw_input()`, which takes a line of input, splits it, and converts the split values into integers through the `map` function. The values of `a` and `b` will depend on the input provided. The other variables (`N`, `H`, `A`, `B`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `H` is a positive integer, `A` is an empty list, `B` is an empty list, `i` is 0; `a` and `b` are input integers from `raw_input()`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `H` is a positive integer, `A` is an empty list, `B` is an empty list, `i` is 0; `a` and `b` are input integers from `raw_input()`**.
