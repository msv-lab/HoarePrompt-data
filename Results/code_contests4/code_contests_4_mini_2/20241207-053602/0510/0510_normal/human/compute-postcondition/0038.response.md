The value of `c` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `c` is unknown, but it increases by 1. The states of the other variables (`N`, `H`, `A`, `B`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `am`, `h`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `H` is a positive integer, `A` is a list containing `N` input integers, `B` is a reversed sorted list containing `N` input integers followed by -1, `i` is `N`, `a` is the last input integer, `b` is `B[bi]`, `am` is the maximum value in list `A`, `h` is updated to `h + b`, and `c` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `H` is a positive integer, `A` is a list containing `N` input integers, `B` is a reversed sorted list containing `N` input integers followed by -1, `i` is `N`, `a` is the last input integer, `b` is `B[bi]`, `am` is the maximum value in list `A`, `h` is updated to `h + b`, and `c` is increased by 1.**
