Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not implement the required functionality to determine the minimum number of edges needed to make the graph harmonious. Instead, it contains several functions that handle input and output operations without any actual logic to analyze the graph structure or determine the number of edges to add.

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: Reads and returns a single integer input from the user. This does not relate to the graph or its edges.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: Reads a line of input and returns a list of integers, but does not analyze or manipulate the graph in any meaningful way.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: Outputs an integer as a string but does not contribute to solving the problem.

4. **Function 4 (`func_4`)**: Takes an array and prints it. Again, this does not analyze the graph or determine how to make it harmonious.

5. **Function 5 (`func_5`)**: Reads multiple integers from input, but does not implement any logic to analyze the edges or nodes of the graph.

None of these functions work towards the goal of checking the harmony of the graph or calculating the minimum edges required to achieve harmony as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is clearly incorrect with respect to the requirements set forth in the problem description.
