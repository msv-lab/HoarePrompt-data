The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters. It reads input that consists of edges defined by integers `u_i` and `v_i`, which represent connections in an undirected simple graph with constraints on `n` and `m`. After executing the function body, it returns a list of integers. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_5` is to read input representing edges of a graph and return a list of these integers.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns a list of integers representing the edges of an undirected simple graph.**
