n is an integer representing the number of nodes in the graph, where 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; m is an integer representing the number of edges in the graph, where 1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000; each edge is defined by two distinct integers u_i and v_i (1 ≤ u_i, v_i ≤ n, u_i ≠ v_i), indicating a connection between nodes u and v, and there are at most one edge between any pair of nodes.
