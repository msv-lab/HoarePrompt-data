The function accepts no parameters and reads input from standard input (stdin). It returns a map object containing integers parsed from the input, which represents the edges of an undirected simple graph defined by pairs of vertices. The function does not handle any exceptions or errors related to input format, so if the input is not as expected (e.g., non-integer values), it may raise an error.
