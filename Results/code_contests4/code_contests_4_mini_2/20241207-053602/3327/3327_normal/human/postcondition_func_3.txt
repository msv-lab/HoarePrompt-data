The function accepts a list `arr` that contains graph specifications, specifically the first element being two integers `n` and `m` (which represent the number of nodes and edges in the graph), followed by `m` pairs of integers representing the edges of the graph. The function prints the contents of the list as a single space-separated string, but does not return any value or provide any information related to the graph itself.
