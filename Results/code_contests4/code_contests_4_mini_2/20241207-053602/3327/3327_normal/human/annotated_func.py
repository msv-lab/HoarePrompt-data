#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of nodes in the graph (3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), m is an integer representing the number of edges (1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000), and for each edge, u_i and v_i are integers representing the endpoints of the edges (1 ≤ u_i, v_i ≤ n, u_i ≠ v_i).
def func_1():
    return int(raw_input())
    #The program returns an integer inputted by the user through raw_input()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns an integer inputted by the user through raw_input(). It assumes that the input provided by the user is a valid integer, but does not handle cases where the input may be invalid (e.g., non-integer inputs), which could lead to a runtime error.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of nodes in the graph, where 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; m is an integer representing the number of edges in the graph, where 1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000; each edge is defined by two distinct integers u_i and v_i (1 ≤ u_i, v_i ≤ n, u_i ≠ v_i), indicating a connection between nodes u and v, and there are at most one edge between any pair of nodes.
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained from the input provided via raw_input, representing some data related to the graph's nodes or edges.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns a list of these integers. It does not accept any parameters, and the integers represent data related to the graph's nodes or edges.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of nodes in the graph (3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), and m is an integer representing the number of edges in the graph (1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000). Each edge connects two distinct nodes u_i and v_i (1 ≤ u_i, v_i ≤ n, u_i ≠ v_i), and there are m such pairs provided as input.
def func_3(n):
    stdout.write(str(n) + '\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer parameter `n`, which represents the number of nodes in a graph. It outputs the value of `n` to the standard output. The function does not handle any edges or additional parameters related to the graph structure despite the annotations suggesting it processes edges. There are no return values from the function.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list containing the first line with two integers n and m (3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000), followed by m lines where each line contains two integers u_i and v_i (1 ≤ u_i, v_i ≤ n, u_i ≠ v_i) representing the edges of the graph.
def func_4(arr):
    pr(' '.join(map(str, arr)) + '\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `arr` that contains graph specifications, specifically the first element being two integers `n` and `m` (which represent the number of nodes and edges in the graph), followed by `m` pairs of integers representing the edges of the graph. The function prints the contents of the list as a single space-separated string, but does not return any value or provide any information related to the graph itself.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000, and for each edge defined by u_i and v_i, 1 ≤ u_i, v_i ≤ n with u_i ≠ v_i, representing edges in an undirected simple graph.
def func_5():
    return map(int, stdin.read().split())
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained from reading the input, which consists of the edges defined by u_i and v_i in the undirected simple graph.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and reads input from standard input (stdin). It returns a map object containing integers parsed from the input, which represents the edges of an undirected simple graph defined by pairs of vertices. The function does not handle any exceptions or errors related to input format, so if the input is not as expected (e.g., non-integer values), it may raise an error.
