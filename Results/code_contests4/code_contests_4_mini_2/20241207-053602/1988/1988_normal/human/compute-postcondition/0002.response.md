According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. Additionally, before the loop starts, the variable `i` should be initialized to its starting value, which will be 0 for the first iteration. 

State: **`data` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
