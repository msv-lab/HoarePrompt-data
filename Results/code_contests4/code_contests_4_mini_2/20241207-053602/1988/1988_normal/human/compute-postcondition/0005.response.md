According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. 

After the current iteration, `i` will be 1. For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`data` is a list containing the `tmp` map object, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
