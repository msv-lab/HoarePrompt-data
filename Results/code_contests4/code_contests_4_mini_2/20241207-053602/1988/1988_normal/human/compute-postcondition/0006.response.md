The `tmp` variable is assigned the value of the map object created by applying the `int` function to each element of the list generated by `raw_input().split()`. The previous state of the other variables (`data`, `i`, and `n`) remains unchanged, as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects that `tmp` is now a map object containing integers based on the input received.

Output State: **`data` is a list containing the `tmp` map object, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1; `tmp` is a map object with integer values from input.**
