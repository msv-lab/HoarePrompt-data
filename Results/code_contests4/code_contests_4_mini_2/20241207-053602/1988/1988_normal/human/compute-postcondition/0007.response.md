The `append` method is called on the list `data`, which adds the `tmp` map object to it. The previous value of `data` is a list that already contains the `tmp` map object, and the variable `i` retains its value of 1. The variable `n` must be greater than 1, but its exact value is not specified, so it doesn't affect the output state directly. Since `data` is being modified by adding another element, the output state reflects this change.

Output State: **`data` is a list containing the original `tmp` map object plus an additional `tmp` map object; `i` is 1; `n` must be greater than 1.**
