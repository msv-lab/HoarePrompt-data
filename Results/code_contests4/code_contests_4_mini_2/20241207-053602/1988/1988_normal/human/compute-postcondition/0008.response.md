According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will increase by 1, making `i` equal to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`data` is a list containing the original `tmp` map object plus an additional `tmp` map object; `i` is 2; for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
