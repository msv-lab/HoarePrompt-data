Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. Here are the reasons why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` which is not defined in Python 3 (it should be `input()`). Additionally, the program does not handle the conversion of the input to an integer correctly because it attempts to append `map` objects directly to the `data` list. The `map` function returns an iterator in Python 3, which means the integers need to be converted into a list or another iterable type before being appended.

2. **Logic Implementation**: The problem description requires a logic to determine if it's possible to stack the balls in cylinders B and C such that larger balls can be placed on top of smaller ones. The provided code does not include any logic or algorithm to perform this check. It merely collects input data without processing it to produce the required "YES" or "NO" outputs.

3. **Output Generation**: The program lacks any implementation for outputting results based on the conditions specified in the problem description. There is no mechanism to analyze the arrangement of the balls and determine if they can be stacked as described.

In summary, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description because it fails to correctly process the input and lacks the necessary logic to determine if the stacking of balls is valid. Therefore, it cannot produce the expected output of "YES" or "NO" for each dataset.
