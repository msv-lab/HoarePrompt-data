You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: <image>


There is a container that is bifurcated as shown in the figure. Drop 10 balls numbered from 1 to 10 through the opening A of the container and place the balls in the left cylinder B or the right cylinder C. Since plate D can rotate left and right around the fulcrum E, you can move plate D to decide whether to put it in cylinder B or cylinder C.

Gives a sequence of balls to drop from opening A. Put them in cylinder B or cylinder C in order. At this time, create a program that outputs YES if both cylinder B and cylinder C can arrange large balls on the small numbered balls, and NO if they cannot be arranged. However, the order of the balls cannot be changed in the container. In addition, it is assumed that they can be put in the same cylinder in succession, and that there is enough room for all 10 balls in both cylinders B and C.



Input

Given multiple datasets. The number of datasets N is given in the first line. Then you are given a dataset of N rows. Each dataset is given 10 numbers, starting from the left, separated by blanks.

Output

Print YES or NO on one line for each dataset.

Example

Input

2
3 1 4 2 5 6 7 8 9 10
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1


Output

YES
NO
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple datasets, where the first line contains an integer N (1 <= N <= 100), followed by N lines each containing exactly 10 integers (1 <= integer <= 10).
def func():
    n = input()
    data = []
    for i in range(n):
        tmp = map(int, raw_input().split())
        
        data.append(tmp)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `data` is a list containing `n` map objects created from `raw_input().split()` and converted to integers, `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is equal to `n - 1` if `n` is greater than 0, otherwise `i` is -1 if `n` is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer N from input, which indicates the number of subsequent lines to read. It then reads N lines, each containing exactly 10 integers (ranging from 1 to 10), and stores them in a list called `data`. However, the function does not return any result or perform any analysis on the datasets; it simply collects the input data. Additionally, the function does not handle invalid input cases, such as if N is not within the specified bounds or if the lines do not contain exactly 10 integers.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
