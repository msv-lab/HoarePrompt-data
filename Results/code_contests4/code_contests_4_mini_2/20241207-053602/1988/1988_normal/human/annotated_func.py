#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple datasets, where the first line contains an integer N (1 <= N <= 100), followed by N lines each containing exactly 10 integers (1 <= integer <= 10).
def func():
    n = input()
    data = []
    for i in range(n):
        tmp = map(int, raw_input().split())
        
        data.append(tmp)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `data` is a list containing `n` map objects created from `raw_input().split()` and converted to integers, `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is equal to `n - 1` if `n` is greater than 0, otherwise `i` is -1 if `n` is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer N from input, which indicates the number of subsequent lines to read. It then reads N lines, each containing exactly 10 integers (ranging from 1 to 10), and stores them in a list called `data`. However, the function does not return any result or perform any analysis on the datasets; it simply collects the input data. Additionally, the function does not handle invalid input cases, such as if N is not within the specified bounds or if the lines do not contain exactly 10 integers.
