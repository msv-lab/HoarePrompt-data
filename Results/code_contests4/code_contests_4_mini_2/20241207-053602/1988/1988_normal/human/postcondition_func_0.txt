The function accepts an integer N from input, which indicates the number of subsequent lines to read. It then reads N lines, each containing exactly 10 integers (ranging from 1 to 10), and stores them in a list called `data`. However, the function does not return any result or perform any analysis on the datasets; it simply collects the input data. Additionally, the function does not handle invalid input cases, such as if N is not within the specified bounds or if the lines do not contain exactly 10 integers.
