Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. Specifically, the function `func()` is supposed to determine the subject of a document based on its content, which includes an identifier, a document name, and the text of the document. However, the current implementation of the function simply prints the integer '3' without analyzing the input in any way.

1. **No Input Handling**: The program does not read or process any input data, which is necessary to determine the document's subject.

2. **Hardcoded Output**: The program always outputs '3', which is incorrect. The subject should be determined based on the document's content, and the output could be 1, 2, or 3 depending on the document.

3. **Lack of Logic**: There is no logic implemented to assess or classify the document based on its content. The problem states that "it is guaranteed that the document corresponds to one of the three subjects," but the program does not utilize this guarantee effectively to sort or categorize the document.

In summary, the function does not comply with the requirement to determine and output the correct subject based on the document's content. Thus, it is incorrect.
