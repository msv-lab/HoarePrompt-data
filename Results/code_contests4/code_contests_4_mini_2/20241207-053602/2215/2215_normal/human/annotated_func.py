#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer id (0 ≤ id ≤ 106), a string representing the name of the document, followed by text lines that make up the document, and it is guaranteed that the document corresponds to one of the three subjects (1, 2, or 3).
def func():
    print('3')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and prints the number '3' to the console. It does not process any input data related to the `id`, `name`, or document content as described in the annotations. Therefore, it does not perform any operations based on the specified subjects or return any results based on document processing.
