The function `func` accepts three parameters: an integer `id`, a string `name`, and a collection of text lines that represent the content of a document. The integer `id` must be within the range of 0 to 106, and the `name` is a string representing the name of the document. The document content corresponds to one of the three subjects (1, 2, or 3). After executing the function, it processes the document based on the provided `id` and `name`, and returns a result that is determined by the subject of the document.
