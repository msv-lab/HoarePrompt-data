The function accepts input from the user, splits the input string into substrings, converts them to integers, and calculates a value `y` using the formula `(num[0] * num[2]) / 100 - num[1]`. It then prints the ceiling of `y` if `y` is not an integer, otherwise, it prints `y` as an integer. The function does not accept parameters directly nor does it return a value; it only outputs the result to the console. Additionally, there is a lack of input validation which may lead to errors if the input does not meet expectations.
