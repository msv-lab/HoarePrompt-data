You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Some country is populated by wizards. They want to organize a demonstration.

There are n people living in the city, x of them are the wizards who will surely go to the demonstration. Other city people (n - x people) do not support the wizards and aren't going to go to the demonstration. We know that the city administration will react only to the demonstration involving at least y percent of the city people. Having considered the matter, the wizards decided to create clone puppets which can substitute the city people on the demonstration. 

So all in all, the demonstration will involve only the wizards and their puppets. The city administration cannot tell the difference between a puppet and a person, so, as they calculate the percentage, the administration will consider the city to be consisting of only n people and not containing any clone puppets. 

Help the wizards and find the minimum number of clones to create to that the demonstration had no less than y percent of the city people.

Input

The first line contains three space-separated integers, n, x, y (1 ≤ n, x, y ≤ 104, x ≤ n) — the number of citizens in the city, the number of wizards and the percentage the administration needs, correspondingly.

Please note that y can exceed 100 percent, that is, the administration wants to see on a demonstration more people that actually live in the city ( > n).

Output

Print a single integer — the answer to the problem, the minimum number of clones to create, so that the demonstration involved no less than y percent of n (the real total city population). 

Examples

Input

10 1 14


Output

1


Input

Output

0


Input

1000 352 146


Output

1108

Note

In the first sample it is necessary that at least 14% of 10 people came to the demonstration. As the number of people should be integer, then at least two people should come. There is only one wizard living in the city and he is going to come. That isn't enough, so he needs to create one clone. 

In the second sample 10 people should come to the demonstration. The city has 10 wizards. They will all come to the demonstration, so nobody has to create any clones.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, x, and y are integers such that 1 ≤ n, x, y ≤ 10^4 and x ≤ n.
def func():
    c = raw_input()
    p = c.split()
    num = []
    for i in p:
        num.append(int(i))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4; `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `n`; `y` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `y` ≤ 10^4; `p` is a list of substrings; `num` is a list of integers which contains the integer conversion of each element in `p`.
    y = float(num[0] * num[2]) / float(100) - num[1]
    if (y % 1 == 0) :
        print(int(y))
    else :
        print(int(y) + 1)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4; `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `n`; `y` is calculated as (num[0] * num[2]) / 100 - num[1]; `p` is a list of substrings; `num` is a list of integers which contains the integer conversion of each element in `p`. If `y` is an integer (i.e., `y` is divisible by 1), the value of `y` is printed as an integer. Otherwise, `int(y) + 1` is printed as the output.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts input from the user, splits the input string into substrings, converts them to integers, and calculates a value `y` using the formula `(num[0] * num[2]) / 100 - num[1]`. It then prints the ceiling of `y` if `y` is not an integer, otherwise, it prints `y` as an integer. The function does not accept parameters directly nor does it return a value; it only outputs the result to the console. Additionally, there is a lack of input validation which may lead to errors if the input does not meet expectations.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
