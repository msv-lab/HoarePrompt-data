The code initializes an empty list `num`. The previous values of the variables `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged, and the list `p` is also unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `x`, `y` ≤ 10^4 and `x` ≤ `n`; `p` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the string `c`; `num` is an empty list.
