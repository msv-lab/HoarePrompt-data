The variable `y` is assigned the value calculated from the expression `float(num[0] * num[2]) / float(100) - num[1]`. 

To analyze the expression:
- `num[0]` is an integer from the list `num`.
- `num[2]` is another integer from the list `num`.
- The product of `num[0]` and `num[2]` is calculated, then converted to a float.
- This product is then divided by `100`, again converted to a float.
- Finally, `num[1]` (which is also an integer from `num`) is subtracted from the result.

Thus, the value of `y` will depend on the specific values of `num[0]`, `num[1]`, and `num[2]`. The other variables (`n`, `x`, `p`) are not affected by this expression.

Therefore, the Output State is: the value of `y` is calculated based on `num[0]`, `num[1]`, and `num[2]`, while `n`, `x`, and `p` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4; `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `n`; `y` is calculated as (num[0] * num[2]) / 100 - num[1]; `p` is a list of substrings; `num` is a list of integers which contains the integer conversion of each element in `p`.**
