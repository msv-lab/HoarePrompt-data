The code attempts to append the integer conversion of `i` to the list `num`. However, `num` is originally an integer and cannot have elements appended to it. Therefore, the output state reflects this error. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4; `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `n`; `y` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `y` ≤ 10^4; `p` is a list of substrings with at least 2 elements; `i` is the second element in the list `p`; `num` is an integer and cannot have elements appended to it.**
