The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `x`, and `y`. All three parameters are integers constrained such that \(1 \leq n, x, y \leq 10^4\) and \(x \leq n\). However, the output behavior is not explicitly specified in the provided information. Therefore, based on the constraints, we can outline the accepted parameters but cannot detail the return value.

Functionality: **The function accepts three integer parameters: `n`, `x`, and `y`, with constraints that 1 ≤ n, x, y ≤ 10^4 and x ≤ n. The return value is not specified.**
