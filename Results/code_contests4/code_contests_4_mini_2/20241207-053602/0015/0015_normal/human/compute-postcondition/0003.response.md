According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `p`. For the loop to execute, `p` must contain at least one substring. Since `p` is formed by splitting the string `c`, we need to ensure that `c` is non-empty to have at least one element in `p`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `num` remains an empty list. Thus, for the loop to be executed, `p` must have at least 1 element, and `i` will be assigned the first substring from `p`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `n`, `y` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `y` ≤ 10^4, for the loop to execute the first time `p` must be a list of substrings with at least 1 element, and `i` is the first element in `p`.**
