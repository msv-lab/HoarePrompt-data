The code `p = c.split()` takes the string `c` and splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace, assigning this list to the variable `p`. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged, and there are no operations affecting them. The output will reflect the new value of `p`, which is a list derived from the string input `c`.

Output State: **`n`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `x`, `y` ≤ 10^4 and `x` ≤ `n`; `p` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the string `c`**.
