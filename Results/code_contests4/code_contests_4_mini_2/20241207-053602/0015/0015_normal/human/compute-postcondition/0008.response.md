The code attempts to append the integer value of `i` (which is the third element in the list `p`) to `num`. However, `num` is defined as an integer and cannot have elements appended to it, leading to an error. Therefore, the state of the other variables remains unaffected. Thus, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4; `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `n`; `y` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `y` ≤ 10^4; `p` is a list of substrings with at least 3 elements; `i` is the third element in the list `p`; `num` is an integer and cannot have elements appended to it, resulting in an error during execution.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4; `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `n`; `y` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `y` ≤ 10^4; `p` is a list of substrings with at least 3 elements; `i` is the third element in the list `p`; `num` is an integer and cannot have elements appended to it, resulting in an error during execution.**
