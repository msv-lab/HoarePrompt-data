The value of `y` is calculated as (num[0] * num[2]) / 100 - num[1]. Since it is given that `y` is not an integer, `int(y)` will truncate `y` to its integer part. Therefore, the output after executing `print(int(y) + 1)` is `int(y) + 1`, which is one more than the integer part of `y`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4; `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `n`; `y` is calculated as (num[0] * num[2]) / 100 - num[1]; `p` is a list of substrings; `num` is a list of integers which contains the integer conversion of each element in `p`; `int(y) + 1` is the output of the print statement.**
