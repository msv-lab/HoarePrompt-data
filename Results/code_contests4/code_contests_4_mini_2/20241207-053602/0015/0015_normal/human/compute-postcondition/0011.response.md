Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4; `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `n`; `y` is calculated as (num[0] * num[2]) / 100 - num[1]; `p` is a list of substrings; `num` is a list of integers which contains the integer conversion of each element in `p`; `y` is an integer (i.e., `y` is divisible by 1).***
