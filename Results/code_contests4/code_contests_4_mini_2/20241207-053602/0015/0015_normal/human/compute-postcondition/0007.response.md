According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `p`. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again for the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `p` has at least 2 elements, and `i` is the second element in the list `p`. For the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 3 elements, and `i` will then take the value of the third element in the list `p`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4; `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `n`; `y` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `y` ≤ 10^4; `p` is a list of substrings with at least 3 elements; `i` is the third element in the list `p`; `num` is an integer and cannot have elements appended to it.**
