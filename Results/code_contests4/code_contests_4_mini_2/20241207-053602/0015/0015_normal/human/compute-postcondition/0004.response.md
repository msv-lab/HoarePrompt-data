Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4; `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `n`; `y` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `y` ≤ 10^4; `p` is a list of substrings with at least 1 element; `i` is the first element in `p`; `num` now contains an additional integer, which is the integer conversion of `i`.**
