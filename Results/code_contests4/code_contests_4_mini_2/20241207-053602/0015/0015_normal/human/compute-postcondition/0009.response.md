The loop iterates over each element in the list `p`, converting each substring into an integer and appending it to the list `num`. At the end of the loop, if `p` contains `k` elements, then `num` will contain `k` integers which are the integer conversions of each element in `p`. 

Thus, if `p` is a list with at least one element, `num` will be a list of integers of length equal to the length of `p`. If `p` is empty, the loop will not execute, and `num` will remain an empty list. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4; `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `n`; `y` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `y` ≤ 10^4; `p` is a list of substrings; `num` is a list of integers which contains the integer conversion of each element in `p`.**
