To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the logic and see if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown
1. We have `n` citizens in the city.
2. Of them, `x` are wizards willing to participate in a demonstration.
3. The city administration requires that at least `y` percent of `n` citizens must be represented in the demonstration.
4. The output should be the minimum number of clone puppets needed to meet the required percentage.

### Required Logic
- Calculate the minimum number of participants required: `required_participants = ceil((y / 100) * n)`.
- Then determine how many more participants are needed beyond the existing wizards: `needed_clones = required_participants - x`.
- If `needed_clones < 0`, output `0` (no clones needed). If `needed_clones >= 0`, output that value.

### Analyzing the Code
The provided code performs the following steps:
1. It reads input and splits it into three integers: `n`, `x`, and `y`.
2. It calculates the required number of participants as `y = float(num[0] * num[2]) / float(100) - num[1]`.
3. It checks if `y` is whole and prints either `int(y)` or `int(y) + 1`.

### Issues in the Code
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Required Participants**:
   The code calculates the number of clones needed as:
   ```python
   y = float(num[0] * num[2]) / float(100) - num[1]
   ```
   This is incorrect because it does not take into account the ceiling function required to ensure it rounds up to the nearest whole number of participants. 

2. **Handling of Negative Clones**:
   The code does not handle the case where the number of needed clones is negative correctly. The logic should return `0` in such cases instead of returning a negative number.

### Example of Failure
Consider the input:
```
10 1 10
```
- Expected output: `1` (because 10% of 10 is 1, and with only 1 wizard, 1 clone is needed).
- The code calculates: 
  ```
  y = (10 * 10) / 100 - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0
  ```
  Hence, it would output `0` instead of `1`, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion
The program does not handle the requirements of the problem correctly, particularly in the calculation and rounding of required clones. 

Correctness: **False**
