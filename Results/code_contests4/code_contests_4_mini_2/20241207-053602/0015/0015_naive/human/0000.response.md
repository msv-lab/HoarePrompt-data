To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step and consider possible edge cases.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to calculate the minimum number of clones needed for a demonstration, given:
  - n: total number of citizens
  - x: number of wizards
  - y: required percentage of citizens that need to be present for the demonstration to be acknowledged.
- The demonstration will consist of all wizards and their clones.
- We should ensure that at least `ceil((y/100) * n)` people are present for the demonstration.

### Analyzing the Program:
1. The input is read and split into a list of integers.
2. The required number of participants is calculated as:
   - `required_people = ceil((y/100) * n)`
   - In the code, this is computed with `y = float(num[0] * num[2]) / float(100)`.
3. The program then calculates how many more people are needed beyond the wizards:
   - It subtracts the number of wizards (`num[1]`) from the required number of participants.
4. If the result is exactly an integer (`y % 1 == 0`), it prints that integer. Otherwise, it prints the integer part plus one.

### Problem in the Code:
- The calculation of the `required_people` does not use `ceil`, which is necessary to ensure that any fractional number of required people is rounded up.
- For example, if `n = 10`, `x = 1`, and `y = 14`, then we require at least `ceil(14% of 10) = ceil(1.4) = 2` people. The program incorrectly computes `1` because it does not handle rounding up correctly.

### Edge Case:
1. Consider the input `n = 10, x = 1, y = 14`.
   - The expected output should be `1` (since `1 wizard + 1 clone = 2`).
   - However, the program incorrectly calculates that `1` more is needed, as it does not round up the required number of people.

Based on this analysis, the program fails to produce the correct result for certain inputs.

Correctness: **False**.
