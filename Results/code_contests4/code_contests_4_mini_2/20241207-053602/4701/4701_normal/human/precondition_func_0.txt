H and W are positive integers such that 1 <= H, W <= 1000; C_h, C_w, D_h, and D_w are positive integers such that 1 <= C_h, D_h <= H and 1 <= C_w, D_w <= W; S is a 2D list of characters where each character is either '#' or '.', and S[C_h-1][C_w-1] and S[D_h-1][D_w-1] are '.'; (C_h, C_w) is not equal to (D_h, D_w).
