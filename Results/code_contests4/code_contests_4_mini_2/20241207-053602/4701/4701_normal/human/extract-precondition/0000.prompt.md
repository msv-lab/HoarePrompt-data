You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: A maze is composed of a grid of H \times W squares - H vertical, W horizontal.

The square at the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left - (i,j) - is a wall if S_{ij} is `#` and a road if S_{ij} is `.`.

There is a magician in (C_h,C_w). He can do the following two kinds of moves:

* Move A: Walk to a road square that is vertically or horizontally adjacent to the square he is currently in.
* Move B: Use magic to warp himself to a road square in the 5\times 5 area centered at the square he is currently in.



In either case, he cannot go out of the maze.

At least how many times does he need to use the magic to reach (D_h, D_w)?

Constraints

* 1 \leq H,W \leq 10^3
* 1 \leq C_h,D_h \leq H
* 1 \leq C_w,D_w \leq W
* S_{ij} is `#` or `.`.
* S_{C_h C_w} and S_{D_h D_w} are `.`.
* (C_h,C_w) \neq (D_h,D_w)

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


H W
C_h C_w
D_h D_w
S_{11}\ldots S_{1W}
\vdots
S_{H1}\ldots S_{HW}


Output

Print the minimum number of times the magician needs to use the magic. If he cannot reach (D_h,D_w), print `-1` instead.
