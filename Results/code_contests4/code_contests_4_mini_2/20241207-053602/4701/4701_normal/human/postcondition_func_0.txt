The function accepts two positive integers representing the height (H) and width (W) of a grid, along with starting (C_h, C_w) and destination (D_h, D_w) coordinates. It processes a 2D grid of characters where each cell is either passable ('.') or blocked ('#'). The function calculates the minimum number of steps required to reach the destination from the starting point using valid moves, considering both single-step and double-step movements. If the destination is unreachable, it returns -1. If reachable, it returns the minimum number of steps.
