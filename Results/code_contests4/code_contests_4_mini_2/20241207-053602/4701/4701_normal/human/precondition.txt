H and W are integers representing the height and width of the maze respectively, with 1 <= H, W <= 1000. C_h and C_w are integers representing the starting position of the magician in the maze, with 1 <= C_h <= H and 1 <= C_w <= W. D_h and D_w are integers representing the destination position in the maze, with 1 <= D_h <= H and 1 <= D_w <= W. S is a list of strings each of length W, representing the maze layout where each character is either '#' (a wall) or '.' (a road), and S[C_h-1][C_w-1] and S[D_h-1][D_w-1] are guaranteed to be '.' (indicating both start and destination are on roads). (C_h, C_w) is not equal to (D_h, D_w).
