The value of `ch` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `ch` is an integer from the input, so after execution, `ch` will be one less than its original value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is an input integer, `w` is an input integer, `ch` is the input integer decremented by 1, `cw` is an input integer, `dh` is an input integer, `dw` is an input integer.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer, `w` is an input integer, `ch` is the input integer decremented by 1, `cw` is an input integer, `dh` is an input integer, `dw` is an input integer.**
