The variable `q` is assigned a list containing a tuple `(0, start)`. The initial state indicates that `goal` is equal to `dh * w + dw`, `seen` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, and `seen[start]` is set to 0. The previous values of `seen` do not affect the assignment of `q`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `goal` is equal to `dh * w + dw`, `seen` is a list of `None` values of length `n` with `seen[start]` set to 0, and `q` is assigned the value `[(0, start)]`.
Output State: **`goal` is equal to `dh * w + dw`, `seen` is a list of `None` values of length `n` with `seen[start]` set to 0, and `q` is assigned the value `[(0, start)]**
