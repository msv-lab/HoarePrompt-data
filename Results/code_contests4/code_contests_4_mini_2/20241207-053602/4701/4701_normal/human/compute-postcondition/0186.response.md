The values of `pu` and `w` are used in the `divmod` function, which calculates both the quotient and the remainder. The quotient is assigned to `ux`, and the remainder is assigned to `uy`. Other variables remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `seen` contains the minimum number of steps to reach each valid position; `q` is not empty; `pnum` is now assigned a new value returned by `hpp(q)`; `pu` is now assigned another new value returned by `hpp(q)`; `ux` is the quotient of the new `pu` divided by `w`; `uy` is the remainder of the new `pu` divided by `w`; `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` are non-empty lists; `xx`, `yy`, and `vv` remain the last elements of `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` processed in the loop; `x` is now the last calculated value of `ux + xx`; `y` is now the last calculated value of `uy + yy`; `u` is now the last calculated value of `x * w + y`; and `num` is now the last calculated value of `pnum + vv`.
