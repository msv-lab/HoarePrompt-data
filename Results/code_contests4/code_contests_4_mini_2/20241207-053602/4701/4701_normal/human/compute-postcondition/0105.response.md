The variable `dx` is a list that initially contains the value of `i` repeated twelve times. The code `dx.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the end of the list `dx`. Since the previous state of `dx` includes the value of `i` repeated twelve times, after the execution, `dx` will contain thirteen elements, with the last element being the current value of `i`.

The previous values of the affected variables are:
- `dx` contains the value of `i` repeated twelve times.
- `i` is not equal to `j` and is not equal to 0.

Therefore, the Output State is: `goal` is equal to `dh * w + dw`, `seen` is a list of None values of length `n` with `seen[start]` set to 0, `q` holds the value [(0, start)], `dx` now has `i` repeated twelve times followed by an additional `i`, `dy` is now [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 0, -2, -1], `j` is 0, and `i` is not equal to `j` and is not equal to 0.

Output State: **`goal` is equal to `dh * w + dw`, `seen` is a list of None values of length `n` with `seen[start]` set to 0, `q` holds the value [(0, start)], `dx` now has `i` repeated thirteen times, `dy` is now [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 0, -2, -1], `j` is 0, and `i` is not equal to `j` and is not equal to 0.**
