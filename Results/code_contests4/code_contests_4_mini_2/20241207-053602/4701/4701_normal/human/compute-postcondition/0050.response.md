Postcondition: ***`goal` is equal to `dh * w + dw`, `seen` is a list of None values of length `n` with `seen[start]` set to 0, `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)], `dx` now contains `i` and the new value of `dx` after appending is [... , i], `dy` is now `[-2, -1]`, `j` is -1, `i` is not equal to `j` and is not equal to 0. If the absolute values of `i` and `j` sum to more than 1, then `vvs` has `1` appended to it. Otherwise, `vvs` contains an additional element 0.***
