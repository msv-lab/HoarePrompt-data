Postcondition: ***`goal` is equal to `dh * w + dw`, `seen` is a list of None values of length `n` with `seen[start]` set to 0, `q` holds the value [(0, start)], `dx` contains the value of `i` repeated twelve times, `dy` is now [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 0, -2, -1], `j` is -1, and `i` is not equal to `j` and is not equal to 0. If the absolute values of `i` and `j` sum to more than 1, the value 1 is appended to the list `vvs`; otherwise, 0 is appended to `vvs`.***
