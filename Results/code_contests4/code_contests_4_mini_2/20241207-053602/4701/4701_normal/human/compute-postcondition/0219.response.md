Output State: **`seen` contains the minimum number of steps to reach each valid position represented by `u`, where `u` is calculated as `x * w + y` for all valid `x` and `y` derived from the offsets in `dx` and `dy`; `q` is empty; if `pu` equals `goal`, the loop has exited successfully; if there are any unreachable positions, `seen` reflects that with `None` values; if all positions are reachable, `seen` is updated accordingly.**
