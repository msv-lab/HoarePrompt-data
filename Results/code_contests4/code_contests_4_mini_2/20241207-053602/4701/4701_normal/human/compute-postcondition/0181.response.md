In this case, the function `hp` is called with the arguments `(num, u)`. The values of `num` and `u` have been previously calculated as `num` (the sum of `pnum` and `vv`) and `u` (calculated as `x * w + y`). However, since the actual values of these variables are not provided, we can only describe the impact of the function call on the program without changing any variable states.

Therefore, the Output State is: `u` is calculated as `x * w + y`; `num` is the sum of `pnum` and `vv`; the function `hp` is called with `num` and `u` as arguments.
Output State: **`u` is calculated as `x * w + y`; `num` is the sum of `pnum` and `vv`; the function `hp` is called with `num` and `u` as arguments.**
