The values of `x` and `y` are updated based on the new calculations. `x` is assigned the value `ux + xx`, and `y` is assigned the value `uy + yy`. The previous values of `ux`, `xx`, `uy`, and `yy` will affect the new values of `x` and `y`, but are not specified. Therefore, `x` and `y` are now dependent on these calculations.

Output State: **`x` is `ux + xx`, `y` is `uy + yy`**
