The variable `u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y`. The values of `x` and `y` are given as `ux + xx` and `uy + yy`, respectively. However, the value of `w` is unknown. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignments and the unknown variable `w`. 

Output State: **`x` is `ux + xx`, `y` is `uy + yy`, `u` is `x * w + y`**
