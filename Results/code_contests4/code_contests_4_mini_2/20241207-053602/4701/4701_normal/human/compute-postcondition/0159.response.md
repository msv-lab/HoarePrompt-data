Output State: **`seen` contains the minimum number of steps to reach each valid position; `q` is not empty; `pnum` is assigned a value returned by `hpp(q)`; `pu` is assigned another value returned by `hpp(q)`; `ux` is the quotient of `pu` divided by `w`; `uy` is the remainder of `pu` divided by `w`; `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` are non-empty lists; `xx` is the first element of `dx`; `yy` is the first element of `dy`; `vv` is the first element of `vvs`; `x` is `ux + xx`; `y` is `uy + yy`; `u` is calculated as `x * w + y`; `num` is `pnum + vv`; `x` is less than 0 or `y` is less than 0 or `x` is greater than or equal to `h` or `y` is greater than or equal to `w` or `ss[x][y]` is equal to '#'; the process continues to the next iteration without affecting any variables.**
