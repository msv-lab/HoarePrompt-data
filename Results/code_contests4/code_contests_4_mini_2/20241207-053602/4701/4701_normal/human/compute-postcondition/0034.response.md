According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from -2 to 2, which includes the values -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2. The loop will execute five times, starting with `i` at -2 and ending with `i` at 2. 

The states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are primarily around the variable `i`, which will take on each of these values during the loop's execution. The other states such as `goal`, `seen`, `q`, `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` do not directly impact whether the loop will execute, as they are not evaluated within the loop construct itself.

Thus, for the loop to execute the first time:
- `i` should be initialized to -2.

State: **`goal` is equal to `dh * w + dw`, `seen` is a list of None values of length n with seen[start] set to 0, `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)], `dx` is an empty list, `dy` is an empty list, `vvs` is an empty list, `i` is -2**
