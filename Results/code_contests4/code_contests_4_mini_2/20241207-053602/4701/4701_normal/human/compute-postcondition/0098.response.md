The code `dx.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the end of the list `dx`. The initial state indicates that `dx` contains the value of `i` repeated ten times followed by `i`, which means `dx` currently has eleven occurrences of `i`. After executing the code, `dx` will have one more occurrence of `i`, making a total of twelve occurrences of `i`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`goal` is equal to `dh * w + dw`, `seen` is a list of None values of length `n` with `seen[start]` set to 0, `q` holds the value [(0, start)], `dx` contains the value of `i` repeated twelve times, `dy` is now [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 0, -2], `j` is -1, and `i` is not equal to `j` and is not equal to 0.**
