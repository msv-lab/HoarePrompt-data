Output State: **`u` is calculated as `x * w + y`, where `x` is derived from `ux - 2` and `y` from `uy - 2`; `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`; `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` must contain at least one more element; `xx` is the next element in `dx`, `yy` is the next element in `dy`, `vv` is the next element in `vvs`; `x` and `y` are updated to `ux + xx` and `uy + yy`, respectively.**
