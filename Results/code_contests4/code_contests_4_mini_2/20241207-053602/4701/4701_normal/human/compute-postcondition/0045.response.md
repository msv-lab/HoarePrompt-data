According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from -2 to 2 (inclusive), which means it will execute for the values of `j` being -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is -2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented to -1 for the next iteration.

State: **`goal` is equal to `dh * w + dw`, `seen` is a list of None values of length `n` with `seen[start]` set to 0, `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)], `dx` now contains `i`, `dy` now contains [-2], `j` is -1, and `i` is not equal to `j` and is not equal to 0. If the sum of the absolute values of `i` and `j` is greater than 1, `vvs` is now [1]. Otherwise, if the sum of the absolute values of `i` and `j` is 1 or less, `vvs` contains [0].**
