The value of `i` is appended to the list `dx`. The previous value of `dx` is the value of `i` repeated five times. Therefore, after execution, `dx` will contain the original five values of `i` followed by an additional value of `i`. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`goal` is equal to `dh * w + dw`, `seen` is a list of None values of length `n` with `seen[start]` set to 0, `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)], `dx` contains the value of `i` repeated six times, `dy` contains [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2], `j` is equal to 1, and it is true that `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is not equal to 0.**
