Postcondition: ***`u` is calculated as `x * w + y`, where `x` is calculated as `ux - 2` and `y` is calculated as `uy - 2`; `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`. The variable `x` is less than 0 or `y` is less than 0 or `x` is greater than or equal to `h` or `y` is greater than or equal to `w` or the value at `ss[x][y]` is '#'.***
