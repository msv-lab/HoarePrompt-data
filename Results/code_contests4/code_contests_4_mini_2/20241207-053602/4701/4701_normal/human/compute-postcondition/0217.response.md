Postcondition: ***`x` is `ux + xx`, `y` is `uy + yy`, `u` is `x * w + y`, `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`. If `seen[u]` is None or greater than `num`, then `seen[u]` is assigned the value of `num` and `hp` is called with (num, u). If `seen[u]` is not None and not greater than `num`, no changes are made.***
