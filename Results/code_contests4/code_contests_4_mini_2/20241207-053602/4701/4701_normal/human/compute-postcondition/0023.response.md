The value of `ss[i]` is assigned the value of `s`. Since `i` is 2, `ss[2]` will now hold the value of `s`. The previous values of `ss[0]` and `ss[1]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `ss[2]` is now equal to `s`.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer greater than 0, `w` is an input integer, `rows` is equal to `h`, `cols` is equal to `w`, `OK` is '.', `NG` is '#', `ns` is a defaultdict of sets, `ss[0]` is equal to `s`, `ss[1]` is equal to `s`, `ss[2]` is equal to `s`, `i` is 2, and `s` is an input string.**
