According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop will iterate through the range from -2 to 2 (inclusive), which means it will execute for the values -2, -1, 0, 1, 2. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is currently -2, which is the first value in the range. After the first iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

At the start of the next iteration, `j` will be -1. Since the range is -2 to 2, and `j` has not yet reached 2, the loop can execute again.

State: **`goal` is equal to `dh * w + dw`, `seen` is a list of None values of length `n` with `seen[start]` set to 0, `q` holds the value [(0, start)], `dx` contains the value of `i` repeated ten times followed by `i`, `dy` is now [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 0, -2], `j` is -1, and `i` is not equal to `j` and is not equal to 0. For the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be -1.**
