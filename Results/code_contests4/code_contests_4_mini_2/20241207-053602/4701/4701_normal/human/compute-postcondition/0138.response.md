Postcondition: ***`u` is calculated as `(ux + xx) * w + (uy + yy)`, and `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv` based on the specified conditions. If `seen[u]` is None or `seen[u]` is greater than `num`, then `seen[u]` is updated to `num`, and the function `hp` is called with arguments `q` and `(num, u)`. If neither condition for `seen[u]` is met, no changes are made to `seen[u]` or the state of `u` and `num`.***
