The variable `u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y`. The value of `x` is `ux + xx`, and `y` is `uy + yy`. However, the value of `w` is not provided, so `u` cannot be fully determined without it. The other variables (`x` and `y`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is `ux + xx`, `y` is `uy + yy`, and `u` is `x * w + y`, where `w` is an unknown value.

Output State: **`x` is `ux + xx`, `y` is `uy + yy`, `u` is `x * w + y`, where `w` is an unknown value**
