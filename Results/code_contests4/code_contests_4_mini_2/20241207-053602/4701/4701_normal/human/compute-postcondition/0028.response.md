The variable `seen` is assigned a list of `None` values of length `n`. The values of `goal`, `dh`, and `dw` are not affected by this operation, and the specific value of `n` is not provided, so we cannot know the exact length of the list. Therefore, the output state is: `goal` is equal to `dh * w + dw`, and `seen` is a list of `None` values of length `n`.

Output State: **`goal` is equal to `dh * w + dw`, and `seen` is a list of `None` values of length `n`.**
