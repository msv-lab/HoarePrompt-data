Postcondition: ***`goal` is equal to `dh * w + dw`, `seen` is a list of None values of length `n` with `seen[start]` set to 0, `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)], `dx` contains the value of `i` repeated six times, `dy` is now `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1]`, `j` is equal to 1, and it is true that `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is not equal to 0, and the absolute value of `i` plus the absolute value of `j` is less than or equal to 1***
