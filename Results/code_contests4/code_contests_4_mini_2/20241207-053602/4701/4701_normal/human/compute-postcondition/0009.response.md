The value of `dw` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `dw` is an input integer, so after execution, `dw` will be one less than its original value. The other variables (`h`, `w`, `ch`, `cw`, `dh`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is an input integer, `w` is an input integer, `ch` is the input integer decremented by 1, `cw` is the input integer decremented by 1, `dh` is the input integer decremented by 1, `dw` is an input integer decremented by 1.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer, `w` is an input integer, `ch` is the input integer decremented by 1, `cw` is the input integer decremented by 1, `dh` is the input integer decremented by 1, `dw` is an input integer decremented by 1**
