The value of `dy` is modified by appending the value of `j` to it. The initial state of `dy` is `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 0, -2]`, and since `j` is -1, the new state of `dy` after appending will be `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 0, -2, -1]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `goal` is equal to `dh * w + dw`, `seen` is a list of None values of length `n` with `seen[start]` set to 0, `q` holds the value [(0, start)], `dx` contains the value of `i` repeated twelve times, `dy` is now [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 0, -2, -1], `j` is -1, and `i` is not equal to `j` and is not equal to 0.

Output State: **`goal` is equal to `dh * w + dw`, `seen` is a list of None values of length `n` with `seen[start]` set to 0, `q` holds the value [(0, start)], `dx` contains the value of `i` repeated twelve times, `dy` is now [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 0, -2, -1], `j` is -1, and `i` is not equal to `j` and is not equal to 0.**
