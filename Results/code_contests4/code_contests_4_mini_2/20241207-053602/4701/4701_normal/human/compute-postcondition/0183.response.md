Output State: **`seen` contains the minimum number of steps to reach each valid position; `q` is not empty; `pnum` is assigned a value returned by `hpp(q)`; `pu` is assigned another value returned by `hpp(q)`; `ux` is the quotient of `pu` divided by `w`; `uy` is the remainder of `pu` divided by `w`; `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` are non-empty lists; `xx`, `yy`, and `vv` are the last elements of `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` processed in the loop; `x` is the last calculated value of `ux + xx`; `y` is the last calculated value of `uy + yy`; `u` is the last calculated value of `x * w + y`; and `num` is the last calculated value of `pnum + vv`. The `seen` array is updated such that for each valid position, it contains the minimum steps to reach that position. If `seen[u]` was updated at least once, it reflects the minimum number of steps for the valid positions processed during all iterations.**
