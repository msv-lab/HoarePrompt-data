The value of `n` is assigned the result of the multiplication of `rows` and `cols`. The previous values are `rows` equal to `h` (an input integer greater than 0) and `cols` equal to `w` (another input integer). Therefore, `n` will be the product of `h` and `w`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`h` is an input integer greater than 0, `w` is an input integer, `rows` is equal to `h`, `cols` is equal to `w`, `n` is equal to `h * w`, `OK` is '.', `NG` is '#', `ns` is a defaultdict of sets, `ss` is a list of length `h` where each `ss[i]` is equal to the corresponding input string for all `i` from 0 to `h-1`.**
