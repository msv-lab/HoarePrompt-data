According to the code, the loop will execute for each value of `j` in the range from -2 to 2, inclusive. The loop will execute five times in total (for j = -2, -1, 0, 1, 2). At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to 1. To execute the loop for one more time, `j` will be incremented to 2. 

Since the loop's range is from -2 to 2, after the last iteration with `j` as 1, the next value for `j` will be 2. After this, there are no more values left in the range to execute the loop again. 

Thus, to execute the loop a second time, `j` will have to be 2. 

State: **`goal` is equal to `dh * w + dw`, `seen` is a list of None values of length `n` with `seen[start]` set to 0, `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)], `dx` contains the value of `i` repeated six times, `dy` is now `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1]`, `j` is 2, and the loop will execute a final time.**
