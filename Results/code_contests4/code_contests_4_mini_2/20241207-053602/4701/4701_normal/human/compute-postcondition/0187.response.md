The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `seen` contains the minimum number of steps to reach each valid position; `q` is not empty; `pnum` is assigned a new value returned by `hpp(q)`; `pu` is assigned another new value returned by `hpp(q)`; `ux` is the quotient of the new `pu` divided by `w`; `uy` is the remainder of the new `pu` divided by `w`; `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` are non-empty lists; `xx`, `yy`, and `vv` remain the last elements of `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` processed in the loop; `x` is the last calculated value of `ux + xx`; `y` is the last calculated value of `uy + yy`; `u` is the last calculated value of `x * w + y`; and `num` is the last calculated value of `pnum + vv` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
