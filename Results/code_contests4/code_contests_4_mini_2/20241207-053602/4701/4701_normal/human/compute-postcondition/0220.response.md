The variable `val` is assigned the value of `seen[goal]`. The value of `seen` contains the minimum number of steps to reach each valid position, including the position represented by `goal`. The state of `seen` would determine if `val` is a valid number of steps or `None`. Therefore, the Output State is: `seen` contains the minimum number of steps to reach each valid position; `val` is the value of `seen[goal]`, which could be a valid number of steps or `None`.

Output State: **`seen` contains the minimum number of steps to reach each valid position; `val` is the value of `seen[goal]`, which could be a valid number of steps or `None`.**
