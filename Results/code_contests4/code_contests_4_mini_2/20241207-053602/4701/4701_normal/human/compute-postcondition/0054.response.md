The value of `dy` is modified by appending `j` to it. The previous value of `dy` is `[-2, -1]`, and `j` is equal to 0. Therefore, after executing the code, `dy` will now be `[-2, -1, 0]`. Other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`goal` is equal to `dh * w + dw`, `seen` is a list of None values of length `n` with `seen[start]` set to 0, `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)], `dx` now contains [..., i], `dy` is now [-2, -1, 0], `j` is 0, `i` is not equal to `j` and is not equal to 0.**
