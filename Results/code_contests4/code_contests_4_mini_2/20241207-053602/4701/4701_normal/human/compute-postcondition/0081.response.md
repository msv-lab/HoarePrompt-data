The line `vvs.append(1)` adds the value `1` to the list `vvs`. This operation affects the `vvs` variable, but it does not change the values of any other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Since `vvs` is being modified by appending an element, we can conclude that `vvs` now contains one additional element, which is `1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`goal` is equal to `dh * w + dw`; `seen` is a list of None values of length `n` with `seen[start]` set to 0; `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)]; `dx` contains the value of `i` repeated eight times; `dy` is now `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`; `j` is 3; `vvs` now contains the value 1 appended to it.**
