The value of `j` is appended to the list `dy`. Since `j` is -1, the new value of `dy` becomes `[-2, -1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `goal` is equal to `dh * w + dw`, `seen` is a list of None values of length `n` with `seen[start]` set to 0, `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)], `dx` now contains `i` and the new value of `dx` after appending is `[... , i]`, `dy` is now `[-2, -1]`, `j` is -1, `i` is not equal to `j` and is not equal to 0, and `vvs` is determined by the conditions mentioned.
