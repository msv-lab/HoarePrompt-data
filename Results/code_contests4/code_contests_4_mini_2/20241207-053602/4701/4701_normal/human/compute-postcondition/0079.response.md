The `dx` list is modified by appending the value of `i` to it. Since `dx` previously contained the value of `i` repeated seven times, after executing `dx.append(i)`, the length of `dx` will increase by one, and the last element will be the value of `i`. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`goal` is equal to `dh * w + dw`; `seen` is a list of None values of length `n` with `seen[start]` set to 0; `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)]; `dx` contains the value of `i` repeated eight times; `dy` is now `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2]`; `j` is 3; for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than 3.**
