The variable `ss` is assigned a list of `None` values with a length equal to `rows`, which is equal to `h` (an input integer). The states of the other variables (`h`, `w`, `rows`, `cols`, `OK`, `NG`, `ns`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is an input integer, `w` is an input integer, `rows` is equal to `h`, `cols` is equal to `w`, `OK` is '.', `NG` is '#', `ns` is a defaultdict of sets, and `ss` is a list of length `h` filled with `None`.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer, `w` is an input integer, `rows` is equal to `h`, `cols` is equal to `w`, `OK` is '.', `NG` is '#', `ns` is a defaultdict of sets, `ss` is a list of length `h` filled with `None`**.
