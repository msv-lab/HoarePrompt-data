The variables `x` and `y` are assigned the values `ux + xx` and `uy + yy`, respectively. Since `xx` and `yy` are the second elements in their respective lists, we can calculate the values of `x` and `y`. However, the exact values of `ux`, `uy`, `xx`, and `yy` are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact numerical results.

The output state reflects that `x` is calculated as `ux + xx` and `y` is calculated as `uy + yy`, but we do not have specific values for these variables.

Output State: **`x` is `ux + xx`, `y` is `uy + yy`**
