Postcondition: ***`u` is calculated as `x * w + y`, where `x` is derived from `ux - 2` and `y` from `uy - 2`. `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`. If `seen[u]` is None or greater than `num`, then `seen[u]` is assigned the value of `num` and the function `hp` is called with arguments `(num, u)`. If the conditions involving `x`, `y`, and `ss[x][y]` are met, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop without affecting `seen[u]`.***
