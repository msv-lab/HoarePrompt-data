Output State: **`u` is calculated as `x * w + y`, where `x` is derived from `ux - 2` and `y` from `uy - 2`; `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`; `x` is less than 0, `y` is less than 0, `x` is greater than or equal to `h`, `y` is greater than or equal to `w`, or the value at `ss[x][y]` is '#'; `seen[u]` is assigned the value of `num`; the function `hp` is called with arguments `(num, u)`.**
