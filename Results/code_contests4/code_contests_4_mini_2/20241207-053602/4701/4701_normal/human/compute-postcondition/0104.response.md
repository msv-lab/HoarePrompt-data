According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop is set to iterate over the range from -2 to 2 (inclusive), which means it will execute for values of `j` equal to -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is -1. The next value for `j` in the loop will be 0. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` must be 0, and it will iterate again until it reaches 2. 

In this case, since `j` will be updated to 0, and the loop has not yet executed for `j` equal to 0, the conditions for the loop are still valid. 

State: **`goal` is equal to `dh * w + dw`, `seen` is a list of None values of length `n` with `seen[start]` set to 0, `q` holds the value [(0, start)], `dx` contains the value of `i` repeated twelve times, `dy` is now [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 0, -2, -1], `j` is 0, and `i` is not equal to `j` and is not equal to 0. If the absolute values of `i` and `j` sum to more than 1, the value 1 is appended to the list `vvs`; otherwise, 0 is appended to `vvs`. If `i` is equal to `j` and both are 0, this block does not execute.**
