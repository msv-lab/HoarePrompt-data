The value of `dy` is impacted by the code `dy.append(j)`, which adds the current value of `j` to the end of the list `dy`. The previous value of `dy` is `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 0, -2, -1]`, and since `j` is 0, the new value of `dy` becomes `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 0, -2, -1, 0]`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `goal` is equal to `dh * w + dw`, `seen` is a list of None values of length `n` with `seen[start]` set to 0, `q` holds the value [(0, start)], `dx` now has `i` repeated thirteen times, `dy` is now [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 0, -2, -1, 0], `j` is 0, and `i` is not equal to `j` and is not equal to 0.

Output State: **`goal` is equal to `dh * w + dw`, `seen` is a list of None values of length `n` with `seen[start]` set to 0, `q` holds the value [(0, start)], `dx` now has `i` repeated thirteen times, `dy` is now [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 0, -2, -1, 0], `j` is 0, and `i` is not equal to `j` and is not equal to 0.**
