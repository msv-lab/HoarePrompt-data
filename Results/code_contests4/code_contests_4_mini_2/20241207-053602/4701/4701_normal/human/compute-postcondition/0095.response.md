Postcondition: ***`goal` is equal to `dh * w + dw`, `seen` is a list of None values of length `n` with `seen[start]` set to 0, `q` holds the value [(0, start)], `dx` contains the value of `i` repeated ten times followed by `i`, `dy` is now [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 0, -2], `j` is -2, `i` is not equal to `j` and is not equal to 0, the loop has executed the first time with `i` less than 3; if the absolute sum of `i` and `j` is greater than 1, `vvs` has 1 appended to it. Otherwise, if the absolute sum of `i` and `j` is less than or equal to 1, `vvs` has a new value of [0].***
