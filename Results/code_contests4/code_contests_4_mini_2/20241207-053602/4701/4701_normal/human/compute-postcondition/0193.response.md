Postcondition: ***`ux` is the quotient of `pu` divided by `w`, `xx` is the first element of `dx`, `uy` is the remainder of `pu` divided by `w`, `yy` is the first element of `dy`; `x` is now `ux + xx`, `y` is now `uy + yy`; `u` is assigned the value `x * w + y`; `num` is assigned the value `pnum + vv`. Either `x` is less than 0, or `y` is less than 0, or `x` is greater than or equal to `h`, or `y` is greater than or equal to `w`, or the value of `ss[x][y]` is equal to '#'.***
