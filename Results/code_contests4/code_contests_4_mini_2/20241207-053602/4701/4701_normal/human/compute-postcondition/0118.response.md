Postcondition: ***`goal` is equal to `dh * w + dw`, `seen` is a list of None values of length `n` with `seen[start]` set to 0, `q` is assigned the value `[(0, start)]`, `dx` contains `[-2, -2, -2, -2, -1, -1, -1, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2]`, `dy` contains `[-2, -1, -2, -1, -2, -1, 1, 2, -2, -1, 1, 2, -2, -1, 1, 2]`, `vvs` contains values based on the evaluations of `abs(i) + abs(j)` for each combination; if `pu` is equal to `goal`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
