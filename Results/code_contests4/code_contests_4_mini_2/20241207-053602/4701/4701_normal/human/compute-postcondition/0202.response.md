The variable `u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y`. The previous values of the affected variables are `x` as `ux + xx` and `y` as `uy + yy`. Since `w` is not defined in the initial state, it remains unknown. Thus, the value of `u` will depend on the value of `w`. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is `ux + xx`, `y` is `uy + yy`, and `u` is calculated as `x * w + y`, where `w` is unknown.

Output State: **`x` is `ux + xx`, `y` is `uy + yy`, and `u` is calculated as `x * w + y`, where `w` is unknown.**
