Postcondition: ***`goal` is equal to `dh * w + dw`, `seen` is a list of None values of length `n` with `seen[start]` set to 0, `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)], `dx` contains the value of `i` repeated six times, `dy` is now `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1]`, `j` is equal to 1, and if the sum of the absolute values of `i` and `j` is greater than 1, `vvs` is updated to include 1; otherwise, `vvs` now contains the value 0 appended to it. If `i` is equal to `j` and both are 0, the previous conditions do not apply.***
