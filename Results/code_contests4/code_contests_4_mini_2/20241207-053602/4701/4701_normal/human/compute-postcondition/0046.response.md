The value of `i` is appended to the list `dx`. The previous value of `dx` is not specified but it contains `i` as part of its data. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `goal` is equal to `dh * w + dw`, `seen` is a list of None values of length `n` with `seen[start]` set to 0, `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)], `dx` now contains `i` and the new value of `dx` after appending is `[... , i]`, `dy` now contains [-2], `j` is -1, and `i` is not equal to `j` and is not equal to 0. If the sum of the absolute values of `i` and `j` is greater than 1, `vvs` is now [1]. Otherwise, if the sum of the absolute values of `i` and `j` is 1 or less, `vvs` contains [0].
