According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `rows` variable. The loop is set to iterate `rows` times, and since `rows` is equal to `h`, it must be at least 1 for the loop to execute. The variable `i` will start at 0 for the first iteration. Therefore, in order for the loop to execute, `h` must be greater than 0, and `i` is initialized to 0. 

State: **`h` is an input integer greater than 0, `w` is an input integer, `rows` is equal to `h`, `cols` is equal to `w`, `OK` is '.', `NG` is '#', `ns` is a defaultdict of sets, `ss` is a list of length `h` filled with `None`, `i` is 0**
