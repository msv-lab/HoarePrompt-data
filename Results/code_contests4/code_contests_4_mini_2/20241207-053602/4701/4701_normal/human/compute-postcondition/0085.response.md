Output State: **`goal` is equal to `dh * w + dw`; `seen` is a list of None values of length `n` with `seen[start]` set to 0; `q` holds the value [(0, start)]; `dx` contains the value of `i` repeated ten times; `dy` is now `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 0]`; `j` is 4; if `i` and `j` are not both zero, and if the absolute sum of `i` and `j` is greater than 1, then `1` has been appended to `vvs` an additional four times; otherwise, `vvs` contains a corresponding number of 0s appended to it.**
