`dh` is decremented by 1, so its new value will be `dh - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is an input integer, `w` is an input integer, `ch` is the input integer decremented by 1, `cw` is the input integer decremented by 1, `dh` is the input integer decremented by 1, `dw` is an input integer.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer, `w` is an input integer, `ch` is the input integer decremented by 1, `cw` is the input integer decremented by 1, `dh` is the input integer decremented by 1, `dw` is an input integer**
