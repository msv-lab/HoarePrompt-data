According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to `rows`. The loop executes for each value of `i` from 0 to `rows - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `rows` is equal to `h`, which is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1. Since `i` is currently 0, it will become 1 for the next iteration.

Thus, the state must indicate that `i` is now 1, and the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `rows`.

State: **`h` is an input integer greater than 0, `w` is an input integer, `rows` is equal to `h`, `cols` is equal to `w`, `OK` is '.', `NG` is '#', `ns` is a defaultdict of sets, `ss` is a list of length `h` where `ss[0]` is equal to `s`, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than `rows` (which is equal to `h`).**
