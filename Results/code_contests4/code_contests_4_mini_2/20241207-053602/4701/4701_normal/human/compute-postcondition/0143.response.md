The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is `ux + xx`, `y` is `uy + yy`, `u` is `x * w + y`, and `num` is equal to `pnum + vv`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.  
Output State: **`x` is `ux + xx`, `y` is `uy + yy`, `u` is `x * w + y`, and `num` is equal to `pnum + vv`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
