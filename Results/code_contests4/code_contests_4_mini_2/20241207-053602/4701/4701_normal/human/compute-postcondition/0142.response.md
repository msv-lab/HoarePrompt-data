The variable `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`. The values of `pnum` and `vv` are not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine a specific value for `num`. The other variables (`x`, `y`, and `u`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is `ux + xx`, `y` is `uy + yy`, `u` is `x * w + y`, and `num` is equal to `pnum + vv`.

Output State: **`x` is `ux + xx`, `y` is `uy + yy`, `u` is `x * w + y`, and `num` is equal to `pnum + vv`**
