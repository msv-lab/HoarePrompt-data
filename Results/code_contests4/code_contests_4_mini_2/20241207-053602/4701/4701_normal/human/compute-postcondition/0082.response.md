The code `vvs.append(0)` appends the value `0` to the list `vvs`. The previous values of `vvs` are not specified in the initial state, so we can only state that `0` is added to the list. Other variables remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`goal` is equal to `dh * w + dw`; `seen` is a list of None values of length `n` with `seen[start]` set to 0; `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)]; `dx` contains the value of `i` repeated eight times; `dy` is now `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`; `j` is 3; `vvs` now contains an additional value 0.**
