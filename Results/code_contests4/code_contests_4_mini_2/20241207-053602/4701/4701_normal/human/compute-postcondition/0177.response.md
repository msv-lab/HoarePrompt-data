The code assigns the value of `num` as the sum of `pnum` and `vv`. The previous values of `pnum` and `vv` are not specified, so we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `num`. The variable `u` remains unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `u` is calculated as `x * w + y`; `num` is the sum of `pnum` and `vv`.

Output State: **`u` is calculated as `x * w + y`; `num` is the sum of `pnum` and `vv`**.
