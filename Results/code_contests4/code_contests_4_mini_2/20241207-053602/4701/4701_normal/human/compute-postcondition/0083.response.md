Postcondition: ***`goal` is equal to `dh * w + dw`; `seen` is a list of None values of length `n` with `seen[start]` set to 0; `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)]; `dx` contains the value of `i` repeated eight times; `dy` is now `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`; `j` is 3; if the absolute values of `i` and `j` sum to more than 1, `vvs` contains the value 1 appended to it; otherwise, `vvs` contains an additional value 0.***
