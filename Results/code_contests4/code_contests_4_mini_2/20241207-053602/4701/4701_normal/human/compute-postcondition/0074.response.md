The value `1` is appended to the list `vvs`. The previous values of the other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `goal` is equal to `dh * w + dw`; `seen` is a list of None values of length `n` with `seen[start]` set to 0; `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)]; `dx` contains the value of `i` repeated seven times; `dy` is now `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2]`; `j` is 2; and `1` has been appended to `vvs`.
