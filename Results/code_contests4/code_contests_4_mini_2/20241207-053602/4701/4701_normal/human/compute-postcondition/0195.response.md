Postcondition: ***`ux`, `xx`, `uy`, `yy`, `x`, `y`, `u`, `num`, `pnum`, `vv`, `h`, `w` are defined. If `x` is less than 0, or `y` is less than 0, or `x` is greater than or equal to `h`, or `y` is greater than or equal to `w`, or `ss[x][y]` is equal to '#', the values of `ux`, `xx`, `uy`, `yy`, `x`, `y`, `u`, and `num` remain unchanged as we continue to the next iteration of the loop.***
