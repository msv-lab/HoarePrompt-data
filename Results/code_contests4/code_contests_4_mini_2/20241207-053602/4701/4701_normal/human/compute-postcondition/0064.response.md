The value of `j` is appended to the list `dy`. The previous state of `dy` is `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]`, and since `j` is equal to 1, the new value of `dy` will be `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `goal` is equal to `dh * w + dw`, `seen` is a list of None values of length `n` with `seen[start]` set to 0, `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)], `dx` contains the value of `i` repeated six times, `dy` is now `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1]`, `j` is equal to 1, and it is true that `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is not equal to 0.

Output State: **`goal` is equal to `dh * w + dw`, `seen` is a list of None values of length `n` with `seen[start]` set to 0, `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)], `dx` contains the value of `i` repeated six times, `dy` is now `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1]`, `j` is equal to 1, and it is true that `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is not equal to 0.**
