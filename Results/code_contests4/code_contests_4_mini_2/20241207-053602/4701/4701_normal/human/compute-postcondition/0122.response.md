The variable `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`. The previous values of `pnum` and `vv` are unknown, so we cannot determine the specific value of `num`. However, the values of `u`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `u` is calculated as `x * w + y`, where `x` is calculated as `ux - 2` and `y` is calculated as `uy - 2`; `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`.

Output State: **`u` is calculated as `x * w + y`, where `x` is calculated as `ux - 2` and `y` is calculated as `uy - 2`; `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`.**
