The code assigns the values from the `input()` function split into two parts to the variables `h` and `w`, which are converted into integers using `map(int, ...)`. The previous values of `h` and `w` are unknown, as they are determined by the input. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` and `w` are assigned values from input as integers.

Output State: **`h` and `w` are assigned values from input as integers**
