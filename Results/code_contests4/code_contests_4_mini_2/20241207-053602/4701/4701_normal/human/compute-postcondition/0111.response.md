Output State: **`goal` is equal to `dh * w + dw`, `seen` is a list of None values of length `n` with `seen[start]` set to 0, `q` holds the value [(0, start)], `dx` contains the value of `i` repeated fourteen times, `dy` is now [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 0, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2], and `vvs` contains five values, which are determined by the absolute sums of `i` and `j` for each iteration.**
