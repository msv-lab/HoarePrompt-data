According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` lists. The loop will execute as long as there are elements to iterate over in these lists. The `zip` function will create tuples from the corresponding elements of `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs`. 

To determine the initial state needed for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that:

1. `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` must all have the same length, which implies that `len(dx)`, `len(dy)`, and `len(vvs)` must be equal.
2. The loop will iterate over the elements starting from the first position (index 0).

Given the current state, we do not yet have information about the lengths of `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs`, but we assume they are correctly defined to be of the same length. 

Thus, to ensure the loop can execute, `xx`, `yy`, and `vv` must be initialized correctly during the first iteration. 

State: **`goal` is equal to `dh * w + dw`, `seen` is a list of None values of length `n` with `seen[start]` set to 0, `q` is assigned the value `[(0, start)]`, `dx` contains `[-2, -2, -2, -2, -1, -1, -1, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2]`, `dy` contains `[-2, -1, -2, -1, -2, -1, 1, 2, -2, -1, 1, 2, -2, -1, 1, 2]`, `vvs` contains values based on the evaluations of `abs(i) + abs(j)` for each combination; for the loop to execute the first time, `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` must all have the same length, and `xx`, `yy`, `vv` will be the first elements of `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` respectively.**
