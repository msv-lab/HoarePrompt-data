The code `dx.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the end of the list `dx`. The previous values of `dx` consist of the value of `i` repeated six times. After the execution of this line, `dx` will have one additional element (the value of `i`), making it contain the value of `i` seven times in total. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`goal` is equal to `dh * w + dw`; `seen` is a list of None values of length `n` with `seen[start]` set to 0; `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)]; `dx` contains the value of `i` repeated seven times; `dy` is now `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1]`; `j` is 2; and the loop will execute a final time.**
