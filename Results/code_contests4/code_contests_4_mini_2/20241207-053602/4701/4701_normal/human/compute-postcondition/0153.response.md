Postcondition: ***`seen` contains the minimum number of steps to reach each valid position, `q` is not empty, `pnum` and `pu` are assigned the values returned by the function `hpp(q)`, `ux` is the quotient of `pu` divided by `w`, and `uy` is the remainder of `pu` divided by `w`. If `pu` equals `goal`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
