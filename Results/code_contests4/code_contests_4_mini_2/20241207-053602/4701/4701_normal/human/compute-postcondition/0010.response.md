The variables `rows` and `cols` are assigned the values of `h` and `w`, respectively. Since `h` is an input integer and `w` is also an input integer, the values of `rows` and `cols` will be equal to those input integers. The other variables (`ch`, `cw`, `dh`, `dw`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is an input integer, `w` is an input integer, `rows` is equal to `h`, and `cols` is equal to `w`.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer, `w` is an input integer, `rows` is equal to `h`, `cols` is equal to `w`**
