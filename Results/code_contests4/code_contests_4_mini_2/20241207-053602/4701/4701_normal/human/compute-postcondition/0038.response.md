The operation `dy.append(j)` adds the value of `j` to the list `dy`. The value of `j` is -2, which means that -2 will be appended to the empty list `dy`. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `goal` is equal to `dh * w + dw`, `seen` is a list of None values of length n with `seen[start]` set to 0, `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)], `dx` now contains `i`, `dy` now contains [-2], `vvs` is an empty list, `j` is -2, and `i` is not equal to `j` and is not equal to 0.

Output State: **`goal` is equal to `dh * w + dw`, `seen` is a list of None values of length n with `seen[start]` set to 0, `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)], `dx` now contains `i`, `dy` now contains [-2], `vvs` is an empty list, `j` is -2, and `i` is not equal to `j` and is not equal to 0.**
