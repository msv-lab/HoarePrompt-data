The code initializes an empty list `vvs`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed by this operation, as `vvs` was not defined prior to this line. Therefore, the output state captures the initial values of all other variables while noting that `vvs` has been initialized as an empty list.

Output State: **`goal` is equal to `dh * w + dw`, `seen` is a list of `None` values of length `n` with `seen[start]` set to 0, `q` is assigned the value `[(0, start)], `dx` is an empty list, `dy` is an empty list, and `vvs` is an empty list.**
