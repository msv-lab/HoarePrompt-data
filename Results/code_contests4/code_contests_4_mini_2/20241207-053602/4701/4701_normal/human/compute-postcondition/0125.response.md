Postcondition: ***`u` is calculated as `x * w + y`, where `x` is derived from `ux - 2` and `y` from `uy - 2`. The variable `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`. If `x` is less than 0, `y` is less than 0, `x` is greater than or equal to `h`, `y` is greater than or equal to `w`, or the value at `ss[x][y]` is '#', the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
