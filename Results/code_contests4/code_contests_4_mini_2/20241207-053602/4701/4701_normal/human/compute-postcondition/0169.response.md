The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `u` is calculated as `x * w + y` based on the updated values of `x`, `y`, and `w`; `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
