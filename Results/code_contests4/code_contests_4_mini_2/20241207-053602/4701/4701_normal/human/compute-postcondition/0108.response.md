The code appends the value `0` to the list `vvs`. The previous values of the affected variables do not change; thus, `vvs` will now contain the value `0` added to its contents. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `goal` is equal to `dh * w + dw`, `seen` is a list of None values of length `n` with `seen[start]` set to 0, `q` holds the value [(0, start)], `dx` now has `i` repeated thirteen times, `dy` is now [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 0, -2, -1, 0], `j` is 0, `i` is not equal to `j` and is not equal to 0, and `vvs` now includes `0`.
