Output State: **`seen` contains the minimum number of steps to reach each valid position; `q` is not empty; `pnum` is assigned a value returned by `hpp(q)`; `pu` is assigned another value returned by `hpp(q)`; `ux` is the quotient of `pu` divided by `w`; `uy` is the remainder of `pu` divided by `w`; `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` are non-empty lists; `xx` is the second element of `dx`; `yy` is the second element of `dy`; `vv` is the second element of `vvs`; `x` is updated to `ux + xx`; `y` is updated to `uy + yy`; `u` is calculated as `x * w + y`; `num` is `pnum + vv`; if `seen[u]` is None or `seen[u]` is greater than `num`, then `seen[u]` is updated to `num` and `hp(q, (num, u))` is called with arguments `(num, u)`.**
