The values of `ux`, `uy`, `xx`, and `yy` are used to calculate new values for `x` and `y`. The values of `xx` and `yy` are the first elements of `dx` and `dy`, respectively. Therefore, if we assume `ux` and `uy` have specific values, the new values for `x` and `y` will be computed based on those.

Since `xx` is the first element of `dx` and `yy` is the first element of `dy`, we can deduce:
- `xx = -2` (first element of `dx`)
- `yy = -2` (first element of `dy`)

Thus, we have:
- `x = ux + (-2)`
- `y = uy + (-2)`

The values of `x` and `y` will change according to `ux` and `uy`. However, the specific values of `ux` and `uy` are not given, meaning we cannot provide exact numeric outputs for `x` and `y`.

The output state will reflect that `x` and `y` are calculated based on `ux`, `uy`, `xx`, and `yy`.

Output State: **`x` is calculated as `ux - 2`, `y` is calculated as `uy - 2`**
