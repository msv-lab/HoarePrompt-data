According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j`. The loop iterates over the range from -2 to 2 inclusive, which consists of the values -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is -1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be updated to the next value in the range, which is 0.

Additionally, the loop will execute a total of 5 times (for values -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2). Since `j` is currently -1, it means the loop has executed for `j` values -2 and -1, and the next value will be 0.

State: **`goal` is equal to `dh * w + dw`, `seen` is a list of None values of length `n` with `seen[start]` set to 0, `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)], `dx` now contains `i` and the new value of `dx` after appending is [... , i], `dy` is now `[-2, -1]`, `j` is 0, `i` is not equal to `j` and is not equal to 0**
