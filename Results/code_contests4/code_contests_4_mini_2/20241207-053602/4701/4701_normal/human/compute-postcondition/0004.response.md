The variables `ch` and `cw` are assigned values from input that are split into two separate integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The previous values of `h` and `w` are not affected, as only `ch` and `cw` are being assigned new values. Therefore, the output state reflects the new assignments.

Output State: **`h` and `w` are assigned values from input as integers; `ch` and `cw` are input integers from the same input line.**
