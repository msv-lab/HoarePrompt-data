The variable `u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y`. The values of `x`, `w`, and `y` are used in this calculation, but their specific values are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `u` is calculated based on the expression `x * w + y`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`u` is calculated as `x * w + y`**
