The statement `vvs.append(1)` adds the value `1` to the list `vvs`. The previous state of `vvs` is determined by the conditions mentioned, but the specific state is not provided. Therefore, we can only confirm that `1` is appended to `vvs`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`goal` is equal to `dh * w + dw`, `seen` is a list of None values of length `n` with `seen[start]` set to 0, `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)], `dx` now contains `i` and the new value of `dx` after appending is `[... , i]`, `dy` is now `[-2, -1]`, `j` is -1, `i` is not equal to `j` and is not equal to 0, and `vvs` has `1` appended to it.**
