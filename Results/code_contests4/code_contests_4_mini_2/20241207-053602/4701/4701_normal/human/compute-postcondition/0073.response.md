The code `dy.append(j)` adds the value of `j` to the list `dy`. The previous value of `j` is 2, so after execution, `dy` will have an additional element with the value 2 appended to it. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`goal` is equal to `dh * w + dw`; `seen` is a list of None values of length `n` with `seen[start]` set to 0; `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)]; `dx` contains the value of `i` repeated seven times; `dy` is now `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2]`; `j` is 2; and the loop will execute a final time.**
