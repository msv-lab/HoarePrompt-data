The code `dy.append(j)` adds the value of `j` to the end of the list `dy`. The current value of `j` is 3. Therefore, after executing this line, the list `dy` will now include the value 3 as its last element. The previous values of `dy` are `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2]`, and now it will be `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`goal` is equal to `dh * w + dw`; `seen` is a list of None values of length `n` with `seen[start]` set to 0; `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)]; `dx` contains the value of `i` repeated eight times; `dy` is now `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`; `j` is 3; for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than 3.**
