The variables `dh` and `dw` are assigned the values obtained from the input, which is split into two parts and converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The previous values of `h`, `w`, `ch`, and `cw` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` and `w` are assigned values from input as integers; `ch` and `cw` are input integers from the same input line; `dh` and `dw` are now the two integers from the input.

Output State: **`h` and `w` are assigned values from input as integers; `ch` and `cw` are input integers from the same input line; `dh` and `dw` are now the two integers from the input.**
