The values of `x` and `y` are assigned the results of the expressions `ux + xx` and `uy + yy`, respectively. The variables `ux`, `xx`, `uy`, and `yy` are previously defined and affect the new values of `x` and `y`. The other variables `u`, `num`, `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `ux`, `xx`, `uy`, and `yy` influence the values of `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`x` is `ux + xx`, `y` is `uy + yy`**
