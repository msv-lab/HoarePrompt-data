`start` is assigned the value of `ch * w + cw`. The variables `ch` and `cw` are not defined in the initial state, but we can infer that they are likely indices or coordinates related to the grid defined by `h` and `w`. The value of `w` is an input integer, and `h` is an input integer greater than 0. Therefore, `start` will depend on the values of `ch`, `cw`, and `w`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer greater than 0, `w` is an input integer, `rows` is equal to `h`, `cols` is equal to `w`, `n` is equal to `h * w`, `OK` is '.', `NG` is '#', `ns` is a defaultdict of sets, `ss` is a list of length `h` where each `ss[i]` is equal to the corresponding input string for all `i` from 0 to `h-1`; `start` is equal to `ch * w + cw`.**
