The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement is executed, which skips the current iteration of the loop we are directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `u` is calculated as `x * w + y`; `num` is the sum of `pnum` and `vv` and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
