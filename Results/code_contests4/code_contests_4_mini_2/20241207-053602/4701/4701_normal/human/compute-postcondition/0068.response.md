The code `vvs.append(0)` appends the value `0` to the list `vvs`. There are no changes to the other variables, and the previous values of the affected variables are not specified. Therefore, the Output State reflects the new state of the variable `vvs` with the appended value.

Output State: **`goal` is equal to `dh * w + dw`, `seen` is a list of None values of length `n` with `seen[start]` set to 0, `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)], `dx` contains the value of `i` repeated six times, `dy` is now `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1]`, `j` is equal to 1, and `vvs` now contains the value 0 appended to it.**
