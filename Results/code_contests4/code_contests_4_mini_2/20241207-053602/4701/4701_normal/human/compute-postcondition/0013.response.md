The code initializes `ns` as a `defaultdict` of sets. This means `ns` will be a dictionary where each key will have a default value of an empty set when a key is accessed for the first time. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged, as they are not directly modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer, `w` is an input integer, `rows` is equal to `h`, `cols` is equal to `w`, `OK` is '.', `NG` is '#', `ns` is a defaultdict of sets**.
