The variable `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`. The value of `pnum` is determined by the previous execution of `hpp(q)`, and `vv` is the first element of the non-empty list `vvs`. Thus, `num` is calculated as the sum of these two values. The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `seen` contains the minimum number of steps to reach each valid position; `q` is not empty; `pnum` is assigned a value returned by `hpp(q)`; `pu` is assigned another value returned by `hpp(q)`; `ux` is the quotient of `pu` divided by `w`; `uy` is the remainder of `pu` divided by `w`; `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` are non-empty lists; `xx` is the first element of `dx`; `yy` is the first element of `dy`; `vv` is the first element of `vvs`; `x` is `ux + xx`; `y` is `uy + yy`; `u` is calculated as `x * w + y`; `num` is `pnum + vv`.
