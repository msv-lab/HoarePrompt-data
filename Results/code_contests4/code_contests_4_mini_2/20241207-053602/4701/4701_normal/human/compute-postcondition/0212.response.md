The variable `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`. The initial state does not provide values for `pnum` or `vv`, so we cannot determine the exact value of `num`. The other variables (`x`, `y`, and `u`) remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is `ux + xx`, `y` is `uy + yy`, `u` is `x * w + y`, and `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`.

Output State: **`x` is `ux + xx`, `y` is `uy + yy`, `u` is `x * w + y`, `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`**
