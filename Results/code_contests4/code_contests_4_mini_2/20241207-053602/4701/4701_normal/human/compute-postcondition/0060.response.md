According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from -2 to 2 (inclusive). The current value of `i` at the end of the last iteration is 2, which means that the loop has completed its last iteration with `i` being 2. 

Since the loop's range is from -2 to 2, it can no longer execute again because there are no more values left in the specified range for `i`. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, the range must be adjusted.

The next possible value for `i` after 2 is outside the current range. Therefore, to allow for another iteration, we would need to extend the range to include at least one more number.

State: **`goal` is equal to `dh * w + dw`, `seen` is a list of None values of length `n` with `seen[start]` set to 0, `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)], `dx` contains the value of `i` repeated five times, `dy` contains [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2], `j` is 2, `vvs` contains [1, 1, 0, 1]; for the loop to execute a third time, the range of `i` must be adjusted to include at least 3 (for example, change to `range(-2, 4)`).**
