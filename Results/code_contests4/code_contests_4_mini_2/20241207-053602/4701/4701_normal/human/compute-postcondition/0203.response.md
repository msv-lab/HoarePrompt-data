The variable `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`. The previous values of the affected variables `pnum` and `vv` are unknown, and the values of `x`, `y`, and `u` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is `ux + xx`, `y` is `uy + yy`, and `u` is calculated as `x * w + y`; `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`.

Output State: **`x` is `ux + xx`, `y` is `uy + yy`, `u` is calculated as `x * w + y`; `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`.**
