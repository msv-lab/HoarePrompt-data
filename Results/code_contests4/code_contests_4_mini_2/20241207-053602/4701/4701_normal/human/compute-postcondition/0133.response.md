The value of `num` is assigned the sum of `pnum` and `vv`. The initial state does not specify the values of `pnum` and `vv`, so they are unknown. Therefore, the output state reflects the change without specific values. 

Output State: **`u` is calculated as `(ux + xx) * w + (uy + yy)`; `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`**
