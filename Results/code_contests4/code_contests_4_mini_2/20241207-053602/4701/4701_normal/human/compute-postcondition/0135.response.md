Postcondition: ***`u` is calculated as `(ux + xx) * w + (uy + yy)`; `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv` if `x` is less than 0, `y` is less than 0, `x` is greater than or equal to `h`, `y` is greater than or equal to `w`, or `ss[x][y]` equals '#'. If none of these conditions are met, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop without modifying `u` or `num`.***
