The variable `goal` is assigned the value of `dh * w + dw`. The values of `dh` and `dw` are not specified in the initial state, but they are assumed to be integers. The values of `h` and `w` are input integers, with `h` being greater than 0. Therefore, `goal` will be calculated based on those values, resulting in an expression that depends on the specific values of `dh`, `dw`, and `w`.

Since `dh` and `dw` can vary, the output state will reflect that `goal` is dependent on these variables.

Output State: **`goal` is equal to `dh * w + dw`, where `dh` and `dw` are integers.**
