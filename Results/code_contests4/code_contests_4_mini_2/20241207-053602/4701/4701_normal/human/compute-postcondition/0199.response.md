Postcondition: ***`ux`, `xx`, `uy`, `yy`, `x`, `y`, `u`, `num`, `pnum`, `vv`, `h`, `w` are defined. If `seen[u]` is None or `seen[u]` is greater than `num`, then `seen[u]` is assigned the value of `num` and the function `hp` is called with arguments `(num, u)`. If `seen[u]` is already assigned a value that is less than or equal to `num`, the values of `ux`, `xx`, `uy`, `yy`, `x`, `y`, `u`, and `num` remain unchanged.***
