Postcondition: ***`goal` is equal to `dh * w + dw`, `seen` is a list of None values of length `n` with `seen[start]` set to 0, `q` is assigned the value [(0, start)], `dx` now contains [..., i], `dy` is now [-2, -1, 0], `j` is 0, and `i` is not equal to `j` and is not equal to 0. If the sum of the absolute values of `i` and `j` is greater than 1, then `vvs` now contains an additional element 1; otherwise, `vvs` has appended the value 0.***
