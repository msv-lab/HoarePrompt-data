The expression `x += x & -x` performs a bitwise operation on `x`. Given that `x` is less than or equal to 0, the value of `x & -x` will be 0 when `x` is 0, and it will also be 0 or a negative value when `x` is less than 0. Therefore, after executing the line, `x` remains unchanged because adding 0 does not change the value of `x`. 

The state of `ts[x - 1]` remains unchanged as well, since no operations alter it within the provided code snippet.

Thus, the output state reflects the conditions of the variables:

Output State: **`x` is less than or equal to 0; `ts[x - 1]` is incremented by 1; `x` remains unchanged.**
