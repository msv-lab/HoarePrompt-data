The value of `i` is decremented by 1, changing its previous value of 1 to 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings, `item` is the second string in `l1`, `x` is now the length of `item` minus 1, `res` is 0, `i` is 0, and `ans` remains unchanged.
