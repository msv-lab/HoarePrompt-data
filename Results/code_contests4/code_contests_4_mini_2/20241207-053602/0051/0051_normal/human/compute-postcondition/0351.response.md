Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l1` is a list of strings with at least 3 strings, `item` is the third string in `l1`, `x` is the length of `item`, `res` is the accumulated result from calculations based on `item`. If `x` is less than or equal to `i`, `ans` is updated by adding `arr[i - 1] * res` where `i` is 1. Otherwise, `res` is updated based on cumulative calculations involving all characters of `item`, `ans` is updated with `arr[10] * res`, `i` is updated to 11, and `j` is set to -1.***
