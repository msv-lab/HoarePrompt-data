The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or block of code we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `xs` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is `len(xs) - 1`, `x` is increased by `x & -x`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
