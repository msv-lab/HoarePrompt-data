According to the code, the `while True` loop will always execute at least once, since the condition is a constant true. Therefore, no modifications are needed to the program state for the loop to execute for the first time. 

State: **`x` is `zs[i] + 1`, `us[i]` is updated with the sum of `ts` values accessed during the iterations, `ts` remains unchanged, `i` is `len(xs) - 2`.**
