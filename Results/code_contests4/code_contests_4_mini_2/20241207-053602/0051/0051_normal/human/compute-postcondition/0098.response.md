Since the loop is a `while True`, it will always execute at least once regardless of the state of the variables. Therefore, no modifications are necessary to ensure that the loop can execute its first iteration.

State: **`x` is updated to `zs[i] + 1`, `us[i]` holds the sum of all `ts` values accessed during the iterations, `i` is `len(xs) - 3`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `len(xs)` is at least 3**
