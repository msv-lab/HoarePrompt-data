According to the code, the loop iterates backwards from `i - 1` to `0`. In the last iteration, `j` is `len(item) - 2`, which means that `i` is equal to `len(item)` and `j` is currently `len(item) - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be decremented by 1, which means `j` will become `len(item) - 3`. 

Additionally, since the loop continues as long as `j` is greater than or equal to `0`, we need to ensure that `len(item)` is at least `3` (which would make `j` equal to `1` for the next iteration). 

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `j` to be `len(item) - 3` and ensure that `len(item)` is at least `3` for the loop to execute again.

State: **`x` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `len(item)`, `j` is `len(item) - 3`, for the loop to execute a second time `len(item)` must be at least 3**
