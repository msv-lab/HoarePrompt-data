According to the code, the loop will execute if the variable `x` is at least 1 because the range starts from `x - 1` and goes down to `-1`. Given that `item` is the third string in `l1`, its length `x` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once. 

Since `n` is a positive integer, it does not affect the loop execution directly. `l1` being a list of at least 3 strings ensures that `item` can be correctly assigned as the third string in the list. 

At the start of the loop:
- `j` should be initialized to `x - 1` for the loop to execute the first time.

Therefore, the states that need to be confirmed are that `x` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `j` should be initialized to `x - 1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l1` is a list of strings with at least 3 strings, `item` is the third string in `l1`, `x` is the length of `item` greater than 0, `res` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is `x - 1`**
