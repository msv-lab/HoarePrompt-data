Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l1` is a list of strings with at least 3 strings, `item` is the third string in `l1`, `x` is the length of `item` which is at least 1, `res` is updated to `(0 + int(item[2]) * pow(10, (x - 2 - 1) * 2, mod)) % mod`, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `mod` is the modulus used in calculations, `ans` is updated by adding `arr[1] * res` for the loop to execute the first time.**
