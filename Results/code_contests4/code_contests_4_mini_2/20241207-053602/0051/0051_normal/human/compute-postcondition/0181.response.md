Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings, `item` is the second string in `l1`, `ans` is the accumulated result based on the calculations performed for all iterations of `i` from 1 to 10, `x` is now the length of `item` minus 1, `res` is (res + 2 * int(item[j]) * pow(10, x - 1 + 2 * (2) - 1, mod)) % mod, `j` is 0, and for the loop to execute the first time `i` is less than x.**
