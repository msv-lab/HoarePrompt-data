The value of `i` is decremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l1` is a list of strings with at least 3 strings, `item` is the third string in `l1`, `x` is a positive integer (specifically `x - 1`), `res` is 0, `ans` is updated after all iterations of `i` from 1 to 10, `i` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l1` is a list of strings with at least 3 strings, `item` is the third string in `l1`, `x` is a positive integer (specifically `x - 1`), `res` is 0, `ans` is updated after all iterations of `i` from 1 to 10, `i` is 0**
