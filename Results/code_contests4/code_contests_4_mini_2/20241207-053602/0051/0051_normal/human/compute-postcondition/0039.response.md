Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100000; if `s[i]` is greater than or equal to `b'0'[0]`, then `numb` is updated based on the calculation and `i` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `s[i]` is equal to `b'-'[0]`, then `sign` is set to -1; if `s[i]` is not equal to `b'\r'[0]`, `A` is modified to include `sign * numb`, `numb` is reset to zero, `sign` is set to 1, and `i` is increased by 1.**
