The value of `sign` is assigned the value 1, but it was already 1 in the initial state. Therefore, the value of `sign` remains unchanged, and the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100000; `s[i]` is processed but remains undefined; `A` is [0, 0]; `numb` is 0; `sign` is 1; `i` is now 1**
