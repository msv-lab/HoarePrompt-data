The code attempts to access the `item` string at the index `j + (x - i)`, which evaluates to `1 + (0 - 2)`, resulting in an index of `-1`. Since `item` is a string of length 0, trying to access any index will lead to an index out-of-bounds error. Therefore, the values of the variables do not change, and we encounter an error.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l1` is a list of strings with at least 1 string, `item` is a string of length 0, `res` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `x` is 0, and an index out-of-bounds error occurs.**
