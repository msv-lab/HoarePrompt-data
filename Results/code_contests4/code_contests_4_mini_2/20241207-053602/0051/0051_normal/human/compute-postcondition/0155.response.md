Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l1` is a list of strings with at least 1 string, `item` is the first string in `l1`, and `x` is the length of `item`. If `x` is less than or equal to `i`, `j` is set to -1, `res` is updated based on the calculations performed in the loop, and `ans` is updated by adding `arr[i - 1] * res`. Otherwise, if `x` is greater than `i`, `item` is a string of length 0, `res` remains unchanged, `i` is set to 2, `j` is -1, `x` is updated to 0, and an `IndexError` occurs preventing any changes to `res.***
