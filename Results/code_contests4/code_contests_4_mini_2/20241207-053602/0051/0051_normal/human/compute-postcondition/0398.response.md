Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l1` is a list of strings with at least 3 strings, `item` is the third string in `l1`, `x` is the length of `item`, `res` is updated based on computations involving `item` and `i` is 1. If `x` is less than or equal to `i`, `ans` is updated by adding `arr[0] * res`. Otherwise, `res` holds the final computed value, `j` is -1, `x` is the length of `item`, `mod` is the modulus used in calculations, and `ans` is updated by adding `arr[i - 1] * res`.***
