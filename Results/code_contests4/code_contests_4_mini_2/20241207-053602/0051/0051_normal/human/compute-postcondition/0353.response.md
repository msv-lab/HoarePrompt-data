The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l1` is a list of strings with at least 3 strings, `item` is the third string in `l1`, `x` is the length of `item`, `res` is the accumulated result from calculations based on `item`, `i` is 1 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
