Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings, `item` is the second string in `l1`, `ans` is the accumulated result based on the calculations performed for all iterations of `i` from 1 to 10, `x` is the length of `item`, `res` reflects the cumulative computed values based on the characters in `item` across all iterations, and if `arr[0]` is equal to 0, the loop continues to the next iteration without altering any values in `ans` or `res`.***
