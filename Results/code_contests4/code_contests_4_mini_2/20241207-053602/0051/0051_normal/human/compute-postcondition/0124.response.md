In this case, the loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will continue to execute indefinitely unless there is an explicit break condition within the loop body. Since there are no conditions to stop the loop, it can always execute one more time regardless of the current state.

Therefore, no adjustments to the state are necessary for the loop to proceed.

State: **`x` is less than or equal to 0; `ts[x - 1]` is incremented by 1**
