According to the code, the `while True` loop will always execute indefinitely unless there is a break statement encountered within the loop. Since the loop always allows for execution, we can simply repeat the program state at the end of the previous iteration. 

State: **`x` is less than or equal to 0, `ts` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
