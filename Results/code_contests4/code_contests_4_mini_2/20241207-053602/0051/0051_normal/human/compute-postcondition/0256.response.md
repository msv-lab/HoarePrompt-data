Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings, `item` is the second string in `l1`, `x` is the length of `item`, `res` is updated based on all characters of `item` and `mod`, `i` is 2, `ans` is updated with the value `ans + arr[i - 1] * res`, and `j` is -1. If `arr[i - 1]` is equal to 0, the execution continues to the next iteration of the loop without modifying `ans`.***
