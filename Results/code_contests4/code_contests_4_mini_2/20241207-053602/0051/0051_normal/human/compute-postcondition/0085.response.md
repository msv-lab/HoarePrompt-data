Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute again regardless of the current state. Therefore, there is no need to modify any state variables as the loop is guaranteed to run one more time.

State: **`x` is `zs[i] + 1`, `us[i]` is updated with the sum of `ts` values accessed during the iterations, `ts` remains unchanged, `i` is `len(xs) - 2`, and `ts[x - 1]` is incremented by 1**
