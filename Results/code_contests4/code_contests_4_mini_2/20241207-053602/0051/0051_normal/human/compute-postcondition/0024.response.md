`A` is updated by appending the value of `sign * numb`. Given that `sign` is 1 and `numb` is 0, the result of `sign * numb` is 0. Therefore, `A` will now be `[0, 0]`. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100000; `s[i]` is processed but remains undefined; `A` is [0, 0]; `numb` is zero; `sign` remains 1; `i` is now 1.**
