The value of `sign` is assigned 1, but it was already 1 in the initial state. Therefore, there is no change to the variable. The other variables remain unaffected as well. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100000; `conv` is assigned the value of `ord` if `py2` is true, otherwise it is assigned a lambda function; `A` is [0]; `numb` is zero; `sign` is 1; `i` is 0; `s` is assigned the value of the input read from `sys.stdin.buffer`.**
