Since the loop condition is `while True`, it will always execute at least once regardless of the state of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to the program state for the loop to proceed.

State: **`x` is greater than 0; `ts` has been updated at the indices determined by the values of `x`; `i` is `len(xs) - 2`; `xs` is a list of integers with at least 1 element.**
