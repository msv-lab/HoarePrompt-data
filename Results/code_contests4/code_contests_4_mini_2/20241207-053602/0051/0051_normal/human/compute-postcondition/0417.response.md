The value of `i` is decremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 1. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l1` is a list of strings with at least 3 strings, `item` is the third string in `l1`, `x` is at least 2, `res` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is -1, `mod` is the modulus used in calculations, `ans` is updated by adding `arr[1] * res`.
