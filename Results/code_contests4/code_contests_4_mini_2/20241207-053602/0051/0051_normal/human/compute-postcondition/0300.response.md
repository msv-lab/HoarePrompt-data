Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings, and `item` is the second string in `l1`. If the length of `item` (x) is less than or equal to 2, then `res` holds the final computed value, `ans` is updated with the value `ans + arr[i - 1] * res`, and `j` is -1. Otherwise, if `x` is greater than 2, then `i` is equal to the length of `item`, `j` is -1, `res` is updated based on a calculation involving all elements of `item`, `mod`, and the values of `x`, `i`, and `j`, and `ans` is updated to `ans + arr[i - 1] * res`.***
