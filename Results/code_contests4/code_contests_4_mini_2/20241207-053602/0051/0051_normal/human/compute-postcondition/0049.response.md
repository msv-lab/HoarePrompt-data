Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `zero` and returns a list of integers extracted from the input string `s`, which includes a 0. The function processes the input to convert sequences of numeric characters into integers, handles negative signs, and concatenates the results into the list `A`. It also includes the last number processed if the input ends with a digit. If the input is empty, the function will return an empty list. **
