According to the code, since the loop is a `while True`, it will always execute indefinitely unless interrupted or exited by some condition within the loop body. Therefore, no adjustments to the state are necessary for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`x` is updated to `zs[i] + 1`, `us[i]` remains unchanged, and `i` is `len(xs) - 3`**
