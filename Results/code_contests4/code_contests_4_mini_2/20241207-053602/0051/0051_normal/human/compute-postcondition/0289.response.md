According to the code, the loop will execute if the starting value of `j` (which is `i - 1`) is greater than or equal to 0. In the provided state, `i` is equal to `len(item)`, which means `j` will be initialized to `len(item) - 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `len(item)` must be greater than 0, ensuring that `j` is non-negative. 

Given that `x` is equal to `len(item)`, we can conclude that `x` must be greater than 0. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that condition, and `j` will begin at `len(item) - 1`. 

State: **`x` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `len(item)`, `j` is `len(item) - 1`**
