Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100000; if the ASCII value of `s[i]` is greater than or equal to the ASCII value of '0', an error occurred due to `numb` being undefined. Otherwise, if `s[i]` is equal to the ASCII value of '-', then `sign` is set to -1; if `s[i]` is not equal to the ASCII value of carriage return, `A` is set to [0], `numb` is zero, `sign` remains 1, and `i` is 0, maintaining the program state as described.***
