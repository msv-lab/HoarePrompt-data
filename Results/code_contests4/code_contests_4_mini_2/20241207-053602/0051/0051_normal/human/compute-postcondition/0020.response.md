The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is 0, so after execution, `i` becomes 1. The states of the other variables (`n`, `s`, `numb`, `sign`, `A`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100000; `s[i]` is processed but remains undefined; `A` is set to [0]; `numb` is zero; `sign` remains 1; `i` is now 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100000; `s[i]` is processed but remains undefined; `A` is set to [0]; `numb` is zero; `sign` remains 1; `i` is now 1.**
