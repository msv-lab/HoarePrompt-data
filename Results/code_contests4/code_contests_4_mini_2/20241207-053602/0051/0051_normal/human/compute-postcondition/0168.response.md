According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from `x - 1` down to `0`, inclusive. The loop can execute if `j` is greater than or equal to `0`. In the previous iteration, `j` was initialized to `x - 1`, and since `x` is less than or equal to `i`, `j` must have decremented by 1 during the last iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` would be `-1`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be initialized back to `x - 1`, which means `x` should not change. Therefore, the states must reflect that `j` is set to `x - 1` again for the loop to start the next iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings, `item` is the second string in `l1`, `ans` is the accumulated result based on the calculations performed for all iterations of `i` from 1 to 10, `x` is the length of `item`, `j` is initialized to `x - 1`, and for the loop to execute again, `x` must be less than or equal to `i`.**
