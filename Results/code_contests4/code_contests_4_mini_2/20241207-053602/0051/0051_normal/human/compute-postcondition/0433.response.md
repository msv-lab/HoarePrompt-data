The value of `x` is assigned the length of `item`. Since `item` is the third string in `l1`, `x` will be the length of that specific string. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l1` is a list of strings with at least 3 strings, `item` is the third string in `l1`, `x` is the length of `item`, `res` is updated based on all iterations, `i` is 2, `j` is `x - 1`, `mod` is the modulus used in calculations, `ans` is updated by adding `arr[1] * res`.
