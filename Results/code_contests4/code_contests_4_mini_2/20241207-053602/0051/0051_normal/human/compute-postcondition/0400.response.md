The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change, but we skip any remaining code in the current iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l1` is a list of strings with at least 3 strings, `item` is the third string in `l1`, `x` is the length of `item`, `res` is updated based on computations involving `item`, `i` is 2, `j` is -1, `mod` is the modulus used in calculations, and `ans` is updated by adding `arr[1] * res`, and we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop.
