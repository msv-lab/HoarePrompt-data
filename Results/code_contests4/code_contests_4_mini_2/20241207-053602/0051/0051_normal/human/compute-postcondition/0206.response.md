Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings, `item` is the second string in `l1`, `x` is the length of `item`, and `res` is initialized to 0. If `x` is less than or equal to `i`, `ans` is updated by adding `arr[i - 1] * res` for the current iteration, `res` is updated based on all characters of `item`, and `j` is -1 after the loop completes. Otherwise, `res` is updated based on the calculations performed for all iterations of `j` from `i - 1` down to 0; `j` is -1; `i` is set to 11; `x` remains the length of `item`; `item` is still the second string in `l1`; `mod` is used for modulo operations; and `ans` is updated to `ans + arr[10] * res`.***
