The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown, so the output state is: variable `j` is increased by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l1` is a list of strings with at least 3 strings, `item` is the third string in `l1`, `x` is greater than 0, `res` is updated based on the calculation, `i` is 0, `j` is increased by 1.**
