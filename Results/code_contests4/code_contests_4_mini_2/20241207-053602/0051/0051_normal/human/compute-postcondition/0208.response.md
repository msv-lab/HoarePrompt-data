The values of the variables do not change, but we skip the current iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings, `item` is the second string in `l1`, `x` is the length of `item`, `res` is initialized to 0, `i` is still 1 for the loop, and `ans` remains unchanged as it is based on calculations performed in the loop.
