The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is updated to `zs[i] + 1`; `us[i]` is updated by adding `ts[x - 1]` to its previous value; `ts` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
