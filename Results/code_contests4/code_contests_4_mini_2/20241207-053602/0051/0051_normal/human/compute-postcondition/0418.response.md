The value of `j` is assigned the value `0`. The previous value of `j` was `-1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l1` is a list of strings with at least 3 strings, `item` is the third string in `l1`, `x` is at least 2, `res` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `mod` is the modulus used in calculations, `ans` is updated by adding `arr[1] * res`.
