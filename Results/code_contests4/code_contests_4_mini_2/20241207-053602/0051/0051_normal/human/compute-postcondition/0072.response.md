According to the code, since the loop is a `while True` loop, it is guaranteed to execute again regardless of the current state. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states for the loop to proceed to the next iteration. 

State: **`x` is updated to `zs[i] + 1`; the values of `us[i]` and `ts` remain unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
