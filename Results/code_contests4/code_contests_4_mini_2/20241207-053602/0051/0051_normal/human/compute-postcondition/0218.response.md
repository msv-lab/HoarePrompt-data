According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `x - 2`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be decremented by 1. 

Given that `j` starts as `x - 2`, it will then become `x - 3` for the next iteration of the loop. The loop will execute again if `j` is at least 0, which means `x - 3` must be greater than or equal to 0. Thus, `x` must be at least 3.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings, `item` is the second string in `l1`, `x` is the length of `item`, `j` is `x - 3`, `res` is updated based on the last character of `item` and `mod`, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `x` must be at least 3.**
