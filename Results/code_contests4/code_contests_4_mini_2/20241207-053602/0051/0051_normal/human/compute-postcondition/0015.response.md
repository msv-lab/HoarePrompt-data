Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100000; `conv` is assigned the value of `ord` if `py2` is true, otherwise it is assigned a lambda function; `A` is an empty list; `numb` is zero; `sign` is 1; `i` is 0; `s` is assigned the value of the input read from `sys.stdin.buffer`; the value of `s[i]` is less than the ASCII value of '0'; `s[i]` is not equal to the ASCII value of '-' (45); and `s[i]` is not equal to the ASCII value of '\r' (13); appending `sign * numb` results in appending 0 to `A`, so `A` is now [0].**
