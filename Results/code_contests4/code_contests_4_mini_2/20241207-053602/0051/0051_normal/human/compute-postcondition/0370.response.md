The value of `i` is decremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 0. The other variables `n`, `l1`, `item`, `x`, and `res` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l1` is a list of strings with at least 3 strings, `item` is the third string in `l1`, `x` is greater than 1 and now is decremented by 1, `res` is 0, `i` is 0.
