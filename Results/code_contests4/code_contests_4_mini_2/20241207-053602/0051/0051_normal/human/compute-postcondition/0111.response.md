According to the code, the loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will continue to execute indefinitely unless a break statement is encountered. Since there are no conditions that will prevent the loop from executing again, the program state at the end of the previous iteration can simply be repeated without any modifications. 

State: **`us[i]` is updated by adding `ts[x - 1]`, `x` is `zs[i] + 1`, and `i` is `len(xs) - 3`.**
