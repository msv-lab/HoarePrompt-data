Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l1` is a list of strings with at least 3 strings, `item` is the third string in `l1`, `x` is the length of `item`, `res` is 0, `i` is 2, `j` is -1, and `mod` is the modulus used in calculations. If `x` is less than or equal to `i`, `ans` is updated by adding `arr[1] * res`. Otherwise, `res` is updated based on the calculations involving the last two characters of `item`, and `ans` is updated by adding `arr[1] * res` to its previous value.***
