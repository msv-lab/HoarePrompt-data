Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100000; if `s[i]` is equal to the ASCII value of '-', then `sign` is set to -1. Otherwise, `A` is [0], `numb` is zero, `sign` remains 1, `i` is 0, and the program state remains as described if `s[i]` is not equal to the ASCII value of carriage return.***
