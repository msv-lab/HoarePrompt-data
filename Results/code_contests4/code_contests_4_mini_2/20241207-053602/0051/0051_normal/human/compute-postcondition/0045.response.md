The value of `numb` is appended to the list `A` after being multiplied by `sign`. Since `numb` is zero and `sign` is 1, the result of the multiplication is 0. Thus, 0 is added to the list `A`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100000; `A` contains the integers extracted from the input `s` and now includes a 0; `numb` is zero; `sign` is 1; `i` is equal to the length of `s`; `s` is not empty, and the last element of `s` is greater than or equal to the ASCII value of '0'.
