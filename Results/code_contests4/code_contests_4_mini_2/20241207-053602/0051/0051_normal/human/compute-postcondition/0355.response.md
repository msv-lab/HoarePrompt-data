The value of `x` is assigned the length of `item`. Since `item` is the third string in `l1`, `x` will be the length of that specific string. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l1` is a list of strings with at least 3 strings, `item` is the third string in `l1`, `x` is the length of `item`, `res` is the accumulated result from calculations based on `item`, and `i` is 1.
