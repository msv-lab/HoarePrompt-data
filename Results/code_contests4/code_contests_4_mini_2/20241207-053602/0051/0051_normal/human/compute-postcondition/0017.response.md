Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100000; `conv` is assigned the value of `ord` if `py2` is true, otherwise it is assigned a lambda function; `A` is [0]; `numb` is zero; `sign` is 1; `i` is 0; `s` is assigned the value of the input read from `sys.stdin.buffer`, and if `s[i]` is not equal to the ASCII value of carriage return, then the program state remains as described.***
