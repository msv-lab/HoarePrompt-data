The code updates the variable `ans` by adding the product of `arr[i - 1]` and `res` to it. The value of `i` is 2, which means `i - 1` is 1. Therefore, `arr[i - 1]` refers to `arr[1]`. The value of `res` is already defined as the final computed value based on all iterations, but its specific value is not provided. The previous value of `ans` is also not given. 

Since we do not have specific values for `arr[1]`, `res`, or `ans`, we can only describe the operation. The output state indicates that `ans` is updated, but the exact numerical value cannot be determined without more information. 

Output State: **`ans` is updated by adding `arr[1] * res`**
