The code assigns a new value to `ans` by adding the product of `arr[i - 1]` and `res` to the current value of `ans`. The variable `i` is 2, so `i - 1` equals 1, meaning that the value of `arr[1]` will be used in the calculation. The other variables do not change. Since `ans` remains unchanged prior to this operation, we do not have its previous value stated, but we acknowledge that it is being updated.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings, `item` is the second string in `l1`, `x` is the length of `item`, `res` is updated to the final computed value, `i` is 2, `ans` is updated, `j` is -1.**
