The value of `x` is updated by adding `x & -x` to it. The previous value of `x` is not specified, but it will definitely change as a result of this operation. The other variables (`xs`, `i`, and `ts`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `xs` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is `len(xs) - 1`, `x` is increased by `x & -x`.

Output State: **`xs` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is `len(xs) - 1`, `x` is increased by `x & -x`**
