The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is 1. Therefore, after execution, `j` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings, `item` is the second string in `l1`, `ans` is the accumulated result based on the calculations performed for all iterations of `i` from 1 to 10, `x` is now the length of `item` minus 3, `res` is updated based on the formula, `j` is 2, and `i` is 1.**
