Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings, `item` is the second string in `l1`, `x` is the length of `item`, `res` is updated based on all characters of `item` and `mod`, `i` is 1, and `ans` is updated to `ans + arr[0] * res` if `x` is less than or equal to 1. If `x` is greater than 1, then `ans` is updated with the value `ans + arr[i - 1] * res`, where `i` is the length of `item`, `j` is -1, and `item` is the second string in `l1`.***
