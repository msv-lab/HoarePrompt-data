Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l1` is a list of strings with at least 3 strings, `item` is the third string in `l1`, `x` is the length of `item`, `res` is the accumulated result from calculations based on `item`, and `i` is 1. If `arr[i - 1]` is equal to 0, the loop continues to the next iteration.***
