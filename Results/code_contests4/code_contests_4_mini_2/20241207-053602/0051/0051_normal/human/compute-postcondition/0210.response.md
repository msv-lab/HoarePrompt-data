The value of `x` is assigned the length of `item`. Since `item` is the second string in `l1`, and `l1` contains at least 2 strings, `x` will be the length of that second string. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings, `item` is the second string in `l1`, `x` is the length of `item`, `res` is initialized to 0, `i` is 1, and `ans` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings, `item` is the second string in `l1`, `x` is the length of `item`, `res` is initialized to 0, `i` is 1, and `ans` remains unchanged.**
