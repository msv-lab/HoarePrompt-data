The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is 0. Therefore, after execution, `j` will be 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings, `item` is the second string in `l1`, `x` is the length of `item` minus 2, `res` is updated with the expression `(0 + 2 * int(item[j]) * pow(10, x + 1, mod)) % mod`, `i` is 0, `ans` remains unchanged, `j` is 1**
