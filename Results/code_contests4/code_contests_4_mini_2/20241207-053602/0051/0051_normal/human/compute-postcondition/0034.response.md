`A` is modified by appending the product of `sign` and `numb` to it. The values of `n`, `numb`, `sign`, and `i` do not affect the execution of this line aside from their existence in the operation. While `A` changes, `n`, `numb`, `sign`, and `i` remain in their previous states. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100000; `A` is modified to include `sign * numb`; `numb` remains unchanged; `sign` remains unchanged; `i` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100000; `A` is modified to include `sign * numb`; `numb` remains unchanged; `sign` remains unchanged; `i` is increased by 1.**
