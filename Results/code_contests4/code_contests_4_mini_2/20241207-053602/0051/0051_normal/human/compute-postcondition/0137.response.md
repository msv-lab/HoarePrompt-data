The function `count_next_smaller_elements` accepts a parameter `xs`. `xs` is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9, and the length of `xs` is a positive integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000. After executing the function body, it returns the cumulative sums stored in 'us' based on the counts in 'ts', which holds the counts of unique integers updated during the iterations. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `xs` and returns cumulative sums based on the counts of unique integers in the list.**
