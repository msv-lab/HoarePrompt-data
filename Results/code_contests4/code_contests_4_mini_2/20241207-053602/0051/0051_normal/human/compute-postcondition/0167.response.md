Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings, `item` is the second string in `l1`, `ans` is the accumulated result based on the calculations performed for all iterations of `i` from 1 to 10, `x` is the length of `item`, `res` is updated with the calculation `(res + int(item[j]) * pow(10, (x - j) * 2 - 1, mod)) % mod`, where `j` is initialized to `x - 1` and `x` is less than or equal to `i` for the first iteration.**
