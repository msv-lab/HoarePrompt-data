According to the code, the `while True` loop will execute indefinitely as there are no conditions that can prevent it from running. Therefore, there are no specific states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute at least one time. 

State: **`x` is less than or equal to 0, `us[i]` is updated to include the sum of all `ts` values accessed during the iterations, `i` is `len(xs) - 3`**
