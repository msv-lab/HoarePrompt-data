The value of `sign` is assigned -1, changing its previous value of 1 to -1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100000; `conv` is assigned the value of `ord` if `py2` is true, otherwise it is assigned a lambda function; `A` is an empty list; `numb` is assigned the value of `zero`, which is undefined; `sign` is -1; `i` is 0; `s` is assigned the value of the input read from `sys.stdin.buffer`; the value of `s[i]` is less than the ASCII value of '0'; the value of `s[i]` is equal to the ASCII value of '-'.
