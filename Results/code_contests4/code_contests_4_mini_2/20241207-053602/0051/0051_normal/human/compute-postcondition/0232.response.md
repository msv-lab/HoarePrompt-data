Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings, `item` is the second string in `l1`, `x` is the length of `item` minus 2, `res` is updated with the expression `(res + 2 * int(item[j]) * pow(10, x - i + 2 * (i + 1) - 1, mod)) % mod`, `i` is 0, `ans` remains unchanged, `j` is 1, and for the loop to execute again `x` is greater than 0.**
