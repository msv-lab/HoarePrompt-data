Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l1` is a list of strings with `n` strings, `item` is the last string in `l1`, `ans` is the accumulated result based on the calculations performed for all iterations of `i` from 1 to 10 for each string in `l1`, `x` is the length of the last `item`, and `res` reflects the cumulative computed values based on the characters in the last `item` across all iterations.**
