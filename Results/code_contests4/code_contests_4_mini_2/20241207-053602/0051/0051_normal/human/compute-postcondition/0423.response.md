According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x` and `i`. If `x` is greater than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be greater than 1. Since `x` is at least 1, we need to ensure that it is strictly greater than 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l1` is a list of strings with at least 3 strings, `item` is the third string in `l1`, `x` is at least 1, `res` is updated, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `mod` is the modulus used in calculations, `ans` is updated by adding `arr[1] * res, and for the loop to execute again x must be greater than 1**
