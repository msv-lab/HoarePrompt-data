The value of `x` is assigned the length of `item`. Since `item` is the third string in `l1`, `x` will be the length of that string. Other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l1` is a list of strings with at least 3 strings, `item` is the third string in `l1`, `x` is the length of `item`, `res` is updated based on computations involving `item`, `i` is 2, `j` is -1, `mod` is the modulus used in calculations, and `ans` is updated by adding `arr[1] * res`.
