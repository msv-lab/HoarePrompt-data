According to the code, the loop iterates with the variable `j` starting from `i - 1` down to `0`. The execution of the loop depends on the value of `j`. At the end of the last iteration, `res` has been updated based on the previous value of `res` and the current item in `l1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is currently at `i - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be decremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `j` will be `j - 1`, which is `i - 2`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is greater than or equal to `0`.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted accordingly. 

State: **`res` is updated with the value calculated from `(previous res + int(item[x - 1]) * 10) % mod`, for the loop to execute one more time `j` is `i - 2`, and `j` must be greater than or equal to 0.**
