Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l1` is a list of strings with at least 3 strings, `item` is the third string in `l1`, `x` is the length of `item`, `res` is the cumulative computed value based on the characters in `item`, `ans` is updated after all iterations of `i` from 1 to 10, and `i` is 1. If `arr[0]` is 0, the program continues to the next iteration without any changes to `res` or `ans`.***
