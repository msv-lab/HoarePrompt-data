The value of `x` is decremented by 1, which means that `x` is now one less than its previous value. The other variables (`n`, `l1`, `item`, `i`, `ans`, `j`, and `res`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings, `item` is the second string in `l1`, `x` is now one less than its previous value, `i` is 0, `ans` remains unchanged, `j` is 2, and `res` is updated based on the formula with `item[j]`, `x`, and `i`.
