The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is updated to `zs[i] + 1`; `ts`, `i`, and `us` remain unchanged; `us[i]` is increased by `ts[x - 1]` and then `x` is modified by `x -= x & -x`, resulting in a new value of `x`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
