To determine the output state, we analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet.

Initial State: 
- `x` is updated to `zs[i] + 1`
- `us[i]` remains unchanged
- `i` is `len(xs) - 3`

When the code `us[i] += ts[x - 1]` is executed, it modifies the value of `us[i]` by adding the value from `ts` at the index `x - 1`.

1. The variable `x` has been updated to `zs[i] + 1`, which is a specific value based on the current `i`.
2. The value from `ts` at index `x - 1` is used to update `us[i]`.
3. The operation modifies `us[i]`, while `us` was previously unchanged.

Thus, the state of the variables changes as follows:
- `us[i]` is updated with the addition of `ts[x - 1]`.

Since we do not have the specific values of `zs`, `ts`, or `us`, we only know that:

- `x` is `zs[i] + 1` (a specific value)
- `us[i]` is incremented by `ts[x - 1]` (the result of `ts` at the updated index).

Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `us[i]`:

Output State: **`us[i]` is updated by adding `ts[x - 1]`, `x` is `zs[i] + 1`, `i` is `len(xs) - 3`.**
