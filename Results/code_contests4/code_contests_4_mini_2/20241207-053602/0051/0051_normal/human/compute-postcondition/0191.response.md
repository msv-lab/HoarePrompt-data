The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is 2, so after execution, `j` becomes 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings, `item` is the second string in `l1`, `ans` is the accumulated result based on the calculations, `x` is the length of `item` minus 4, `j` is 3, and `res` is updated based on the formula.
