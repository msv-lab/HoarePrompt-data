The code `x -= 1` decrements the value of `x` by 1. The value of `x` is currently the length of `item`, which is greater than 1 (i.e., `x > 1`). Therefore, after executing this line, `x` will be `x - 1`, which is still a positive integer (since `x` was greater than 1). The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l1` is a list of strings with at least 3 strings, `item` is the third string in `l1`, `x` is greater than 1 and now is decremented by 1, `res` is 0, `i` is 1.**
