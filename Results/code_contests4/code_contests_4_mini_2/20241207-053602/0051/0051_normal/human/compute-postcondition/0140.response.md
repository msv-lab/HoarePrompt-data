The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is 2, so after execution, `j` becomes 3. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 1 string; `item` is the first string in `l1` with length `x`; `res` is adjusted as per the calculation; `i` is `x + 1`; `j` is 3; `x` is now decremented by 1.
