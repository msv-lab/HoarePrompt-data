To determine the output state, we first analyze the code snippet provided. 

1. The variable `ans` is being updated with the expression `ans + arr[i - 1] * res`.
2. We know that `i` is equal to the length of `item`, which means `i - 1` refers to the last index of the array `arr`.
3. `res` has been updated with the final accumulated value calculated from all characters in `item`.
4. As a result, `arr[i - 1]` will access the last element of `arr`, and we will multiply it by `res` and add that product to `ans`.

Now, we summarize the values and the computations:

- `ans` is updated based on the previous value of `ans`, the last element of `arr`, and the value of `res`.
- The specific values of `ans`, `arr`, and `res` are not provided, so we cannot compute an exact numerical output, but we can describe the relationship.

Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`ans` is updated with the value `ans + arr[i - 1] * res`, where `i` is the length of `item`, `j` is -1, `item` is the second string in `l1`, and `x` is the length of `item`.**
