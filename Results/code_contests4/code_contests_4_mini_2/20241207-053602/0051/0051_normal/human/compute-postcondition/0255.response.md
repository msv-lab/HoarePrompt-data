The statement `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables, but it will affect the flow of the program by preventing any following code within the loop from executing for the current iteration. 

Since the initial values of `n`, `l1`, `item`, `x`, `res`, `i`, `ans`, and `j` are not modified by this statement, we will simply state that we continue to the next iteration of the loop. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings, `item` is the second string in `l1`, `x` is the length of `item`, `res` is updated based on all characters of `item` and `mod`, `i` is 2, `ans` is updated with the value `ans + arr[i - 1] * res`, `j` is -1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings, `item` is the second string in `l1`, `x` is the length of `item`, `res` is updated based on all characters of `item` and `mod`, `i` is 2, `ans` is updated with the value `ans + arr[i - 1] * res`, `j` is -1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
