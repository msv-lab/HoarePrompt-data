Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100000. If `s[i]` is greater than or equal to `b'0'[0]`, then `A` is set to [0], `numb` is `s[i] - 48`, `sign` remains 1, and `i` is now 1. Otherwise, if `s[i]` is equal to `b'-'[0]`, then `sign` is set to -1. If `s[i]` is not equal to `b'\r'[0]`, `A` is updated to [0, 0], `numb` remains 0, `sign` remains 1, and `i` is now 1.***
