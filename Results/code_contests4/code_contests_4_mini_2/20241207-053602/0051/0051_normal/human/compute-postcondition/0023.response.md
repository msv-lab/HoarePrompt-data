The value of `sign` is changed from its previous value of 1 to -1. The values of the other variables (`n`, `s[i]`, `A`, `numb`, `i`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100000; `s[i]` is processed but remains undefined; `A` is set to [0]; `numb` is zero; `sign` is -1; `i` is now 1.
