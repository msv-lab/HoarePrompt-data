The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `zero`. `zero` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq zero \leq 100000\). The function returns a list `A` containing integers that are extracted from the input `zero`, which includes a 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a positive integer `zero` and return a list of integers, including a 0, extracted from the input. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `zero` and returns a list of integers, including 0, extracted from the input.**
