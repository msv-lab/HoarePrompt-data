You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: This problem differs from the previous one only in the absence of the constraint on the equal length of all numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.

A team of SIS students is going to make a trip on a submarine. Their target is an ancient treasure in a sunken ship lying on the bottom of the Great Rybinsk sea. Unfortunately, the students don't know the coordinates of the ship, so they asked Meshanya (who is a hereditary mage) to help them. He agreed to help them, but only if they solve his problem.

Let's denote a function that alternates digits of two numbers f(a_1 a_2 ... a_{p - 1} a_p, b_1 b_2 ... b_{q - 1} b_q), where a_1 ... a_p and b_1 ... b_q are digits of two integers written in the decimal notation without leading zeros.

In other words, the function f(x, y) alternately shuffles the digits of the numbers x and y by writing them from the lowest digits to the older ones, starting with the number y. The result of the function is also built from right to left (that is, from the lower digits to the older ones). If the digits of one of the arguments have ended, then the remaining digits of the other argument are written out. Familiarize with examples and formal definitions of the function below.

For example: $$$f(1111, 2222) = 12121212 f(7777, 888) = 7787878 f(33, 44444) = 4443434 f(555, 6) = 5556 f(111, 2222) = 2121212$$$

Formally,

  * if p ≥ q then f(a_1 ... a_p, b_1 ... b_q) = a_1 a_2 ... a_{p - q + 1} b_1 a_{p - q + 2} b_2 ... a_{p - 1} b_{q - 1} a_p b_q; 
  * if p < q then f(a_1 ... a_p, b_1 ... b_q) = b_1 b_2 ... b_{q - p} a_1 b_{q - p + 1} a_2 ... a_{p - 1} b_{q - 1} a_p b_q. 



Mishanya gives you an array consisting of n integers a_i, your task is to help students to calculate ∑_{i = 1}^{n}∑_{j = 1}^{n} f(a_i, a_j) modulo 998 244 353.

Output

Print the answer modulo 998 244 353.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` from user input, reads `n` strings, and calculates a result based on the lengths of these strings and their character values. It counts the number of strings of different lengths (up to 10), and for each string, it performs a series of calculations involving modular exponentiation and accumulates a final result, which it prints. The function does not return a value but outputs the computed result directly.

#Function 2:

    return res
    #The program returns the result of the modular exponentiation of x raised to the value of 0 modulo p, which is 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: `x`, `y`, and `p`. It performs modular exponentiation to compute (x^y) mod p. If y is 0, it returns 1, which is consistent with the mathematical rule that any number raised to the power of 0 equals 1. Otherwise, it returns the result of x raised to the power of y modulo p. The function efficiently computes the result using an iterative method that reduces the exponent y by half in each iteration.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `xs` and returns a list of cumulative sums based on the counts of unique integers in `xs`. The cumulative sums are calculated in a manner that accounts for the frequencies of each unique integer, providing an updated count for each index in the original list. The function is designed to handle up to 100,000 integers, each ranging from 1 to 10^9.

The function processes the input to convert sequences of numeric characters into integers, handles negative signs, and concatenates the results into the list `A`. It also includes the last number processed if the input ends with a digit. If the input is empty, the function will return an empty list.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
