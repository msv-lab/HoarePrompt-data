The function accepts three parameters: `x`, `y`, and `p`. It performs modular exponentiation to compute (x^y) mod p. If y is 0, it returns 1, which is consistent with the mathematical rule that any number raised to the power of 0 equals 1. Otherwise, it returns the result of x raised to the power of y modulo p. The function efficiently computes the result using an iterative method that reduces the exponent y by half in each iteration.
