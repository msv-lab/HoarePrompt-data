The function accepts a positive integer `n` from user input, reads `n` strings, and calculates a result based on the lengths of these strings and their character values. It counts the number of strings of different lengths (up to 10), and for each string, it performs a series of calculations involving modular exponentiation and accumulates a final result, which it prints. The function does not return a value but outputs the computed result directly.
