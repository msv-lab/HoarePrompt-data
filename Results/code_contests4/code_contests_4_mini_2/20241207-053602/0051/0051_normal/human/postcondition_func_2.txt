The function accepts a list of integers `xs` and returns a list of cumulative sums based on the counts of unique integers in `xs`. The cumulative sums are calculated in a manner that accounts for the frequencies of each unique integer, providing an updated count for each index in the original list. The function is designed to handle up to 100,000 integers, each ranging from 1 to 10^9.
