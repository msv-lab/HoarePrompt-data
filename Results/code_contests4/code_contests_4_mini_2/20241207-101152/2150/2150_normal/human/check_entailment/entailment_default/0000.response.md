To determine the correctness of the provided code based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the output hints carefully.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to determine the maximum possible number of edges that can be removed from a tree such that all remaining connected components have even sizes. If it's impossible to achieve this, the output should be -1.

### Function Analysis:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function performs a breadth-first traversal to count unique vertices starting from a given vertex `a`. 
   - The output hints suggest that it does not validate edges or vertex references, which could lead to inaccuracies if the edges do not represent a connected tree, but since the problem guarantees a tree, this flaw does not impact the overall functionality.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function computes the size of the subtree rooted at a given node. It handles the case of already seen nodes appropriately by returning 0.
   - The function accumulates the sizes of subtrees and checks if the sizes of the connected components formed by removing edges can be even.

### Observations:
- The first function does not directly contribute to the solution of counting removable edges but is part of the tree structure management. The second function is critical for determining subtree sizes.
- There is a check at the beginning of the second function that directly addresses the case where `n` (the number of vertices) is odd by returning -1 immediately. This is crucial because if the total number of vertices is odd, it is impossible to split the tree into even-sized components.
- The logic that counts the removable edges is structured correctly by checking the sizes of subtrees.

### Output Hints Validation:
- The hints for `func_1` mention that it counts unique vertices but lack direct relevance to the edge removal logic.
- The hints for `func_2` accurately describe its role in calculating subtree sizes, and the assumption about already visited nodes is valid.

### Edge Cases:
The immediate edge case where `n` is odd is handled correctly by returning -1. However, it's essential to also consider if there are cases where the code might incorrectly count edges.

1. **Case with n = 2**: The tree will consist of only one edge (1-2). The function should return 0 since no edges can be removed while keeping the components even-sized.
2. **Case with n = 4**: The hints indicate that the function can successfully find one removable edge, which is correct as removing one edge will create two components of size 2 each.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem as described, handles the edge cases appropriately, and does not exhibit flaws in the logic that would lead to incorrect results.

Correctness: **True**. 

The code successfully determines the maximum number of edges that can be removed while ensuring all remaining components are of even size, adhering to the problem description across all potential cases.
