Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the given problem description. Here are the reasons why:

1. **Function Purpose Misalignment**: The problem requires a function that determines the maximum number of edges that can be removed while ensuring all remaining components have even sizes. However, the program includes two functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) which do not directly address this requirement.

2. **Missing Logic for Edge Removal**: The logic for calculating which edges can be removed to leave all components with even sizes is not present. The program only provides functions that seem to traverse the tree and count nodes but doesn't compute or return the number of removable edges.

3. **Incorrect Use of Data Structures**: The use of `deque` in `func_1` and the variable `seen` is not correctly set up to track visited nodes. The variable `E` (presumably representing edges) is used without initialization or population, which indicates a lack of proper setup for the tree structure.

4. **Incompleteness**: There is no final return statement in either function that could yield the required output (maximum edges removed or -1 if impossible). The functions return sizes of components or counts of unique nodes but do not translate that into a count of removable edges.

5. **Tree Characteristics**: The program does not account for the tree's properties, such as the requirement that for any edge removal, the resulting components should contain an even number of vertices. The overall logic should involve checking the sizes of subtrees and ensuring that they are even, which is not reflected in the code.

In summary, the program fails to implement the necessary logic to solve the problem as described. It does not provide a mechanism to determine the maximum removable edges while ensuring all components remain of even size. Therefore, it does not satisfy the problem requirements, resulting in a determination of incorrectness.
