To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the given problem description and annotations, we need to analyze the program's logic and how it adheres to the requirements of the task.

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to determine the maximum number of edges that can be removed from a tree such that all remaining connected components have even sizes. If such a configuration is impossible, the function should return -1.

### Annotations Summarized
1. **Function 1**:
   - Performs a breadth-first traversal to count unique vertices in the tree.
   - It does not directly contribute to solving the specific problem of edge removal for even-sized components.

2. **Function 2**:
   - Recursively calculates the size of subtrees.
   - It also keeps track of visited nodes to avoid counting them multiple times.
   - The function returns the size of the subtree rooted at a given node.

### Analysis of the Code Logic
- The provided functions focus on traversing the tree and counting vertices and sizes of subtrees. However, they do not implement any logic to evaluate whether edges can be removed while ensuring that the sizes of the remaining components are even.

### Key Points of Failure
1. **Edge Removal Logic**: The code lacks any mechanism to evaluate which edges can be removed while checking the sizes of the resulting components.
2. **Handling of Odd-Sized Trees**: If the total number of vertices `n` is odd, it's impossible to have all components of even size after any number of removals. The program does not check this case explicitly and would likely fail to return -1 when appropriate.
3. **Count of Removable Edges**: There is no logic to determine the maximum number of edges that can be removed while maintaining the even size constraint.

### Examples from the Problem Description
- For `n = 3` (an odd-sized tree), the program should return -1, but it does not seem to handle this case correctly as implied by the annotations.
- For `n = 4`, the program should remove one edge to achieve two components of size 2; again, the current implementation does not provide a mechanism for this.

### Conclusion
The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to implement the necessary logic to check the conditions for edge removal and does not handle odd-sized trees correctly.

Thus, the evaluation of the program's correctness is as follows:

Correctness: **False**

The program lacks the complete logic required to solve the problem as specified, particularly in handling edge removals and odd-sized trees.
