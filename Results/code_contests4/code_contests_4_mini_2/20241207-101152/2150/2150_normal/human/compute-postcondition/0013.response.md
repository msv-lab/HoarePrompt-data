Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree; `node` is printed and its value is not in the `seen` set; `sz[node]` is increased by the return value of `func_2(neigh)`; for the loop to execute one more time, `E[node]` must contain at least 2 neighbors, and `neigh` must be the next neighbor in the list of neighbors of `node`; `neigh` is printed.**
