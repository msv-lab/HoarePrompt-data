The value of `b` is appended to the list `Q`. The previous state indicates that `Q` was not empty (since `cnt` was incremented), and `b` is the first element in `E[a]`. The other variables (`cnt`, `seen`, and `a`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the inclusion of `b` in `Q`.

Output State: **`a` is the first element removed from `Q`, `cnt` is incremented by 1, `cnt` was decremented by 1 if `Q` was not empty, `seen` now includes the element `a`, `b` is the first element in `E[a]`, and `b` is appended to `Q`.**
