The value of `b` is appended to the list `Q`. The previous state indicates that `cnt` has been incremented by 1, `seen` includes element `a`, and `b` is already defined as the second element in `E[a]`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `cnt` has been incremented by 1, `seen` includes element `a`, `b` is the second element in `E[a]`, and `b` is appended to `Q`.

Output State: **`cnt` has been incremented by 1, `seen` includes element `a`, `b` is the second element in `E[a]`, and `b` is appended to `Q.**
