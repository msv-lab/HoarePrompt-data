The value of `sz[node]` is assigned 1, indicating that the size of the subtree rooted at the node is set to 1. The previous value of `sz[node]` is not specified, but since `node` is printed and its value is not in the `seen` set, we can conclude that `sz[node]` is now initialized. The states of the other variables (`n`, `seen`, etc.) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State reflects the assignment and the initialization of `sz[node]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000); `node` is printed and its value is not in the `seen` set; `sz[node]` is 1.**
