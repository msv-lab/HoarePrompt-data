According to the code, the loop continues as long as `Q` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `Q` includes all elements in `E[a]`, which means `Q` may or may not be empty depending on the contents of `E[a]`. 

Since `a` is the first element removed from `Q`, and `b` is each element in `E[a]` that has been appended to `Q`, for the loop to execute one more time, `Q` must contain at least one element after the previous iteration.

To ensure that `Q` is not empty, we need to adjust the state of `Q` to include at least one more element. Therefore, we need to ensure that `E[a]` contains at least one element that can be appended to `Q`.

State: **`a` is the first element removed from `Q`, `cnt` is incremented by the number of elements in `E[a]`, `seen` now includes the element `a`, `b` is each element in `E[a]` that has been appended to `Q`, and for the loop to execute again `Q` must include at least one more element from E[a]**
