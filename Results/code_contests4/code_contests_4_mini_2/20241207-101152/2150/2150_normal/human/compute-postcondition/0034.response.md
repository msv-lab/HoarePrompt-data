Postcondition: ***`cnt` is incremented by the number of elements in `E[a]`, `seen` now includes the element `a`, `b` is each element in `E[a]` that has been appended to `Q`, and `a` is the first element removed from `Q`. If `a` is already in `seen`, the program continues to the next iteration without executing further code in the current loop.***
