Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `a` representing the number of vertices in a tree and a list `b` of tuples representing edges between these vertices. It performs a breadth-first traversal of the tree to count and return the total number of unique vertices encountered. The code does not account for any missing edges or invalid vertex references in the adjacency representation, which may lead to potential inaccuracies in the count if the edges do not represent a connected tree. Additionally, the function assumes that the edges are correctly defined and that every vertex from 1 to `n` is reachable from the starting vertex.**
