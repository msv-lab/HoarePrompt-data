Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `node` representing a vertex in a tree and returns the size of the subtree rooted at `node`, including the node itself. If the `node` has already been seen (visited), it returns 0. If the node has no neighbors, it will still calculate the size of the subtree by recursively visiting all its neighbors, accumulating their sizes. This function is primarily used to determine the size of connected components in a tree structure. **
