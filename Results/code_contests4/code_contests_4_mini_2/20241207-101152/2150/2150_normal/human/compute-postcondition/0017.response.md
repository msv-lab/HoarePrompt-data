The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `node`. `node` is an integer representing a vertex in a tree structure. If the `node` has no neighbors, the function returns 0. If the `node` has neighbors, the function returns the size `sz[node]`, which is increased by the cumulative return value of `func_2(neigh)` for all neighbors in `E[node]`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept an integer `node` representing a vertex in a tree and return either 0 if the node has no neighbors or the size of the node calculated by the cumulative sizes of its neighboring nodes. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter node representing a vertex in a tree. It returns 0 if the node has no neighbors; otherwise, it returns the size of the node increased by the cumulative size of its neighboring nodes.**
