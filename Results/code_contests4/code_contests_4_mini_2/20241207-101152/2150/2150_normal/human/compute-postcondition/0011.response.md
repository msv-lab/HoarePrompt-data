The code `sz[node] += func_2(neigh)` updates the size of the current node by adding the return value of the function `func_2` when called with the neighbor `neigh`. The value of `sz[node]` is increased based on the output of `func_2(neigh)`, which is dependent on the execution of that function. The variable `node` is already defined and its size is being updated. 

Since the initial state indicates that `node` is printed and its value is not in the `seen` set, and `neigh` is also printed, we can conclude that the `func_2(neigh)` call will return some integer value, which will be added to `sz[node]`.

However, since we do not have the specific return value of `func_2(neigh)`, we cannot determine the exact new value of `sz[node]`. We can only state that `sz[node]` is increased by the return value of `func_2(neigh)`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree; `node` is printed and its value is not in the `seen` set; `sz[node]` is increased by the return value of `func_2(neigh)`; `E[node]` contains at least 1 neighbor; `neigh` is printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree; `node` is printed and its value is not in the `seen` set; `sz[node]` is increased by the return value of `func_2(neigh)`; `E[node]` contains at least 1 neighbor; `neigh` is printed.**
