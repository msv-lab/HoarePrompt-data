The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. Parameter `a` is an integer representing the number of vertices in a tree, constrained to the range \(1 \leq a \leq 100,000\). Parameter `b` is a list of \(n-1\) tuples, where each tuple represents an edge between vertices \(u\) and \(v\) with constraints \(1 \leq u, v \leq n\). After executing the function body, it returns the total number of unique elements encountered from the initial empty queue `Q`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `a` representing the number of vertices in a tree and a list `b` of tuples representing edges between these vertices. It returns the total number of unique elements encountered from the initial empty queue `Q`.**
