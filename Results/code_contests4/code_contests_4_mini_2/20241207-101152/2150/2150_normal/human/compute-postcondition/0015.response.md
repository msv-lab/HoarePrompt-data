Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree; `node` is printed and its value is not in the `seen` set; `sz[node]` is increased by the cumulative return value of `func_2(neigh)` for all neighbors in `E[node]`; `E[node]` contains all neighbors of `node`; `neigh` is the last neighbor printed.**
