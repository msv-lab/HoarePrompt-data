According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `E[a]`. For the loop to execute, `E[a]` must contain at least one element. Before the loop starts, `cnt` has been incremented by 1 and `seen` includes the element `a`, which does not provide information about the state of `E[a]`. 

Therefore, for the loop to be executed the first time, `E[a]` must not be empty, and `b` should be the first element in `E[a]`. 

State: **`cnt` is incremented by 1, `seen` includes element `a`, for the loop to execute the first time `E[a]` is not empty and `b` is the first element in `E[a]`**.
