`g` is assigned the value of `g + str(s)`, which means the string representation of the even integer `s` is concatenated to the existing value of `g`. The variable `b` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an even integer, `b` is an input odd integer, `g` is updated to include the string representation of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is an even integer, `b` is an input odd integer, `g` is updated to include the string representation of `s`**
