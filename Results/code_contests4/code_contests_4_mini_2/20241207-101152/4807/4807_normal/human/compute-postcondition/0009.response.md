In this scenario, `s` is assigned the value of `b`, and we are decrementing `s` by 1. Since `b` is an even integer greater than 1, `s` will be at least 2. Thus, after executing the line `s = s - 1`, the value of `s` will decrease by 1. 

The other variables `t`, `i`, and `g` are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `i` is 0; `s` is `b - 1`; `g` is the string representation of `b`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `i` is 0; `s` is `b - 1`; `g` is the string representation of `b`**.
