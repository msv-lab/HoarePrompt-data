The value of `g` is modified by concatenating a space character to its end. Since `g` is the string representation of the even integer `s`, the resulting value of `g` will be the string representation of `s` followed by a space. The values of the other variables (`s`, `t`, `i`, and `a`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an even integer greater than 1, `g` is the string representation of that even integer followed by a space, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `i` is 1, `a` is greater than 1.

Output State: **`s` is an even integer greater than 1, `g` is the string representation of that even integer followed by a space, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `i` is 1, `a` is greater than 1**
