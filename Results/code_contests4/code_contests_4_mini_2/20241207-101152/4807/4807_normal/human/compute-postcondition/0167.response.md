The code concatenates a space character to the string variable `g`. The previous value of `g` was updated by concatenating the string representation of the previous odd integer value of `s`, and this value remains unchanged as only a space is added. The values of `s` and `b` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an even integer, `g` is the previous value concatenated with a space, `b` is an odd integer.

Output State: **`s` is an even integer, `g` is the previous value concatenated with a space, `b` is an odd integer**
