The variable `g` is assigned the value of itself concatenated with the string representation of `s`. Since `g` is currently the string representation of the even integer `s` followed by a space, the new value of `g` will be that same string representation of `s` followed by a space and then followed by the string representation of `s` again. Thus, `g` will now contain the string representation of `s`, a space, and then another string representation of `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is an even integer greater than 1, `g` is the string representation of `s` followed by a space followed by the string representation of `s`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `i` is 1, `a` is greater than 1**
