The code `g = g + ' '` appends a space to the end of the string `g`. The previous value of `g` is the string representation of `s` followed by a space and then again the string representation of `s`. Therefore, after executing this line of code, `g` will now have an additional space at the end.

Since no other variables are affected, the output state is:
`s` is an odd integer greater than 1, `g` is the string representation of the previous value of `s` followed by a space followed by the string representation of the previous value of `s` with an additional space at the end, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `i` is 1, `a` is greater than 1, and for the loop to execute again, `b` must be even.

Output State: **`s` is an odd integer greater than 1, `g` is the string representation of the previous value of `s` followed by a space followed by the string representation of the previous value of `s` with an additional space at the end, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `i` is 1, `a` is greater than 1, and for the loop to execute again, `b` must be even.**
