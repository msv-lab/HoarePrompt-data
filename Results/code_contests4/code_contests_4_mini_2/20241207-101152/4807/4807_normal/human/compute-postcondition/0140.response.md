The value of `s` is decremented by 1. Since `s` is an input odd integer greater than 1, the new value of `s` will be even (as subtracting 1 from an odd number results in an even number). The value of `b` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an even integer (previously an odd integer greater than 1), `b` is an input odd integer.

Output State: **`s` is an even integer (previously an odd integer greater than 1), `b` is an input odd integer**
