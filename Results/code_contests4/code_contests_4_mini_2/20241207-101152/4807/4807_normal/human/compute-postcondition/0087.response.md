The value of `s` is decremented by 2. Since `s` is at least 1, this means that after the operation, `s` will be at least -1. The other variables `b` and `g` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is at least -1, `b` is odd, `g` is the original value of `g` followed by str(s) after the update.

Output State: **`s` is at least -1, `b` is odd, `g` is the original value of `g` followed by str(s)**
