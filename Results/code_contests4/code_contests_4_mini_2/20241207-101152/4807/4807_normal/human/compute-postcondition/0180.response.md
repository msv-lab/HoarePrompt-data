Output State: **`i` is equal to `a`, `s` is less than or equal to 0 after the last iteration, `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `g` contains the string representation of the last input value `b` followed by all decremented values until `s` reaches 0, with spaces separating the numbers, and each value of `b` had been processed up to `a` times.**
