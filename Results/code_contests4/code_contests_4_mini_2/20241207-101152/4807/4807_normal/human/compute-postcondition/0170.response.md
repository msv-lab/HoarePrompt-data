The value of `g` is updated by concatenating the string representation of `s` to the current value of `g`, which already ends with a space. Since `s` is an even integer, its string representation will be added to `g`, maintaining the space at the end. The values of `s` and `b` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is an even integer, `g` is the previous value concatenated with a space and the string representation of `s`, `b` is an odd integer.

Output State: **`s` is an even integer, `g` is the previous value concatenated with a space and the string representation of `s`, `b` is an odd integer**
