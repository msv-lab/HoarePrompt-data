The value of `g` is updated by concatenating the string representation of `s` to its current value. Since `s` is greater than 1 after decrement, `str(s)` will be a string representation of a value greater than 1. The initial state of `g` is not specified, but it will now include the value of `s` as a string. The other variables (`t`, `i`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `i` is 0; `s` is greater than 1 after decrement; `g` is updated to include the string representation of `s`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `i` is 0; `s` is greater than 1 after decrement; `g` is updated to include the string representation of `s`.**
