The variable `g` is being concatenated with a space character `' '`. However, the initial state does not provide the value of `g`, so we cannot determine its previous value. The other variables `t`, `i`, and `s` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `g` has been modified by appending a space.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `i` is 0; `s` is `b - 2`; `g` is modified by concatenating a space character.**
