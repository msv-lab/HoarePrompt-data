The function `func` does not take any parameters directly but operates based on the constraints provided. It processes multiple test cases, where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, constrained by 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, there is an integer `n`, constrained by 2 ≤ n ≤ 100. The function generates results based on these constraints and returns appropriate outputs for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases defined by t, where for each test case it operates on an integer n, returning results based on the values of t and n within the specified constraints.**
