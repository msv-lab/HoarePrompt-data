To analyze the given code snippet, we start with the initial state where `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `s` is greater than 1 and has been decremented by 1, and `s` is equal to `b // 2 + 1`. The variable `g` has been incremented by a space (' ').

Now, we assign `g` the value of `g + str(s - 1)`. 

1. The value of `s` is greater than 1, and since it has been decremented by 1, `s - 1` is at least 1.
2. We convert `s - 1` to a string using `str(s - 1)`. Therefore, this will yield a string representation of the integer value of `s - 1`.
3. The existing value of `g` (which includes a space) will be concatenated with the string representation of `s - 1`.

The affected variables are `g` and `s`. The other variables `t` and `i` remain unchanged.

Considering that `s` was initially greater than 1 and has been decremented by 1, we can conclude that `s - 1` is at least 1. 

Thus, after executing the line `g = g + str(s - 1)`, the output state reflects the updates to `g` and the unchanged states of the other variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `i` is 0; `s` is greater than 1; `g` is updated to include the string representation of `s - 1`**.
