The variable `g` is updated to include the string representation of `s`, which means `g` will now contain the value of `g` concatenated with `str(s)`. The previous value of `g` is not specified, but it will be updated with the string representation of `s`. The variable `s` is greater than 1, so `str(s)` will be a string representing a number greater than 1. The state of `t` and `i` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `i` is 0; `s` is greater than 1; `g` is updated to include the string representation of `s`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `i` is 0; `s` is greater than 1; `g` is updated to include the string representation of `s`.**
