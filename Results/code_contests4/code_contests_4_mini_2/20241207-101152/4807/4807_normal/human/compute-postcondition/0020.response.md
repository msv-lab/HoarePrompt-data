Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `i` is 0; `s` is `b - k` (where `k` is the number of times the loop executed); `g` is the string representation of `b` followed by `k` spaces and the string representation of each decrementing value from `b - 1` to `b - k`. If `b` is odd or less than 2, the loop won't execute and `s` remains equal to `b`, and `g` is simply the string representation of `b`.**
