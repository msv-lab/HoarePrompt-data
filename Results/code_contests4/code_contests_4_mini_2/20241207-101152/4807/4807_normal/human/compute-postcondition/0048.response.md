The variable `s` is decremented by 1, meaning its new value is less than its previous value, which was greater than 1. The other variables `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The condition for the loop to execute again (that `b` must be odd) is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `i` is 0; `s` is greater than 1 after decrementing; and `b` must be odd for the loop to execute again.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `i` is 0; `s` is greater than 1 after decrement; and `b` must be odd for the loop to execute again.**
