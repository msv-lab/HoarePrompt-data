The variable `g` is assigned an empty string `''`. This means that the string representation of `b` and the decremented values until `s` reaches 0 will not be assigned to `g` in this step, but no other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is equal to `b`, `g` is now an empty string, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `i` is 1, `a` is greater than 1.

Output State: **`s` is equal to `b`, `g` is now an empty string, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `i` is 1, `a` is greater than 1.**
