In this code, `g` is incremented by the string representation of `s`. The value of `s` is an even integer, and `g` is previously incremented by a space character. Therefore, after executing the code, `g` will now include the string version of the even integer `s` appended to it.

The output state can be described as follows:
- `s` remains an even integer.
- `b` is an input odd integer.
- `g` is now the previous value of `g` (which included a space character) concatenated with the string representation of `s`.

Thus, the Output State is: `s` is an even integer, `b` is an input odd integer, `g` is incremented by the string representation of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is an even integer, `b` is an input odd integer, `g` is incremented by the string representation of `s`.**
