The variable `g` is assigned the value of its previous value concatenated with a space and the string representation of `s - 1`. Since `s` is an even integer, `s - 1` will be an odd integer. The previous value of `g` is concatenated with this new value. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an even integer, `g` is the previous value concatenated with a space and the string representation of `s - 1`, `b` is an odd integer.

Output State: **`s` is an even integer, `g` is the previous value concatenated with a space and the string representation of `s - 1`, `b` is an odd integer**
