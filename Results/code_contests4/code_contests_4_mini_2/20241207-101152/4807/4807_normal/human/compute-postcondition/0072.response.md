`The value of s` is decremented by 1. Since `s` is an even integer greater than 1, after execution, `s` will be an odd integer greater than 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an odd integer greater than 1, `g` is the string representation of the previous value of `s` followed by a space followed by the string representation of the previous value of `s`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `i` is 1, `a` is greater than 1, and for the loop to execute again, `b` must be even.

Output State: **`s` is an odd integer greater than 1, `g` is the string representation of the previous value of `s` followed by a space followed by the string representation of the previous value of `s`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `i` is 1, `a` is greater than 1, and for the loop to execute again, `b` must be even.**
