The variable `g` is assigned the value of `g + str(s)`. The initial value of `g` is the string representation of `b` followed by a space. The variable `s` is `b - 1`, which means `str(s)` will convert `s` to its string representation. Therefore, the final value of `g` will concatenate the original value of `g` with the string representation of `s`. The states of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `i` is 0; `s` is `b - 1`; `g` is the string representation of `b` followed by a space and then followed by the string representation of `s`.**
