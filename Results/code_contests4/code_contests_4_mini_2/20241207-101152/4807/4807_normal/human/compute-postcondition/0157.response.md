The code `g = g + ' '` concatenates a space to the current value of `g`. The initial state indicates that `g` is the string representation of `s` followed by a space. Therefore, after executing this line, `g` will now contain the same initial string representation of `s` followed by a space, and an additional space will be appended to it. The values of `s` and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is now an odd integer; `b` is an input odd integer; `g` is the string representation of `s` followed by two spaces.**
