The variable `g` is assigned the value of `g + str(s)`, which means that the string representation of `s` is appended to `g`. The value of `s` is greater than 1 after decrement (meaning `s` is at least 3), and `g` is unchanged prior to this operation. Other variables `t`, `i`, and `b` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `g` with the appended string representation of `s`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `i` is 0; `s` is greater than 1; `b` must be odd for the loop to execute again; `g` is updated with the string representation of `s**.
