The variable `g` is updated by concatenating it with the string representation of `s - 1`. Since `s` is greater than 1 after decrement, `s - 1` is guaranteed to be at least 1. The value of `g` will thus change based on its previous value. The other variables `t` and `i` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `g` after the concatenation operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `i` is 0; `s` is greater than 1 after decrement; `g` is updated to be concatenated with str(s - 1)**
