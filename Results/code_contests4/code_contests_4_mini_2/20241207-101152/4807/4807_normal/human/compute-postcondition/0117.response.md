The value of `g` is updated by concatenating it with the string representation of `s`. Since `s` is at least -1, `str(s)` can be either "-1" or a larger negative number or zero, and thus it will be a valid string. The value of `b` does not affect the operation. After execution, `g` will have the previous value of `g` followed by the string representation of `s`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is at least -1; `b` is odd; `g` is updated to include the string representation of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is at least -1; `b` is odd; `g` is updated to include the string representation of `s.**
