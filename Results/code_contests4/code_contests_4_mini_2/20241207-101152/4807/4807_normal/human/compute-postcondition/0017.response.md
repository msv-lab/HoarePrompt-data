The variable `s` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `s` was `b - 2`, so after executing the code, `s` becomes `b - 3`. The states of the other variables (`t`, `i`, and `b`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `i` is 0, and `s` is `b - 3`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `i` is 0, `s` is `b - 3`**
