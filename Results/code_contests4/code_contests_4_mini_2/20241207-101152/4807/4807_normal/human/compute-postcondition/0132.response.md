The variable `g` is assigned the value of `g` plus a space character `' '`. The previous value of `g` is its original value plus the string representation of the original `s`. Therefore, the new value of `g` will be the original value of `g` concatenated with a space character. The values of `s` and `b` remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`s` is now an odd integer greater than 0; `b` is an even integer; `g` holds its original value plus the string representation of the original `s` followed by a space.**
