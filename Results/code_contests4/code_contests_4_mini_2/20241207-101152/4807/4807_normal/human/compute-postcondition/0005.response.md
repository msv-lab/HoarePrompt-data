The variable `s` is assigned the value of `b`. The variable `b` is an input integer, but its specific value is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects that `s` takes on the value of `b`. Other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `i` is 0; `b` is an input integer; `s` is assigned the value of `b`.**
