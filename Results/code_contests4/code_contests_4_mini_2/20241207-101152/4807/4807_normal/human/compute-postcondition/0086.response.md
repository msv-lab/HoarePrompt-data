In the given code, `g` is assigned the value of `g + str(s)`. The variable `s` has a value of at least 1, and `g` is currently increased by a space character. This means that `g` has a string value that starts with a space. 

To evaluate the new value of `g`, we will convert `s` to a string using `str(s)`, which will result in a string representation of `s`. 

The impact of the code is that `g` will now hold the original value of `g` (which includes the space character) followed by the string representation of `s`. 

Thus, the output state will reflect the updated value of `g` combined with the original state of `s` and `b`.

Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `b` is odd, `g` is the original value of `g` (including a space) followed by str(s)**
