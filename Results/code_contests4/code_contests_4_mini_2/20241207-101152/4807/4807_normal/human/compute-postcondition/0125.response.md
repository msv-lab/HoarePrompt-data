The value of `g` is updated by concatenating it with the string representation of `b`. Since `g` is initially an empty string and `b` is an input odd integer, after execution, `g` will hold the string representation of that odd integer. The other variables, `s` and `a`, remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an input odd integer, `b` is an input odd integer, `g` is the string representation of the input odd integer `b`, `a` must be greater than `i` for the loop to execute again.

Output State: **`s` is an input odd integer, `b` is an input odd integer, `g` is the string representation of `b`, `a` must be greater than `i` for the loop to execute again.**
