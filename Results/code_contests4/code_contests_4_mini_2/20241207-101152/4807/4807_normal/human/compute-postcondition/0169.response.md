The value of `g` is concatenated with a space, but the previous value of `g` is unknown. The values of `s` and `b` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an even integer, `g` is the previous value concatenated with a space, `b` is an odd integer, and `g` is now updated to include an additional space at the end.

Output State: **`s` is an even integer, `g` is the previous value concatenated with a space, `b` is an odd integer, and `g` is now updated to include an additional space at the end.**
