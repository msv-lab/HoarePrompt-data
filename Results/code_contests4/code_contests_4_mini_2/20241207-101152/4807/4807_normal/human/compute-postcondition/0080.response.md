To determine whether the `while` loop can execute, we need to analyze the conditions specified in the loop statement:

```
while s - 1 > 0 and b % 2 == 1:
```

1. The first condition, `s - 1 > 0`, simplifies to `s > 1`. Given that `s` is currently 1, this condition is **not satisfied**, meaning the loop cannot execute based on this condition alone.

2. The second condition, `b % 2 == 1`, checks if `b` is odd. Since it is stated that `b` is even, this condition is also **not satisfied**.

For the loop to execute at least once, both conditions must be satisfied:
- The value of `s` must be adjusted to be greater than 1 (i.e., `s` should be at least 2).
- The value of `b` must be adjusted to be an odd number (i.e., `b` must be changed).

Thus, the necessary adjustments to the program state right before the loop are:
- Increase `s` to at least 2.
- Change `b` to an odd integer.

State: **`s` is at least 2, `b` is odd**
