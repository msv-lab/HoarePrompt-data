The variable `i` is assigned the value 0. The previous values of the affected variables do not change, so `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 100, and `a` is an integer from input. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `a` is an integer from input; `i` is 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `a` is an integer from input; `i` is 0**
