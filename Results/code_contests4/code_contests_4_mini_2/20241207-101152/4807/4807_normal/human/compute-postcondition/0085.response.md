The code `g = g + ' '` appends a space character to the current value of `g`. The variable `g` is increased by the string representation of `s - 1` in the initial state, but this operation does not affect the current operation of adding a space. The value of `s` being at least 1 and `b` being odd does not influence the current operation either. Therefore, the output state reflects that a space has been added to `g`.

Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `b` is odd, `g` is increased by a space character.**
