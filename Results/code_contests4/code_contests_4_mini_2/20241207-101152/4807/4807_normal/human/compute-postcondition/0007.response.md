In the given code snippet, `g` is assigned the value of `g + str(b)`. The initial value of `g` is an empty string, and `b` is an input integer. 

1. `g` starts as an empty string (`""`).
2. The value of `b` is converted to a string using `str(b)`.
3. The result of the operation `g + str(b)` concatenates the empty string with the string representation of `b`.

Since `g` is initially an empty string, after the concatenation, `g` will now hold the string value of `b`.

Therefore, the output state will indicate that `g` is now equal to the string representation of `b`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `i` is 0; `b` is an input integer; `s` is assigned the value of `b`; `g` is the string representation of `b`**.
