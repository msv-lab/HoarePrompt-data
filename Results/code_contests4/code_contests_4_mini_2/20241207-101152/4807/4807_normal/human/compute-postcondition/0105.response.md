In this code, `g` is assigned the value of `g + str(s)`, where `str(s)` converts the value of `s` to a string and concatenates it to the existing value of `g`. The value of `s` is at least 0, and `g` is currently increased by one space. The previous state of `g` will determine the new state after concatenation. 

Assuming `g` initially had one space, after the operation `g` will be changed to include the string representation of `s` appended to that space. 

The states of `s` and `b` remain unchanged, but `g` will now include the string version of `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is at least 0, `b` is odd, and `g` now contains its previous value plus the string of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is at least 0, `b` is odd, `g` is increased by the string representation of `s`**
