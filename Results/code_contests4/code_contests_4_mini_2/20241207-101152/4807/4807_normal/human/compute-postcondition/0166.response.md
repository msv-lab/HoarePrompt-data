The value of `s` is decremented by 1. Since `s` is an odd integer greater than 1, the result of `s - 1` will be an even integer. The values of `g` and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an odd integer greater than 1 (now decremented to an even integer), `g` is the updated string representation of the previous value of `s`, and `b` is an odd integer to allow the loop to execute again.

Output State: **`s` is an even integer, `g` is updated by concatenating the string representation of the previous odd integer value of `s`, `b` is an odd integer**.
