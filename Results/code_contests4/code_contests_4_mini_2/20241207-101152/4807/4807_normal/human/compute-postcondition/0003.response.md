According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If `i` is less than `a`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is 0. Since `a` is an integer from input, we need to ensure that `a` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once. Therefore, `a` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `a` must be greater than 0**
