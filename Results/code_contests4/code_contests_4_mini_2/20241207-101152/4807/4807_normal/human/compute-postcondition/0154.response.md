The value of `s` is decremented by 1. Since `s` is initially an even integer, after the operation, `s` becomes an odd integer. The values of `b` and `g` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is now an odd integer, `b` is an input odd integer, `g` is incremented by the string representation of the initial value of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is now an odd integer, `b` is an input odd integer, `g` is incremented by the string representation of the initial value of `s`**
