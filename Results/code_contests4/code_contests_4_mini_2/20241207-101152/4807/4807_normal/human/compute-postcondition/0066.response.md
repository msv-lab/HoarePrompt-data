The variable `g` is assigned the value of `g + str(b)`. Since `g` is currently an empty string and `b` is assigned to `s`, the value of `str(b)` will convert `b` to a string. Therefore, `g` will now hold the string representation of `b`. The values of the other variables (`s`, `t`, `i`, and `a`) remain unchanged. 

Thus, the Output State is: `s` is equal to `b`, `g` is now the string representation of `b`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `i` is 1, `a` is greater than 1.

Output State: **`s` is equal to `b`, `g` is now the string representation of `b`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `i` is 1, `a` is greater than 1**.
