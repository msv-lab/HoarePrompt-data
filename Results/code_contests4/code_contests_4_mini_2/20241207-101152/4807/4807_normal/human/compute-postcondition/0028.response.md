The value of `s` is decremented by 2, and since `s` is greater than 1, the new value of `s` will still be valid after the operation. The other variables `t` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `i` is 0; `s` is greater than 1 after decrement; `g` is updated to include the string representation of `s`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `i` is 0; `s` is greater than 1 after decrement; `g` is updated to include the string representation of `s`.**
