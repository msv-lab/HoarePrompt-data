The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an even integer (previously an odd integer greater than 1), `b` is an input odd integer, and `s` is equal to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
