The value of `g` is incremented by a space character `' '`, but there is no information provided on the previous value of `g`. The values of the other variables `t`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `i` is 0, `s` is `b - 3`, and `g` is updated by appending a space character.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `i` is 0, `s` is `b - 3`, and `g` is updated by appending a space character.**
