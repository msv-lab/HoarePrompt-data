Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `b` and generates a string of numbers starting from `b` down to 1. If `b` is even, it decrements by 1 until reaching 0. If `b` is odd, it appends a special format for the half-point during the decrementing process. The output for each test case is printed as a space-separated string of these values. The function handles at most 100 test cases, and the values of `b` are constrained between 2 and 100. It does not handle input errors or invalid values of `b`.**
