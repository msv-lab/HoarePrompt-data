The line of code `g = g + ' '` appends a space character to the current value of `g`. The variable `g` is updated but its previous value is not specified in the initial state. The other variables `t`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `i` is 0; `s` is greater than 1 after decrement; `g` is updated to be concatenated with str(s - 1) and a space is added to it.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `i` is 0; `s` is greater than 1 after decrement; `g` is updated to be concatenated with str(s - 1) and a space is added to it.**
