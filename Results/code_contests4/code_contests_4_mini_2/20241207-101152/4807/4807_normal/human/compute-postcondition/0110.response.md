The code `g = g + ' '` appends a space character to the existing value of `g`. The value of `g` is updated, but the previous values of `s` and `b` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `g` while maintaining the previous values of `s` and `b`.

Output State: **`s` is at least -1; `b` is odd; `g` is updated by appending a space character.**
