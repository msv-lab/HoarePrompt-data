The variable `g` is assigned the value of `g + str(s - 1)`. The value of `s` is at least 1, and it is equal to `b // 2 + 1`, indicating that `s` is at least 1 and can take various values depending on `b`. The expression `s - 1` will yield a non-negative integer, which is then converted to a string and concatenated to the existing value of `g`. The exact new value of `g` depends on its initial value, which is not specified. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is at least 1, `b` is odd, and `g` is increased by the string representation of `s - 1`.

Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `b` is odd, and `g` is increased by the string representation of `s - 1.**
