The value of `s` is decremented by 1. Since `s` is an even integer greater than 1, the new value of `s` will be an odd integer greater than 0. The variable `b` remains unchanged, and `g` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is now an odd integer greater than 0; `b` is an even integer; `g` holds its original value plus the string representation of the original `s`.

Output State: **`s` is now an odd integer greater than 0; `b` is an even integer; `g` holds its original value plus the string representation of the original `s`.**
