The value of `g` is updated to include the string representation of `s` followed by a space. The previous value of `g` is not specified, but we know that `s` is at least 0. Therefore, the output state will reflect the concatenation of the string representation of `s` and the previous value of `g`.

Output State: **`s` is at least 0; `g` is updated to include the string representation of `s` followed by a space.**
