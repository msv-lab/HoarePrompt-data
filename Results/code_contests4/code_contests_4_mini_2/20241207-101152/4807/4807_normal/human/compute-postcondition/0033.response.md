The code `g = g + ' '` appends a space to the current value of `g`. The initial state mentions that `g` is updated under certain conditions, but since we don't have the value of `g` or the specific conditions that led to this execution, we will assume that `g` already holds some value. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `s`) are not directly affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State reflects that a space has been added to `g`, but does not change the values of `t`, `i`, or `s`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `i` is 0; `s` is greater than 1 after decrement; a space has been added to `g`.**
