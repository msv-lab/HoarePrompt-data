Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `i` is 0; `s` is greater than 1 after decrement (now `s - 2`); `b` must be odd for the loop to execute again. If `s` equals 0, the function will not make any changes to `g`, and the execution will continue without breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s` equals `b // 2 + 1`, then `g` is incremented by the string representation of `s` followed by a space, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
