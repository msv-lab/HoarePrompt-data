The code `g = g + ' '` appends a space character to the existing string `g`. The value of `g` is updated, but the values of `t`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `g` including the appended space.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `i` is 0; `s` is greater than 1; `g` is updated to include the string representation of `s - 1` followed by a space.**
