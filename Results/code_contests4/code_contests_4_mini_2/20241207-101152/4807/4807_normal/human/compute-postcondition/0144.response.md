The value of `g` is updated by concatenating a space character to its current value. The values of `s` and `b` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an even integer, `b` is an input odd integer, and `g` is updated to include an additional space.

Output State: **`s` is an even integer, `b` is an input odd integer, `g` is updated to include an additional space**
