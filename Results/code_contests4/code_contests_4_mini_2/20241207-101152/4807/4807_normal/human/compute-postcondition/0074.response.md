The value of `g` is updated by concatenating it with the string representation of `s`. Since `g` was previously the string representation of `s` followed by a space and then `s` with an additional space, the new value of `g` will now include `s` again as a string without any additional spaces. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an odd integer greater than 1; `g` is the previous value of `g` concatenated with the string representation of `s`; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `i` is 1; `a` is greater than 1; `b` must be even for the loop to execute again.

Output State: **`s` is an odd integer greater than 1; `g` is the previous value of `g` concatenated with the string representation of `s`; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `i` is 1; `a` is greater than 1; `b` must be even for the loop to execute again.**
