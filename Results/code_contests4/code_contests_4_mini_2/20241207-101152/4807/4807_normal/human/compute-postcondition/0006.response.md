The variable `g` is assigned an empty string. The previous values of the other variables (`t`, `i`, `b`, and `s`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `i` is 0; `b` is an input integer; `s` is assigned the value of `b`; `g` is an empty string.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `i` is 0; `b` is an input integer; `s` is assigned the value of `b`; `g` is an empty string.**
