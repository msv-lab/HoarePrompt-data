The variable `g` is updated to include the string representation of `s`, which is an odd integer greater than 0, followed by a space. The original value of `g` is retained, and the new value of `g` becomes the concatenation of the original `g` and the string representation of `s`. The variables `s` and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is now an odd integer greater than 0; `b` is an even integer; `g` holds its original value plus the string representation of the original `s` followed by a space.

Output State: **`s` is now an odd integer greater than 0; `b` is an even integer; `g` holds its original value plus the string representation of the original `s` followed by a space.**
