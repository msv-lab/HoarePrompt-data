The value of `s` is decremented by 2. Since `s` is initially an even integer, subtracting 2 from it will still result in an even integer. The values of `g` and `b` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an even integer decreased by 2, `g` is the previous value concatenated with a space and the string representation of the original `s`, `b` is an odd integer.

Output State: **`s` is an even integer decreased by 2, `g` is the previous value concatenated with a space and the string representation of the original `s`, `b` is an odd integer**
