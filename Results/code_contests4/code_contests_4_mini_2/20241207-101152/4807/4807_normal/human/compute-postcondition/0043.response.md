The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `i` is 0; `s` is greater than 1 after decrement; `g` is not updated; `s` remains unchanged; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
