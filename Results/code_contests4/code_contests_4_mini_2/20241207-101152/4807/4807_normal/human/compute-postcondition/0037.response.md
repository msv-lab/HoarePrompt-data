The variable `g` is being concatenated with a space. However, the initial state does not provide a specific value for `g`, so we cannot determine its new value after the operation. The other variables `t`, `i`, and `s` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State reflects the unchanged values of these variables and indicates the operation performed on `g`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `i` is 0; `s` is greater than 1 after decrement; `g` is concatenated with a space.**
