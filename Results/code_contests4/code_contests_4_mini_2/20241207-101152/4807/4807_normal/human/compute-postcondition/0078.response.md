The variable `g` is assigned the value of its previous state concatenated with the string representation of `s`. Since `s` is an even integer greater than 0, `str(s)` will convert it to a string without changing its value. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `a`, and `b`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `g` while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is an even integer greater than 0; `g` is the previous value of `g` concatenated with str(s); `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `i` is 1; `a` is greater than 1; `b` is even.**
