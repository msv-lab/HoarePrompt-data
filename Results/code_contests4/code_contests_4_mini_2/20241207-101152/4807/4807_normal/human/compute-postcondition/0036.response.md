The value of `s` is decremented by 1, which means that `s` will now be one less than its previous value. The other variables, `t` and `i`, remain unchanged. The requirement for the loop to execute again (that `b` must be odd) is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `i` is 0; `s` is greater than 1 after decrement.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `i` is 0; `s` is greater than 1 after decrement.**
