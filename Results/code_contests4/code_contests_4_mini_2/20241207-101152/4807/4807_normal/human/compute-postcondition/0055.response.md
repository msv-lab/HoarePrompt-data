The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `i` is 0; `s` is greater than 1 after decrement (now `s - 2`); `b` must be odd for the loop to execute again; if `s` equals `b // 2 + 1`, then `g` is incremented by the string representation of `s` followed by a space, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
