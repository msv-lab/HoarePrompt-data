The value of `s` is decremented by 2. Given that `s` is greater than 1 before the decrement, the new value of `s` will still be greater than 1 after the operation. The values of `t`, `i`, `b`, and `g` remain unchanged, but `s` is now 2 less than its previous value. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `i` is 0; `s` is greater than 1 after decrement (now `s - 2`); `b` must be odd for the loop to execute again; `g` is incremented by the string representation of `s` followed by a space.
