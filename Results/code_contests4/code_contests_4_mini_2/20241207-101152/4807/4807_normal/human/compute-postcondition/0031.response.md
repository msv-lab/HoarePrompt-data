The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `i` is 0; `s` is greater than 1 after decrement; if `s` is equal to `b // 2 + 1`, then `g` is updated to include the string representation of `s`; `s` is equal to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
