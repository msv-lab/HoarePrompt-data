The code `g = g + ' '` appends a space character to the current value of `g`. However, the initial state does not provide the value for `g`, so we cannot determine its previous value. The values of `s` and `b` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is at least -1; `b` is odd; `g` is updated by appending a space.

Output State: **`s` is at least -1; `b` is odd; `g` is updated by appending a space.**
