The value of `s` is decremented by 1. Since `s` is an odd integer greater than 0, after the execution, `s` will become an even integer. The values of `b` and `g` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is now an even integer; `b` is an even integer; `g` holds its original value plus the string representation of the original odd integer `s` followed by a space.

Output State: **`s` is now an even integer; `b` is an even integer; `g` holds its original value plus the string representation of the original odd integer `s` followed by a space.**
