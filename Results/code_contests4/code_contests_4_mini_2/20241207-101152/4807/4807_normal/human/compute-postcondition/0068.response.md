The value of `s` is decremented by 1, and since `s` is an even integer greater than 2, after execution, `s` will still be an even integer greater than 1. The values of `g`, `t`, `i`, and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an even integer greater than 1, `g` is the string representation of that even integer, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `i` is 1, `a` is greater than 1.

Output State: **`s` is an even integer greater than 1, `g` is the string representation of that even integer, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `i` is 1, `a` is greater than 1**
