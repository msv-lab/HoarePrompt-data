The code `g = g + ' '` appends a space character to the existing value of `g`. However, the value of `g` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine its previous value. The variables `s` and `b` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is at least 0, `b` is odd, and `g` is increased by one space character.

Output State: **`s` is at least 0, `b` is odd, and `g` is increased by one space character.**
