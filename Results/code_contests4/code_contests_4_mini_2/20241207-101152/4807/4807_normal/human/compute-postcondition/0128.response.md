The code `g = g + ' '` appends a space character to the existing value of `g`. However, the variable `g` has not been initialized or defined in the initial state. Since the initial state does not provide any information about `g`, we cannot determine its previous value. The other variables `s` and `b` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State reflects that `g` is being modified, but the exact new value cannot be determined.

Output State: **`s` is an input odd integer greater than 1 and now it is decremented to an even integer; `b` must be an even integer for the loop to execute the first time; `g` is modified to hold the original value of `g` plus a space character, but the specific value of `g` is unknown.**
