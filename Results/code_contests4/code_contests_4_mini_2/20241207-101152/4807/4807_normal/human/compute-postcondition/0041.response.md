The value of `s` is decremented by 2. Since it is stated that `s` is greater than 1 after the decrement, this means that the new value of `s` will still be valid and greater than 1. However, the exact new value of `s` is not specified. The other variables `t`, `i`, and `g` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `i` is 0; `s` is greater than 1 after decrement; `g` is updated to be concatenated with str(s) (with the new value of `s` being `s - 2`).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `i` is 0; `s` is greater than 1 after decrement; `g` is updated to be concatenated with str(s) (where s is now s - 2)**
