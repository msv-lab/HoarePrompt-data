The variable `g` is assigned the value of `g` concatenated with the string representation of `s`. The variable `s` is previously defined as `b - 2`, but the actual value of `b` is unknown. Therefore, `s` can take on various integer values depending on `b`. The value of `g` is modified by adding the string form of `s` to it, but without knowing the current value of `g`, we cannot determine the exact new value of `g`. 

Thus, the output state reflects that `g` has been modified by concatenating the string representation of `s`, and we acknowledge that `s` is `b - 2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `i` is 0; `s` is `b - 2`; `g` is modified by concatenating the string representation of `s`.**
