The value of `g` is updated by concatenating a space to its current value. Since `g` is the string representation of `b`, it will now have an additional space at the end. The other variables (`t`, `i`, and `s`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `i` is 0; `s` is `b - 1`; `g` is the string representation of `b` followed by a space.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `i` is 0; `s` is `b - 1`; `g` is the string representation of `b` followed by a space.**
