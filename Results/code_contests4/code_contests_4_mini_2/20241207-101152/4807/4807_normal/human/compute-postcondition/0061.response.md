The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is 0. Therefore, after execution, `i` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`s` is less than or equal to 0; `g` contains the string representation of `b` followed by the string representation of each decremented value until `s` reaches 0; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `i` is 1; and `g` is printed.**
