The code `g = g + ' '` appends a space character to the current value of `g`. Since `g` is previously incremented by the string representation of the initial value of `s`, it now has a string value that represents the initial odd integer. The variable `s` remains unchanged, and `b` does not affect the output state. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`s` is now an odd integer, `b` is an input odd integer, `g` is the string representation of the initial value of `s` followed by a space.**
