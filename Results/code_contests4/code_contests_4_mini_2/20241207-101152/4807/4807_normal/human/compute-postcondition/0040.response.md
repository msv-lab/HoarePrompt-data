The value of `g` is updated to be concatenated with `str(s)`. Since `s` is greater than 1 after decrement, `str(s)` will convert the integer value of `s` to its string representation. The previous value of `g` is concatenated with this string representation of `s`, but we do not have the initial value of `g`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `i` is 0; `s` is greater than 1 after decrement; `g` is updated to be concatenated with str(s).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `i` is 0; `s` is greater than 1 after decrement; `g` is updated to be concatenated with str(s).**
