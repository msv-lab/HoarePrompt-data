The value of `s` is decremented by 2. Since `s` is initially an even integer, the result will still be an even integer after the decrement. The values of `b` and `g` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an even integer decreased by 2, `b` is an input odd integer, and `g` is updated to include the string representation of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is an even integer decreased by 2, `b` is an input odd integer, `g` is updated to include the string representation of `s`**
