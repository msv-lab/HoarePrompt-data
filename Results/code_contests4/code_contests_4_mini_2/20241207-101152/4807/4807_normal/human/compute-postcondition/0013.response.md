The value of `s` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `s` is `b - 1`, which means `s` will take on the value of `b - 2` after the operation. The values of `t`, `i`, and `b` remain unchanged, and the conditions for the loop to execute again are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `i` is 0; `s` is `b - 2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `i` is 0; `s` is `b - 2`**
