The value of `a` is assigned the result of `int(input())`, where `input` reads a line from standard input and converts it to an integer. The variable `t` remains unaffected, and the output will reflect the value of `a` based on the input provided. Since `a` takes the value from the input, its specific value is not known at this moment. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `a` is an integer from input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `a` is an integer from input**
