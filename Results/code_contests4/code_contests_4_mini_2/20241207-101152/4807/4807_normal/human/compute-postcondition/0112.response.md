The variable `s` is decremented by 2. Since `s` is at least -1, the new value of `s` will be at least -3 (if `s` was -1). The variable `b` remains unaffected as it is not altered by this operation, and `g` remains unchanged as the operation does not affect its value. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is at least -3; `b` is odd; `g` is updated by appending the string representation of the previous value of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is at least -3; `b` is odd; `g` is updated by appending the string representation of the previous value of `s`.**
