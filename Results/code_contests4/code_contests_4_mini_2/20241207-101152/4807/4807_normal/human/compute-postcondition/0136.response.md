The value of `g` is concatenated with a space. The previous value of `g` includes the original value plus the string representation of the original odd integer `s`, but since `s` is now an even integer, it does not affect the string representation in this context. The other variables `s` and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is now an even integer; `b` is an even integer; `g` is the original value plus the string representation of the original odd integer `s` followed by two spaces.

Output State: **`s` is now an even integer; `b` is an even integer; `g` is the original value plus the string representation of the original odd integer `s` followed by two spaces.**
