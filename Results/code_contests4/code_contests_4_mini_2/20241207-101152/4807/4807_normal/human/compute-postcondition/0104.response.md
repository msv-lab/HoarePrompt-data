The value of `g` is concatenated with a space (' '), but since the previous value of `g` is not specified, we only know it will now include an additional space. The values of `s` and `b` remain unchanged, and there are no other impacts on the state. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is at least 0, `b` is odd, and `g` is now increased by one space.

Output State: **`s` is at least 0, `b` is odd, `g` is increased by one space**
