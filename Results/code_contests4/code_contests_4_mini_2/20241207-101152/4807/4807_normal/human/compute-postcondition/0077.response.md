The code assigns a space character to the variable `g`, concatenating it with any previous values of `g`. The other variables (`s`, `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`) are not affected. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `g` has been updated to include a space.

Output State: **`s` is an even integer greater than 0; `g` is the previous value of `g` concatenated with a space; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `i` is 1; `a` is greater than 1; `b` is even.**
