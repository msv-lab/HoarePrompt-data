Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. The task is to generate a permutation of integers from 1 to n such that no integer appears in its original position (i.e., p_i â‰  i for all i). 

Here are the reasons why the program is incorrect:

1. **Logic Flaw for Generating Permutations**: The program attempts to build a string representation of a sequence of decreasing integers starting from `b`, but the logic for generating the permutation does not guarantee that it will produce a valid permutation of length `n` with the required condition. 

2. **Incorrect Permutation Construction**: The program uses a decrementing loop to generate the numbers, which does not ensure the resultant array will have distinct integers from 1 to n, nor will it ensure that no integer `i` is in position `i`. For instance, for `n=2`, the output might be "2 1", which is acceptable, but for larger values, the logic used may not yield a valid permutation.

3. **Handling of Even and Odd Cases**: The program contains separate logic for even and odd values of `b`, but this differentiation does not conform to the requirements of producing a valid permutation. The conditions inside the while loops are not guaranteed to yield a sequence that meets the permutation requirement.

4. **Output Format**: The output is constructed as a single string without directly creating a list of integers, which could lead to formatting issues when output is expected as individual integers.

In summary, the program's construction approach does not adhere to the requirement of producing a valid permutation where no integer is in its original position, resulting in incorrect outputs for various test cases. Therefore, the program is not correct.
