The variable `mid` is assigned the value of the expression `(be + en + 1) // 2`. The value of `be` is an integer and the value of `en` is greater than `be`, so the calculation will yield an integer value for `mid`. The specific value of `mid` cannot be determined without knowing the exact values of `be` and `en`, but it will be the result of that calculation. Therefore, the output state is: `be` is an integer, `en` is greater than `be`, and `mid` is the result of the expression `(be + en + 1) // 2`.

Output State: **`be` is an integer, `en` is greater than `be`, `mid` is the result of the expression `(be + en + 1) // 2`**
