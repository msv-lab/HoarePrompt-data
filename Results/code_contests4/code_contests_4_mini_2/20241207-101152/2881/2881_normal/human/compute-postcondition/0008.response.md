`mid` is assigned the value of the expression `(be + en + 1) // 2`. Given that `en` is greater than `be`, this will yield a value for `mid`. The specific values of `be` and `en` are not provided, but they satisfy the condition that `en > be`. Therefore, the output state remains dependent on the general relationship between `be` and `en`. 

The output state is: `be` is an integer, `en` is greater than `be`, `mid` is calculated as (be + en + 1) // 2.

Output State: **`be` is an integer, `en` is greater than `be`, `mid` is calculated as (be + en + 1) // 2**
