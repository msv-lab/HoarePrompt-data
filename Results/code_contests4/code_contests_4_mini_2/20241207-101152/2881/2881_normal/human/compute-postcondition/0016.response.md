Postcondition: ***`be` is an integer, `en` is greater than `be`, and `mid` is the result of the expression `(be + en + 1) // 2`. If `x * mid <= a` and `y * mid <= b`, then `be` is updated to `mid`, which is `(be + en + 1) // 2`, while `en` remains greater than the original `be`. Otherwise, `be` remains an integer, `en` is one less than `mid`, and `mid` is still calculated as `(be + en + 1) // 2`.***
