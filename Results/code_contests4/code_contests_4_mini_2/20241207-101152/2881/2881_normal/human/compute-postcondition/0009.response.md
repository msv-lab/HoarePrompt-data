`be` is assigned the value of `mid`, which is calculated as (be + en + 1) // 2. Since `en` is greater than `be`, `mid` will be greater than `be`. Therefore, after execution, `be` will be updated to this new value of `mid`. The value of `en` remains unaffected. 

Thus, the Output State is: `be` is updated to the value of `mid`, which is greater than the previous value of `be`; `en` is greater than the previous value of `be`.

Output State: **`be` is updated to the value of `mid`, which is greater than the previous value of `be`; `en` is greater than the previous value of `be`.**
