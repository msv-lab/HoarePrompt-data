The value of `en` is assigned the value of `mid - 1`. The variable `mid` is calculated as (be + en + 1) // 2, and since `en` is greater than `be`, the value of `mid` will be greater than `be` as well. Thus, when `en` is updated to `mid - 1`, it will be less than the previous value of `en` but still greater than or equal to `be`. Therefore, the Output State is: `be` is an integer, `en` is greater than `be`, and `en` is updated to `mid - 1`.

Output State: **`be` is an integer, `en` is greater than `be`, and `en` is updated to `mid - 1**
