Postcondition: ***`be` is an integer, `en` is greater than `be`, and `mid` is calculated as (be + en + 1) // 2. If `x * mid` is less than or equal to `a` and `y * mid` is less than or equal to `b`, then `be` is updated to `mid`. Otherwise, if either `x * mid` is greater than `a` or `y * mid` is greater than `b`, then `en` is updated to `mid - 1`.***
