The variable `mid` is assigned the value of `(be + en + 1) // 2`. Since `en` is required to be greater than `be` for the loop to execute the first time, `en` must be at least `be + 1`. Given that `be` is an integer, the value of `mid` will be calculated as the integer division of the sum of `be`, `en`, and 1 by 2. 

Since the exact values of `be` and `en` are not provided, the output state will reflect that `mid` is determined based on the formula involving `be` and `en`.

Output State: **`be` is an integer, `en` is greater than `be`; `mid` is calculated as (be + en + 1) // 2**
