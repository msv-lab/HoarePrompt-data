Postcondition: ***`be` is an integer and `en` is greater than `be`. If `x * mid <= a` and `y * mid <= b`, then `be` is updated to `mid`, which is greater than the previous value of `be`, and `en` remains greater than the previous value of `be`. Otherwise, `en` is updated to `mid - 1`, while `be` remains an integer and `en` is still greater than `be`.***
