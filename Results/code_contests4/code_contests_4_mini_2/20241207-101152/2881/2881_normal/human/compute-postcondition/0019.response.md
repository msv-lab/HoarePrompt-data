The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `be` and `en`. Both `be` and `en` are integers representing the original screen dimensions (a, b) and the desired ratio (x, y) respectively, with the constraints that 1 ≤ a, b, x, y ≤ 2·10^9. After executing the function, the output will be determined based on these input parameters, returning the adjusted screen dimensions that maintain the specified ratio while fitting within the original screen dimensions. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `be` and `en`, which are integers representing the original screen dimensions and the desired ratio. It returns adjusted screen dimensions that fit the desired ratio while staying within the constraints of the original dimensions.**
