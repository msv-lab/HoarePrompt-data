In this case, `be` is assigned the value of `mid`. Since `mid` is the result of the expression `(be + en + 1) // 2`, the new value of `be` will be calculated based on the previous values of `be` and `en`. The value of `mid` is effectively the average of `be` and `en` rounded up. 

After the assignment, the value of `be` is updated to `mid`, while `en` remains unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `be` is now equal to `mid`, which is `(be + en + 1) // 2`, and `en` is greater than the original `be`.

Output State: **`be` is now equal to `mid`, which is `(be + en + 1) // 2`; `en` is greater than the original `be`.**
