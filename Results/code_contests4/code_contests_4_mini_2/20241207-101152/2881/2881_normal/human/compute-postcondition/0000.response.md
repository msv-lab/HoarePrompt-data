According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `be` and `en`. The loop will execute if `be` is less than `en`. Since `be` and `en` are integers representing the original screen dimensions and the desired ratio, we need to ensure that `be` is indeed less than `en` for the loop to execute.

If `be` is equal to or greater than `en`, the loop will not execute. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, we need to ensure that `en` is greater than `be`.

Given that `be` and `en` are both integers, we can conclude that we need to adjust `en` to be greater than `be`.

State: **`be` is an integer, for the loop to execute the first time `en` needs to be greater than `be`**
