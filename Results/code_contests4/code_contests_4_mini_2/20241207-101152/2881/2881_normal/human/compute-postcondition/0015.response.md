`en` is assigned the value `mid - 1`. The previous value of `mid` is calculated as `(be + en + 1) // 2`, and since `en` is greater than `be`, the value of `mid` will be at least `be + 1`. Thus, subtracting 1 from `mid` assigns a value to `en` that is one less than `mid`.

After executing the code, the states of `be` and `mid` remain unchanged, while `en` is now one less than `mid`. Therefore, the Output State is: `be` is an integer, `en` is one less than `mid`, `mid` is the result of the expression `(be + en + 1) // 2`.

Output State: **`be` is an integer, `en` is one less than `mid`, `mid` is the result of the expression `(be + en + 1) // 2`**.
