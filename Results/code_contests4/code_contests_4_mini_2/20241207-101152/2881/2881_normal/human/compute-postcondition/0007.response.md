According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `be` and `en`. If `be` is less than `en`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `be` is an integer, `en` is greater than `be`. This means that the condition `be < en` holds true, allowing the loop to execute one more time. 

No adjustments are necessary for the states since the current state already satisfies the loop's condition for one more iteration.

State: **`be` is an integer, `en` is greater than `be`**
