Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer parameters `be` and `en`, which represent the lower and upper bounds for scaling dimensions based on a desired ratio. It calculates the maximum scaling factor `mid` such that scaling the original dimensions `a` and `b` by `mid` results in dimensions that do not exceed the original screen size. The function prints the scaled dimensions. However, the code is missing the definitions for `a`, `b`, `x`, and `y`, which are necessary for the calculations to work correctly. Therefore, the function lacks completeness as it relies on undefined variables.**
