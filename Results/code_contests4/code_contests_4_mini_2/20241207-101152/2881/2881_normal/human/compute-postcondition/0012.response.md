According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `be` and `en`. The loop will execute as long as `be` is less than `en`. At the end of the last iteration, `be` is an integer and `en` is greater than `be`. Since `en` remains greater than `be`, the loop can execute again. 

There is no need to adjust any states, as the current state already allows for one more iteration of the loop. 

State: **`be` is an integer and `en` is greater than `be`**
