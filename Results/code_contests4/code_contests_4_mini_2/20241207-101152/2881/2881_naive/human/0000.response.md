To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the given problem description, we need to analyze the code and see if it correctly computes the reduced screen parameters while adhering to the specified ratio and maximizing the area.

### Problem Analysis:
1. Given integers `a` and `b`, which represent the current dimensions of the monitor.
2. Given integers `x` and `y`, which represent the desired ratio.
3. The task is to find integers `w` and `h` (width and height) such that:
   - The ratio `w:h` is `x:y`.
   - `w` must be less than or equal to `a`, and `h` must be less than or equal to `b`.
   - The area `w * h` must be maximized.

### Code Analysis:
The function `func_1` uses a binary search approach to find the maximum possible value (`mid`) that maintains the screen ratio while fitting within the dimensions `a` and `b`. 

The following line calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` and reduces the ratio:
```python
g = gcd(x, y)
```
Then it scales down `x` and `y`:
```python
x //= g
y //= g
```

Finally, the maximum possible multiplier (`mi`) is calculated which determines the largest size that fits within the original dimensions while maintaining the aspect ratio:
```python
mi = min(a // x, b // y)
```
The output is then:
```python
print(mi * x, mi * y)
```

### Edge Cases:
1. **No Reduction Possible**: If the desired ratio leads to dimensions that exceed `a` or `b` after scaling, the output should be `0 0`.
2. **Very Small Inputs**: For small values of `a`, `b`, `x`, and `y`, particularly those where `x` and `y` exceed `a` and `b`.

### Potential Failing Test Case:
Let's consider the input:
```
1 1 1 2
```
The desired width to height ratio is `1:2`. The maximum possible width (`w = mi * x = 1 * 1 = 1`) and height (`h = mi * y = 1 * 2 = 2`). However, `h` exceeds the given height `b = 1`. Thus, the output should be `0 0`, which the code handles correctly.

However, consider the input:
```
3 1 1 3
```
- Here, the maximum value for `w` that fits within `a` is `3` (since `3 // 1 = 3`).
- The corresponding `h` would be `3` (since `3 * 1 = 3`).
- But `h` exceeds `b` which is `1`, hence the correct output should be `0 0`. 

In this case, the program will output `3 9`, incorrectly suggesting that a valid monitor size exists.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle the case where the calculated height exceeds the given `b` correctly, leading to incorrect outputs.

Correctness: **False**.
