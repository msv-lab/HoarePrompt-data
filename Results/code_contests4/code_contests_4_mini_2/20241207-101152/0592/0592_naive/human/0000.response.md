To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic of the program step by step.

The problem states that we need to determine how often Vasya goes to see his girlfriends Dasha and Masha based on the frequency of trains heading to each of them. The conditions provided must be met correctly by the program.

### Program Review

The program uses the following logic:
1. It employs a recursive function `func_1` to determine the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, which is not directly necessary for solving the problem.
2. It calculates a variable `g` that represents the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` using the formula `a * b / func_1(a, b)`.
3. The next conditional checks involve comparing the frequency of the trains in relation to `g`.

### Potential Issues

1. **Division by Zero Check**: The function `func_1` has a base case for division by zero, but since `b` is guaranteed to be non-zero (given `a â‰  b`), this is not a concern here.
2. **Logic of Frequency Comparison**: The condition `g / min(a, b) == g / max(a, b) + 1` is meant to determine if Vasya goes to both girlfriends equally often. However, this logic might not correctly determine the frequency based on the intervals of time Vasya could arrive.
3. **Output Logic**: The final output logic seems to be flawed. The comparison of train frequencies should simply determine which is less frequent without involving the LCM in that manner, as it does not directly correlate to how many times Vasya will go to each girlfriend.

### Counterexample

Given the input where `a = 4` and `b = 6`, the expected output would be:
- Train to Dasha arrives every 4 minutes.
- Train to Masha arrives every 6 minutes.

Possible arrivals:
- 0, 4 (Dasha)
- 0, 6 (Masha)
- 2 (Dasha)
- 3 (Masha)
- 8, 12 (Dasha)
- 6, 12 (Masha)

If we analyze these arrivals within a single cycle (0 to 12), Vasya would go to Dasha 3 times (at 0, 4, 8) and to Masha 2 times (at 0, 6). The program should output "Dasha", but due to the flawed logic, it might not handle this correctly.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the program does not correctly implement the logic needed to determine how often Vasya visits each girlfriend based on the train frequencies. Specifically, the comparison logic is incorrect and may lead to wrong results in certain scenarios.

Thus, the evaluation concludes that the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
