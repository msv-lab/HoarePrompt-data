Correctness: **False**

The given program incorrectly attempts to determine the frequency with which Vasya visits each girlfriend. Specifically, the logic used to calculate `g` and compare the frequencies does not accurately reflect the scheduling of the trains.

One major issue arises from the conditional statement:
```python
if g / min(a, b) == g / max(a, b) + 1:
```
This condition does not correctly capture the moments of the train arrivals. The logic should actually compute how many times Vasya would visit each girlfriend based on the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the two frequencies, which is not done properly here.

For example, consider the input `a = 3` and `b = 7`:
- The LCM of 3 and 7 is 21.
- In 21 minutes, Vasya would catch trains to Dasha at minutes 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 (7 times), and trains to Masha at minutes 0, 7, 14 (3 times).
- Thus, he visits Dasha more frequently.

However, the program does not correctly compute this and could yield incorrect results for inputs such as `3 7` or `5 3`. 

Also, the division and the comparison in the condition are not reliable for counting how many times he visits each girlfriend over time. 

Thus, the provided program cannot be guaranteed to produce the correct outputs for all possible inputs as per the problem statement.
