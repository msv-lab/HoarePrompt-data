Functionality: ** The function accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`, where `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^6` and `a ≠ b`. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. The function returns `a` if `b` is 0; otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `b` and `a % b` until `b` becomes 0, at which point it returns the GCD. **
