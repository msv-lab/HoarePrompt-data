#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^6 and a ≠ b.
def func_1(a, b):
    return a if b == 0 else func_1(b, a % b)
    #The program returns a if b is 0, otherwise it returns the result of func_1 with parameters b and a % b, where a and b are positive integers and a ≠ b.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`, where `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^6` and `a ≠ b`. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. The function returns `a` if `b` is 0; otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `b` and `a % b` until `b` becomes 0, at which point it returns the GCD.
