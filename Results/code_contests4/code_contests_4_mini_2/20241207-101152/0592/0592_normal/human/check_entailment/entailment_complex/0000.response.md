Correctness: **False**

The annotated program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two integers `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. However, the problem description requires determining which girlfriend Vasya visits more frequently based on the frequency of trains to each girlfriend, not calculating the GCD of the two integers.

The correct approach should involve determining the least common multiple (LCM) of the two frequencies `a` and `b` to analyze the intervals at which Vasya would board the trains to each girlfriend. Then we would need to count how many times he would choose to go to Dasha versus Masha based on the train schedule, rather than computing the GCD.

Since the program does not produce the desired output based on the problem's requirements, it is incorrect.
