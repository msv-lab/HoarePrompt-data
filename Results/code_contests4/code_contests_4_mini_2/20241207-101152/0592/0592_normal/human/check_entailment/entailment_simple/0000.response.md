Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` is an implementation of the Euclidean algorithm, which calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers `a` and `b`. This does not relate to the problem at all, which is about determining how often Vasya goes to his girlfriends based on the frequencies of the trains.

To evaluate the frequency with which Vasya visits Dasha and Masha, the program should compute how many times each train arrives within a certain time period and compare these counts. Specifically, the program should analyze the arrival times of trains going to Dasha (every `a` minutes) and Masha (every `b` minutes) over a common period, such as the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`. 

Since the existing function does not address the problem of counting how often Vasya goes to Dasha or Masha based on their respective train frequencies, it does not fulfill the requirements laid out in the problem description. 

In summary, the program fails to implement the logic necessary to determine which girlfriend Vasya visits more frequently, hence it is incorrect.
