Correctness: **False**.

The program incorrectly uses 'YES' and 'NO' as output instead of the required 'vowel' and 'consonant'. For example, if the input is 'a', the expected output is 'vowel', but the program will output 'YES'. Similarly, for a consonant input like 'z', it should output 'consonant', but it will output 'NO'. Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
