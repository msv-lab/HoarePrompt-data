Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Output Mismatch**: The problem description specifies that the output should be "vowel" if the input letter is a vowel and "consonant" otherwise. However, the program prints "YES" for vowels and "NO" for consonants, which does not align with the required output format.

2. **Input Method**: The program uses `raw_input()`, which is not compatible with Python 3. In Python 3, the correct function to read input is `input()`. This would lead to a runtime error in Python 3 environments.

3. **Missing Functionality**: The function does not return any values or print the output in the required format. It should explicitly check for all five vowels and handle the input accordingly, as specified in the problem description.

Due to these discrepancies, the program does not correctly implement the functionality as described in the problem statement.
