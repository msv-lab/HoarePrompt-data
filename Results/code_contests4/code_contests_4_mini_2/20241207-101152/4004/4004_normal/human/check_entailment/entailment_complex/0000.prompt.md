You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Given a lowercase English letter c, determine whether it is a vowel. Here, there are five vowels in the English alphabet: `a`, `e`, `i`, `o` and `u`.

Constraints

* c is a lowercase English letter.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


c


Output

If c is a vowel, print `vowel`. Otherwise, print `consonant`.

Examples

Input

a


Output

vowel


Input

z


Output

consonant


Input

s


Output

consonant
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: c is a lowercase English letter.
def func():
    print('YES' if raw_input() in ['a', 'i', 'u', 'e', 'o'] else 'NO')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and reads a lowercase English letter from user input. It prints 'YES' if the letter is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u) and 'NO' otherwise. The function does not return any value.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
