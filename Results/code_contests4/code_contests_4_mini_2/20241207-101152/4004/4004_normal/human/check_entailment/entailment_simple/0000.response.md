Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. Specifically, the function is intended to determine whether a given lowercase English letter is a vowel and print either "vowel" or "consonant". 

Here are the issues with the program:

1. The function uses `raw_input()` which is not defined in Python 3 (it is a Python 2 function). In Python 3, `input()` should be used instead.
2. The program prints 'YES' or 'NO' instead of 'vowel' or 'consonant', which does not adhere to the output specifications provided in the problem description.
3. The list of vowels is correct, but the output format is incorrect.

For these reasons, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description.
