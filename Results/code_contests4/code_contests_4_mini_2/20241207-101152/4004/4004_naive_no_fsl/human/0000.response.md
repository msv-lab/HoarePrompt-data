Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not follow the problem description correctly. According to the problem, if the input character `c` is a vowel, the program should print `vowel`, and if it is not, it should print `consonant`. However, the program outputs 'YES' for vowels and 'NO' for consonants, which does not match the required output format.

For example, if the input is 'a', the expected output is 'vowel', but the program will print 'YES'. Similarly, for input 'z', the expected output is 'consonant', while the program will print 'NO'. This discrepancy indicates that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
