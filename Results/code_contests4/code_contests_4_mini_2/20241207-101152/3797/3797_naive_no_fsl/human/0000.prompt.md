You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Alice and Bob play a game. Initially they have a string s_1, s_2, ..., s_n, consisting of only characters . and X. They take alternating turns, and Alice is moving first. During each turn, the player has to select a contiguous substring consisting only of characters . and replaces each of them with X. Alice must select a substing of length a, and Bob must select a substring of length b. It is guaranteed that a > b.

For example, if s = ...X.. and a = 3, b = 2, then after Alice's move string can turn only into XXXX... And if it's Bob's turn and the string s = ...X.., then after Bob's move the string can turn into XX.X.., .XXX.. or ...XXX.

Whoever is unable to make a move, loses. You have to determine who wins if they both play optimally.

You have to answer q independent queries.

Input

The first line contains one integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of queries.

The first line of each query contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ b < a ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5).

The second line of each query contains the string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5), consisting of only characters . and X.

It is guaranteed that sum of all |s| over all queries not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each test case print YES if Alice can win and NO otherwise.

You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).

Example

Input


3
3 2
XX......XX...X
4 2
X...X.X..X
5 3
.......X..X


Output


YES
NO
YES

Note

In the first query Alice can select substring s_3 ... s_5. After that s turns into XXXXX...XX...X. After that, no matter what move Bob makes, Alice can make the move (this will be her second move), but Bob can't make his second move.

In the second query Alice can not win because she cannot even make one move.

In the third query Alice can choose substring s_2 ... s_6. After that s turns into .XXXXX.X..X, and Bob can't make a move after that.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
