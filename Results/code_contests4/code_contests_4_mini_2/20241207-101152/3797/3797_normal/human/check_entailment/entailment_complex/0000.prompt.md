You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Alice and Bob play a game. Initially they have a string s_1, s_2, ..., s_n, consisting of only characters . and X. They take alternating turns, and Alice is moving first. During each turn, the player has to select a contiguous substring consisting only of characters . and replaces each of them with X. Alice must select a substing of length a, and Bob must select a substring of length b. It is guaranteed that a > b.

For example, if s = ...X.. and a = 3, b = 2, then after Alice's move string can turn only into XXXX... And if it's Bob's turn and the string s = ...X.., then after Bob's move the string can turn into XX.X.., .XXX.. or ...XXX.

Whoever is unable to make a move, loses. You have to determine who wins if they both play optimally.

You have to answer q independent queries.

Input

The first line contains one integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of queries.

The first line of each query contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ b < a ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5).

The second line of each query contains the string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5), consisting of only characters . and X.

It is guaranteed that sum of all |s| over all queries not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each test case print YES if Alice can win and NO otherwise.

You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).

Example

Input


3
3 2
XX......XX...X
4 2
X...X.X..X
5 3
.......X..X


Output


YES
NO
YES

Note

In the first query Alice can select substring s_3 ... s_5. After that s turns into XXXXX...XX...X. After that, no matter what move Bob makes, Alice can make the move (this will be her second move), but Bob can't make his second move.

In the second query Alice can not win because she cannot even make one move.

In the third query Alice can choose substring s_2 ... s_6. After that s turns into .XXXXX.X..X, and Bob can't make a move after that.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function processes multiple queries where each query consists of two integers a and b (1 ≤ b < a ≤ 300000) and a string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 300000) consisting solely of characters '.' and 'X'. The total length of all strings across queries does not exceed 300000.
def func_1():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a, b = func_3()
        
        s = list(input())
        
        s.append('X')
        
        cnt = 0
        
        this = 0
        
        flag = False
        
        try:
            for c in s:
                if c == 'X' and this > 0:
                    if b <= this < a or a + 4 * b - 1 <= this:
                        raise
                    if 2 * b <= this:
                        if flag:
                            raise
                        flag = True
                        if this < a:
                            raise
                    cnt += 1
                    this = 0
                elif c == '.':
                    this += 1
            print('NO' if cnt % 2 else 'YES')
        except:
            print('NO')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is an integer less than `a`, `s` is a list of characters from the input strings containing at least one 'X', `cnt` is the count of 'X' characters in `s` that were preceded by at least one '.', `this` is the count of consecutive '.' characters before the last 'X', `flag` indicates whether an exception condition was met during the loop's execution. If an exception occurs in any iteration, 'NO' is printed; if no exceptions occur, 'NO' is printed if `cnt` is odd, otherwise 'YES'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple queries, each consisting of two integers `a` and `b`, and a string `s` made up of characters '.' and 'X'. It checks the conditions related to the counts of consecutive '.' characters and the occurrences of 'X'. If any exception condition is met during these checks, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES' if the count of valid 'X' is even, and 'NO' if it is odd. However, the function does not handle the cases where inputs may not meet the specified constraints, such as `s` not containing 'X' or other edge cases that could lead to unexpected behavior.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer representing the length a (with 1 ≤ b < a ≤ 300000), y is an integer representing the length b (with 1 ≤ b < a ≤ 300000), and s is a string consisting of characters '.' and 'X' with a length of at least 1 and at most 300000, such that the sum of all lengths of s across all queries does not exceed 300000.
def func_2(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`, `y` is 0.
    return x
    #The program returns the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`, which is `x` since `y` is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. If `y` is initially 0, it returns `x` as the GCD, otherwise, it computes the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm. The function does not handle cases where `x` or `y` are negative, which may lead to unexpected results.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: q is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 300000; a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ b < a ≤ 300000; s is a string consisting only of characters '.' and 'X', with a length |s| such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 300000, and the sum of lengths of all strings s across queries does not exceed 300000.
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers from user input, split by spaces
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts user input in the form of a space-separated string of integers, splits the string by spaces, converts each split string into an integer, and returns a list of these integers. It does not handle cases where the input might not be valid integers, nor does it validate the input based on the constraints mentioned in the comments.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: f is an integer representing the number of queries (1 ≤ f ≤ 300000), each query consists of two integers a and b (1 ≤ b < a ≤ 300000) followed by a string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 300000) consisting only of characters '.' and 'X', and the total length of all strings s does not exceed 300000.
def func_4(f):
    return [func_4(f, *dim[1:]) for _ in range(dim[0])] if dim else f()
    #The program returns a list created by calling func_4 with the integer f and additional dimensions from dim, for each of the f queries if dim is not empty; otherwise, it returns the integer f.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `f`, which represents the number of queries. It returns a list of results generated by recursively calling `func_4` with `f` and additional dimensions from `dim` for each of the `f` queries if `dim` is not empty; otherwise, it returns the integer `f`. However, the code appears to be incomplete without a proper definition or context for `dim`, which could lead to a potential `NameError` if `dim` is not defined in the scope of the function execution.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: start is a string consisting only of characters '.' and 'X', step is a tuple of two integers (a, b) where 1 ≤ b < a ≤ 300,000, and count is an integer representing the number of queries (1 ≤ count ≤ 300,000) with the sum of lengths of all start strings not exceeding 300,000.
def func_5(start, step, count):
    return range(start, start + step * count, step)
    #The program returns a range starting from the string 'start' to 'start' plus 'step' multiplied by 'count', using 'step' as the increment.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `start`, a tuple `step` containing two integers (a, b), and an integer `count`. It returns a range object starting from the integer value of `start` and extending to `start` plus `step` multiplied by `count`, using `step` as the increment. However, since `start` is a string, this will raise a TypeError when trying to create a range, indicating that the provided annotations are misleading about the type expected for `start`. The function does not handle input validation for the type of `start`, which should be an integer for the range to work correctly.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ b < a ≤ 300000), followed by a string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 300000) consisting only of characters . and X. The total length of all strings in the list does not exceed 300000.
def func_6(l, start, end):
    return range(start, len(l) + end)
    #The program returns a range object starting from 'start' to 'len(l) + end', where 'len(l)' is the number of tuples in the list 'l' and 'end' is included in the calculation.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts a list of tuples `l` and two integers `start` and `end`. It returns a range object that starts at `start` and goes up to `len(l) + end`, where `len(l)` is the number of tuples in the list. The function does not validate the input parameters; hence, it does not handle cases where `start` is greater than `len(l) + end`, which could lead to an empty range. Also, the function does not consider any potential issues related to negative values for `start` or `end`, which could yield unintended range outputs.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of queries, and for each query, a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ b < a ≤ 300000, and s is a string consisting of characters '.' and 'X' with length |s| such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 300000. The total length of all strings across queries does not exceed 300000.
def func_7(n):
    return 2 ** (n - 1).bit_length()
    #The program returns 2 raised to the power of the bit length of (n - 1), which corresponds to the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to n.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to `n`. It calculates this by returning `2` raised to the power of the bit length of `(n - 1)`, ensuring that the result meets the condition even for edge cases where `n` is 1.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer representing the number of queries (1 ≤ x ≤ 300000), and r is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (a, b) such that (1 ≤ b < a ≤ 300000) and a string s consisting of characters '.' and 'X' (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 300000), with the total length of all strings in r not exceeding 300000.
def func_8(x, r):
    return (x + r - 1) // r
    #The program returns the result of the integer division of (x + r - 1) by r, where x is the number of queries and r is a list of tuples, resulting in an integer value based on the values of x and the length of r.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `x`, representing the number of queries, and a list `r` of tuples. It calculates and returns the result of the integer division of `(x + len(r) - 1)` by `len(r)`, where `len(r)` is the number of tuples in the list. The function does not utilize the contents of the tuples in `r` or any strings associated with them.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
