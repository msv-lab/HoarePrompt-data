You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Alice and Bob play a game. Initially they have a string s_1, s_2, ..., s_n, consisting of only characters . and X. They take alternating turns, and Alice is moving first. During each turn, the player has to select a contiguous substring consisting only of characters . and replaces each of them with X. Alice must select a substing of length a, and Bob must select a substring of length b. It is guaranteed that a > b.

For example, if s = ...X.. and a = 3, b = 2, then after Alice's move string can turn only into XXXX... And if it's Bob's turn and the string s = ...X.., then after Bob's move the string can turn into XX.X.., .XXX.. or ...XXX.

Whoever is unable to make a move, loses. You have to determine who wins if they both play optimally.

You have to answer q independent queries.

Input

The first line contains one integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of queries.

The first line of each query contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ b < a ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5).

The second line of each query contains the string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5), consisting of only characters . and X.

It is guaranteed that sum of all |s| over all queries not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each test case print YES if Alice can win and NO otherwise.

You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).

Example

Input


3
3 2
XX......XX...X
4 2
X...X.X..X
5 3
.......X..X


Output


YES
NO
YES

Note

In the first query Alice can select substring s_3 ... s_5. After that s turns into XXXXX...XX...X. After that, no matter what move Bob makes, Alice can make the move (this will be her second move), but Bob can't make his second move.

In the second query Alice can not win because she cannot even make one move.

In the third query Alice can choose substring s_2 ... s_6. After that s turns into .XXXXX.X..X, and Bob can't make a move after that.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:

The total length of all strings across queries does not exceed 300000.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is an integer less than `a`, `s` is a list of characters from the input strings containing at least one 'X', `cnt` is the count of 'X' characters in `s` that were preceded by at least one '.', `this` is the count of consecutive '.' characters before the last 'X', `flag` indicates whether an exception condition was met during the loop's execution. If an exception occurs in any iteration, 'NO' is printed; if no exceptions occur, 'NO' is printed if `cnt` is odd, otherwise 'YES'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer representing the length a (with 1 ≤ b < a ≤ 300000), y is an integer representing the length b (with 1 ≤ b < a ≤ 300000), and s is a string consisting of characters '.' and 'X' with a length of at least 1 and at most 300000, such that the sum of all lengths of s across all queries does not exceed 300000.

    #The program returns a list of integers from user input, split by spaces

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: f is an integer representing the number of queries (1 ≤ f ≤ 300000), each query consists of two integers a and b (1 ≤ b < a ≤ 300000) followed by a string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 300000) consisting only of characters '.' and 'X', and the total length of all strings s does not exceed 300000.

    #The program returns a list created by calling func_4 with the integer f and additional dimensions from dim, for each of the f queries if dim is not empty; otherwise, it returns the integer f.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: start is a string consisting only of characters '.' and 'X', step is a tuple of two integers (a, b) where 1 ≤ b < a ≤ 300,000, and count is an integer representing the number of queries (1 ≤ count ≤ 300,000) with the sum of lengths of all start strings not exceeding 300,000.
def func_5(start, step, count):
    return range(start, start + step * count, step)
    #The program returns a range starting from the string 'start' to 'start' plus 'step' multiplied by 'count', using 'step' as the increment.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ b < a ≤ 300000), followed by a string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 300000) consisting only of characters . and X. The total length of all strings in the list does not exceed 300000.
def func_6(l, start, end):
    return range(start, len(l) + end)
    #The program returns a range object starting from 'start' to 'len(l) + end', where 'len(l)' is the number of tuples in the list 'l' and 'end' is included in the calculation.

def func_7(n):
    return 2 ** (n - 1).bit_length()
    #The program returns 2 raised to the power of the bit length of (n - 1), which corresponds to the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to n.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer representing the number of queries (1 ≤ x ≤ 300000), and r is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (a, b) such that (1 ≤ b < a ≤ 300000) and a string s consisting of characters '.' and 'X' (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 300000), with the total length of all strings in r not exceeding 300000.
def func_8(x, r):
    return (x + r - 1) // r
    #The program returns the result of the integer division of (x + r - 1) by r, where x is the number of queries and r is a list of tuples, resulting in an integer value based on the values of x and the length of r.

The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
