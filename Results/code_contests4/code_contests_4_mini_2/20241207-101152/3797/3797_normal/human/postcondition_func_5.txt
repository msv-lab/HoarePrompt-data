The function `func_6` accepts a list of tuples `l` and two integers `start` and `end`. It returns a range object that starts at `start` and goes up to `len(l) + end`, where `len(l)` is the number of tuples in the list. The function does not validate the input parameters; hence, it does not handle cases where `start` is greater than `len(l) + end`, which could lead to an empty range. Also, the function does not consider any potential issues related to negative values for `start` or `end`, which could yield unintended range outputs.
