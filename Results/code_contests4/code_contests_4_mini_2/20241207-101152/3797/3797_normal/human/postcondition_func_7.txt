The function accepts an integer `x`, representing the number of queries, and a list `r` of tuples. It calculates and returns the result of the integer division of `(x + len(r) - 1)` by `len(r)`, where `len(r)` is the number of tuples in the list. The function does not utilize the contents of the tuples in `r` or any strings associated with them.
