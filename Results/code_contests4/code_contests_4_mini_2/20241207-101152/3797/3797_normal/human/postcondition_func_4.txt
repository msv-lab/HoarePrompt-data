The function accepts a string `start`, a tuple `step` containing two integers (a, b), and an integer `count`. It returns a range object starting from the integer value of `start` and extending to `start` plus `step` multiplied by `count`, using `step` as the increment. However, since `start` is a string, this will raise a TypeError when trying to create a range, indicating that the provided annotations are misleading about the type expected for `start`. The function does not handle input validation for the type of `start`, which should be an integer for the range to work correctly.
