The function accepts an integer `f`, which represents the number of queries. It returns a list of results generated by recursively calling `func_4` with `f` and additional dimensions from `dim` for each of the `f` queries if `dim` is not empty; otherwise, it returns the integer `f`. However, the code appears to be incomplete without a proper definition or context for `dim`, which could lead to a potential `NameError` if `dim` is not defined in the scope of the function execution.
