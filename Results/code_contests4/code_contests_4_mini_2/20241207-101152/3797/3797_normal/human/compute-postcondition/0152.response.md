Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are the outputs of `func_3()`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string plus 'X' containing at least 2 characters, `c` is the second character in `s`. If `flag` is True, an exception is raised. If `flag` is False, the program continues execution without raising an exception.***
