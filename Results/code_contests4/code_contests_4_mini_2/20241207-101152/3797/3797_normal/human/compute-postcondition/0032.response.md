Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is an integer less than `a`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 2 characters (including 'X'), and `c` is the next character in the list. If `flag` is true, an exception is raised and the values of `a`, `b`, `s`, and `c` remain unchanged. There is no else part in the code, so the program state is unaffected when `flag` is false.***
