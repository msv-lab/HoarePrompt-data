Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is an integer less than `a`, `s` is a list of characters containing at least one 'X' and one additional 'X' at the end, `cnt` is 0, `this` is greater than 0 and less than `a`, `flag` is True, `c` is 'X', and `2 * b` is less than or equal to `this`. If `this` is less than `a`, the conditions remain satisfied, and an exception has been raised.***
