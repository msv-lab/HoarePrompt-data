Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is an integer less than `a`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 1 character and 'X' appended, `cnt` is 0, `this` is initialized to 0, `flag` is set to True, `c` is the first character in the list `s`, `c` is 'X', and `this` is greater than 0. If `2 * b` is less than or equal to `this`, then an exception is raised since `this` is less than `a`. Otherwise, no action is taken as there is no else part.***
