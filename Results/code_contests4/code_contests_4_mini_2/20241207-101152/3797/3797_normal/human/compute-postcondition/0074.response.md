The `raise` statement is used to trigger an exception. The values of the variables do not change, but an exception is raised which interrupts the normal flow of the program. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is an integer less than `a`, `s` is a list of characters containing at least one 'X' and one additional 'X' at the end, `cnt` is 0, `this` is greater than 0, `flag` is True, `c` is 'X', and `2 * b` is less than or equal to `this`, and an exception has been raised.
