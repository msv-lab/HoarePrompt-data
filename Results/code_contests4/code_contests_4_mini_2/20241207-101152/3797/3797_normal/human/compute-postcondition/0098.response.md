The value of `this` is assigned to 0, and it does not affect the previous value of `cnt`, which is increased by 1 prior to this operation. The output state reflects the unchanged nature of `cnt` and the newly assigned value of `this`. 

Output State: **variable `cnt` is increased by 1; `this` is 0**
