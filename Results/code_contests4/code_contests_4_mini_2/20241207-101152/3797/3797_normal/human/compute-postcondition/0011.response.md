Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is an integer less than `a`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 1 character and 'X' appended, `cnt` is 0, `this` is initialized to 0, `flag` is set to False, `c` is the first character in the list `s`, `c` is 'X', and `this` is greater than 0. If `b` is less than or equal to `this` and `this` is less than `a`, or if `this` is greater than or equal to `a + 4 * b - 1`, an exception is raised. Otherwise, no action is taken as there is no else part.***
