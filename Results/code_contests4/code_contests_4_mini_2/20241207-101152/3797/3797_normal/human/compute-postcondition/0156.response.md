Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are the outputs of `func_3()`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string plus 'X' containing at least 2 characters, `c` is the second character in `s`. If `2 * b` is less than or equal to `this`, and if `this` is less than `a`, an unhandled exception is raised because `flag` is True.***
