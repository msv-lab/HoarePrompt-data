Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are the outputs of `func_3()`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string plus 'X' containing at least 3 characters, and `c` is the third character in `s`. If `c` is 'X' and `this` is greater than 0, then `cnt` is incremented by 1 and `this` is set to 0. Otherwise, if `c` is not 'X' or `this` is not greater than 0, and if `c` is equal to '.', then `this` is increased by 1.***
