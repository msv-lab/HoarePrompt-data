The `raise` statement is used to raise an exception, which does not change the values of the variables but indicates that an error or exception has occurred. Therefore, the output state reflects that an exception has been raised without altering the values of the variables. 

Output State: **`a` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is an integer less than `a`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 1 character and 'X' appended, `cnt` is 0, `this` is initialized to 0, `flag` is set to True, `c` is the first character in the list `s`, `c` is 'X', `this` is greater than 0, `2 * b` is less than or equal to `this`, `this` is less than `a` and an exception has been raised.**
