Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is an integer less than `a`, `s` is a list of characters containing at least one 'X' and one additional 'X' at the end, `c` is the next character in the list, and `flag` is set to True. If `2 * b` is less than or equal to `this`, an exception is raised if `this` is less than `a`. Otherwise, no operation occurs.***
