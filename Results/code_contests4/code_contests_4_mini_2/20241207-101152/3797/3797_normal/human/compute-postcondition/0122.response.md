The variable `s` is assigned the value of `list(input())`, where `input()` accepts a string input from the user, and `list()` converts that string into a list of its characters. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the output of `func_3()`, `b` is the output of `func_3()`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string.

Output State: **`a` is the output of `func_3()`, `b` is the output of `func_3()`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string**.
