The `raise` statement is used to trigger an exception in Python. In this case, we do not have enough context to determine what specific exception is being raised, but it interrupts the normal flow of the program. The values of the variables themselves do not change as a result of this statement. Therefore, the Output State reflects that an exception has been raised.

Output State: **`a` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is an integer less than `a`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 2 characters (including 'X'), `c` is the next character in the list, and an exception has been raised.**
