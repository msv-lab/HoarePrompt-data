Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `s`, `c`, and `this` are defined as per the precondition. If `flag` is true, an exception is raised due to the conditions involving `a`, `b`, and `this`. If `flag` is false, no exception occurs and the program continues without any changes to the values of `a`, `b`, `s`, `c`, and `this`.***
