Postcondition: ***`a` is the output of `func_3()`, `b` is the output of `func_3()`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string plus 'X', `s` has at least 1 character, `c` is the first character in `s`, `c` is 'X', `this` is greater than 0. If either `b` is less than or equal to `this` and `this` is less than `a`, or `this` is greater than or equal to `a + 4 * b - 1, an exception is raised.`***
