Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is an integer less than `a`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 2 characters (including 'X'), `c` is the next character in the list, and if `this` is less than `a`, `flag` remains True indicating that an exception has been raised. If `2 * b` is less than or equal to `this`, the conditions for raising the exception are not met, and no changes to `flag` occur.***
