The variable `cnt` is initialized to 0, but no other variables are affected by this line of code. The values of `a`, `b`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the output of `func_3()`, `b` is the output of `func_3()`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string plus 'X'; `cnt` is initialized to 0.

Output State: **`a` is the output of `func_3()`, `b` is the output of `func_3()`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string plus 'X'; `cnt` is initialized to 0**
