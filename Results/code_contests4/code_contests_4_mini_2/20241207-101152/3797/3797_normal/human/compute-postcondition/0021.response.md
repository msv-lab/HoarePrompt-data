The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cnt` is 0 (as per the initial state). Therefore, after execution, `cnt` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`a` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is an integer less than `a`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 1 character and 'X' appended, `cnt` is 1, `this` is initialized to 0, `flag` is set to True, `c` is 'X', and `this` is greater than 0.**
