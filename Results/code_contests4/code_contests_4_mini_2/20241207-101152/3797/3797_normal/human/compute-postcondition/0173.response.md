The variable `this` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `this` is unknown since it wasn't defined in the initial state. The other variables `a`, `b`, `s`, and `c` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are the outputs of `func_3()`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string plus 'X' containing at least 3 characters, `c` is the third character in `s`, and `this` is increased by 1.
