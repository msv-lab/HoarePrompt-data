The `raise` statement is used to raise an exception. In this case, while no specific exception is mentioned, it indicates that an error or exception is being triggered. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, `s`, and `c` remain unchanged, but the program flow is interrupted due to the exception being raised. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are the outputs of `func_3()`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string plus 'X' containing at least 2 characters, `c` is the second character in `s`, and an exception is raised.
