The value of `this` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `this` is unknown, so the output state reflects that `this` has been increased by 1. The other variables (`a`, `b`, `s`, `c`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are the outputs of `func_3()`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string plus 'X' containing at least 2 characters, `c` is the second character in `s`, and `this` is increased by 1.
