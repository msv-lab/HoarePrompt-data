The code `s.append('X')` adds the character 'X' to the end of the list `s`. This operation does not affect the values of `a`, `b`, `cnt`, or `this`. However, it increases the length of the list `s` by one and adds 'X' as its last element. 

Thus, considering the initial states of the variables, the output state reflects the change in the list `s`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is an integer less than `a`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string containing at least one 'X' and one additional 'X' at the end, `cnt` is the count of 'X' characters in `s` that were preceded by at least one '.', `this` is the count of consecutive '.' characters before the last 'X'.**
