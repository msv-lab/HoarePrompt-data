Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are the outputs of `func_3()`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string plus 'X' containing at least 3 characters, `c` is the third character in `s`; if `2 * b` is less than or equal to `this`, `flag` is set to True and an exception is raised if `this` is less than `a`.***
