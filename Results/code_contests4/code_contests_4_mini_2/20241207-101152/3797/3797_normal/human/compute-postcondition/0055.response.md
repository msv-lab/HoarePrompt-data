Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is an integer less than `a`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 2 characters (including 'X'), and `c` is the next character in the list. If `c` is 'X' and `this` is greater than 0, `flag` remains True indicating that an exception has been raised, and `cnt` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `c` is a period ('.'), then `this` is increased by 1; if `c` is not a period, `this` remains unchanged.***
