Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are the outputs of `func_3()`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string plus 'X' containing at least 2 characters, and `c` is the second character in `s`. If `c` is 'X' and `this` is greater than 0, `cnt` is increased by 1 and `this` is set to 0. If `c` is not 'X' or if `this` is not greater than 0, and if `c` equals '.', then `this` is increased by 1.***
