The code appends the character 'X' to the list `s`. The previous values of `a` and `b` are not affected by this operation, and only the list `s` changes. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the output of `func_3()`, `b` is the output of `func_3()`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string plus 'X'.

Output State: **`a` is the output of `func_3()`, `b` is the output of `func_3()`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string plus 'X'**
