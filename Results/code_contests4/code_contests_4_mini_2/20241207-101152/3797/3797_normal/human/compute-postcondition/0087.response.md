Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is an integer less than `a`, `s` is a list of characters containing at least one 'X' and one additional 'X' at the end. If `c` is 'X' and `this` is greater than 0, then `cnt` is 1, `this` is now 0, `flag` is True, and `2 * b` is less than or equal to `this`. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0, `this` is now 1 or greater, `flag` is False, and `c` is '.'***
