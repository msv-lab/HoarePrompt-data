The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `cnt` is unknown. The other variables (`a`, `b`, `s`, `c`, `flag`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is an integer less than `a`, `s` is a list of characters containing at least one 'X' and one additional 'X' at the end, `c` is the next character in the list, `flag` is True, and `cnt` is increased by 1.
