The value of `flag` is assigned `False`, but this does not affect the values of any other variables (`a`, `b`, `s`, `cnt`, `this`). Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the output of `func_3()`, `b` is the output of `func_3()`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string plus 'X'; `cnt` is initialized to 0; `this` is 0; `flag` is False.
