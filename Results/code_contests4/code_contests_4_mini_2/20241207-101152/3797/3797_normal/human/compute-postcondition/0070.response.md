The `raise` statement is used to trigger an exception, which interrupts the normal flow of the program. Since no specific exception is specified, it will raise a generic `RuntimeError`. The values of the variables will not change, but this statement will cause the program to stop execution and signal that an error has occurred. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is an integer less than `a`, `s` is a list of characters containing at least one 'X' and one additional 'X' at the end, `cnt` is 0, `this` is 0, `flag` is False, `c` is 'X', `this` is greater than 0, and an exception has been raised.
