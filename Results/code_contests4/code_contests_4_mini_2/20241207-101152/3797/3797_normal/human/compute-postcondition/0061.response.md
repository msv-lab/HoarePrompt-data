The values of `a` and `b` are assigned the output of the function `func_3()`. The specific values returned by `func_3()` are unknown based on the initial state, but we know that `a` will remain an integer greater than 1, and `b` will remain an integer less than `a`. Other variables such as `s`, `cnt`, and `this` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is an integer less than `a`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string containing at least one 'X', `cnt` is the count of 'X' characters in `s` that were preceded by at least one '.', `this` is the count of consecutive '.' characters before the last 'X'.

Output State: **`a` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is an integer less than `a`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string containing at least one 'X', `cnt` is the count of 'X' characters in `s` that were preceded by at least one '.', `this` is the count of consecutive '.' characters before the last 'X'.**
