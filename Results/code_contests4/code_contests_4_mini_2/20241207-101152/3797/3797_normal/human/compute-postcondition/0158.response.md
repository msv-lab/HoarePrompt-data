The variable `this` is assigned the value of 0. The values of `a`, `b`, `s`, `c`, and `cnt` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are the outputs of `func_3()`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string plus 'X' containing at least 2 characters, `c` is the second character in `s`, `cnt` is increased by 1, and `this` is 0.
