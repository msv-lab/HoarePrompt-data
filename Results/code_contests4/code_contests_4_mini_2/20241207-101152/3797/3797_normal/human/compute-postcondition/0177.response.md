Output State: **`a` and `b` are the outputs of `func_3()`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string plus 'X', `cnt` is the count of 'X's encountered in `s` where the preceding `this` was greater than 0, `this` is the count of consecutive '.' characters encountered before the last 'X', `flag` indicates whether the first 'X' has been encountered after a valid `this` count; if `cnt` is even, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.**
