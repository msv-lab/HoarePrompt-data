Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is an integer less than `a`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 2 characters (including 'X'), and `c` is the next character in the list. If `c` is '.', then `this` is increased by 1. If `c` is not '.', `this` remains unchanged.***
