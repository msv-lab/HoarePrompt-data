The loop implements the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the integers `x` and `y`. The loop continues until `y` becomes zero. 

After all iterations of the loop have executed, `x` will be the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`, and `y` will be 0.

Output State: **`x` is the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`, `y` is 0.**
