The program could raise an exception in the `try` block when any of the conditions that involve the `raise` statement are met, specifically when checking the values of `this`, `a`, and `b`. The conditions include:

1. `if b <= this < a or a + 4 * b - 1 <= this:` - This condition checks if `this` falls within certain bounds related to `a` and `b`.
2. `if flag:` - This condition checks if the first 'X' has been encountered after a valid `this` count, potentially raising an exception if it has.
3. `if this < a:` - This condition checks if `this` is less than `a`, which might also raise an exception.

If any of these conditions are true, an exception is raised, leading to the execution of the `except` block where 'NO' is printed. If no exceptions are raised, the program iterates through `s`, counts the 'X's, and prints 'YES' if `cnt` is even or 'NO' if it is odd.

Therefore, the output state is: `a` and `b` are the outputs of `func_3()`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string plus 'X', `cnt` is the count of 'X's encountered in `s` where the preceding `this` was greater than 0, `this` is the count of consecutive '.' characters encountered before the last 'X', `flag` indicates whether the first 'X' has been encountered after a valid `this` count; if `cnt` is even, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. If an exception occurs, the output will be 'NO'.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are the outputs of `func_3()`. If no exceptions are raised, `cnt` is the count of 'X's encountered in `s` where the preceding `this` was greater than 0, and if `cnt` is even, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. If an exception occurs, 'NO' is printed.**
