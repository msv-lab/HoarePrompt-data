Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is an integer less than `a`, `s` is a list of characters containing at least one 'X' and one additional 'X' at the end, `c` is the next character in the list, and `flag` is True. If `c` is 'X' and `this` is greater than 0, `cnt` is increased by 1 and `this` is set to 0. Otherwise, if `c` is '.', `this` is increased by 1; if `c` is not equal to '.', the value of `this` remains unchanged.***
