The value of `this` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `this` is initialized to 0. Therefore, after execution, `this` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`a` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is an integer less than `a`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 1 character and 'X' appended, `cnt` is 0, `this` is 1, `flag` is set to False, `c` is '.', and it is not the case that `c` is 'X' or `this` is greater than 0.**
