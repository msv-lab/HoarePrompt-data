The `raise` statement is used to trigger an exception in Python. In this case, it will raise the last exception that was caught, or if there is no active exception, it will raise a `RuntimeError`. The state of the variables does not change as nothing is assigned or modified. Therefore, the output state will reflect that an exception is raised.

Output State: **`a` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is an integer less than `a`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 1 character and 'X' appended, `cnt` is 0, `this` is initialized to 0, `flag` is set to True, `c` is the first character in the list `s`, `c` is 'X', `this` is greater than 0, `2 * b` is less than or equal to `this` and an exception is raised.**
