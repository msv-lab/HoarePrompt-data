The function `func_8` accepts two parameters: `x` and `r`. `x` is an integer representing the number of queries, constrained by (1 ≤ x ≤ 300000). The parameter `r` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers (a, b) satisfying (1 ≤ b < a ≤ 300000) and a string `s` consisting of characters '.' and 'X', with the constraint that the total length of all strings in `r` does not exceed 300000. 

After executing the function body, it returns the result of the integer division of (x + r - 1) by r, which results in an integer value based on the values of `x` and the length of `r`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_8` is to accept an integer `x` representing the number of queries and a list `r` of tuples containing specific constraints, and return the result of an integer division based on these inputs. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer parameter x representing the number of queries and a list of tuples r. It returns the result of the integer division of (x + r - 1) by r.**
