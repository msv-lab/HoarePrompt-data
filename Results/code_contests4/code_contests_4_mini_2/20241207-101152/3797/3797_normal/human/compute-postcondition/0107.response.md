The value of `flag` is set to True, but since it is already True, no changes occur. An exception is raised, and as a result, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is an integer less than `a`, `s` is a list of characters containing at least one 'X' and one additional 'X' at the end, `c` is the next character in the list, and `flag` is True.
