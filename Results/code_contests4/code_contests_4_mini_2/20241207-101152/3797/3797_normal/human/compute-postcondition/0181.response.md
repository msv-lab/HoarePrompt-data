The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it processes multiple queries, where each query consists of two integers `a` and `b` and a string `s`. The integers are constrained by the conditions (1 ≤ b < a ≤ 300000), and the string `s` consists solely of the characters '.' and 'X', with its length constrained by (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 300000). The total length of all strings across all queries does not exceed 300000. 

Based on the output information provided, the function likely processes these queries and returns results based on the values of `a`, `b`, and the string `s`. However, the exact return value or behavior based on these inputs is not specified in the output description.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple queries consisting of two integers `a` and `b` and a string `s`, where `a` and `b` are constrained by (1 ≤ b < a ≤ 300000) and `s` consists of characters '.' and 'X' with length constraints. The function returns results based on these inputs.**
