The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are integers that represent lengths, with the constraints that 1 ≤ y < x ≤ 300000. The function returns the GCD (greatest common divisor) of the original values of `x` and `y`. If `y` is 0, the function returns `x`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters x and y, both integers representing lengths, and returns the GCD of x and y, which is x if y is 0.**
