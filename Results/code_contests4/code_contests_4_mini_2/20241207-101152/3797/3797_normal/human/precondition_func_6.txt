n is a positive integer representing the number of queries, and for each query, a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ b < a ≤ 300000, and s is a string consisting of characters '.' and 'X' with length |s| such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 300000. The total length of all strings across queries does not exceed 300000.
