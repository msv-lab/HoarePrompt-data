The function accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. If `y` is initially 0, it returns `x` as the GCD, otherwise, it computes the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm. The function does not handle cases where `x` or `y` are negative, which may lead to unexpected results.
