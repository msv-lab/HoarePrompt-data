Precondition: **x is an integer representing the number of queries (1 ≤ x ≤ 300000), and r is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (a, b) such that (1 ≤ b < a ≤ 300000) and a string s consisting of characters '.' and 'X' (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 300000), with the total length of all strings in r not exceeding 300000.**
