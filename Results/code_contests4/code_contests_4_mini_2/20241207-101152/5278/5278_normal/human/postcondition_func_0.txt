The function reads two positive integers `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of packages and `k` is the number of trucks available. It then reads `n` weights of packages into a list. The function calculates the minimum capacity required for the trucks to transport all packages based on the constraints given by `k`. If `k` is 1, the minimum capacity is equal to the total weight of all packages. If `n` equals `k`, the minimum capacity is the weight of the heaviest package. For other cases, it uses a binary search to determine the minimum truck capacity required to transport all packages without exceeding `k` trucks. Note that the function does not return any value; it calculates `minP`, which holds the result of the minimum capacity but does not output or return it.
