The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing it from 1 to 2. The states of the other variables (`loadings`, `n`, `middle`, `truckCnt`, and `k`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `loadings` is equal to `w[1]`, `n` is greater than 1, `middle` is less than `loadings`, `truckCnt` is increased by 1, and `k` is less than `truckCnt + 1`, exiting the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `loadings` is equal to `w[1]`, `n` is greater than 1, `middle` is less than `loadings`, `truckCnt` is increased by 1, and `k` is less than `truckCnt + 1, exiting the most internal loop or if statement.**
