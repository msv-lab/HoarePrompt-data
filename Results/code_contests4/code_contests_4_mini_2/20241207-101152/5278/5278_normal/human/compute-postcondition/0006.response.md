The `w` list is modified by appending the value of `num` to it. Since `w` is initially an empty list, after executing the code, `w` will contain the single value of `num`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 100,000, `w` is a list containing `num`, `maxW` is 0, `sumW` is `sumW + num`, `i` is 0, and `num` is an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 100,000, `w` is a list containing `num`, `maxW` is 0, `sumW` is `sumW + num`, `i` is 0, `num` is an input integer.**
