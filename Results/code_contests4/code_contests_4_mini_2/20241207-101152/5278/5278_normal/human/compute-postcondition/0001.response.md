The code initializes an empty list `w`. The previous values of the affected variables (`n`, `k`, and any `w_i`) remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State reflects that `w` is now an empty list while maintaining the values of `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 100,000; `w` is an empty list.**
