Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 100,000, `w` is a list containing `num`, if `maxW` is less than `num`, then `maxW` is updated to `num`, `sumW` is updated to `sumW + num`, `i` is 0, and `num` is an input integer.***
