The variable `loadings` is assigned the value of `w[i]`. Given that `i` is 1, `loadings` will be updated to `w[1]`. The previous values of `truckCnt` and `k` do not affect this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 1; `loadings` is `w[1]`; `truckCnt` is increased by 1, and if `k` is less than `truckCnt + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `loadings` is `w[1]`; `truckCnt` is increased by 1, and if `k` is less than `truckCnt + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop.**
