The value of `sumW` is updated by adding `num` to it. The initial state indicates that `sumW` is already defined and is updated to `sumW + num`. The values of `n`, `k`, `w`, `maxW`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the updated value of `sumW`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 100,000; `w` now includes `num`; `maxW` is less than or equal to `num`; `sumW` is updated to `sumW + num`; `i` is 2; `num` is an input integer.**
