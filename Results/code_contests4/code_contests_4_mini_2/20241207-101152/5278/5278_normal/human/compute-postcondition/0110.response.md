The values of `truckCnt`, `i`, and `loadings` are all assigned to 0. This means that after execution, `truckCnt`, `i`, and `loadings` will all be 0. The previous values are now overwritten. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `loadings` is 0, `truckCnt` is 0, and `middle` is unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `loadings` is 0, `truckCnt` is 0, and `middle` is unchanged**.
