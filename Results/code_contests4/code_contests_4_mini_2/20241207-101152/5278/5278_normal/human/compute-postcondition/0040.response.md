The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000; `k` is a positive integer greater than 1; `w` is a list containing `n` input integers; `sumW` is the sum of the integers in `w`; `maxW` is the maximum integer from `w`; `minP` is 0; `left` is `maxW`; `right` is 1000000000; `middle` is (maxW + 1000000000) // 2; `truckCnt` is increased by 1; `i` is 0; `loadings` is increased by `w[0]`; `middle` is less than `loadings`; and `k` is less than `truckCnt + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
