The variable `loadings` is assigned the value of `w[i]`, where `i` is 2. The previous state indicated that `loadings` had been updated to `loadings + w[2]`, so now `loadings` will simply take the value of `w[2]`. The values of `n`, `middle`, and `truckCnt` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `loadings` is `w[2]`, `n` is greater than 1, `middle` is less than `loadings`, and `truckCnt` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `loadings` is `w[2]`, `n` is greater than 1, `middle` is less than `loadings`, and `truckCnt` is increased by 1.**
