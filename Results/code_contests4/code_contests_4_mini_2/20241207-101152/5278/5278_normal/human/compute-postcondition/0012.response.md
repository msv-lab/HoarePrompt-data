The value of `sumW` is updated by adding `num` to it. Since `num` is an input integer, we can denote the new value of `sumW` as `sumW + num`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 100,000; `w` is a list containing `num`; `maxW` is updated to `num` if `num` is greater than `maxW`; `sumW` is updated to `sumW + num` (new value); `i` is 1; `num` is an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 100,000; `w` is a list containing `num`; `maxW` is updated to `num` if `num` is greater than `maxW`; `sumW` is updated to `sumW + num`; `i` is 1; `num` is an input integer.**
