Postcondition: ***`i` is equal to `n`, `loadings` is the sum of `w[0]` to `w[n-1]` until `middle` is less than `loadings`, and `truckCnt` reflects the number of trucks counted until that point. If `k` is less than `truckCnt + 1`, then `minP` remains unchanged, `truckCnt + 1` is greater than `k`, and `left` is assigned the value of `middle + 1`. Otherwise, `right` is assigned the value of `middle - 1`.***
