According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is set to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 2 for the next iteration.

Since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000, and we are currently at `i` equal to 1, the condition for the loop to execute again is that `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 100,000, `w` now includes `num`, `maxW` is less than or equal to `num`, `sumW` is updated to `sumW + num`, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1.**
