The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 3, `loadings` is updated to `loadings + w[2]`, `n` is greater than 1, `middle` is less than `loadings`, and `truckCnt` is increased by 1 if `middle` is less than `loadings`.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `loadings` is updated to `loadings + w[2]`, `n` is greater than 1, `middle` is less than `loadings`, and `truckCnt` is increased by 1 if `middle` is less than `loadings`.**
