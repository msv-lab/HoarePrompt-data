Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 100,000; `w` is a list containing `n` input integers; `sumW` is the sum of the integers in `w`; `maxW` is the maximum integer from `w`; if `k` equals 1, then `minP` is equal to `sumW`. If `k` is greater than 1 and `n` equals `k`, then `minP` is equal to `maxW`. Otherwise, `minP` holds the minimum possible capacity required to transport the load with `k` trucks, `i` is equal to `n`, `loadings` is the sum of integers in `w` that fit within the constraints of the final `middle`, and `truckCnt` is the final count of trucks needed based on the loadings, while `k` and `w` remain unchanged.***
