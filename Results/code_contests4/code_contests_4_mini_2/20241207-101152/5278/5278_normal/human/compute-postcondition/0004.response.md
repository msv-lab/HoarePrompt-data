The variable `num` is assigned the value obtained from `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and converts it to an integer. The values of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `w`, `maxW`, `sumW`, `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 100,000, `w` is an empty list, `maxW` is 0, `sumW` is 0, `i` is 0; `num` is an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 100,000, `w` is an empty list, `maxW` is 0, `sumW` is 0, `i` is 0; `num` is an input integer.**
