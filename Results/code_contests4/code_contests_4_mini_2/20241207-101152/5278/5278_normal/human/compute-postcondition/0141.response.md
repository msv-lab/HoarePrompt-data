Postcondition: ***`i` is equal to `n`, `loadings` is the sum of `w[0]` to `w[n-1]` until `middle` is less than `loadings`, and `truckCnt` reflects the number of trucks counted until that point. `k` is less than `truckCnt + 1`, therefore `minP` remains unchanged, and `truckCnt + 1` is greater than `k`.***
