The value of `right` is assigned the value of `middle - 1`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `loadings`, `truckCnt`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is equal to `n`, `loadings` is equal to the sum of `w[0]` through `w[n-1]` (or less if `truckCnt` exceeds `k`), `truckCnt` is the number of trucks needed to transport the load, and `truckCnt + 1` is greater than `k`; `right` is now equal to `middle - 1`.
