The variable `minP` is initialized to 0. The values of `n`, `k`, `w`, `sumW`, and `maxW` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `minP` while maintaining the existing values of the other variables. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 100,000; `w` is a list containing `n` input integers; `sumW` is the sum of the integers in `w`; `maxW` is the maximum integer from `w`; `minP` is 0**.
