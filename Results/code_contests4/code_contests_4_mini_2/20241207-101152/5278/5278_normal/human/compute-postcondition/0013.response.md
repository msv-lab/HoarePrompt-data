The list `w` is updated by appending the value of `num` to it. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `maxW`, `sumW`, `i`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 100,000; `w` now includes `num`; `maxW` is updated to `num` if `num` is greater than `maxW`; `sumW` is updated to `sumW + num`; `i` is 1; `num` is an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 100,000; `w` now includes `num`; `maxW` is updated to `num` if `num` is greater than `maxW`; `sumW` is updated to `sumW + num`; `i` is 1; `num` is an input integer.**
