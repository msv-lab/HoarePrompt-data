`maxW` is assigned the value of `num`. Since `maxW` is updated to `num` if `num` is greater than `maxW`, and we don't have the previous value of `maxW`, we can only conclude that `maxW` will now equal `num`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 100,000; `w` now includes `num`; `sumW` is updated to `sumW + num`; `i` is 1; `num` is an input integer; `maxW` is now equal to `num`.
