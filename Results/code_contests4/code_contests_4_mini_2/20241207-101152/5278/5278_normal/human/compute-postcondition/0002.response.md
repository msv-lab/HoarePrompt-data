The variables `maxW` and `sumW` are both initialized to 0. The variables `n` and `k` retain their initial states as positive integers within the specified ranges, and `w` remains an empty list. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 100,000; `w` is an empty list; `maxW` is 0; `sumW` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 100,000; `w` is an empty list; `maxW` is 0; `sumW` is 0**
