`w` is updated by appending the value of `num` to it. The previous state of `w` now includes `num`, and this action does not affect the other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 100,000; `w` now includes `num` and the new value of `w` is `w` with `num` appended; `maxW` is less than or equal to `num`; `sumW` is updated to `sumW + num`; `i` is 2; `num` is an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 100,000; `w` now includes `num` appended; `maxW` is less than or equal to `num`; `sumW` is updated to `sumW + num`; `i` is 2; `num` is an input integer.**
