Given the initial state and the code snippet provided, the impact of the code is as follows:

1. `minP` is assigned the value of `sumW`.
2. The value of `sumW` is derived from the sum of the integers in list `w`.
3. Other variables (`n`, `k`, `w`, `maxW`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 100,000; `w` is a list containing `n` input integers; `sumW` is the sum of the integers in `w`; `maxW` is the maximum integer from `w`; `minP` is equal to `sumW`; `k` is equal to 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 100,000; `w` is a list containing `n` input integers; `sumW` is the sum of the integers in `w`; `maxW` is the maximum integer from `w`; `minP` is equal to `sumW`; `k` is equal to 1.**
