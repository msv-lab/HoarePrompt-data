The value of `sumW` is updated by adding the value of `num` to it. Since `num` is an input integer, its value is not known from the initial state. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 100,000, `w` is an empty list, `maxW` is 0, `sumW` is `sumW + num`, `i` is 0; `num` is an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 100,000, `w` is an empty list, `maxW` is 0, `sumW` is `sumW + num`, `i` is 0; `num` is an input integer.**
