The variable `loadings` is incremented by the value of `w[i]`. The current value of `i` is 1, so `loadings` will be updated to `loadings + w[1]`. The variable `n` is stated to be greater than 1 to allow for the loop to execute again, but it does not affect the immediate calculation. The values of the other variables are not specified, so we cannot determine a specific numerical output for `loadings`. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1; `loadings` is updated by adding `w[1]`.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `loadings` is updated by adding `w[1]`**
