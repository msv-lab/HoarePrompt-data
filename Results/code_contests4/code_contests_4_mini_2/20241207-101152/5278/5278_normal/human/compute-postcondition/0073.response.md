According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is 0, and `n` is unspecified. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0. Therefore, `n` needs to be adjusted to ensure that it is greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time then `n` must be greater than 0**
