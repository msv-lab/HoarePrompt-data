The value of `truckCnt` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `truckCnt` is unknown. The values of `i`, `loadings`, and `middle` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `loadings` has been updated by adding `w[0]`, `middle` is less than `loadings`, and `truckCnt` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `loadings` has been updated by adding `w[0]`, `middle` is less than `loadings`, and `truckCnt` is increased by 1.**
