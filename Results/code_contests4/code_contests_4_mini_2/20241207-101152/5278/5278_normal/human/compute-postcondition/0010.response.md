According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop is designed to execute for `i` values starting from 0 up to (but not including) `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, which means the loop has executed once and is preparing to execute again. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 1. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `i` must be less than `n`. Given that `n` is a positive integer in the range of 1 to 100,000, and since `i` is currently 0, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute a second time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 100,000, `w` is a list containing `num`, if `maxW` is less than `num`, then `maxW` is updated to `num`, `sumW` is updated to `sumW + num`, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
