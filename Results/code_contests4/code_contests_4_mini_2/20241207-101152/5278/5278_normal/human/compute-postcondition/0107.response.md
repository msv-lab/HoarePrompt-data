Postcondition: ***`i` is equal to `n`, `loadings` is equal to the sum of `w[0]` through `w[n-1]`, and `truckCnt` is the number of trucks needed to transport the load. If `k` is less than `truckCnt + 1`, then `minP` is assigned the value of `middle` and `left` is assigned the value of `middle + 1`. Otherwise, `truckCnt + 1` is greater than `k` and `right` is equal to `middle - 1.***
