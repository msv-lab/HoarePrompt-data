Postcondition: ***`i` is equal to `n`, `loadings` is equal to the sum of `w[0]` through `w[n-1]` (or less if `truckCnt` exceeds `k`), `truckCnt` is the number of trucks needed to transport the load, and `k` is less than `truckCnt + 1`. If `truckCnt + 1` is less than or equal to `k`, then `minP` is assigned the value of `middle`.***
