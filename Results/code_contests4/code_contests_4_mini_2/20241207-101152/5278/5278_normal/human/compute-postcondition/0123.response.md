The value of `truckCnt` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `truckCnt` is unknown. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1; `loadings` is updated by adding `w[1]`; `truckCnt` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `loadings` is updated by adding `w[1]`; `truckCnt` is increased by 1**
