The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous state indicates that `loadings` has already been updated to `w[i]`, and the conditions regarding `middle`, `truckCnt`, and `k` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, only the value of `i` changes, and the overall state of the other variables remains the same.

Output State: **`i` is increased by 1, `loadings` is updated to `w[i]`, and there are no changes to `truckCnt`.**
