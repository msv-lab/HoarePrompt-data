The value of `loadings` is updated by adding the value of `w[i]` to it. Since `i` is 2, the new value of `loadings` will be `loadings + w[2]`. The values of `truckCnt`, `k`, and `middle` remain unchanged, and `n` is still greater than 2, allowing the loop to execute again. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `loadings` is now `loadings + w[2]`, `truckCnt` is unchanged, `k` is unchanged, `middle` is unchanged, and `n` is greater than 2.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `loadings` is now `loadings + w[2]`, `truckCnt` is unchanged, `k` is unchanged, `middle` is unchanged, and `n` is greater than 2.**
