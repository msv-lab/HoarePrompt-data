Postcondition: ***`i` is equal to `n`, `loadings` is the sum of `w[0]` to `w[n-1]` until `middle` is less than `loadings`, and `truckCnt` reflects the number of trucks counted until that point. If `truckCnt + 1` is less than or equal to `k`, then `minP` is assigned the value of `middle`, and `truckCnt + 1` remains less than or equal to `k`.***
