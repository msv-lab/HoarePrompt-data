According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100,000, the loop will execute at least once because `n` is guaranteed to be at least 1. The loop variable `i` will start at 0 for the first iteration.

Therefore, the states do not need to be adjusted in terms of ensuring the loop executes, but we can note the initial state of `i`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 100,000, `w` is an empty list, `maxW` is 0, `sumW` is 0, `i` is 0**
