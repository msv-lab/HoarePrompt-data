The value of `minP` is assigned the value of `maxW`. Since `maxW` is the maximum integer from the list `w`, `minP` will now hold this maximum value. The states of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `w`, `sumW`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000; `k` is a positive integer such that `k` is greater than 1; `w` is a list containing `n` input integers; `sumW` is the sum of the integers in `w`; `maxW` is the maximum integer from `w`; `minP` is equal to `maxW`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000; `k` is a positive integer such that `k` is greater than 1; `w` is a list containing `n` input integers; `sumW` is the sum of the integers in `w`; `maxW` is the maximum integer from `w`; `minP` is equal to `maxW`.**
