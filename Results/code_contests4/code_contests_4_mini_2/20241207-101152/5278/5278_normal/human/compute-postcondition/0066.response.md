The value of `left` is assigned the value of `middle + 1`. The other variables (`i`, `loadings`, `truckCnt`, `k`, and `w`) remain unchanged. There are no changes to their states. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `n`, `loadings` is the sum of the integers in `w` that fit within the constraints of `middle`, `truckCnt` is the number of trucks needed to transport the loadings based on the maximum capacity defined by `middle`, `k` is the initial value of `k`, `w` remains unchanged, and `left` is `middle + 1`.
