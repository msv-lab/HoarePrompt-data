Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `loadings` is the sum of `w[0]` to `w[n-1]` until `middle` is less than `loadings`, at which point `truckCnt` is incremented, and if `k` is less than `truckCnt + 1`, the loop breaks; if not broken, `loadings` is reset to the last `w[i]` value and the loop continues until `i` reaches `n`. If the loop breaks before completion, `truckCnt` will reflect the number of trucks counted until that point.**
