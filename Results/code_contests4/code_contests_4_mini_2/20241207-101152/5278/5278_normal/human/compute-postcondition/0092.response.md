The value of `loadings` is increased by `w[i]`. Since `i` is 2, `loadings` is updated to `loadings + w[2]`. The other variables `n`, `middle`, and `truckCnt` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `loadings` is updated to `loadings + w[2]`, `n` is greater than 1, `middle` is less than `loadings`, `truckCnt` is increased by 1, and for the loop to execute again `n` is greater than 2.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `loadings` is updated to `loadings + w[2]`, `n` is greater than 1, `middle` is less than `loadings`, `truckCnt` is increased by 1, and for the loop to execute again `n` is greater than 2.**
