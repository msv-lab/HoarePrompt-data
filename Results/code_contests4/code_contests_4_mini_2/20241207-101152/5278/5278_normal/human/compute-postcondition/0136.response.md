The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The other variables (`loadings`, `n`, `middle`, `truckCnt`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 3, `loadings` is `loadings + w[2]`, `n` is greater than 2, `middle` is less than `loadings`, and `truckCnt` is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
