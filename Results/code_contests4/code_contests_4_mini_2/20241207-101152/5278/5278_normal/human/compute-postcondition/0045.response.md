According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been increased by 1. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` should be greater than `i` after the increment.

State: **variable `i` is increased by 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` is greater than the new value of `i`**
