The value of `loadings` is assigned the value of `w[i]`, where `i` is 0. Therefore, `loadings` is now equal to `w[0]`. The other variables, `i`, `middle`, and `truckCnt`, are not affected by this assignment. Thus, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `loadings` is `w[0]`, `middle` is less than `loadings`, and `truckCnt` has been increased by 1. 

Output State: **`i` is 0, `loadings` is `w[0]`, `middle` is less than `loadings`, and `truckCnt` has been increased by 1**
