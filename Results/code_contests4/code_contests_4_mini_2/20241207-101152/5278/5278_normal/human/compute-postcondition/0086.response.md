The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `loadings` is updated to `loadings + w[1]`, `n` must be greater than 1; `truckCnt` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
