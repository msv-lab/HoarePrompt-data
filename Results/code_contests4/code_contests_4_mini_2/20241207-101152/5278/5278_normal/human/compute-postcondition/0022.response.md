The loop processes `n` iterations, during which it collects `n` input integers into the list `w`, updates the cumulative sum `sumW`, and tracks the maximum value encountered in `maxW`. After all iterations are complete, `w` contains all `n` input integers, `sumW` is the total of those integers, and `maxW` reflects the largest integer among them. 

If `n` is 0 (though initially stated as a positive integer, the loop would not execute), both `sumW` and `maxW` would remain at their initialized values, and `w` would still be an empty list.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 100,000; `w` is a list containing `n` input integers; `sumW` is the sum of the integers in `w`; `maxW` is the maximum integer from `w`.**
