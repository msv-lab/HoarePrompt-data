The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The states of the other variables (`loadings`, `truckCnt`, `k`, `middle`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2; `loadings` is equal to `w[1]`; `truckCnt` is unchanged; `k` is unchanged; `middle` is unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2; `loadings` is equal to `w[1]`; `truckCnt` is unchanged; `k` is unchanged; `middle` is unchanged.**
