Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `loadings` has been updated to `loadings + w[2]`, `n` is greater than 1, `middle` is less than `loadings`, and `truckCnt` has been increased by 1. If `k` is less than `truckCnt + 1`, the loop breaks, ensuring that for the next iteration, `n` is greater than 2 and `truckCnt` is increased by 1.***
