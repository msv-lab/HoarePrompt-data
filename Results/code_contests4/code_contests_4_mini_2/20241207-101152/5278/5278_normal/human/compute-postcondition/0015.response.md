Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 100,000; `w` now includes `num`; if `maxW` is less than `num`, then `maxW` is updated to `num`, `sumW` is updated to `sumW + num`, and `i` is set to 1. Otherwise, `maxW` remains unchanged, and `sumW` is still updated to `sumW + num`, with `w` including `num` and `i` set to 1.***
