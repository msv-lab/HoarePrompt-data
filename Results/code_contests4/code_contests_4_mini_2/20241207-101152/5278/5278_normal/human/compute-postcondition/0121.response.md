According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. However, we do not have information about the value of `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1. 

State: **`i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1**
