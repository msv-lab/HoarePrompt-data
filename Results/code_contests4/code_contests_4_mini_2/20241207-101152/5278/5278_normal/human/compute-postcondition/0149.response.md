The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as indicated by the empty parentheses in the function definition. However, it operates on a set of constraints regarding the values that would presumably be provided to it in some manner, likely through external means such as user input or global variables. It is specified that:

- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\)
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 100,000\)
- `w_i` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq w_i \leq 10,000\) for each package \(i\) where \(0 \leq i < n\)

Since there are no specified return values or cases in the output section, we cannot ascertain the exact functionality of the function based on the provided information. However, we can infer that the function is designed to process the integers `n`, `k`, and the list of `w_i` values, likely performing some computation or logic based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly but operates on the constraints of positive integers n, k, and a list of positive integers w_i, where n is the number of packages, k is a threshold or limit, and each w_i represents the weight of a package. The exact output or functionality is not specified.**
