According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `n`. Right before the loop, `i` is 0, but we do not have information about the value of `n`. To ensure the loop can execute for the first time, `n` must be greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time then `n` must be greater than 0**
