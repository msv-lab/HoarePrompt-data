To determine the output state after the execution of the provided code snippet, we need to analyze the existing variables and the impact of the operation.

Given:
- `left` is assigned the value of `maxW`.
- `right` is 1000000000.

The code line:
```
middle = (left + right) // 2
```

Here, `middle` is computed as the integer division of the sum of `left` and `right` by 2.

Calculating the value of `middle`:
- Since `left` is `maxW` (a positive integer that can be at most 100,000) and `right` is 1,000,000,000, we have:
  ```
  middle = (maxW + 1000000000) // 2
  ```

The variable `middle` is now assigned a value based on the previously defined variables, but since `maxW` is not specified, we note that it will result in a specific value depending on `maxW`.

Therefore, the output state will include the computed value of `middle`, while retaining the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000; `k` is a positive integer greater than 1; `w` is a list containing `n` input integers; `sumW` is the sum of the integers in `w`; `maxW` is the maximum integer from `w`; `minP` is 0; `left` is `maxW`; `right` is 1000000000; `middle` is (maxW + 1000000000) // 2**
