The variable `maxW` is assigned the value of `num`. As per the initial state, `maxW` was previously 0, and it is stated that `maxW` is less than `num`, so `maxW` will now take the value of `num`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `w`, `sumW`, `i`) remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 100,000, `w` is a list containing `num`, `maxW` is `num`, `sumW` is `sumW + num`, `i` is 0, `num` is an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 100,000, `w` is a list containing `num`, `maxW` is `num`, `sumW` is `sumW + num`, `i` is 0, `num` is an input integer**
