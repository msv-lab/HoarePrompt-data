The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `loadings` is now `loadings + w[2]`, `truckCnt` is increased by 1, `k` is unchanged, `middle` is unchanged, and `n` is greater than 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
