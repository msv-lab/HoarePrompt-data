The variable `left` is assigned the value of `maxW`, which is the maximum integer from the list `w`. The value of `maxW` is not specified in the initial state but is determined by the contents of the list `w`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000, `k` is a positive integer such that `k` is greater than 1, `w` is a list containing `n` input integers, `sumW` is the sum of the integers in `w`, `maxW` is the maximum integer from `w`, `minP` is 0, `n` is not equal to `k`, and `left` is assigned the value of `maxW`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000, `k` is a positive integer such that `k` is greater than 1, `w` is a list containing `n` input integers, `sumW` is the sum of the integers in `w`, `maxW` is the maximum integer from `w`, `minP` is 0, `n` is not equal to `k`, `left` is assigned the value of `maxW`**.
