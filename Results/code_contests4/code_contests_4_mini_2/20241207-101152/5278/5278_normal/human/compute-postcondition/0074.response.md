The statement `loadings += w[i]` adds the value of `w[i]` to `loadings`. Given that `i` is 0, `loadings` will be updated with the value of `w[0]`. The previous value of `loadings` is not specified, but it will change based on the value of `w[0]`, which is assumed to exist since the loop is set to execute. The state of `i` remains unchanged at 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `loadings` has been updated to include `w[0]`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `loadings` is updated by adding `w[0]**
