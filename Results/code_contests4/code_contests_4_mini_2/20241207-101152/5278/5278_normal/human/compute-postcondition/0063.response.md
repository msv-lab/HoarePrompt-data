Output State: **`minP` is equal to `middle`, `i` is `n`, `loadings` is the sum of the integers in `w` that fit within the constraints of `middle`, `truckCnt` is the number of trucks needed to transport the loadings based on the maximum capacity defined by `middle`, `k` is the initial value of `k`, `w` remains unchanged, and `truckCnt + 1 <= k`.**
