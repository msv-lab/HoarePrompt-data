The value of `truckCnt` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `truckCnt` is unknown. The values of the other variables (`i`, `loadings`, `k`, `middle`, and `n`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `loadings` is now `loadings + w[2]`, `truckCnt` is increased by 1, `k` is unchanged, `middle` is unchanged, and `n` is greater than 2.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `loadings` is now `loadings + w[2]`, `truckCnt` is increased by 1, `k` is unchanged, `middle` is unchanged, and `n` is greater than 2**.
