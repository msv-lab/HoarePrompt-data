According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is increased by 1, which means the current value of `i` is now one greater than its value at the start of the iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than the current value of `i`. 

No other states need to be adjusted since `loadings` and `truckCnt` do not influence the loop condition.

State: **`i` is increased by 1, `loadings` is updated to `w[i]`, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than `i`**
