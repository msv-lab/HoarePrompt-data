The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `loadings` is updated to `loadings + w[2]`, `n` is greater than 1, `middle` is less than `loadings`, `truckCnt` is increased by 1, and for the loop to execute again `n` is greater than 2; `truckCnt` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
