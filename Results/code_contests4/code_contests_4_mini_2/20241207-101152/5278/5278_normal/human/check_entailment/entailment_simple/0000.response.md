Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements a solution to the problem of distributing packages across a specified number of trucks while minimizing the maximum load that any single truck carries. Hereâ€™s how the program adheres to the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of packages `n` and the number of trucks `k`, followed by the weight of each package. It stores these weights in a list `w`, which is essential for further calculations.

2. **Initial Conditions**: The program accurately establishes initial values for `maxW` (the maximum weight of a single package) and `sumW` (the total weight of all packages). These values are critical for determining the bounds for the binary search that follows.

3. **Binary Search Implementation**: The core of the algorithm uses a binary search to find the minimum value of `P` (the maximum load per truck). 
   - The search space is correctly initialized between `maxW` and `sumW`, ensuring that `P` is at least as large as the heaviest package and at most as large as the total weight of all packages if only one truck were used.
   - The middle point is evaluated to see if it is possible to load all packages onto `k` trucks without exceeding this load limit. The inner loop maintains a running total of the current truck's load and increments the truck count whenever the load exceeds `middle`. If the truck count exceeds `k`, it adjusts the search range accordingly.

4. **Conditions for Output**: The program correctly handles edge cases:
   - If `k` is 1, the program returns `sumW` since all packages must go into one truck.
   - If `n` equals `k`, it returns `maxW` because each truck can take exactly one package.
   - Otherwise, it finds the minimum possible `P` through the binary search and updates `minP` accordingly.

5. **Efficiency**: The algorithm operates efficiently within the provided constraints (up to 100,000 packages and weights), using a combination of linear and logarithmic time complexity, which is suitable for the input limits.

In summary, the program meets the requirements of the problem description by implementing the correct logic to minimize the maximum load on the trucks while ensuring all packages are loaded. Thus, it is correct as per the problem description provided.
