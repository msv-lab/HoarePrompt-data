You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given $n$ packages of $w_i$ kg from a belt conveyor in order ($i = 0, 1, ... n-1$). You should load all packages onto $k$ trucks which have the common maximum load $P$. Each truck can load consecutive packages (more than or equals to zero) from the belt conveyor unless the total weights of the packages in the sequence does not exceed the maximum load $P$.

Write a program which reads $n$, $k$ and $w_i$, and reports the minimum value of the maximum load $P$ to load all packages from the belt conveyor.

Constraints

* $1 \leq n \leq 100,000$
* $1 \leq k \leq 100,000$
* $1 \leq w_i \leq 10,000$

Input

In the first line, two integers $n$ and $k$ are given separated by a space character. In the following $n$ lines, $w_i$ are given respectively.

Output

Print the minimum value of $P$ in a line.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100,000, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 100,000, and w_i are positive integers such that 1 <= w_i <= 10,000 for each package i (0 <= i < n).
def func():
    n, k = [int(val) for val in raw_input().split(' ')]
    w = []
    maxW = sumW = 0
    for i in range(n):
        num = int(raw_input())
        
        sumW += num
        
        w.append(num)
        
        if maxW < num:
            maxW = num
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 100,000; `w` is a list containing `n` input integers; `sumW` is the sum of the integers in `w`; `maxW` is the maximum integer from `w`.
    minP = 0
    if (1 == k) :
        minP = sumW
    else :
        if (n == k) :
            minP = maxW
        else :
            left = maxW
            right = 100000 * 10000
            while left <= right:
                middle = (left + right) // 2
                
                truckCnt = i = loadings = 0
                
                while i < n:
                    loadings += w[i]
                    if middle < loadings:
                        truckCnt += 1
                        if k < truckCnt + 1:
                            break
                        loadings = w[i]
                    i += 1
                
                if truckCnt + 1 <= k:
                    minP = middle
                
                if k < truckCnt + 1:
                    left = middle + 1
                else:
                    right = middle - 1
                
            #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `left` is greater than `right`, `minP` holds the minimum possible capacity required to transport the load given `k` trucks, `i` is `n`, `loadings` is the sum of all integers in `w` that fit within the constraints of the final `middle`, `truckCnt` is the final count of trucks needed based on the loadings, `k` remains unchanged from its initial value, `w` remains unchanged.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000; `k` is a positive integer greater than 1; `w` is a list containing `n` input integers; `sumW` is the sum of the integers in `w`; `maxW` is the maximum integer from `w`; if `n` equals `k`, then `minP` is equal to `maxW`. Otherwise, `minP` holds the minimum possible capacity required to transport the load with `k` trucks, `i` is equal to `n`, `loadings` is the sum of integers in `w` that fit within the constraints of the final `middle`, `truckCnt` is the final count of trucks needed based on the loadings, while `k` and `w` remain unchanged.

If `k` is greater than 1 and `n` equals `k`, then `minP` is equal to `maxW`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two positive integers `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of packages and `k` is the number of trucks available. It then reads `n` weights of packages into a list. The function calculates the minimum capacity required for the trucks to transport all packages based on the constraints given by `k`. If `k` is 1, the minimum capacity is equal to the total weight of all packages. If `n` equals `k`, the minimum capacity is the weight of the heaviest package. For other cases, it uses a binary search to determine the minimum truck capacity required to transport all packages without exceeding `k` trucks. Note that the function does not return any value; it calculates `minP`, which holds the result of the minimum capacity but does not output or return it.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
