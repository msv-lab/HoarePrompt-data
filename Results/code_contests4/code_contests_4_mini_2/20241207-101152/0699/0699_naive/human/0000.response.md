To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic and see if it can handle all potential cases.

The problem requires calculating the minimum and maximum beauty of an array after performing operations where adjacent elements can be replaced by their sum. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the ceiling of each element divided by `x`.

### Breakdown of the Program:

1. **Maximum Beauty Calculation:**
   - The maximum beauty is calculated by summing up the ceiling of each element divided by `x`.
   - This is done correctly in the loop iterating through the array `a`, where `mx` accumulates the values of `math.ceil(a[i] / x)`.

2. **Minimum Beauty Calculation:**
   - The minimum beauty is calculated incorrectly. The program attempts to compute it using `int(somme / x)` where `somme` is the sum of all elements in `a`. However, this does not take into account the operations allowed (the summation of adjacent elements) that may yield different sums depending on how the elements are combined.
   - For instance, if we have an array like `[4, 11]` and `x = 3`, the sum is `15`, and the minimum beauty would be `ceil(15/3) = 5`, not `int(somme / x) = int(15/3) = 5` in this straightforward case, but if there are more elements, the combination matters. Therefore, the logic does not account for all combinations of sums that could lead to different minimum beauties.

### Potential Case Where the Program is Incorrect:

Consider the case where `a = [4, 11]` and `x = 3`:
- The maximum beauty correctly computes to `ceil(4/3) + ceil(11/3) = 2 + 4 = 6`.
- However, for the minimum beauty using the sum, it calculates to `int((4 + 11) / 3) = int(15 / 3) = 5`, but if we sum them as `[15]`, we get `ceil(15/3) = 5`, which is correct.
- But if we consider an array like `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` and `x = 2`, it would yield a different minimum based on how they are combined, which the program fails to account for.

### Conclusion:
The logic for calculating the minimum beauty is incorrect in the program as it does not account for all possible combinations of sums that could yield a different result. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
