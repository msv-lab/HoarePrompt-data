To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description and the program logic.

The problem requires calculating the minimum and maximum beauty of an array after performing a sequence of operations. The beauty is defined as the sum of the ceiling of each element divided by `x`. 

**Maximum beauty** can be achieved by not performing any operations on the array, as merging elements will only decrease the number of terms, which can potentially reduce the sum of ceilings.

**Minimum beauty** can be calculated by summing all elements of the array and then taking the ceiling of the total divided by `x`. This is because merging all elements into one will yield a single value that contributes to the beauty calculation.

### Analyzing the Program

1. The program uses the `reduce` function to calculate the sum of the elements in the array `a`. However, the program does not import the `reduce` function from the `functools` module, which would cause a runtime error.

2. It calculates `mx` (the maximum beauty) correctly by iterating through each element of the array and summing up the ceiling values. 

3. The calculation for the minimum beauty is done incorrectly. The program attempts to compute the minimum beauty as `int(somme / x)`, which is incorrect. The correct minimum beauty should be `math.ceil(somme / x)` instead, as we need to round up the division.

### Finding a Potential Case

Given the incorrect calculation for minimum beauty, we can illustrate a case where the program fails:

- **Test Case:**
    - Input: `1`, `3 5`, `2 3 4`
    - Expected Output: 
        - Minimum beauty: `math.ceil((2 + 3 + 4) / 5) = math.ceil(9 / 5) = 2`
        - Maximum beauty: `math.ceil(2/5) + math.ceil(3/5) + math.ceil(4/5) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3`
        - Therefore, the expected output is `2 3`.
    
- The program would incorrectly compute:
    - Minimum beauty as `int(9 / 5) = 1` (incorrect)
    - Maximum beauty as `3` (correct)
    - Outputs: `1 3` 

Thus, the program fails to produce the correct minimum beauty for this input.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis and the potential case identified, we can conclude that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description in all cases.

Correctness: **False**
