According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the integer `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1, and since `i` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration, `i` will become 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
