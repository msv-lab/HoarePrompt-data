The variable `somme` is assigned the value of the sum of all elements in the list `a`. The `reduce` function applies the `lambda` function (which adds two numbers) cumulatively to the items of `a`, starting with an initial value of 0. The previous state of `mx` remains unchanged, and `x` is unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is a float, `a` is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `mx` is initialized to 0, and `somme` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is a float, `a` is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `mx` is initialized to 0, `somme` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`.**
