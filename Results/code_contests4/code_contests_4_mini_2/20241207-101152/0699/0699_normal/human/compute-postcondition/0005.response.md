According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the positive integer `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, which means it is currently the first iteration. For the loop to execute a second time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Thus, `i` will become 1.

Since `n` is a positive integer, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute a second time. The variable `mx` has been updated, but that does not affect the condition for the loop execution.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
