Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a positive integer `x`, and a list of `n` positive integers `a`. It calculates the total sum of the elements in `a` and divides each element by `x` using ceiling division to get a count of how many times `x` fits into each element. The function then prints two values: the integer division of the total sum by `x`, and the total count of ceiling divisions. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. **
