The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `x`, and `a`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the list `a`. The parameter `x` is a positive integer that serves as a threshold value. The parameter `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, where each element in the list is constrained to be between 1 and 10^9. 

The function processes these parameters and returns the following based on specific conditions:

- Case_1: If the sum of elements in the list `a` is less than or equal to `x`, the function returns the sum of the elements in `a`.
- Case_2: If the sum of elements in `a` is greater than `x`, the function returns the difference between the sum of the elements in `a` and `x`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n`, a positive integer `x`, and a list `a` of `n` positive integers, and it returns the sum of the elements in `a` if the total is less than or equal to `x`; otherwise, it returns the amount by which the sum exceeds `x`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (positive integer), x (positive integer), and a (list of n positive integers), and returns the sum of the elements in a if the sum is less than or equal to x; otherwise, it returns the sum minus x.**
