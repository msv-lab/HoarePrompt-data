According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times, where `n` is a positive integer. Since `n` is already given as a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), the loop is guaranteed to execute at least once. 

Before the loop starts, the variable `i` must be initialized to 0, as it will be used to iterate through the range from 0 to n-1. The other variables (`x`, `a`, `mx`, and `somme`) do not need any adjustments for the loop to execute since they are not directly affecting the loop's execution condition.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `mx` is initialized to 0, `somme` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`, `a` is a list of n positive integers**
