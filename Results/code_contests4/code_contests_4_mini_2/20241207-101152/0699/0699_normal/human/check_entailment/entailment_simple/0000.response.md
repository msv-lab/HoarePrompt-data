The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements specified in the problem description. 

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Maximum Beauty Calculation**:
   - The variable `mx` is being calculated as the sum of `math.ceil(a[i] / x)` for each element in the array. This represents the maximum beauty, but it does not account for the possibility of merging adjacent elements to potentially increase the beauty. The maximum beauty can be achieved by leaving the array unchanged, but the program does not validate this condition correctly.
  
2. **Minimum Beauty Calculation**:
   - The program calculates `int(somme / x)` which is the integer division of the total sum of the array by `x`. This does not correctly compute the minimum beauty after merging operations. The minimum beauty should consider the scenario where all elements are merged into one, which would yield `math.ceil(somme / x)`. Instead, the program uses `int(somme / x)`, which effectively discards any remainder and does not round up.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to correctly implement both the maximum and minimum beauty calculations as described in the problem. Therefore, it does not fulfill the requirements specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
