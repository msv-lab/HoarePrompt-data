Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not accurately implement the requirements of the problem description for calculating the minimum and maximum beauty of the array after performing the allowed operations.

Here's why it is incorrect:

1. **Maximum Beauty Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the maximum beauty by summing the ceiling values of each element in the array divided by `x`. However, the problem states that to achieve the maximum beauty, one should not perform any operations on the array, which the program does correctly.

2. **Minimum Beauty Calculation**: The program attempts to find the minimum beauty by calculating `int(somme / x)`, which is incorrect. The minimum beauty should be found by summing the ceiling of the total sum of the array divided by `x`. Instead, the program only takes the integer division of the total sum by `x`, which does not account for the ceiling function.

3. **Missing Operations**: The program does not implement the logic to replace adjacent elements with their sum, which is a critical part of the problem. For minimum beauty, one must consider how the elements can be combined to minimize the ceiling divisions.

For example, if the input is:
```
1 3
6 4 11
```
The minimum beauty should be calculated after combining 4 and 11 into 15, yielding a total beauty of 7 (using `ceil(6/3) + ceil(15/3) = 2 + 5 = 7`). However, the program incorrectly computes the minimum beauty as `int((6 + 4 + 11) / 3) = int(21 / 3) = 7`, which does not account for the ceiling function and is not necessarily valid for all combinations.

In summary, the program fails to correctly implement the logic required for calculating the minimum beauty and does not perform the necessary operations specified in the problem description. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements.
