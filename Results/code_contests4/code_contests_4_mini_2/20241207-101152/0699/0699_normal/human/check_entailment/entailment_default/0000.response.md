To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's break down both the requirements and the code.

**Problem Description Analysis:**
1. We need to determine the minimum and maximum beauty of an array after performing operations that involve summing adjacent elements.
2. The beauty of an array is defined as the sum of the ceiling of each element divided by a given integer `x`.

**Code Analysis:**
The provided program reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer array and a value for `x`. The function `func_1` computes:
- `somme`: the total sum of the elements in `a`.
- `mx`: the sum of the ceiling division of each element in `a` by `x`.

**Potential Issues:**
- The code calculates the maximum beauty correctly by summing up the ceiling of each element divided by `x`.
- However, for the minimum beauty, it only computes the integer division of the total sum by `x`, which ignores the fact that performing operations (summing adjacent elements) could lead to a different minimum beauty. The minimum beauty could potentially be less than the integer division of the total sum by `x` due to the nature of the ceiling function.

For example, consider the input:
- n = 3, x = 3, a = [1, 1, 1]
The total sum is 3, and the integer division of the sum by `x` gives 1. However, if we sum all elements into one (1 + 1 + 1 = 3), the beauty becomes ceil(3/3) = 1, which is indeed correct. But if we had an array like [1, 2, 3] and summed to get 6, the minimum beauty could vary based on how the sums were combined.

**Output Hints Analysis:**
The output hints suggest that the function prints two values: the integer division of the total sum by `x` and the total count of ceiling divisions. This aligns with the code's functionality. However, the hints do not address the minimum beauty accurately, as it suggests simply using the integer division without considering the actual summation operations that could impact the minimum beauty.

**Conclusion:**
The program does not handle the computation for minimum beauty accurately according to the problem description, as it fails to account for the effects of combining elements on the minimum beauty value. This oversight leads to an incorrect implementation.

Correctness: **False**. 

The minimum beauty calculation is incorrect since it does not account for the possibility of combining elements to achieve a lower beauty value than just performing integer division on the total sum.
