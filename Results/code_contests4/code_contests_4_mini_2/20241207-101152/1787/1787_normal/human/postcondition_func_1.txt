The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` positive integers, but it incorrectly attempts to perform calculations on the list itself, which will result in a TypeError. It does not correctly implement the intended functionality of calculating `pow(n, p[i] - 2, p[i])` for each element in the list `p`.
