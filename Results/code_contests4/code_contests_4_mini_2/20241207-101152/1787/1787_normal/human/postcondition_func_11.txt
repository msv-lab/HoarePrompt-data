The function reads multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the length of a password, followed by an array `Arr` of `n` positive integers. It checks if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it prints `n`; otherwise, it prints `1`. The function processes each test case and continues until all have been handled. The function does not return any values but prints the results directly.
