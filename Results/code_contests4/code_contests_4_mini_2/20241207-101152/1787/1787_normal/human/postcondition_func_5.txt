The function accepts input from the user in the format of a single line containing an integer `n` followed by `n` positive integers. It returns this input line stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace. It does not validate the input nor does it handle any potential errors associated with reading input or data format, assuming the input conforms to the expected structure as described in the annotations.
