x is a positive integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ x ≤ 100), and y is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) followed by n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the password for each test case. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
