You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Lord Omkar has permitted you to enter the Holy Church of Omkar! To test your worthiness, Omkar gives you a password which you must interpret!

A password is an array a of n positive integers. You apply the following operation to the array: pick any two adjacent numbers that are not equal to each other and replace them with their sum. Formally, choose an index i such that 1 ≤ i < n and a_{i} ≠ a_{i+1}, delete both a_i and a_{i+1} from the array and put a_{i}+a_{i+1} in their place. 

For example, for array [7, 4, 3, 7] you can choose i = 2 and the array will become [7, 4+3, 7] = [7, 7, 7]. Note that in this array you can't apply this operation anymore.

Notice that one operation will decrease the size of the password by 1. What is the shortest possible length of the password after some number (possibly 0) of operations?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the length of the password.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the initial contents of your password.

The sum of n over all test cases will not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each password, print one integer: the shortest possible length of the password after some number of operations.

Example

Input


2
4
2 1 3 1
2
420 420


Output


1
2

Note

In the first test case, you can do the following to achieve a length of 1:

Pick i=2 to get [2, 4, 1]

Pick i=1 to get [6, 1]

Pick i=1 to get [7]

In the second test case, you can't perform any operations because there is no valid i that satisfies the requirements mentioned above.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases, where each test case has an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) representing the length of the password, followed by an array of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The total number of integers across all test cases does not exceed 200,000.
def func_1():
    fact = [1]
    for i in range(1, 100005):
        fact.append(fact[-1] * i % mod)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `fact` is a list containing the factorials of integers from 0 to 100004 modulo `mod`.
    ifact = [0] * 100005
    ifact[100004] = pow(fact[100004], mod - 2, mod)
    for i in range(100004, 0, -1):
        ifact[i - 1] = i * ifact[i] % mod
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `fact` is a list containing the factorials of integers from 0 to 100004 modulo `mod`; `ifact` now contains the modular inverses of the factorials of integers from 0 to 100004 modulo `mod`, with `ifact[0]` being 1, and `i` is 0.
    return fact, ifact
    #The program returns the list 'fact' containing the factorials of integers from 0 to 100004 modulo 'mod', and the list 'ifact' containing the modular inverses of those factorials, with 'ifact[0]' being 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function computes and returns two lists: `fact`, which contains the factorials of integers from 0 to 100004 modulo `mod`, and `ifact`, which contains the modular inverses of those factorials. The function does not accept any parameters and is designed to handle large integers efficiently within the given constraints. However, the behavior of the function relies on the definition of `mod`, which is not specified within the function, and if `mod` is not defined elsewhere, it may cause an error.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the password, and p is a list of n positive integers.
def func_2(n, p):
    return pow(n, p - 2, p)
    #The program returns the result of pow(n, p - 2, p), where n is a positive integer representing the length of the password and p is a list of n positive integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` positive integers, but it incorrectly attempts to perform calculations on the list itself, which will result in a TypeError. It does not correctly implement the intended functionality of calculating `pow(n, p[i] - 2, p[i])` for each element in the list `p`.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the password, r is an array of n positive integers, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_3(n, r, fact, ifact):
    t = fact[n] * (ifact[r] * ifact[n - r]) % mod % mod
    return t
    #The program returns the value of t, which is calculated as `fact[n] * (ifact[r] * ifact[n - r]) % mod % mod` based on the given positive integer n and the array r.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n`, an array `r` of size `n`, and two arrays `fact` and `ifact`. It calculates and returns the value of `t` using the formula `fact[n] * (ifact[r] * ifact[n - r]) % mod % mod`. However, it does not explicitly handle edge cases such as ensuring that the value of `r` is valid (i.e., `0 <= r <= n`), which could lead to potential errors during execution if `r` is out of bounds.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function handles multiple test cases where t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the length of the password, and a is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9) representing the contents of the password. The sum of all n across test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_4():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing the integers parsed from the input line read from standard input, which represents the contents of the password.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and reads a line of input from standard input, returning a map object containing the integers parsed from that line. This represents the contents of the password for a test case. The function does not handle multiple test cases directly; it only processes a single line of input at a time. Additionally, there is no error handling for invalid input, which could lead to runtime errors if the input does not conform to the expected format.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) followed by an array a of n positive integers (1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9). The total length of all test cases combined does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_5():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers parsed from the input line, which is expected to consist of multiple integers separated by spaces, based on the array a of size n.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a line of input consisting of multiple integers separated by spaces, and returns a list of those integers parsed from the input. It does not handle any specific case for the integer `n` or the array `a`, as it simply reads and processes the input line without any predefined structure or validation on the number of integers provided.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) indicating the length of the password followed by n positive integers (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) representing the contents of the password. The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_6():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    #The program returns a single line input consisting of an integer n followed by n positive integers representing the contents of the password, stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts input from the user in the format of a single line containing an integer `n` followed by `n` positive integers. It returns this input line stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace. It does not validate the input nor does it handle any potential errors associated with reading input or data format, assuming the input conforms to the expected structure as described in the annotations.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a positive integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ x ≤ 100), and y is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) and a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the password for each test case. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_7(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is the last non-empty tuple from `y`, `y` is the result of `x % y` which is an empty tuple, indicating that the loop has finished executing when `y` becomes empty.
    return x
    #The program returns the last non-empty tuple 'x' from 'y', which indicates the loop has finished executing when 'y' became empty.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `x` and a list `y` of tuples. It calculates the last non-empty tuple from `y` using a loop that continues until `y` is empty. The output is the last non-empty tuple which was held in `x`. However, the logic involving the modulo operation and the handling of tuples might not be correctly explained in the annotations, as it does not clearly reflect how tuples are processed. The function appears to operate primarily on the values `x` and `y`, but the relationship to the tuples in `y` is not accurately detailed in the annotations.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a positive integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ x ≤ 100), and y is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) followed by n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the password for each test case. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_8(x, y):
    return x * y // func_7(x, y)
    #The program returns the result of multiplying the number of test cases 'x' by the list of tuples 'y', divided by the result of func_7(x, y)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `x`, representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples `y`, where each tuple contains an integer `n` followed by `n` positive integers. It returns the result of multiplying `x` by `y` and dividing that product by the result of the `func_7(x, y)`. However, the multiplication of `x` by `y` as written will raise a TypeError, since `y` is a list of tuples and cannot be directly multiplied by an integer. This indicates a likely error in the implementation, as the intended operation is unclear. Furthermore, it does not handle potential division by zero errors that may arise from `func_7(x, y)`.

#Function 9:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of integers in the password, and the password is an array of n positive integers where each integer is in the range 1 to 10^9.
def func_9(n):
    return [n, 1, n + 1, 0][n % 4]
    #The program returns 1 if n % 4 is 1, n + 1 if n % 4 is 2, 0 if n % 4 is 3, and n if n % 4 is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns:
- 1 if `n % 4` equals 1,
- `n + 1` if `n % 4` equals 2,
- 0 if `n % 4` equals 3, and
- `n` if `n % 4` equals 0.

#Function 10:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of positive integers representing the password, and b is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the list a, with 1 ≤ b ≤ 2 * 10^5.
def func_10(a, b):
    res = 1
    while b:
        if b & 1:
            res = res * a
            res %= MOD
            b -= 1
        else:
            a = a * a
            a %= MOD
            b >>= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `b` is 0, `res` is the result of multiplying elements of the original list `a` raised to the power of the original `b` modulo `MOD`, and `a` is a list representing the final transformation of the original list after the necessary squaring operations and modulo `MOD`.
    res %= MOD
    return res
    #The program returns the result of multiplying elements of the original list 'a' raised to the power of 'b' which is 0, and since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1, 'res' is updated to 1 modulo 'MOD'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of positive integers `a` and a positive integer `b`, returning the product of the elements of `a` raised to the power of `b` modulo `MOD`. However, if `b` is initially 0, the function returns 1, as any number to the power of 0 is 1. The function may also not handle cases where `MOD` is not defined within the scope of the function, leading to potential errors.

#Function 11:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: P is a list of tuples, each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) followed by a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the password for each test case. The first element of each tuple represents the number of elements in the password, and the total number of elements across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_11(P):
    ans = (-1 + sqrt(1 + 8 * P)) // 2
    return ans
    #The program returns the calculated values of 'ans' using the formula for each first element of the tuples in the list 'P'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of tuples `P`, where each tuple contains an integer `n` followed by `n` positive integers. It calculates and returns a single integer `ans` for the first element of each tuple using the formula `(-1 + sqrt(1 + 8 * n)) // 2`. However, the code does not handle multiple tuples correctly as it only processes the first element of the first tuple in `P`, ignoring any additional tuples or their integers. It also does not account for potential errors or edge cases such as negative or non-integer inputs.

#Function 12:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function reads multiple test cases where each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the length of the password, followed by an array a of n positive integers (1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9). The total number of integers across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_12():
    T = int(func_6())
    while T:
        n = int(func_6())
        
        Arr = func_5()
        
        p = Arr[0]
        
        flag = 0
        
        for i in Arr[1:]:
            if i != p:
                flag = 1
                break
        
        if flag == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n)
        
        T -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `T` is 0, `n` is the last value assigned from `func_6()`, `Arr` is the last list returned by `func_5()`, `p` is the first element of the last `Arr`, and `flag` is either 0 or 1 depending on the last comparison within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the length of a password, followed by an array `Arr` of `n` positive integers. It checks if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it prints `n`; otherwise, it prints `1`. The function processes each test case and continues until all have been handled. The function does not return any values but prints the results directly.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
