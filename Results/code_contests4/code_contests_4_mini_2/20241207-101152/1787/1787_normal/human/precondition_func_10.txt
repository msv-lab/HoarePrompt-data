P is a list of tuples, each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) followed by a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the password for each test case. The first element of each tuple represents the number of elements in the password, and the total number of elements across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
