The function computes and returns two lists: `fact`, which contains the factorials of integers from 0 to 100004 modulo `mod`, and `ifact`, which contains the modular inverses of those factorials. The function does not accept any parameters and is designed to handle large integers efficiently within the given constraints. However, the behavior of the function relies on the definition of `mod`, which is not specified within the function, and if `mod` is not defined elsewhere, it may cause an error.
