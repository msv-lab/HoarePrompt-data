The function accepts a positive integer `n`, an array `r` of size `n`, and two arrays `fact` and `ifact`. It calculates and returns the value of `t` using the formula `fact[n] * (ifact[r] * ifact[n - r]) % mod % mod`. However, it does not explicitly handle edge cases such as ensuring that the value of `r` is valid (i.e., `0 <= r <= n`), which could lead to potential errors during execution if `r` is out of bounds.
