The function handles multiple test cases where t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the length of the password, and a is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9) representing the contents of the password. The sum of all n across test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
