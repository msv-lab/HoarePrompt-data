The function accepts no parameters and reads a line of input from standard input, returning a map object containing the integers parsed from that line. This represents the contents of the password for a test case. The function does not handle multiple test cases directly; it only processes a single line of input at a time. Additionally, there is no error handling for invalid input, which could lead to runtime errors if the input does not conform to the expected format.
