The function accepts a positive integer `x`, representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples `y`, where each tuple contains an integer `n` followed by `n` positive integers. It returns the result of multiplying `x` by `y` and dividing that product by the result of the `func_7(x, y)`. However, the multiplication of `x` by `y` as written will raise a TypeError, since `y` is a list of tuples and cannot be directly multiplied by an integer. This indicates a likely error in the implementation, as the intended operation is unclear. Furthermore, it does not handle potential division by zero errors that may arise from `func_7(x, y)`.
