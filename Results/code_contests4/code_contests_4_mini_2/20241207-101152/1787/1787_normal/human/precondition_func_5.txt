The input consists of multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) indicating the length of the password followed by n positive integers (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) representing the contents of the password. The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
