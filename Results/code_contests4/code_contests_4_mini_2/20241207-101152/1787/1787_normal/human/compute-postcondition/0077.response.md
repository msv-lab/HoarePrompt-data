The function `func_12` does not accept any parameters directly, as it reads multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n`, which represents the length of the password, followed by an array `a` of `n` positive integers. The function processes these test cases and computes a result based on the values provided.

Since the function reads from input and processes multiple test cases, it will return results based on the input given. The specifics of what the function returns are not provided in the output section. Therefore, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer n and an array of n positive integers, and processes these to produce a result based on the test cases.**
