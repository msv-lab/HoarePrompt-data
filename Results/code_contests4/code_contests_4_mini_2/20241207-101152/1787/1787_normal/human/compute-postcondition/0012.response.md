The value of `flag` is set to 1, which does not change as it is already 1. The states of the other variables (`T`, `n`, `Arr`, `p`, `i`) remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is assigned the value of `int(func_6())`, `n` is assigned the same value as `T`, `Arr` is a list with at least 3 elements, `p` is assigned the value of `Arr[0]`, `flag` is 1, and `i` is assigned the value of `Arr[2]`.

Output State: **`T` is assigned the value of `int(func_6())`, `n` is assigned the same value as `T`, `Arr` is a list with at least 3 elements, `p` is assigned the value of `Arr[0]`, `flag` is 1, and `i` is assigned the value of `Arr[2]`.**
