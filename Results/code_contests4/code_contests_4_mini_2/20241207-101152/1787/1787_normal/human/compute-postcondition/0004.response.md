The variable `p` is assigned the value of `Arr[0]`, which means that `p` takes the first element from the list `Arr`. The previous values of `T`, `n`, and `Arr` are not directly affected by this assignment, but they remain in their respective states as determined initially. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is assigned the value of `int(func_6())`, `n` is assigned the same value as `T`, `Arr` is assigned the value returned by `func_5()`, and `p` is assigned the value of `Arr[0]`.

Output State: **`T` is assigned the value of `int(func_6())`, `n` is assigned the same value as `T`, `Arr` is assigned the value returned by `func_5()`, `p` is assigned the value of `Arr[0]`.**
