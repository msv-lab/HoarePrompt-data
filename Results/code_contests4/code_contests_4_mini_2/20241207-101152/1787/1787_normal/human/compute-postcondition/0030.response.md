The value of `flag` is assigned to 0. The previous state of the other variables remains unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is greater than 1; `n` is now assigned the value returned by `int(func_6())`; `Arr` is now assigned the value returned by `func_5()`; `p` is now assigned the value `Arr[0]`; `flag` is 0.
