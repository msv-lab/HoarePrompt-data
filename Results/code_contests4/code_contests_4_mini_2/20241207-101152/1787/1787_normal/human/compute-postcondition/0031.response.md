To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the conditions based on the provided state before the loop and the loop construction itself.

1. The loop iterates over `Arr[1:]`, which means it starts from the second element of the `Arr` list. For the loop to execute, `Arr` must have at least two elements (the second element exists).
2. The variable `i` will take on the values from `Arr[1:]` during each iteration. If `Arr` has fewer than two elements, the slicing `Arr[1:]` would result in an empty list, causing the loop not to execute.
3. The value of `T` being greater than 1 is not directly relevant to the execution of the loop but could imply the potential for multiple elements in `Arr` depending on the implementation of `func_5()`. However, it does not guarantee the loop execution by itself.

Thus, we must ensure that:
- `Arr` contains at least 2 elements to allow for `Arr[1:]` to yield at least one element for the loop to iterate over.
- The starting value of `i` will be the second element of the list, which is `Arr[1]`.

Based on this reasoning, the modified state should reflect that `Arr` has at least two elements.

State: **`T` is greater than 1, `Arr` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is now `Arr[1]`**
