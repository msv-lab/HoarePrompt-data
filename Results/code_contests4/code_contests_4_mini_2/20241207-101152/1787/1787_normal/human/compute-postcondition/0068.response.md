Postcondition: ***If `i` is not equal to `p`, then `flag` is set to 1 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `T`, `Arr`, `i`, and `p` remain unchanged, with the condition that `T` is greater than 1, `Arr` is a list with at least 4 elements, `i` is the fourth element of `Arr`, and `p` is the first element of `Arr`.***
