The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is greater than 1, `Arr` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `Arr`, `p` is the first element of `Arr`, `flag` is 1, and `i` is not equal to `p`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
