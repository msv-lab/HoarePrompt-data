The value of `flag` is assigned the value `1`. The previous values of the affected variables (`T`, `Arr`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is greater than 1, `Arr` is a list with at least 3 elements, `i` is `Arr[2]`, and `flag` is 1.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 1, `Arr` is a list with at least 3 elements, `i` is `Arr[2]`, `flag` is 1**
