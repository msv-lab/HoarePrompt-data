According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. If `T` is a non-zero integer (truthy value), the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `T` is assigned the value of `int(func_6())`, which means `T` will be the integer returned from `func_6()`. 

For the loop to execute at least once, `func_6()` needs to return a value greater than 0, as `T` must be non-zero. Thus, we need to ensure that `func_6()` returns a positive integer.

State: **`T` is assigned the value of `int(func_6())`, for the loop to execute the first time then `func_6()` must return a value greater than 0**
