According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `Arr`. The loop iterates over the elements of `Arr` starting from the second element (index 1). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the third element of `Arr`, which means `i` corresponds to `Arr[2]`. Since `Arr` has at least 3 elements, for the loop to execute one more time, `Arr` must have at least 4 elements. 

In the next iteration, `i` will take the value of the fourth element of `Arr`, which is `Arr[3]`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `Arr` must have at least 4 elements.

State: **`T` is greater than 1, `Arr` is a list with at least 4 elements, `i` is the fourth element of `Arr`, and `p` is the first element of `Arr`.**
