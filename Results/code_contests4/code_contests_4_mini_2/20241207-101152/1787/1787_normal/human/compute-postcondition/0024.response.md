Postcondition: ***`T` is assigned the value of `int(func_6())`, `n` is assigned the same value as `T`, `Arr` is a list with at least 2 elements, and `p` is assigned the value of `Arr[0]`. If `flag` is 1, indicating that at least one element in `Arr[1:]` is not equal to `p`, the output of the print statement is 1. If `flag` is 0, meaning all elements in `Arr[1:]` are equal to `p`, `n` is printed.***
