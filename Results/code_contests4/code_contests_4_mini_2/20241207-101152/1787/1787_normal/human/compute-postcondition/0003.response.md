`Arr` is assigned the value returned by `func_5()`. The previous values of `T` and `n` are unchanged and are both greater than 0. The execution of this line does not affect the values of `T` or `n`, but it initializes `Arr` with the output of `func_5()`. 

Output State: **`T` is assigned the value of `int(func_6())`, `n` is assigned the same value as `T`, `Arr` is assigned the value returned by `func_5()`**.
