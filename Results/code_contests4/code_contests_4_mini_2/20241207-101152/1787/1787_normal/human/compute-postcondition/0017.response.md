The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is assigned the value of `int(func_6())`, `n` is assigned the same value as `T`, `Arr` is a list with at least 4 elements, `p` is assigned the value of `Arr[0]`, `flag` is 1, `i` is assigned the value of `Arr[3]`, and `flag` remains 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
