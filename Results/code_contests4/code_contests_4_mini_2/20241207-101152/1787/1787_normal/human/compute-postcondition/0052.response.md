The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(func_6())`, where `func_6()` is expected to return a value that can be converted to an integer. The specific return value from `func_6()` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact integer value of `n`. The other variables `T` and `Arr` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is greater than 1, `Arr` is a list with at least 2 elements, and `n` is the integer result of `int(func_6())`.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 1, `Arr` is a list with at least 2 elements, `n` is the integer result of `int(func_6())`**
