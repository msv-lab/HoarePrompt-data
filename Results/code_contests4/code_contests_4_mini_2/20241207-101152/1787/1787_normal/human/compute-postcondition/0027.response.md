The code assigns the value of `n` to the result of `int(func_6())`. The previous value of `n` is the same as the initial value of `T`, which is greater than 1. Since `func_6()` is called, its output is unknown, but it is expected to return a value that can be converted to an integer. There are no changes to other variables. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is greater than 1; `n` is now assigned the value returned by `int(func_6())`; `Arr` is a list with at least 2 elements; `p` is `Arr[0]`; `flag` can either be 0 or 1.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 1; `n` is now assigned the value returned by `int(func_6())`; `Arr` is a list with at least 2 elements; `p` is `Arr[0]`; `flag` can either be 0 or 1.**
