The code assigns the value `1` to `flag`. The previous values of the affected variables are `T`, `n`, `Arr`, `p`, and `i`, but they remain unchanged. The only change is that `flag` is now `1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is assigned the value of `int(func_6())`, `n` is assigned the same value as `T`, `Arr` is a list with at least 2 elements, `p` is assigned the value of `Arr[0]`, `flag` is 1, `i` is `Arr[1]`, and `i` is not equal to `p`.

Output State: **`T` is assigned the value of `int(func_6())`, `n` is assigned the same value as `T`, `Arr` is a list with at least 2 elements, `p` is assigned the value of `Arr[0]`, `flag` is 1, `i` is `Arr[1]`, and `i` is not equal to `p**
