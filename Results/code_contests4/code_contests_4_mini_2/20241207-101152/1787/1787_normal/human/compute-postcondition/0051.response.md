According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `T` is not zero. At the end of the last iteration, `T` is greater than 1, which means it can execute one more time. The loop does not require any adjustment for `T` to execute again since `T` will be decremented by 1 but will still be greater than 0.

State: **`T` is greater than 1, `Arr` is a list with at least 2 elements**
