Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 1, `Arr` is a list with at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element of `Arr`, and `p` is the first element of `Arr`. If `i` is not equal to `p`, then `flag` is set to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. There is no else part in the code.***
