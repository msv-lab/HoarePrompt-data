The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is greater than 1, `Arr` is a list with at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element of `Arr`, `p` is the first element of `Arr`, and `flag` is set to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
