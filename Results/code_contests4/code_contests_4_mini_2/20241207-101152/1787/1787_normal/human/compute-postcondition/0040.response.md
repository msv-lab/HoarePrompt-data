According to the code, the for loop is iterating over the elements of `Arr` starting from the second element (index 1) to the end of the list. Since at the end of the last iteration, `i` is `Arr[2]`, we know that `i` is currently set to the third element of `Arr`. 

The loop will execute again for the next element in the list, which would be `Arr[3]`, provided that `Arr` has more elements. Given that the preconditions state that `Arr` is a list with at least 3 elements, and assuming `Arr` has more than 3 elements, we can determine the next state.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be updated to the next element in the list. Thus, `i` will be `Arr[3]`, and we still need to ensure that `Arr` has at least 4 elements for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`flag` is set to 1, `i` is `Arr[3]`, for the loop to execute a second time `Arr` must have at least 4 elements.**
