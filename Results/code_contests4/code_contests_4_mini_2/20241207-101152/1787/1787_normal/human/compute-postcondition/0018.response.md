Postcondition: ***`T` is assigned the value of `int(func_6())`, `n` is assigned the same value as `T`, `Arr` is a list with at least 4 elements, `p` is assigned the value of `Arr[0]`, and `i` is assigned the value of `Arr[3]`. If `i` is not equal to `p`, `flag` remains 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
