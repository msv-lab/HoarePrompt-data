The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `T`, `n`, `k`, and `a`. 

- `T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30.
- `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 100.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^16.

The function's output is based on the values of these parameters, but specific return values are not provided in the prompt. Therefore, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters T, n, k, and a, where T is an integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 1000), n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 30), k is an integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 100), and a is a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^16).**
