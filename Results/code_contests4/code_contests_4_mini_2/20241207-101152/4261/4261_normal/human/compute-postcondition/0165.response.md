The value of `j` is incremented by `r`, and since `r` is 0, `j` remains unchanged. The other variables are not affected, so the output state is: `i` is such that it is no longer divisible by `k` raised to the power of `j + 1`; `j` is the maximum number of times `i` can be divided by `k`; `r` remains 0.
Output State: **`i` is such that it is no longer divisible by `k` raised to the power of `j + 1`; `j` is the maximum number of times `i` can be divided by `k`; `r` remains 0**
