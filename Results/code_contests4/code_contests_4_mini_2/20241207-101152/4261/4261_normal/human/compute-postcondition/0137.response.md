According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is reduced by 1, meaning it is now less than or equal to its previous value. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than 0. Therefore, `i` needs to be adjusted to at least 1. The other states (`j`, `r`, and `li`) do not need any adjustments as they do not affect the loop condition.

State: **`i` must be adjusted to at least 1, `j` remains unchanged, `r` is `j`, and `li` must have at least 1 element**
