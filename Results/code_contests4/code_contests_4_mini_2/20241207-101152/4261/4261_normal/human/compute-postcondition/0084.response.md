According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `k`. The loop condition states that `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0` must hold true for the loop to execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than 0, `r` is infinity, `j` is 1, and `k` is 1. 

Calculating the condition:  
- Since `j` is 1, `k ** (j + 1)` becomes `1 ** 2`, which equals 1.
- Therefore, the condition simplifies to `i % 1 == 0`. 

Given that any integer `i` greater than 0 will satisfy this condition, the loop can execute again without needing to adjust the state. 

Thus, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`i` is greater than 0, `r` is infinity, `j` is 1, `k` is 1**
