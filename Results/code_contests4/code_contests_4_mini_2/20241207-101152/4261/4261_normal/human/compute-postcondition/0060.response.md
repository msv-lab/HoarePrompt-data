According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `li`. If `li` has more elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, which indicates that it is the first iteration of the loop. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration. Therefore, `i` will be 1, and the loop must check if there are more elements in `li` to continue executing.

State: **`i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `li` must have at least 2 elements.**
