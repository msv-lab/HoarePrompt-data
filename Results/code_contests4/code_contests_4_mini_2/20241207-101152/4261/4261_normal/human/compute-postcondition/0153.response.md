In the given code snippet, `r` is assigned the value of `j`. The previous values of the affected variables are as follows: `j` has been increased by `r` and `i` has been updated to `i // k`, but the specific values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we don't know the specific values of `r` after this assignment, as it depends on the current value of `j`. 

The output state indicates the relationship between these variables after running the code. Thus, the output state is: `i` is updated to `i // k`, `j` is increased by `r`, and `r` is now equal to the updated value of `j`.

Output State: **`i` is updated to `i // k`, `j` is increased by `r`, `r` is now equal to the updated value of `j`.**
