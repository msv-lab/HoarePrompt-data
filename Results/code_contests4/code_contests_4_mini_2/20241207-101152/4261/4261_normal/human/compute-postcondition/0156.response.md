The value of `j` is assigned to 0. The values of other variables are not affected in this step, but since `j` is updated to 0, we have that `r` will also become 0 as it is equal to the updated value of `j`. The condition for the loop to execute again is not affected by this assignment since it is not executed in this step. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is updated to `i // k`, `j` is 0, `r` is 0, and the loop condition remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is updated to `i // k`, `j` is 0, `r` is 0, and the loop condition remains unchanged.**
