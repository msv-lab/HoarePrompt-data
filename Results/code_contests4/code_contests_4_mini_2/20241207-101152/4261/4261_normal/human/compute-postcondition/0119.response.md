According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop condition states that `i` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute. Right before the loop, `i` is 0, which means the condition is not satisfied and the loop cannot execute. 

To allow the loop to execute at least once, `i` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 0. The other variables (`li` and `r`) do not influence the execution of the loop in this case.

State: **`i` is greater than 0, `li` must have at least 1 element, `r` is 0**
