To analyze the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we need to consider the effects of the nested loops and how they manipulate the variables, particularly focusing on the final values of `i`, `r`, `j`, and `req`.

1. The outer loop iterates over the elements in `li`. For each `i` in `li`, the inner while loop continues as long as `i` is greater than 0.
2. The inner while loop calculates `j` based on how many times `i` can be divided by `k` raised to increasing powers (if `k` is greater than 1), and `j` is adjusted based on its previous value stored in `r`.
3. As `i` decreases in each iteration of the inner while loop, eventually `i` reaches 0 and then becomes -1 due to the decrement (`i -= 1`).
4. The variable `req` collects unique sums of `j` over the iterations, ensuring that if a value of `j` has already been added, the function `func_2('NO')` is called to indicate an error state.
5. The loop will terminate when `i` becomes less than or equal to 0 for all elements of `li`.

After all iterations, if we assume `li` has at least one element and that the loop executes fully:

- `i` will be -1 (as it decrements after reaching 0).
- `r` will be the last computed value of `j`, which would reflect the final state of calculations performed in the inner loops.
- `j` will hold the last computed value before exiting the loop.
- `req` will contain all unique values of `j` computed during the loop executions.

From the provided examples and the analysis:

Output State: **`i` is -1, `r` is the last computed value of `j`, `j` is the last computed value before exiting the loop, `req` contains all unique values of `j` computed during the iterations.**
