According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute again as long as `i` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must be greater than 0. Therefore, `i` needs to be adjusted to a value greater than 0.

State: **`i` is greater than 0, `r` is infinity, `j` is infinity, `k` is 1**
