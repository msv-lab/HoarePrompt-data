`j` is assigned the value of `j + r`. Since `r` is infinity and `j` is also infinity, the result of `j + r` will still be infinity. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and `k` is unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is greater than 0, `r` is infinity, `j` is infinity, `k` is 1.

Output State: **`i` is greater than 0, `r` is infinity, `j` is infinity, `k` is 1**
