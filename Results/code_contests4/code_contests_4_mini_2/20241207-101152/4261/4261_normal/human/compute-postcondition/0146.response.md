The value of `i` is updated by performing an integer division of `i` by `k` raised to the power of `j`. Since `j` is the highest integer such that `i` is divisible by `k`, it means that `k ** j` is the largest power of `k` that divides `i`. After executing this line, `i` will now be `i // (k ** j)`, which simplifies `i` by removing all factors of `k` from it. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is updated to `i // (k ** j)`, `j` remains the highest integer such that `i` is divisible by `k`.**
