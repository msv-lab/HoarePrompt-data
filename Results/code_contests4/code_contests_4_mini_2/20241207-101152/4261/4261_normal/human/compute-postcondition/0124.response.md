The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is 1, so after execution, `j` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is greater than 0, `li` must have at least 1 element, `r` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is defined with `i` being divisible by `k`, and for the loop to execute again, `i` must also be divisible by `k`.

Output State: **`i` is greater than 0, `li` must have at least 1 element, `r` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is defined with `i` being divisible by `k`, and for the loop to execute again, `i` must also be divisible by `k.**
