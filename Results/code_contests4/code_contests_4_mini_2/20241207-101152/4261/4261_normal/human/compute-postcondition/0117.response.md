According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `li`. If `li` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is -1. Since `i` is iterating over the elements of `li`, the next value of `i` will be the next element in `li`, which will be at index 0 (the first element). 

For the loop to be executed one more time, `li` must have at least 1 element. Since we do not have information about the number of elements in `li`, but we know `i` will be updated to 0, we can summarize the state.

State: **`i` is 0, for the loop to execute a second time `li` must have at least 1 element.**
