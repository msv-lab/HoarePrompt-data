The value of `r` is assigned the value of `j`. The previous state indicates that `j` has been increased by `r`, but the exact values of `i`, `j`, and `req` are not specified. Therefore, the output state reflects that `r` now holds the value of `j`, while `i` and `req` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`i` is modified to a new value based on the division by `k`, `j` is increased by `r`, `j` is added to `req`, `r` is assigned the value of `j`.**
