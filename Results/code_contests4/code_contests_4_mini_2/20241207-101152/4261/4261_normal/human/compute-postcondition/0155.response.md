According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is updated to `i // k`, which means it has been reduced based on the integer division by `k`. Additionally, `i` has been decreased by 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be greater than 0 after these modifications. Therefore, we need to ensure that the value of `i` before the final decrement (the value after the update to `i // k`) must be greater than 1. This means that before the decrement, `i // k` must be greater than 1, which implies that `i` must have been greater than `k`.

State: **`i` is updated to `i // k`, `j` is increased by `r`, `r` is now equal to the updated value of `j`, and for the loop to execute again `i` must have been greater than `k`, and thus `i // k` must be greater than 1**
