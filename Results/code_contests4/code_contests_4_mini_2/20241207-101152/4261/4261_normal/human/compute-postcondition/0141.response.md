According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`, `k`, and `j`. The loop continues to execute as long as `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `i` is set to at least `k`, `j` is 1, and `r` is 1 with `li` having at least 1 element. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0` holds true. Since `j` is currently 1, `k ** (j + 1)` evaluates to `k ** 2`. 

Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is a multiple of `k ** 2` for the loop to execute again. Given that `i` is set to at least `k`, we can assert that `i` must be adjusted to ensure that `i` is at least `k ** 2` (as `k` alone does not guarantee this condition). 

No other states need to be adjusted since `j`, `r`, and `li` do not affect the loop condition directly.

State: **`i` is set to at least `k`, `j` is 1, `r` is 1, `li` must have at least 1 element and for the loop to execute again `i` must be at least `k ** 2`**
