The value of `i` is decremented by 1. The previous values of the affected variables are not specified, but the operation directly impacts `i`. The other variables (`j`, `k`, `r`, and `req`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is reduced by 1; `j` is increased by `r`; `j` is added to `req`; `j` is not an element of `req` before this operation; `r` is assigned the value of `j`.

Output State: **`i` is reduced by 1; `j` is increased by `r`; `j` is added to `req`; `j` is not an element of `req` before this operation; `r` is assigned the value of `j`.**
