To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the `while` loop condition:

```
while i % k ** (j + 1) == 0:
```

The loop will continue executing as long as `i % k ** (j + 1)` equals 0. 

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `r` is 0
- `j` is 1
- `k` is equal to 1

Now, we can evaluate the condition:

1. Calculate `k ** (j + 1)`. Since `k` is 1 and `j` is 1:
   - `k ** (j + 1) = 1 ** (1 + 1) = 1 ** 2 = 1`

2. Now evaluate `i % k ** (j + 1)`:
   - `i % 1 = 1 % 1 = 0`

Since the condition `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0` holds true (`0 == 0`), the loop can execute again. 

In this case, since the loop can certainly execute one more time, we do not need to adjust any of the variables. 

Thus, the state remains the same for the next iteration.

State: **`i` is 1, `r` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is equal to 1**
