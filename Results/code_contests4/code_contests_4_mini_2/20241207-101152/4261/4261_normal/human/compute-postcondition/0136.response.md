The value of `i` is decremented by 1. The previous values of the affected variables are not specified, but `j` remains unchanged, and `r` is `j`. The other variables (`k`, `li`, and `req`) are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is reduced by 1, `j` remains unchanged, `r` is `j`, and `li` must have at least 1 element.

Output State: **`i` is reduced by 1, `j` remains unchanged, `r` is `j`, and `li` must have at least 1 element.**
