The code `req.add(j)` adds the value of `j` to the set `req`. Given that `j` is infinity and is not already in `req`, the operation will result in `j` being added to `req`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `r` is 0, `j` is infinity, `k` is 1, and `j` is added to `req`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `r` is 0, `j` is infinity, `k` is 1, and `j` is added to `req.**
