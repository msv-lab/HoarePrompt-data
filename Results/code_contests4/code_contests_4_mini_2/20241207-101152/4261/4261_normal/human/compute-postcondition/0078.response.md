The variable `r` is assigned the value of `j`, and since `j` is infinity, `r` will also become infinity. The values of the other variables (`i`, `k`) do not change. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `r` is infinity, `j` is infinity, `k` is 1.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `r` is infinity, `j` is infinity, `k` is 1**
