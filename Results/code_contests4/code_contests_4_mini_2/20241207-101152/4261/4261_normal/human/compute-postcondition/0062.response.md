According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is 1, which is greater than 0, so the loop can indeed execute one time. Therefore, there is no need to adjust the state.

State: **`i` is 1, `r` is 0**
