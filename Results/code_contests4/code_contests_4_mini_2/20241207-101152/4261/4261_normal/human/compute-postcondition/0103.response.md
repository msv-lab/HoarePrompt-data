The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `j` is 1, so after execution, `j` becomes 2. The states of the other variables (`i`, `r`, and `k`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is greater than 0, `r` is infinity, `j` is 2, `k` is 1.

Output State: **`i` is greater than 0, `r` is infinity, `j` is 2, `k` is 1**
