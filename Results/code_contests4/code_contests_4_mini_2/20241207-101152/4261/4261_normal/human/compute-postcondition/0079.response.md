The value of `i` is decremented by 1, and since its initial value is 1, after execution, `i` becomes 0. The values of `r`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `r` is infinity, `j` is infinity, `k` is 1.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `r` is infinity, `j` is infinity, `k` is 1**
