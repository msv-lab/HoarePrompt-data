The value of `j` is incremented by `r`, which means that `j` will now be increased by the value of `r`. The initial state mentions that `j` is the largest integer such that `i` is divisible by `k` raised to the power of `j`, but does not provide specific values for `i`, `k`, or `r`. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `j` without affecting other variables.

Output State: **`i` is reduced by the factor of `k` raised to the power of `j`, and `j` is increased by `r`.**
