The value of `j` is incremented by `r`, and since `r` is initially 0, the value of `j` remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is reduced by dividing it by `k` raised to the power of `j`, `r` is 0, and `li` must have at least 1 element, and `j` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is reduced by dividing it by `k` raised to the power of `j`, `r` is 0, `li` must have at least 1 element, and `j` remains unchanged.**
