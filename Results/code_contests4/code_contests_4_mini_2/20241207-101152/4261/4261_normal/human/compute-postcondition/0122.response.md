The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is 0, so after execution, `j` is now 1. The states of the other variables (`i`, `li`, `r`, and `k`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is greater than 0, `li` must have at least 1 element, `r` is 0, `j` is 1, and `k` is defined with `i` being divisible by `k`.

Output State: **`i` is greater than 0, `li` must have at least 1 element, `r` is 0, `j` is 1, and `k` is defined with `i` being divisible by `k.**
