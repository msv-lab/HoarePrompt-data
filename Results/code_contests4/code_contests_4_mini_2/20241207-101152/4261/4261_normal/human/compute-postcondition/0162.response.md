The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is 2, so after execution, `j` becomes 3. The values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is updated to `i // k`, `j` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `i` must be divisible by `k^3`.

Output State: **`i` is updated to `i // k`, `j` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `i` must be divisible by `k^3**
