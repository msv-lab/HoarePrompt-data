The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `T`, `n`, and `k`, where `T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, and `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 100`. Additionally, it accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^16. After executing the function body, the function returns `None` in all cases, regardless of the conditions specified.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept parameters `T`, `n`, `k`, and a list `a` of integers. The function does not return any specific value and returns `None` in all cases. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters T (1 ≤ T ≤ 1000), n (1 ≤ n ≤ 30), k (2 ≤ k ≤ 100), and a list a of n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^16), and it returns None in all cases.**
