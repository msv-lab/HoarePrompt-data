According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`. For this condition to be true, `i` must be divisible by `k` raised to the power of `(j + 1)`. 

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is set to at least `k`, meaning `i` could be equal to or greater than `k`.
- `j` is 2.
- Therefore, `j + 1` is 3, and `k ** (j + 1)` is `k ** 3`.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be such that it is divisible by `k ** 3`. Since `i` is currently at least `k`, it may or may not be divisible by `k ** 3`. 

To ensure the loop can execute again, we can state that `i` must be at least `k ** 3`. 

No other states need to be adjusted, as `j` is already set to 2, `r` is 1, and `li` has at least 1 element.

State: **`i` is at least `k`, `j` is 2, `r` is 1, `li` must have at least 1 element, and for the loop to execute again `i` must be at least `k ** 3`**.
