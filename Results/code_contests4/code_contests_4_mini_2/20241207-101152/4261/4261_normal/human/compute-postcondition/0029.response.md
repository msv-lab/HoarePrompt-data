According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and `j`. Specifically, the condition checks if `i` is divisible by `k` raised to the power of `j + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3, so the condition currently checks if `i % k ** 4 == 0`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be divisible by `k` raised to the power of `j + 1`, which would be `k ** 4`. Therefore, the state of `j` must remain the same, and no adjustments to `i` or `k` are necessary if we want the loop to execute again.

State: **`j` is 3, for the loop to execute again `i % k ** 4` must equal 0**
