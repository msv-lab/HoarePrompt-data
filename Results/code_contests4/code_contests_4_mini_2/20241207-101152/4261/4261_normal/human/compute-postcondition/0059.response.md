To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we need to analyze the effects of the while loops given the initial state and the output state after the first few iterations.

1. The outer loop runs while `i > 0`. Each iteration of this loop decreases `i` by 1.
2. Inside the outer loop, the inner loop calculates how many times `i` can be divided by `k` raised to increasing powers (starting from `k^1`), and this determines `j`.
3. The value of `j` is then incremented by `r`, which represents the value from the previous iteration of the outer loop.
4. The value of `j` is added to the set `req`, and if `j` is already in `req`, the function `func_2('NO')` is called, and the loop exits.
5. The value of `r` is then updated to the current value of `j`.

Given that `i` starts as a positive integer and is decremented until it reaches 0, we can conclude the following:

- The outer loop will execute exactly `i` times, decrementing `i` to 0.
- The value of `j` on each iteration depends on how many times `i` can be divided by powers of `k`, plus `r`.
- Each unique value of `j` will be added to `req`, preventing duplicates from causing the function to terminate early.

After all iterations of the loop have been executed, `i` will be 0, and `req` will contain all unique values of `j` calculated throughout the iterations, and `r` will have the last calculated value of `j` before `i` was decremented to 0.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `r` is the last calculated value of `j`, `req` contains all unique values of `j` computed during the iterations.**
