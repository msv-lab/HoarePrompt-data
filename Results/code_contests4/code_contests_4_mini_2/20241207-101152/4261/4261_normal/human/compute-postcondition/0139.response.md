According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the expression `i % k ** (j + 1)`. The loop will execute if `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`. 

Right before the loop, the program states are:
- `i` must be adjusted to at least 1, 
- `j` is 0, 
- `r` is `j`, which means `r` is currently 0, 
- `li` must have at least 1 element.

For the loop to execute the first time, we need to ensure that `i % k ** (j + 1)` evaluates to 0. Since `j` is 0, `k ** (j + 1)` simplifies to `k ** 1`, which is just `k`. Therefore, `i` needs to be a multiple of `k` (i.e., `i` should be at least `k` if `k` is greater than 0) for the loop condition to hold true.

Additionally, since `i` must be at least 1, it is sufficient to set `i` to be at least `k` where `k` is greater than or equal to 1. 

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `i` must be set to at least `k` (assuming `k` is a positive integer).
- `li` must have at least 1 element (which fulfills its condition).

State: **`i` set to at least `k`, `j` is 0, `r` is `j`, `li` must have at least 1 element**
