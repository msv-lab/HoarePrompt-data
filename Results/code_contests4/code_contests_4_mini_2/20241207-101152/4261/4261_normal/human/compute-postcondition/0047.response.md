According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and `j`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is divisible by `k` raised to the power of `j + 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, it is given that `i` is greater than 0 and `i` is divisible by `k`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be divisible by `k` raised to the power of the next value of `j + 1`, which is `j + 2`.

Since `j` was increased by 1 in the previous iteration, we need to ensure that `i` is also divisible by `k` raised to the power of `j + 2` for the loop to continue.

State: **`i` is greater than 0 and `i` is divisible by `k`; variable `j` is increased by 1, and for the loop to execute again `i` is divisible by `k` raised to the power of `j + 2`**
