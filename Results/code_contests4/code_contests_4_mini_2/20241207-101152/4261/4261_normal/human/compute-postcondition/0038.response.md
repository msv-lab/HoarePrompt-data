The `req` set is updated by adding the value of `j`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly affected by this operation; however, `j` is confirmed to not be an element of `req` before this addition. Therefore, the output state reflects that `j` has been added to `req`.

Output State: **`i` is reduced by the factor of `k` raised to the power of `j`, `j` is increased by `r`, `j` is added to `req`, and `j` is not an element of `req` before this operation.**
