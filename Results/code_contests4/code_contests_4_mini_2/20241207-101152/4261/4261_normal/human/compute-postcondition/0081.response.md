`j` is assigned the value 0. The previous values of the other variables remain unchanged: `i` is greater than 0, `r` is infinity, and `k` is 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is greater than 0, `r` is infinity, `j` is 0, `k` is 1.

Output State: **`i` is greater than 0, `r` is infinity, `j` is 0, `k` is 1**
