`j` is assigned the value `0`. The previous value of `j` is infinity, but it is stated that `j` is added to `req`, and now `j` is updated to `0`. The values of `i`, `r`, and `k` remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, after executing this code, the output state reflects the new value of `j`. 

Output State: **`i` is greater than 0, `r` is infinity, `j` is 0, `k` is 1, `j` is added to `req**
