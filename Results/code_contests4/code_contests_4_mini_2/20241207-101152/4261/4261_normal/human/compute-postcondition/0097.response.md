The value of `i` is decremented by 1. Since `i` is greater than 0, it will take a new value which is `i - 1`. The other variables `r`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is greater than 0, `r` is infinity, `j` is infinity, `k` is 1, `j` is not an element of `req`, and `j` is added to `req`; `i` is decremented by 1.

Output State: **`i` is greater than 0, `r` is infinity, `j` is infinity, `k` is 1, `j` is not an element of `req`, and `j` is added to `req; `i` is decremented by 1.**
