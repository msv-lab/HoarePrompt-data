The value of `i` is decremented by 1, but since `i` is greater than 0, its new value will be `greater than 0 - 1`. The values of `r` and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is greater than 0; `r` is infinity; `j` is increased by infinity.

Output State: **`i` is greater than 0; `r` is infinity; `j` is increased by infinity**
