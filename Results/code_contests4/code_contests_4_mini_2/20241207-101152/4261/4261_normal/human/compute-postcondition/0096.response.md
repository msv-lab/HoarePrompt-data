The value of `r` is assigned the value of `j`. Since `j` is infinity, `r` will also be set to infinity. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is greater than 0, `r` is infinity, `j` is infinity, `k` is 1, `j` is not an element of `req`, and `j` is added to `req`.

Output State: **`i` is greater than 0, `r` is infinity, `j` is infinity, `k` is 1, `j` is not an element of `req`, and `j` is added to `req.**
