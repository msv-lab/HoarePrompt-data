The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is 0, so after execution, `j` becomes 1. The states of the other variables (`i`, `r`, `li`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` set to at least `k`, `j` is 1, `r` is `j` (which is now 1), `li` must have at least 1 element.

Output State: **`i` set to at least `k`, `j` is 1, `r` is 1, `li` must have at least 1 element**
