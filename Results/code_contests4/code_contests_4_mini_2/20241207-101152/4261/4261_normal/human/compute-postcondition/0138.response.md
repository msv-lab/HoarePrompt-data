The value of `j` is assigned to 0. Since the initial state specifies that `j` remains unchanged, the value of `j` will now be 0. The other variables, `i`, `r`, and `li`, are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output remains consistent with the conditions provided in the initial state.

Output State: **`i` must be adjusted to at least 1, `j` is 0, `r` is `j`, and `li` must have at least 1 element**
