According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and `j`. The loop condition checks if `i` is divisible by `k` raised to the power of `j + 1`. For the loop to execute, `i % k ** (j + 1)` must equal 0.

Before the loop, `i` is reduced by 1, which means `i` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again. Additionally, since `j` is set to 0, the condition simplifies to whether `i` is divisible by `k`. 

To ensure that `i` is divisible by `k`, we can adjust `i` so that it satisfies the condition `i % k == 0`. 

So to summarize, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than 0 and also be divisible by `k`.

State: **`i` is greater than 0 and `i` is divisible by `k`.**
