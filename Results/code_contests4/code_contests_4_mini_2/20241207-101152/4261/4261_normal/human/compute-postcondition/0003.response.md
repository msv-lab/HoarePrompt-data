According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `args`. The loop will iterate over the `args` collection, and for it to execute at least once, `args` must contain at least one element.

The current state indicates that `T`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `at_start` do not directly affect the execution of the loop, but they set some context for the program. Since `args` is not defined in the given state, we need to ensure that `args` is a collection with at least one element for the loop to execute.

Thus, for the loop to be executed the first time, `args` must be a non-empty collection.

State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^{16}, `at_start` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `args` is a collection with at least 1 element**
