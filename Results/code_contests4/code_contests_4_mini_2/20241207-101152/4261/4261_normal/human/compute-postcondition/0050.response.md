The value of `i` is updated to `i //= k ** j`, which means `i` is divided by `k` raised to the power of `j`. Since `i` is greater than 0 and not divisible by `k`, this operation will result in `i` being reduced to a value that is still greater than or equal to 0, but not divisible by `k`. The other variable `j` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is modified to a new value based on the division by `k ** j`, and `j` remains unchanged as the maximum integer such that `i` is divisible by `k`.

Output State: **`i` is modified to a new value based on the division by `k ** j`, `j` remains unchanged.**
