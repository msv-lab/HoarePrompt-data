The code `i -= 1` decrements the value of `i` by 1. The previous value of `i` is not explicitly stated, but it is being updated to `i // k`, which suggests it is a non-negative integer. The code does not affect `j` or `r` directly, but since `r` was updated to the value of `j`, the relationship between `j` and `r` remains intact.

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is updated to `i // k`, `j` is increased by `r`, `r` is now equal to the updated value of `j`, and `i` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`i` is updated to `i // k`, `j` is increased by `r`, `r` is now equal to the updated value of `j`, and `i` is decreased by 1.**
