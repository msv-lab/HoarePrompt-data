The variable `j` is added to the set `req`. Since `j` is not an element of `req` before this operation, it will now be included in `req`. The values of `i` and `r` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `j` has been added to `req` while the other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`i` is such that it is no longer divisible by `k` raised to the power of `j + 1`; `j` is now an element of `req`; `r` remains 0.**
