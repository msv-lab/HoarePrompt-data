Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^{16}, `at_start` is False, `args` has been fully iterated over, and all elements of `args` have been written to the file, with `sep` written between the elements except before the first one; and the file ends with the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')`, which defaults to a newline character if 'end' is not provided in `kwargs`.**
