The code `req.add(j)` adds the value of `j` to the set `req`. The variables `i` and `j` were previously updated, but their specific values are not provided in the initial state. The operation does not affect `i` or any other variables but modifies the set `req` by including the new value of `j`. 

Output State: **`i` is updated to `i // k`, `j` is increased by `r`, and `j` is added to `req`.**
