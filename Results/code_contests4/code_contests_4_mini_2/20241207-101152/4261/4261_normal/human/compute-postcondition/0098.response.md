According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than 0, so it is valid for the loop to execute one more time without needing any adjustments. 

State: **`i` is greater than 0, `r` is infinity, `j` is infinity, `k` is 1, `j` is not an element of `req`, and `j` is added to `req; `i` is decremented by 1**
