According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the exponent of `k`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is divisible by `k^(j + 1)`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is updated to `i // k`, `j` is 2, and for the loop to execute again, `i` must be divisible by `k^3` (since `j + 1` is 3). 

Since `i` was updated to `i // k`, in order for `i` to still be divisible by `k^3`, `i` must have been at least `k^4` before the last iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that `i` is a multiple of `k^3` after the update.

Hence, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `i` must satisfy this condition.

State: **`i` is updated to `i // k`, `j` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `i` must be divisible by `k^3`**
