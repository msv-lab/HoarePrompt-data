According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is reduced by 1, meaning that for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be at least 1 before the next iteration. Therefore, `i` currently must be greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`i` is reduced by 1; `j` is increased by `r`; `j` is added to `req`; `j` is not an element of `req` before this operation; and for the loop to execute again `i` must be greater than 0**
