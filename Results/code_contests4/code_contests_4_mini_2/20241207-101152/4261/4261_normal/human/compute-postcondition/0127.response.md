The loop increments `j` as long as `i` is divisible by `k` raised to the power of `j + 1`. Since `i` is greater than 0 and `k` is defined such that `i` is divisible by `k`, the loop will continue executing until `i` is no longer divisible by `k` raised to a certain power.

After all iterations of the loop:

- `i` remains greater than 0,
- `li` still has at least 1 element,
- `r` remains 0,
- `j` will be the highest value such that `i` is divisible by `k` raised to the power of `j + 1`, meaning `i` is no longer divisible by `k` raised to the power of `j + 2`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is greater than 0, `li` must have at least 1 element, `r` is 0, `j` is the largest integer such that `i` is divisible by `k` raised to the power of `j + 1`**
