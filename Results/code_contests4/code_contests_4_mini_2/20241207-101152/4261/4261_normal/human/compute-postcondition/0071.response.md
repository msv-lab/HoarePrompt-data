The operation `i //= k ** j` performs integer division of `i` by `k` raised to the power of `j`. Given the initial state, we have `i` is 1, `r` is 0, `j` is infinity, and `k` is 1. 

Calculating `k ** j`:
- Since `k` is 1 and `j` is infinity, `1 ** infinity` is equal to 1.

Now substituting into the operation:
- The operation becomes `i //= 1`, which means `i` will be integer divided by 1.

The result of `1 // 1` is 1. Therefore, the value of `i` remains unchanged.

The states of `r` and `j` are not affected, so they remain 0 and infinity, respectively.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `r` is 0, `j` is infinity, `k` is 1**
