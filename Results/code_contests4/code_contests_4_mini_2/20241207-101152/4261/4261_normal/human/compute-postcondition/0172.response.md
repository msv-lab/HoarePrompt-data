The value of `i` is decremented by 1, but since the previous value of `i` is unknown and it is stated that `i` is no longer divisible by `k` raised to the power of `j + 1`, the specific impact on divisibility cannot be determined. The values of `j` and `r` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is now one less than its previous value; `j` is still an element of `req`; `r` is `j`.

Output State: **`i` is now one less than its previous value; `j` is still an element of `req`; `r` is `j`.**
