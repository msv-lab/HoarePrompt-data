Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`, and a list `li` of `n` integers. It processes each integer in `li`, calculating a value `j` based on the divisibility by powers of `k` and tracks unique values of `j`. If a duplicate value is found, it calls `func_2` with 'NO' and exits; otherwise, after processing all integers, it calls `func_2` with 'YES'. The function does not return any value, always resulting in a return of None.**
