The value of `j` is incremented by 1, and since `j` is initially 2, after execution, `j` becomes 3. The other variables `i`, `r`, and `k` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is greater than 0, `r` is infinity, `j` is 3, `k` is 1.

Output State: **`i` is greater than 0, `r` is infinity, `j` is 3, `k` is 1**
