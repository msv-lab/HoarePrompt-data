According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and `j`. The loop continues as long as `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, which means the loop condition is checking if `i` is divisible by `k ** 2`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be divisible by `k ** 2`, which means that the condition will hold true. The current state does not provide information on the values of `i` or `k`, but it can be deduced that if `i` was divisible by `k ** 2` previously, it should remain so for the loop to execute again. 

Since `j` is currently 1, it needs to be incremented to 2 for the next iteration of the loop to check if `i` is divisible by `k ** 3`. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect this increment.

State: **`j` is 2**
