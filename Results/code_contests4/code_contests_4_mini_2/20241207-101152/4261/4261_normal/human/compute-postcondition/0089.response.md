The variable `i` is assigned the value of `i //= k ** j`, where `k` is 1 and `j` is infinity. Calculating `k ** j`, we get `1 ** infinity`, which is 1. Therefore, `i` is assigned the value of `i // 1`. Since `i` is greater than 0, `i // 1` is equal to `i`. The values of `r` and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is greater than 0, `r` is infinity, `j` is infinity, `k` is 1; `i` remains unchanged.**
