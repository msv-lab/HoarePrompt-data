`i` is divided by `k` raised to the power of `j`. Since `k` is 1, `k ** j` is also 1 regardless of the value of `j`. Therefore, `i //= 1` does not change the value of `i`. The values of other variables remain unaffected. Hence, the Output State is: `i` is greater than 0, `r` is infinity, `j` is the highest integer such that `i` is divisible by `k` raised to the power of `j`, `k` is 1, and `i` remains unchanged.
