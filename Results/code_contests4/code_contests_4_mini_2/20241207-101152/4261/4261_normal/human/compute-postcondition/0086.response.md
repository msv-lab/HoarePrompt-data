According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `k`. The condition for the loop to execute is that `i % k ** (j + 1)` must equal 0. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `i` is greater than 0, `r` is infinity, `j` is 2, and `k` is 1. 

Calculating `k ** (j + 1)`: 
- Since `k` is 1 and `j` is 2, we have `k ** (j + 1) = 1 ** (2 + 1) = 1 ** 3 = 1`.

This means the loop condition simplifies to `i % 1 == 0`, which is always true for any integer `i` greater than 0. Thus, `i` does not need to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute again; it is sufficient as is.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be considered is that `i` must remain greater than 0 for the loop to execute again, which it currently is.

State: **`i` is greater than 0, `r` is infinity, `j` is 2, `k` is 1**
