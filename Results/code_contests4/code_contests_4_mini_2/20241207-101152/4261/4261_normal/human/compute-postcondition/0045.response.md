According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and `j`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is divisible by `k` raised to the power of `j + 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `i` is greater than 0 and `i` is divisible by `k` since `j` was increased by 1. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be divisible by `k` raised to the power of `j + 1`. 

Since `j` has been increased by 1, we need to ensure that `i` is also divisible by `k` raised to the power of `j + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, we must adjust `i` to be divisible by `k` raised to the power of `j + 2`.

State: **`i` is greater than 0 and `i` is divisible by `k`; variable `j` is increased by 1, and for the loop to execute again `i` must also be divisible by `k` raised to the power of `j + 2**
