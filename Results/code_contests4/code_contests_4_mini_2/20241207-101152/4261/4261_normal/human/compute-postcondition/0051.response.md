The value of `j` is incremented by `r`, but the previous values of `j` and `r` are unknown, so the output state reflects that `j` has been modified. The state of `i` remains unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is modified to a new value based on the division by `k`; `j` is increased by `r`.

Output State: **`i` is modified to a new value based on the division by `k`; `j` is increased by `r**
