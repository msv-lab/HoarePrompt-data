Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^{16}. The values remain unchanged as the code only describes a function without executing any operations.**
