The variable `j` is initialized to 0. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed, and since `i` is greater than 0, `li` has at least 1 element, and `r` is 0, these states remain intact. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is greater than 0, `li` must have at least 1 element, `r` is 0, and `j` is 0.

Output State: **`i` is greater than 0, `li` must have at least 1 element, `r` is 0, and `j` is 0**
