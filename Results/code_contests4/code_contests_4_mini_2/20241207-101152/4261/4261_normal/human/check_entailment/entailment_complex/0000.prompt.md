You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Suppose you are performing the following algorithm. There is an array v_1, v_2, ..., v_n filled with zeroes at start. The following operation is applied to the array several times — at i-th step (0-indexed) you can: 

  * either choose position pos (1 ≤ pos ≤ n) and increase v_{pos} by k^i; 
  * or not choose any position and skip this step. 



You can choose how the algorithm would behave on each step and when to stop it. The question is: can you make array v equal to the given array a (v_j = a_j for each j) after some step?

Input

The first line contains one integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. Next 2T lines contain test cases — two lines per test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 30, 2 ≤ k ≤ 100) — the size of arrays v and a and value k used in the algorithm.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^{16}) — the array you'd like to achieve.

Output

For each test case print YES (case insensitive) if you can achieve the array a after some step or NO (case insensitive) otherwise.

Example

Input


5
4 100
0 0 0 0
1 2
1
3 4
1 4 1
3 2
0 1 3
3 9
0 59049 810


Output


YES
YES
NO
NO
YES

Note

In the first test case, you can stop the algorithm before the 0-th step, or don't choose any position several times and stop the algorithm.

In the second test case, you can add k^0 to v_1 and stop the algorithm.

In the third test case, you can't make two 1 in the array v.

In the fifth test case, you can skip 9^0 and 9^1, then add 9^2 and 9^3 to v_3, skip 9^4 and finally, add 9^5 to v_2.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: T is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, k is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 100, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^16.
def func_1():
    n, k = get_list()
    li = get_list()
    req = set()
    for i in li:
        r = 0
        
        while i > 0:
            j = 0
            while i % k ** (j + 1) == 0:
                j += 1
            i //= k ** j
            j += r
            if j in req:
                func_2('NO')
                return
            req.add(j)
            r = j
            i -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is -1, `r` is the last computed value of `j`, `j` is the last computed value before exiting the loop, `req` contains all unique values of `j` computed during the iterations.
    func_2('YES')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`, and a list `li` of `n` integers. It processes each integer in `li`, calculating a value `j` based on the divisibility by powers of `k` and tracks unique values of `j`. If a duplicate value is found, it calls `func_2` with 'NO' and exits; otherwise, after processing all integers, it calls `func_2` with 'YES'. The function does not return any value, always resulting in a return of None.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: T is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, k is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 100, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^{16}.

    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        
        file.write(str(x))
        
        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^{16}, `at_start` is False, `args` has been fully iterated over, and all elements of `args` have been written to the file, with `sep` written between the elements except before the first one.
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^{16}, `at_start` is False, `args` has been fully iterated over, and all elements of `args` have been written to the file with `sep` written between the elements except before the first one; the file ends with the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')`. If `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is True, the file buffer is flushed, ensuring that all data written to the file is pushed out to the underlying storage.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts variable arguments and keyword arguments for printing. It writes the elements of `args` to a specified output stream (`file`), separating them with a specified separator (`sep`). After writing all elements, it appends an ending character (default is a newline) and optionally flushes the output buffer if the `flush` keyword argument is set to True. It does not use the parameters `T`, `n`, `k`, and `a` in its logic, making those parameters irrelevant to its functionality.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
