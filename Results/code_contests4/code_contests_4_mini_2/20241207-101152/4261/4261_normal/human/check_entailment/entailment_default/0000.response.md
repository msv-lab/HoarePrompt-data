To assess the correctness of the provided code based on the problem description, let's break down the code's functionality and the output hints.

### Problem Description
The program aims to determine if it is possible to transform an array of zeroes into a given target array `a` using a specified algorithm. Each element of the array can be incremented by a power of `k` (i.e., `k^i`) during each step, and the algorithm can be stopped at any point.

### Code Functionality
1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - It reads the input values `n` and `k`, and an array `li`.
   - It processes each integer in `li` to compute a value `j` based on how many times `i` can be divided by powers of `k`.
   - It tracks unique values of `j` in the set `req`.
   - If a duplicate `j` is found, it outputs 'NO'; otherwise, it outputs 'YES' after processing all integers.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function handles the output, printing the result to the console.

### Output Hints
The output hints describe that:
- The function processes each integer in the list, calculating a value based on divisibility by powers of `k`.
- If a duplicate value of `j` is found, it indicates that the required array cannot be formed.
- If all values are unique, it concludes that it can achieve the target array.

### Initial Assessment
The code seems to follow the problem's logic by:
- Ensuring that the powers of `k` can only contribute unique values to the target array.
- Stopping the algorithm or skipping steps is inherently handled by not forcibly incrementing any values.

### Edge Cases Consideration
1. **Case of all zeros:** The code must handle the case where the target array is all zeroes. It should return 'YES' since no operations are needed.
2. **Duplicate values in target array:** If the target array has the same non-zero value more than once (e.g., `[1, 1]`), it should return 'NO' because you cannot achieve the same power of `k` at different indices.
3. **Handling large values:** The input constraint allows values up to `10^16`, so we must ensure that the calculations do not cause overflow or incorrect results.

### Agreement of Output Hints with Code
The output hints are consistent with the function's logic:
- The function does check for duplicates and outputs 'NO' when necessary.
- The hints correctly explain that the function will output 'YES' if it can achieve the target configuration without duplicates.

### Conclusion
Given that the function can correctly handle the edge cases discussed and aligns with the output hints, it appears to follow the problem description correctly.

Correctness: **True**. 

### Explanation
The program correctly identifies when a target array can be formed from zeroes by checking for unique values derived from powers of `k`. All edge cases, including duplicates and the case of an all-zero target array, are handled according to the problem's requirements.
