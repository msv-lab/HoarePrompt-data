To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and the annotations in the code, let's analyze both the program logic and the annotations step by step.

### Problem Breakdown
The problem states that you can operate on an initially zeroed array `v` using a value `k` to achieve a target array `a`. The operations involve adding powers of `k` based on the step index. The main question is whether it is possible to construct the array `a` from the array `v` using the defined operations.

### Code Overview
1. The function `func_1()` is responsible for processing each test case. 
2. It reads integers `n` and `k`, as well as the array `li`.
3. The core logic involves determining if each number in `li` (target array `a`) can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of `k` (considering the step indices).
4. The program checks for repeated positions (i.e., if the same power is required more than once) which would indicate that it's impossible to form `a`.

### Annotations Analysis
- The annotations indicate that if a duplicate value `j` is found in `req`, it will call `func_2('NO')`.
- The output is either "YES" or "NO", indicating whether the target array can be formed or not.

### Edge Cases
From the problem description and the provided examples:
- If `a` contains any number greater than the maximum power of `k` that could be represented within the bounds (which is quite large since `k` can be up to 100), it may lead to issues.
- The program must ensure that any `a[i]` is expressible in terms of distinct powers of `k` without repetition.

### Specific Failure Case
Let's consider a specific case:
- If `k = 3` and we want to achieve `a = [0, 1, 3]`. 
  - The only powers we can use are `3^0 (1)`, `3^1 (3)`, and `3^2 (9)`, etc. 
  - The number `3` can be achieved, but `1` should not overlap with any future step's usage of `3^0`. 
  - The program would need to track how many times each power is utilized and cannot reuse the same power at different indices, but that check seems to be flawed if not all cases are covered.

### Conclusion
The logic in the code does not correctly handle cases where the same power of `k` is needed multiple times across different elements of `a`. For example, if `a` requires two `1`s, this cannot be achieved because we can only use `3^0` once, leading to a failure to produce the correct output.

**Correctness: False**

The program does not cover all edge cases effectively, particularly those involving multiple uses of the same power.
