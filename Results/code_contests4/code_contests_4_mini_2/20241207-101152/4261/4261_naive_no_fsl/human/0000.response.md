To analyze the correctness of the provided Python program, we must ensure it adheres to the given problem description regarding the ability to reach a target array `a` from an initial array of zeros using the specified operations.

The key points to consider in the problem are:
1. You can increase any element of the array `v` by `k^i` at the `i-th` step (0-indexed).
2. You can skip steps as needed.
3. The array `v` must match the array `a` after some steps.

### Analysis of the Provided Code

The function `func_1()` processes each test case by:
1. Reading the size of the array `n` and the base `k`.
2. Reading the target array `a`.
3. Iterating over each element of `a` to determine if it can be achieved using powers of `k`.

#### Key Logic in the Code
- The code utilizes a set `req` to track the unique powers of `k` that are necessary to construct the values in `a`.
- For each value in `a`, the code calculates how many times it can be divided by increasing powers of `k` until it cannot be divided anymore.
- It checks if the resulting index (after considering how many divisions were performed) has already been used (exists in `req`). If it has, then it cannot achieve the target, and it outputs 'NO'. If it can allocate the necessary powers to achieve the value without collisions, it outputs 'YES'.

### Identifying Edge Cases
1. **Case with Maximum Values**: Consider the case where `a` contains the maximum possible values, for example, `a = [10^16]` with `k = 2`. The code should correctly identify that it's not possible to achieve a single value of `10^16` since it would require multiple uses of the same power of `k`.

2. **Multiple Same Values**: If `a` contains multiple identical values, such as `a = [1, 1]` with `k = 3`, the program should recognize that achieving two `1`s requires using the same power of `k`, which is not allowed.

3. **Skipping Steps**: The behavior when `a` contains zeros, such as `a = [0, 0, 0]`, should return 'YES' because we can skip all steps.

### Testing the Edge Cases
If we test the code with the example of `a = [1, 1]` and `k = 3`, the program should output 'NO' because it cannot produce two `1`s without using the same power of `k` more than once.

### Conclusion
The provided code fails to handle the case where duplicate values exist in `a`, as it does not account for the necessity of using the same power more than once. Therefore, it incorrectly answers 'YES' for cases where it should answer 'NO'.

Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
