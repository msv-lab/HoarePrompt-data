According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates over the range from `0` to `i`, but since `i` is currently set to `n + 1` (which is greater than `n`), the loop can execute. However, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be adjusted to be greater than its current value of `n`, which is not possible since `n` is fixed within the given bounds (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100). 

Therefore, for the loop to execute for the first time, `j` will start at `0` and go up to `n`, and the value of `i` must remain `n + 1` for the loop to iterate correctly. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is `n + 1`, for the loop to execute `j` is 0 and continues until `j` is less than `i` (which is `n + 1`)**.
