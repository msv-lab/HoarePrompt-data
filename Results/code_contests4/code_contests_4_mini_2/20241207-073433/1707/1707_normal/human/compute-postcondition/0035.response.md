The loop iterates over each element `i` from 1 to `n`, and for each `i`, it iterates over all preceding elements `j` from 0 to `i-1`. During each iteration, it updates `ans` to ensure it holds the maximum value of the bitwise XOR between `a[i]` and each `a[j]`. After all iterations are complete, `ans` will contain the maximum XOR value computed across all valid pairs of `a[i]` and `a[j]`.

Given that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, after all iterations, `ans` will reflect the maximum XOR of any element `a[i]` with all preceding elements `a[j]` for `0 ≤ j < i` where `1 ≤ i ≤ n`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `ans` is the maximum XOR value computed from all pairs `a[i]` and `a[j]` for `0 ≤ j < i` and `1 ≤ i ≤ n`.**
