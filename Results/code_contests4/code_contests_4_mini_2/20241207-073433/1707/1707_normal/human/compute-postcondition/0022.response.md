According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `i`. The loop iterates as long as `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `i` is `n + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1. 

Since `j` is currently 0, to execute the loop again, `j` will become 1 in the next iteration, and for the loop to continue executing, `i` must remain greater than `j`. Since `i` is `n + 1`, it will always be greater than `j` as long as `n` is at least 1.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `i` is `n + 1`; `j` is 1; for the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be greater than 1.**
