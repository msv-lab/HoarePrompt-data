The code `a[i] ^= a[i - 1]` performs a bitwise XOR operation between the element at index `i` of the list `a` and the element at index `i - 1`. Since `i` is 3, this means we are looking at `a[3]` and `a[2]`.

The output state will depend on the values of `a[3]` and `a[2]`. However, since we do not have the specific values of the list `a`, we can only state that the operation modifies `a[3]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `i` is 3, and `a[3]` is modified by performing `a[3] ^= a[2]`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `i` is 3, and `a[3]` is modified by performing `a[3] ^= a[2]`.**
