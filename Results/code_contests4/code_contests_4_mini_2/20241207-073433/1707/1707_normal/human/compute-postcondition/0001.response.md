The variable `s` is assigned the value of `raw_input().split()`, which means it will hold a list of strings created by splitting the input string based on whitespace. The previous value of `n` is not affected by this operation, and `s` will now contain the input as a list of strings. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, it remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `s` is a list of strings from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `s` is a list of strings from the input.**
