According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit defined by `i`. The loop is set to run for `j` in the range from 0 to `i - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`, which means `j` has reached its maximum value of `i - 1` (or `n`), since `j` starts at 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to `n`, and `i` remains unchanged since it was based on `n`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is `n + 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be equal to `n`**
