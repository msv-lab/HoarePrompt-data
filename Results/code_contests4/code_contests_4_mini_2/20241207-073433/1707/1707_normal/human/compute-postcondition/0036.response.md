The code `print(ans)` outputs the value of `ans`. The value of `ans` has been previously calculated as the maximum XOR value from all pairs `a[i]` and `a[j]` for `0 ≤ j < i` and `1 ≤ i ≤ n`. Since no new calculations or assignments are made in this line of code, the other variable `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `ans` is the maximum XOR value computed from all pairs `a[i]` and `a[j]` for `0 ≤ j < i` and `1 ≤ i ≤ n`; `ans` is printed.**
