According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The `range(0, i)` function generates numbers starting from 0 up to, but not including, `i`. Since `i` is currently set to 1, the range will produce a single value, which is 0. Therefore, the loop will execute exactly once.

The initial state of `n` does not affect the execution of this loop, but it is constrained by the condition 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. The variable `j` will take the value of 0 during the single iteration of the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `j` will be 0**
