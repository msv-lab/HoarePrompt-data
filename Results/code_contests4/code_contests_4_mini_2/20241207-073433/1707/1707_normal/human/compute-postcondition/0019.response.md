According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n`, inclusive. The variable `i` is currently between 1 and `n`, which means at the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to `n + 1`, which is outside the range of the loop.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, and since `n` is at its maximum valid value, the next iteration will not execute because `i` (which will become `n + 1`) exceeds the upper limit of the loop range.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `i` is `n + 1` (which is greater than `n`), for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than `n`.**
