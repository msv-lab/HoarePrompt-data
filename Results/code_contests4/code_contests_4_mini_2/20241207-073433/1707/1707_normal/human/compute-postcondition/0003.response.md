According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `n`. The range function `range(1, n + 1)` generates values from 1 to `n` inclusive. Given that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, this means that the loop will execute at least once if `n` is at least 1. 

Before the loop starts, `s` is a list of strings, and `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integer values derived from the first `n` elements of `s`. The index variable `i` will start at 1 for the first iteration.

To summarize, for the loop to execute:
- The variable `n` must be at least 1.
- The variable `i` will be initialized to 1 at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is at least 1**
