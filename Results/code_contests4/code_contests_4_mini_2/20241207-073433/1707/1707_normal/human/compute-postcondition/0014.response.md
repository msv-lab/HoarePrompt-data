According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the value of `j` in relation to `i`. The loop will execute while `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1. 

Since `j` is 0 and will be incremented to 1 for the next iteration, and for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `i`. 

Therefore, after the next iteration, `j` will be 1, and since `i` is 1, `j` will no longer be less than `i`, and the loop will not execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `i` is 1, `j` is 1; for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than 1**
