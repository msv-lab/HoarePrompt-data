In the given code snippet, `a[i]` is modified using the XOR operation with the previous element `a[i - 1]`. The values of `n` and `i` are as follows: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and `i` is initialized to 1. Since the loop is set to execute at least once, `a[i]` must exist, and `a[i - 1]` is also valid because `i` is 1.

Assuming `a` is a list/array that has been defined with at least two elements (since `i` is 1), the operation `a[i] ^= a[i - 1]` updates `a[i]` to the result of `a[i] XOR a[i - 1]`.

The state of the variables would be affected as follows: 
- `a[i]` will change based on the XOR operation with `a[i - 1]`, while `a[i - 1]` remains unchanged. The specific values of `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` are not provided, but we can infer that `a[i]` will take on a new value based on the XOR calculation.

Therefore, with `a[i]` changing, the output state reflects that `a[i]` has been modified.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `i` is 1, `a[i]` is updated to `a[i] XOR a[i - 1]`.**
