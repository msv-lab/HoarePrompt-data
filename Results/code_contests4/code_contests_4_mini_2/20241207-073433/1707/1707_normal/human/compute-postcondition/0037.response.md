The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as it takes input in the form of standard input (stdin). The input consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` which is constrained to be between 1 and 100, and the second line contains `n` space-separated non-negative integers, each strictly less than \(2^{30}\). 

After processing the input, the function is expected to perform some operations based on the provided integers. However, since the output is not specified in the provided information, we cannot determine the exact return value or the nature of the output.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to read an integer `n` and a list of `n` non-negative integers from standard input, while the specific output or behavior based on these inputs is not described.

Functionality: **The function reads an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and n space-separated non-negative integers (each < 2^30) from standard input. The output behavior is not specified.**
