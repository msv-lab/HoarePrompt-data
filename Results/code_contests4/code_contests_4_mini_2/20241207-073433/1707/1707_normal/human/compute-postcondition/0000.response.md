`n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int()` converts it to an integer. Since `n` is already an integer in the initial state, the value remains within the bounds specified (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100**
