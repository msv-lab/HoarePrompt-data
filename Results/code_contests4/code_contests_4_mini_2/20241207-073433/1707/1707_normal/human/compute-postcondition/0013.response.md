In the given code snippet, `ans` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and the result of the bitwise XOR operation between `a[i]` and `a[j]`. The variables `i` and `j` are defined as `i = 1` and `j = 0`. The output state will depend on the values of `a[i]` and `a[j]`, which are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the exact computation can't be performed, but we can mention that `ans` is updated based on the maximum of its current value and the XOR of the two specific elements from array `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `i` is 1, `j` is 0; `ans` is updated to max(ans, a[1] ^ a[0])**
