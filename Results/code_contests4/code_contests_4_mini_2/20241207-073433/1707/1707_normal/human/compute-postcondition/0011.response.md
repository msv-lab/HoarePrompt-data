According to the code, the loop is set to iterate from 1 to n (inclusive), which means it will execute if n is at least 1. The initial state mentions that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, which ensures that n is at least 1. Also, the variable `i` will start from 1 when the loop executes for the first time. 

The state of `ans` does not affect the execution of the loop as it is initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be within the specified bounds, and `i` will be initialized to 1 when the loop starts.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `i` is 1**
