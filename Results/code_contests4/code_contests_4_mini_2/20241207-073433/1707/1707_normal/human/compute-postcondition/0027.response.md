According to the code, the `for` loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n + 1`, which means it will execute for values of `i` starting from 1 up to and including `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`, which means the loop has completed all its iterations since `i` no longer satisfies the condition for the loop to run again.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to update `i` to `n + 2` (which is what it would be if the loop were still executing) and note that the loop cannot execute again as the condition `1 ≤ i ≤ n + 1` is not satisfied.

Thus, the relevant states are:
- `n` remains the same.
- `i` should be adjusted to `n + 2`, which is outside the valid range for the loop.

Since the loop cannot execute again, we do not need to adjust `ans` or any values related to the loop body.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `i` is `n + 2`, for the loop to execute again `i` must be less than or equal to `n + 1`**
