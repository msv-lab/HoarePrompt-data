According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop is set to execute for values of `i` starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

After the last iteration, `i` will become 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 2 (since `i` must be less than or equal to `n`).

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**
