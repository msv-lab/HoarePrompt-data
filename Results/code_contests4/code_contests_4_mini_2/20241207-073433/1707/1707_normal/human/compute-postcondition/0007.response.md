According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3. Additionally, `n` must be at least 3 to allow the loop to continue executing.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `i` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be greater than or equal to 3**
