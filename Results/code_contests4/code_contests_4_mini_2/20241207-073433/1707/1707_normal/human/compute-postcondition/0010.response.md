The variable `ans` is assigned the value `0`. The initial state of `n` and `a[i]` remains unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a[i]` is the result of the XOR operation of all preceding elements from `a[0]` to `a[i]` for `1 ≤ i ≤ n; ans` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a[i]` is the result of the XOR operation of all preceding elements from `a[0]` to `a[i]` for `1 ≤ i ≤ n; `ans` is 0.**
