You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Little Petya likes arrays that consist of non-negative integers a lot. Recently his mom has presented him one such array consisting of n elements. Petya immediately decided to find there a segment of consecutive elements, such that the xor of all numbers from this segment was maximal possible. Help him with that.

The xor operation is the bitwise exclusive "OR", that is denoted as "xor" in Pascal and "^" in C/C++/Java.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in the array. The second line contains the space-separated integers from the array. All numbers are non-negative integers strictly less than 230.

Output

Print a single integer — the required maximal xor of a segment of consecutive elements.

Examples

Output

Note

In the first sample one of the optimal segments is the segment that consists of the first and the second array elements, if we consider the array elements indexed starting from one.

The second sample contains only one optimal segment, which contains exactly one array element (element with index three).
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the second line contains n space-separated non-negative integers, each strictly less than 2^30.
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    s = raw_input().split()
    a = [0] + [int(s[i]) for i in range(0, n)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        a[i] ^= a[i - 1]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a[i]` is the result of the XOR operation of all preceding elements from `a[0]` to `a[i]` for `1 ≤ i ≤ n.`
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(0, i):
            ans = max(ans, a[i] ^ a[j])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `ans` is the maximum XOR value computed from all pairs `a[i]` and `a[j]` for `0 ≤ j < i` and `1 ≤ i ≤ n`.
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and reads `n` space-separated non-negative integers (each less than 2^30). It calculates the maximum XOR value of all pairs formed by the prefix XORs of the integers, and prints this maximum value.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
