The function accepts a 2D list of integers `x4`, representing a grid. It returns a new list formed by applying `func_1` to the first two rows of `x4` concatenated with the remaining rows if there are more than two rows. If there are exactly two rows, it returns the result of `func_1` applied to those two rows. If there is only one row, it returns that first row. The function effectively processes the grid based on its height, handling edge cases for different numbers of rows.
