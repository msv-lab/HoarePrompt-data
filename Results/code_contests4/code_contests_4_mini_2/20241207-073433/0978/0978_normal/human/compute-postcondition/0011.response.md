Functionality: ** The function accepts two non-negative integers `x` and `y`, representing the dimensions of a grid (number of rows and columns, respectively). It computes and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. If `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, it checks if `x` is divisible by `y`; if so, it returns `y`. If not, it recursively calls itself with `y` and `x % y`. If `y` is greater than `x`, it checks if `y` is divisible by `x`; if so, it returns `x`. If not, it recursively calls itself with `x` and `y % x`. The function does not handle cases where either `x` or `y` is zero, which could lead to an infinite recursion or incorrect behavior, particularly when both are zero.**
