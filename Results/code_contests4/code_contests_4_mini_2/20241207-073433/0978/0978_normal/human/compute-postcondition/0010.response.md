The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are non-negative integers, where `x` represents the number of horizontal rows (H) in the grid and `y` represents the number of vertical columns (W) in the grid. The function evaluates the following cases based on the relationship between `x` and `y`:

- Case 1: The function returns the non-negative integer `y`, indicating the number of vertical columns (W) in the grid, where `y` is less than or equal to `x` and adheres to the specified constraints for H and W.
  
- Case 2: The function returns the result of calling `func_1` with arguments `y` and `(x % y)`, which indicates a non-zero value since `x` is not divisible by `y`.

- Case 3: The function returns the non-negative integer `x`, representing the number of horizontal rows (H) in the grid, under the condition that `x` is less than `y`.

- Case 4: The function returns the result of calling `func_1` with arguments `x` and `(y modulo x)`, given that `x` is less than `y` and `y` is not divisible by `x`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two non-negative integers `x` and `y`, representing the dimensions of a grid, and return values based on specific conditions involving these integers. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `x` and `y`, both non-negative integers representing the dimensions of a grid, and returns values based on their relationships: it returns `y` if `y` <= `x`, calls itself with arguments `y` and `(x % y)` if `x` is not divisible by `y`, returns `x` if `x` < `y`, and calls itself with arguments `x` and `(y % x)` if `x` < `y` and `y` is not divisible by `x`.**
