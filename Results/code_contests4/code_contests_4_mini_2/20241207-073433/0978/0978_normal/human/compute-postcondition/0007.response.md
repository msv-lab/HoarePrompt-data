The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `x4`. `x4` is a 2D list of integers representing a grid of size H x W, where 1 <= H, W <= 500 and 0 <= a_{ij} <= 9 for each cell (i, j) in the grid. 

- In Case 1, the function returns a new list formed by applying `func_1` to the first two rows of the 2D list `x4` and concatenating it with the remaining rows of `x4` starting from the third row.
- In Case 2, the function returns the result of the function `func_1` applied to the first and second rows of the 2D list `x4`, which are both lists of integers representing grid cells.
- In Case 3, the function returns the first row of the 2D list `x4`, which is a grid of integers with dimensions H x W and contains values between 0 and 9.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a 2D list of integers `x4` and return different outputs based on the conditions specified in the cases. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a 2D list of integers x4 representing a grid and returns either a new list formed by applying `func_1` to the first two rows concatenated with the remaining rows (Case 1), the result of `func_1` applied to the first two rows (Case 2), or the first row of the grid (Case 3).**
