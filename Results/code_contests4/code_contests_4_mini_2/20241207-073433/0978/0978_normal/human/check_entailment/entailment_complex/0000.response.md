Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not adhere to the problem description in multiple ways. Firstly, the code does not implement the necessary logic to maximize the number of cells containing an even number of coins, as required. Instead, it contains two functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) that seem to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of grid dimensions and process the grid dimensions but do not address the actual goal of redistributing coins within the grid.

Moreover, the annotations indicate that the functions are primarily concerned with the lengths of rows and columns and their GCD, which is irrelevant to the task of moving coins to maximize even distribution. For example, the function `func_2` is designed to return a list based on the GCD calculation, but there is no logic for performing operations on the grid cells or for producing valid moves to achieve the goal of maximizing even-numbered cells.

A critical edge case occurs when we have a grid with all odd numbers of coins in every cell (e.g., a grid like `[[1, 1], [1, 1]]`). The program fails to provide any operations that would lead to an even distribution since it does not consider the redistribution logic required by the problem statement.

In conclusion, the absence of any mechanism to perform the required operations to maximize even counts in grid cells makes the program incorrect.
