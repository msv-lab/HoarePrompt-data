Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description. The problem description requires a program that maximizes the number of cells containing an even number of coins by performing specified operations on a grid of coins. Specifically, it needs to output the number of operations performed and the details of each operation in a specific format.

However, the annotated program consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which appear to be related to some form of numerical computation involving the dimensions of the grid or the values of its cells, rather than performing the required operations on the grid itself. 

1. **Function Purpose**: 
   - `func_1` seems to implement a form of the Euclidean algorithm for calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) based on the dimensions of the grid. It returns one of the dimensions of the grid, which is unrelated to maximizing even coin counts or performing operations on the grid cells.
   - `func_2` processes the rows of the grid but does not perform any operations to move coins between cells. It merely returns values derived from `func_1`, which does not align with the problem requirements of moving coins to maximize even counts.

2. **Missing Functionality**: 
   - There is no logic present in the provided code to actually perform the required operations (i.e., moving coins between cells) or to generate the output format specified in the problem description. The program fails to provide the necessary steps to achieve the stated goal.

3. **Output Format**: 
   - The program does not produce any output in the specified format, which includes printing an integer followed by the details of each operation.

Since the given program does not meet the requirements of manipulating the coin grid or generating the expected output, it is deemed incorrect.
