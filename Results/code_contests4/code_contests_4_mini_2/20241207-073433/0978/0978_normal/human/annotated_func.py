#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a non-negative integer representing the number of horizontal rows (H) in the grid, y is a non-negative integer representing the number of vertical columns (W) in the grid, where 1 <= H, W <= 500. Each cell (i, j) in the grid contains a non-negative integer a_{ij} such that 0 <= a_{ij} <= 9.
def func_1(x, y):
    if (x >= y) :
        if (x % y == 0) :
            return y
            #The program returns the non-negative integer `y`, representing the number of vertical columns (W) in the grid, which is less than or equal to the number of horizontal rows (H) `x` and adheres to the conditions set for H and W.
        else :
            return func_1(y, x % y)
            #The program returns the result of func_1 with arguments y (the number of vertical columns in the grid) and (x % y) which is the remainder of x when divided by y, indicating a non-zero value since x is not divisible by y.
    else :
        if (y % x == 0) :
            return x
            #The program returns the non-negative integer x representing the number of horizontal rows (H) in the grid, where x is less than y.
        else :
            return func_1(x, y % x)
            #The program returns the result of func_1 with arguments x and (y modulo x), where x is a non-negative integer less than y, and y is not divisible by x.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two non-negative integers `x` and `y`, representing the dimensions of a grid (number of rows and columns, respectively). It computes and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. If `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, it checks if `x` is divisible by `y`; if so, it returns `y`. If not, it recursively calls itself with `y` and `x % y`. If `y` is greater than `x`, it checks if `y` is divisible by `x`; if so, it returns `x`. If not, it recursively calls itself with `x` and `y % x`. The function does not handle cases where either `x` or `y` is zero, which could lead to an infinite recursion or incorrect behavior, particularly when both are zero.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x4 is a 2D list of integers representing a grid of size H x W, where 1 <= H, W <= 500 and 0 <= a_{ij} <= 9 for each cell (i, j) in the grid.
def func_2(x4):
    if (len(x4) > 2) :
        return func_2([func_1(x4[0], x4[1])] + x4[2:])
        #The program returns a new list formed by applying 'func_1' to the first two rows of the 2D list 'x4' and concatenating it with the remaining rows of 'x4' starting from the third row.
    else :
        if (len(x4) == 2) :
            return func_1(x4[0], x4[1])
            #The program returns the result of the function func_1 applied to the first and second rows of the 2D list x4, which are both lists of integers representing grid cells.
        else :
            return x4[0]
            #The program returns the first row of the 2D list `x4`, which is a grid of integers with dimensions H x W and contains values between 0 and 9.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a 2D list of integers `x4`, representing a grid. It returns a new list formed by applying `func_1` to the first two rows of `x4` concatenated with the remaining rows if there are more than two rows. If there are exactly two rows, it returns the result of `func_1` applied to those two rows. If there is only one row, it returns that first row. The function effectively processes the grid based on its height, handling edge cases for different numbers of rows.
