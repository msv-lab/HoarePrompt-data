The function accepts an integer `now`, a set `used` to track visited nodes, and a list `back_track` to record the traversal path. It marks the current node as visited and recursively visits all adjacent unvisited nodes. After all reachable nodes are processed, it appends the current node to the `back_track` list, which effectively performs a depth-first traversal of a graph.
