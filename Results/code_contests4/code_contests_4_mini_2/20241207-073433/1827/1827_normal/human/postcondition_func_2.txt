The function accepts an integer `now` representing the current node, an integer `num_cmp` indicating the index of the strongly connected component, a list `used` marking whether each node has been visited, and a list `cmp` which assigns component indices to nodes. It updates `used` to mark the current node and all reachable nodes as visited, and updates `cmp` to assign the current component index to those nodes. The function does not return a value but modifies the `used` and `cmp` lists in place to reflect the traversal of the graph.
