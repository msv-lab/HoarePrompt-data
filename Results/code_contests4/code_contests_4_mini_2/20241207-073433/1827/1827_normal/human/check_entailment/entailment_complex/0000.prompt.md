You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A direced graph is strongly connected if every two nodes are reachable from each other. In a strongly connected component of a directed graph, every two nodes of the component are mutually reachable.

Constraints

* 1 ≤ |V| ≤ 10,000
* 0 ≤ |E| ≤ 30,000
* 1 ≤ Q ≤ 100,000

Input

A directed graph G(V, E) and a sequence of queries where each query contains a pair of nodes u and v.


|V| |E|
s0 t0
s1 t1
:
s|E|-1 t|E|-1
Q
u0 v0
u1 v1
:
uQ-1 vQ-1


|V| is the number of nodes and |E| is the number of edges in the graph. The graph nodes are named with the numbers 0, 1,..., |V|-1 respectively.

si and ti represent source and target nodes of i-th edge (directed).

ui and vi represent a pair of nodes given as the i-th query.

Output

For each query, pinrt "1" if the given nodes belong to the same strongly connected component, "0" otherwise.

Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: frm is a list of pairs representing directed edges in a directed graph, where each pair consists of non-negative integers representing node indices, and to is a list of pairs representing queries, where each pair consists of non-negative integers representing node indices, with constraints 1 ≤ |V| ≤ 10,000, 0 ≤ |E| ≤ 30,000, and 1 ≤ Q ≤ 100,000.
def func_1(frm, to):
    g[frm].append(to)
    rg[to].append(frm)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters: a list of directed edges `frm` and a list of queries `to`. It appends directed edges to a graph and its reverse graph. However, the function does not return any results or fulfill the queries in `to`, making the annotation misleading. Instead, it only constructs part of a graph structure but lacks the complete implementation to handle queries or provide any output.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: now is an integer representing the current node in the graph, used is a set of integers representing the nodes that have been visited, and back_track is a list of integers representing the path taken during the traversal.
def func_2(now, used, back_track):
    used[now] = True
    for nx in g[now]:
        if not used[nx]:
            func_2(nx, used, back_track)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `now` is the current node, `used` marks all reachable nodes from the starting node as visited, `back_track` remains unchanged.
    back_track.append(now)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `now`, a set `used` to track visited nodes, and a list `back_track` to record the traversal path. It marks the current node as visited and recursively visits all adjacent unvisited nodes. After all reachable nodes are processed, it appends the current node to the `back_track` list, which effectively performs a depth-first traversal of a graph.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: now is an integer representing the current node, num_cmp is an integer representing the number of strongly connected components, used is a list of boolean values indicating whether each node has been visited, and cmp is a list of integers representing the component index of each node.
def func_3(now, num_cmp, used, cmp):
    used[now] = True
    cmp[now] = num_cmp
    for nx in rg[now]:
        if not used[nx]:
            func_3(nx, num_cmp, used, cmp)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `now` is an integer representing the current node, `num_cmp` is an integer representing the number of strongly connected components, `used` is a list of boolean values with all nodes reachable from `now` set to True, `cmp` has updated `cmp` for all nodes reachable from `now` to `num_cmp`, and `rg[now]` contains all neighboring nodes of `now`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `now` representing the current node, an integer `num_cmp` indicating the index of the strongly connected component, a list `used` marking whether each node has been visited, and a list `cmp` which assigns component indices to nodes. It updates `used` to mark the current node and all reachable nodes as visited, and updates `cmp` to assign the current component index to those nodes. The function does not return a value but modifies the `used` and `cmp` lists in place to reflect the traversal of the graph.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer representing the number of nodes in a directed graph, and the function processes a list of directed edges and a sequence of queries on pairs of nodes (u, v) where 0 <= u, v < n. The number of edges must satisfy 0 <= |E| <= 30,000, and the number of queries Q must satisfy 1 ≤ Q ≤ 100,000.
def func_4(n):
    used = [False] * n
    back_track = []
    cmp = [-1] * n
    for v in xrange(n):
        if not used[v]:
            func_2(v, used, back_track)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer; `used` is a list of length `n` where elements may be either `True` or `False` depending on whether `func_2` was called for the corresponding index; `back_track` is a list that may contain elements modified by `func_2`; `cmp` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `-1` unless modified by `func_2`.
    used = [False] * n
    num_cmp = 0
    for v in back_track[::-1]:
        if not used[v]:
            func_3(v, num_cmp, used, cmp)
            num_cmp += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `used` reflects which elements from `back_track` were processed, `cmp` is unchanged unless modified by `func_3`, `num_cmp` is the number of unprocessed elements from `back_track` that were not used.
    return num_cmp, cmp
    #The program returns the number of unprocessed elements from 'back_track' that were not used as 'num_cmp' and the value of 'cmp' which is unchanged unless modified by 'func_3'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`, representing the number of nodes in a directed graph. It processes nodes using two helper functions, `func_2` and `func_3`, to determine strongly connected components. The function returns the count of strongly connected components as `num_cmp` and a list `cmp` that may contain modified values indicating the component each node belongs to. If the graph has no edges, `num_cmp` will be 0 and `cmp` will remain unchanged from its initial state.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
