The provided program seems to be implementing a method to find strongly connected components (SCCs) in a directed graph and to answer queries about whether two nodes belong to the same SCC. However, there are some issues that prevent it from fulfilling the requirements of the problem description.

1. **Graph Representation**: The program defines two lists, `g` and `rg`, which presumably represent the graph and its reverse. However, these lists are not initialized or populated correctly in the code shown. This will lead to a `NameError` when trying to append elements to `g[frm]` and `rg[to]`, as `g` and `rg` are not defined as lists of lists.

2. **Input Handling**: The function `func_4(n)` mentions processing a list of directed edges and a sequence of queries, but there is no code in the provided program to actually read or process the edges (`frm`) or the queries (`to`). This means that the graph structure and the queries are never established or used in the functions.

3. **Query Output**: The program does not include any functionality to answer the queries after computing the strongly connected components. The problem description specifies that for each query, the program must output `1` if the nodes belong to the same SCC and `0` otherwise. The code does not implement this aspect.

4. **Return Values**: The `func_4` function returns the number of strongly connected components and an array indicating the component index of each node. However, the program does not utilize this information effectively to answer the queries.

Because of these issues, the program fails to meet the requirements set forth in the problem description. 

Correctness: **False**
