Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. Although it includes functions to identify strongly connected components, it lacks the necessary structure to handle the queries that check if two nodes belong to the same strongly connected component.

Specifically:

1. **Function 1** only constructs the graph and its reverse but does not handle the queries or return any results. It does not fulfill the requirement of outputting "1" or "0" based on the queries.

2. **Function 2** and **Function 3** perform depth-first searches and mark nodes as visited and assign component indices, but these functions alone do not address how to respond to the queries about node connectivity.

3. **Function 4** computes the number of strongly connected components and assigns components to nodes, but again, it does not execute or handle the queries specified in the problem description. There is no mechanism to output the results for the pairs of nodes specified in the queries.

Since the code does not provide a complete implementation that answers the queries as required by the problem description, it is incorrect. For instance, if the input specifies a query `(0, 1)`, the code does not produce an output of "1" or "0" to indicate whether these two nodes are in the same strongly connected component.

Thus, the program fails to cover the essential functionality needed to comply with the problem description.
