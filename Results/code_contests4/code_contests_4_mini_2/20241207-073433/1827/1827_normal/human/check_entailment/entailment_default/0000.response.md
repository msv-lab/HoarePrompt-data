To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program in relation to the problem description, let's analyze the code, the output hints, and identify any potential edge cases.

### Problem Description
The problem states that we need to determine if two nodes in a directed graph belong to the same strongly connected component (SCC). The program needs to handle a directed graph defined by its vertices and edges and answer multiple queries regarding the reachability of nodes.

### Code Analysis
1. **Function `func_1(frm, to)`**: 
   - This function adds directed edges to the graph and its reverse. 
   - The output hint indicates that it does not return results or handle queries, which is consistent with the code.

2. **Function `func_2(now, used, back_track)`**:
   - This function performs a depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the graph and records the order of nodes in `back_track`.
   - The output hint correctly describes its behavior.

3. **Function `func_3(now, num_cmp, used, cmp)`**:
   - This function marks nodes belonging to the same strongly connected component.
   - The hint accurately describes its purpose and functionality.

4. **Function `func_4(n)`**:
   - This function orchestrates the overall process: it first executes a DFS to build the backtrack list, then processes the reverse graph to identify strongly connected components.
   - The hint correctly states that it returns the number of components and a list of component indices.

### Handling Queries
The main logic assessing whether two nodes belong to the same SCC is performed in the last part of `func_4`, where it compares the component indices of the queried nodes.

### Edge Cases
1. **No Edges**: If there are no edges in the graph, every node is its own SCC. The program should correctly handle cases where the input graph is completely disconnected.
2. **Single Node**: A graph with a single node should return that the node is in the same SCC as itself.
3. **Self-loops**: If there are self-loops (e.g., an edge from node `u` to `u`), the program should correctly identify that as being part of an SCC.
4. **Multiple Queries**: The program should handle multiple queries efficiently, as indicated by the constraints.

### Output Hints Validation
The output hints suggest that the functions correctly identify SCCs and answer the queries. However, they also note that `func_1` does not fulfill the query directly, which has no impact on the correctness as its purpose is to construct the graph.

### Conclusion
The program appears to handle the requirements of the problem description accurately under various scenarios, including edge cases. Given that the hints align with the behavior of the code and no potential cases where the program fails to meet the specification can be identified, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**. 

Explanation: The program successfully constructs the directed graph, identifies strongly connected components using DFS in both the original and reversed graphs, and correctly answers queries regarding the reachability of nodes. The logic handles edge cases such as disconnected graphs and self-loops appropriately.
