The line of code initializes a list named `used` with a length of `n`, where each element is set to `False`. This indicates that initially, none of the nodes in the directed graph are marked as used. Other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer representing the number of nodes in a directed graph; `used` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `False`.**
