According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `v` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `v` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `v` is 0, and since `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, the loop can execute again. After the current iteration, `v` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `v` needs to be 1.

Additionally, the element at index `v` in the `used` list must still be `False` for the function `func_2` to be called again. As `used` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `False`, the condition will be satisfied for `v = 1`.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `v` is 1, `used` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `False`, `back_track` is an empty list, `cmp` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `-1`**
