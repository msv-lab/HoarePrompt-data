The value of `num_cmp` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `num_cmp` is unknown, but since `num_cmp` is being updated, we know its new value will be one greater than its previous value. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `back_track` is a list with at least 2 elements, `v` is the second last element of `back_track`, and `num_cmp` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `back_track` is a list with at least 2 elements, `v` is the second last element of `back_track`, and `num_cmp` is incremented by 1.**
