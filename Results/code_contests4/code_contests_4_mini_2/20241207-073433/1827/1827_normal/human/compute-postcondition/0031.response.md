The function `func_4` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer representing the number of nodes in a directed graph. After executing the function body, it returns the number of unprocessed elements from 'back_track' that were not used as 'num_cmp' and the value of 'cmp', which is unchanged unless modified by another function `func_3`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_4` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return the count of unprocessed elements from 'back_track' and the current value of 'cmp'. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer n and returns the number of unprocessed elements from 'back_track' that were not used as 'num_cmp' along with the value of 'cmp', which remains unchanged unless modified by 'func_3'.**
