The variable `num_cmp` is initialized to 0. The previous values of the affected variables `n`, `used`, `back_track`, and `cmp` remain unchanged as the code only impacts `num_cmp`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer; `used` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `False`; `back_track` is unchanged; `cmp` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `-1`; `num_cmp` is 0.
