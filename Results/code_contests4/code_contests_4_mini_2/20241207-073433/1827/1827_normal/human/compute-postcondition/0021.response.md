According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `back_track` list. The loop iterates over the `back_track` list in reverse order. At the end of the last iteration, `back_track` has at least 1 element, and `v` is the last element of `back_track`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `back_track` must have at least 2 elements, and `v` should be set to the second last element of the list.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `back_track` is a list with at least 2 elements, `v` is the second last element of `back_track`.**
