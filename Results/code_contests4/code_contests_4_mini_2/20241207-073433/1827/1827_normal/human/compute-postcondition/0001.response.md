The variable `back_track` is initialized as an empty list. The previous state of `n` and `used` is unaffected by this initialization, so they remain as they were. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer representing the number of nodes in a directed graph; `used` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `False`, and `back_track` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer representing the number of nodes in a directed graph; `used` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `False`; `back_track` is an empty list.**
