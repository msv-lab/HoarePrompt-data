Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`, representing the number of nodes in a directed graph. It processes nodes using two helper functions, `func_2` and `func_3`, to determine strongly connected components. The function returns the count of strongly connected components as `num_cmp` and a list `cmp` that may contain modified values indicating the component each node belongs to. If the graph has no edges, `num_cmp` will be 0 and `cmp` will remain unchanged from its initial state.**
