To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we consider the behavior of the loop based on its code and the initial state.

Given the loop:
```
for v in back_track[::-1]:
    if not used[v]:
        func_3(v, num_cmp, used, cmp)
        num_cmp += 1
```

The loop iterates over the `back_track` list in reverse order. For each element `v`, if `used[v]` is `False`, it calls `func_3(v, num_cmp, used, cmp)` and increments `num_cmp` by 1.

1. If `back_track` is empty, the loop will not execute. In this case, `num_cmp` remains 0, and `used` remains unchanged (all `False`).

2. If `back_track` has elements, the loop will execute for each element in reverse order. During each iteration:
   - If an element `v` is not used (i.e., `used[v]` is `False`), `num_cmp` will be incremented.
   - The `used` list will be modified as `func_3` is called (the exact changes depend on the implementation of `func_3`, which we cannot determine).

After all iterations:
- The value of `num_cmp` will be equal to the count of elements in `back_track` that were not marked as used at the time of their respective iterations.
- The `used` list will reflect which elements were processed by `func_3`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `used` reflects which elements from `back_track` were processed, `cmp` is unchanged unless modified by `func_3`, `num_cmp` is the number of unprocessed elements from `back_track` that were not used.**
