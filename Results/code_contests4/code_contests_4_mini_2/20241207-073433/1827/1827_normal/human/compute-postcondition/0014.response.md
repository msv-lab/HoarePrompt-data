The variable `used` is assigned a new list of length `n` where all elements are set to `False`, indicating that none of the indices have been marked as used. The original state of `used` is overwritten with this new value. The other variables (`back_track` and `cmp`) remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `used` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `False`; `back_track` is unchanged; `cmp` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `-1`.**
