According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. The state of `used`, `back_track`, and `cmp` is not directly relevant to whether the loop can start, but their initial values indicate they are properly prepared for the execution of the loop. 

For the loop to execute for the first time, `n` must be greater than 0, and the loop variable `v` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop. 

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `v` is 0, `used` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `False`, `back_track` is an empty list, `cmp` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `-1`**
