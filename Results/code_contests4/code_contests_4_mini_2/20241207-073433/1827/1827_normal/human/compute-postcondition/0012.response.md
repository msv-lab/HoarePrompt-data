Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `v` is 2, and `used` is a list of length `n` with all elements initially set to `False`. If `used[v]` is `False`, the function `func_2` is called with parameters `v`, `used`, and `back_track`. If `used[v]` is `True`, the function does not execute `func_2`.***
