According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `back_track`. The loop iterates over the reversed list `back_track[::-1]`. For the loop to execute at least once, `back_track` must contain at least one element. Since `n` is a non-negative integer, if `n` is 0, `back_track` would be an empty list, and the loop would not execute. 

To ensure the loop can execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0, and consequently, `back_track` should be a list with at least one element. The loop will start with `v` being the last element of `back_track`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute the first time `back_track` is a list with at least 1 element, and `v` is the last element of `back_track`**
