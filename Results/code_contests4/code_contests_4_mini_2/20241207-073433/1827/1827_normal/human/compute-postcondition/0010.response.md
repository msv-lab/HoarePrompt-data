According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `v` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute again as long as `v` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `v` is 1, and since `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again if `v` is incremented. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `v` should be increased by 1 to 2. 

Additionally, since `used` is a list with all elements initially set to `False`, `used[v]` was `False` during the previous iteration when `v` was 1. For the next iteration, we need to check that `used[2]` is also `False` to execute the function `func_2`.

Thus, the conditions for the next iteration are:
- `v` is now 2.
- `used` must indicate that `used[2]` is `False`.
- `n` must still be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `v` is 2, `used` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `False`, for the loop to execute a second time `used[2]` must be `False` and `n` must be greater than 2.**
