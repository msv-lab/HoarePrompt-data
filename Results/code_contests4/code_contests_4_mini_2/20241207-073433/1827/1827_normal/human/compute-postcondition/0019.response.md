The variable `num_cmp` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `num_cmp` is unknown, but since it is being increased, we can denote that it will now be greater than its previous value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `back_track` is a list with at least 1 element, `v` is the last element of `back_track`, `used[v]` is false, and `num_cmp` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `back_track` is a list with at least 1 element, `v` is the last element of `back_track`, `used[v]` is false, and `num_cmp` is increased by 1.**
