The variable `cmp` is assigned a list of length `n`, with each element initialized to `-1`. The previous values of the affected variables are: `n` is a non-negative integer representing the number of nodes; `used` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `False`; `back_track` is an empty list. The list `cmp` will now contain `n` elements, all set to `-1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer; `used` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `False`; `back_track` is an empty list; `cmp` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `-1`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `used` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `False`; `back_track` is an empty list; `cmp` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `-1**
