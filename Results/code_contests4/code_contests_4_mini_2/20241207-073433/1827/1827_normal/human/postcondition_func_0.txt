The function accepts two parameters: a list of directed edges `frm` and a list of queries `to`. It appends directed edges to a graph and its reverse graph. However, the function does not return any results or fulfill the queries in `to`, making the annotation misleading. Instead, it only constructs part of a graph structure but lacks the complete implementation to handle queries or provide any output.
