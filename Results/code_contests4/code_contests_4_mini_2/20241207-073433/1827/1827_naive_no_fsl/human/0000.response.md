Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly identifies strongly connected components in a directed graph and answers queries about whether two nodes belong to the same component. 

Here's the reasoning:

1. **Graph Construction**: The program builds both the original graph (`g`) and the transposed graph (`rg`) by reading edges from the input.

2. **Finding Strongly Connected Components (SCCs)**: The program uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to:
   - Fill a stack (`back_track`) with nodes in the order of their finishing times (first pass).
   - Then, it processes nodes in the reverse order to identify strongly connected components (second pass).

3. **Query Processing**: After determining the strongly connected components, the program processes each query by checking if the two nodes belong to the same component using the `cmp` array, which stores the component index for each node.

4. **Output**: For each query, it prints "1" if both nodes belong to the same component and "0" otherwise.

The program adheres to the problem description and constraints, handling up to 10,000 nodes and 30,000 edges efficiently, and can process up to 100,000 queries. There are no apparent edge cases or missing logic that would cause it to fail for valid inputs as specified in the problem.

Overall, since the implementation correctly fulfills the requirements for every possible case given the constraints, the correctness is confirmed as **True**.
