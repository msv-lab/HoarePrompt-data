To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the program logic and identify if it correctly identifies whether pairs of nodes belong to the same strongly connected component in a directed graph.

The program follows these steps:

1. It constructs the directed graph `g` and its reverse `rg`.
2. It uses depth-first search (DFS) to perform a post-order traversal on the original graph to populate `back_track`.
3. It then reverses the process on the transposed graph to assign components to each node.
4. Finally, it answers the queries by checking if two nodes belong to the same component.

However, there are a few potential issues to consider:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `xrange`, which is not available in Python 3 and would cause an error if run in a Python 3 environment. The problem description does not specify the Python version.
   
2. **Strongly Connected Components**: The logic for identifying strongly connected components appears to be based on Kosaraju's algorithm, which is generally correct. However, if there are multiple edges between nodes or self-loops, the algorithm might not handle them correctly in terms of counting connections.

3. **Edge Cases**: 
   - If there are no edges (`m = 0`), each node is its own component, and the program should correctly return `0` for all queries with pairs of different nodes.
   - If a query is made for a node to itself, the program should return `1`.

4. **Output Format**: The problem description requires output to be "1" or "0" based on the connectivity, which seems to be handled correctly in the program.

To check if the program fails in any potential cases, consider the following test case:

**Test Case**:
```
Input:
3 0
2
0 1
1 2
```
Expected output:
```
0
0
```
Explanation: There are 3 nodes and no edges. All nodes should be isolated, hence queries between any different pairs should return `0`.

The provided program will output:
```
0
0
```
This matches the expected output. 

After considering multiple scenarios, including edge cases and potential issues, I find that the algorithm is fundamentally sound for the problem it is meant to solve, assuming it is run in an appropriate Python environment.

Correctness: **True**.
