Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not exist (it is represented by empty triple quotes). Therefore, there is no implementation of the logic required to carry out the task as described in the problem statement. 

In any scenario, an empty program cannot meet the requirements of the task, as it fails to handle any input or perform any actions related to asphalting the roads at the intersections as specified. For example, if we consider the input:
```
1
1 1
```
There would be no output generated since there is no logic to process the intersection, thus failing to meet the requirement.

Therefore, since the program lacks any implementation to perform the required actions, it is deemed incorrect.
