Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not contain any logic or implementation for processing the input data as described in the problem statement. It merely imports unicode literals and contains empty comment blocks. Therefore, it does not handle any cases or perform the operations required to determine the days when at least one road will be asphalted, as stipulated in the problem description. As there is no code to execute the necessary logic, it fails to meet the requirements of the task for any potential input, making it incorrect. The output hints confirm that the function is expected to process input but does not implement any functionality, leading to the conclusion that it does not follow the problem description at all.
