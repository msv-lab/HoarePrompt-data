Correctness: **False**

The provided annotated program `func()` is incomplete and does not contain any implementation or logic to fulfill the problem description. The problem requires a function that processes a series of intersections over `n²` days, checking whether the roads at each intersection can be asphalted based on prior work done. The function must track the asphalted roads and determine which days result in road work being performed.

Since the function does not contain any code, there is no way to ascertain that it meets the requirements of the problem description. A correct implementation would need to include logic to:

1. Read the input values for `n` and the subsequent `n²` pairs (hi, vi).
2. Maintain a record of asphalted horizontal and vertical roads.
3. Process each day's intersection, checking if either of the roads has already been asphalted.
4. Output the days when work was actually performed.

Without any of this functionality, the program cannot fulfill the described requirements, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
