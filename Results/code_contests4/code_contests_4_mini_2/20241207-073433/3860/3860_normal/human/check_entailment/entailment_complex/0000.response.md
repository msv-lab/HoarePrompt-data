Correctness: **False**

The annotated program does not implement any logic or processing of the pairs of integers representing the intersections, as required by the problem description. While it sets the expectations for input and constraints, it lacks the necessary operations to determine which roads are asphalted on which days.

Specifically, the problem description outlines a clear sequence of actions based on the state of the roads at each intersection, while the provided code does not perform these actions at all. It does not check if the roads at the given intersections have been asphalted or maintain any state about the roads. Thus, there is no functionality to determine the days when at least one road will be asphalted.

In conclusion, since the program lacks the implementation required to fulfill the problem's requirements, it does not meet the correctness criteria set forth in the problem description.
