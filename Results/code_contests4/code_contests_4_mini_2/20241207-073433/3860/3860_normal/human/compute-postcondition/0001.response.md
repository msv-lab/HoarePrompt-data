The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. However, it operates on a set of constraints where `n` is an integer that must satisfy the condition \(1 \leq n \leq 50\). Following this, the function expects `n²` lines of input, each containing a pair of integers \((h_i, v_i)\) where \(1 \leq h_i, v_i \leq n\) and represents distinct intersections.

The function processes this input and produces an output based on the defined relationships and constraints. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to handle a matrix of intersections derived from the input integer `n` and its corresponding pairs of integers, although the specific output based on these inputs is not detailed in the prompt.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly, but it processes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and expects n² pairs of integers representing distinct intersections, each within the range (1 ≤ hi, vi ≤ n).**
