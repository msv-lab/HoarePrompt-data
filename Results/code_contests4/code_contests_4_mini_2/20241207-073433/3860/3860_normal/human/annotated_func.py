#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the next n² lines contain pairs of integers (hi, vi) where 1 ≤ hi, vi ≤ n representing distinct intersections.
def func():
    """
    """
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters directly, but it is designed to process an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and expects to read `n²` pairs of integers representing distinct intersections, each within the range (1 ≤ hi, vi ≤ n). However, the actual logic or processing of these pairs is not implemented in the provided code. Therefore, while it sets the expectation for input and constraints, it does not perform any operations or return any results based on those inputs.
