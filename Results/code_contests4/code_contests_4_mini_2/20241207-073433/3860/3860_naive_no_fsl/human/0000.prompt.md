You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: City X consists of n vertical and n horizontal infinite roads, forming n × n intersections. Roads (both vertical and horizontal) are numbered from 1 to n, and the intersections are indicated by the numbers of the roads that form them.

Sand roads have long been recognized out of date, so the decision was made to asphalt them. To do this, a team of workers was hired and a schedule of work was made, according to which the intersections should be asphalted.

Road repairs are planned for n2 days. On the i-th day of the team arrives at the i-th intersection in the list and if none of the two roads that form the intersection were already asphalted they asphalt both roads. Otherwise, the team leaves the intersection, without doing anything with the roads.

According to the schedule of road works tell in which days at least one road will be asphalted.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) — the number of vertical and horizontal roads in the city. 

Next n2 lines contain the order of intersections in the schedule. The i-th of them contains two numbers hi, vi (1 ≤ hi, vi ≤ n), separated by a space, and meaning that the intersection that goes i-th in the timetable is at the intersection of the hi-th horizontal and vi-th vertical roads. It is guaranteed that all the intersections in the timetable are distinct.

Output

In the single line print the numbers of the days when road works will be in progress in ascending order. The days are numbered starting from 1.

Examples

Output

1 

Note

In the sample the brigade acts like that:

  1. On the first day the brigade comes to the intersection of the 1-st horizontal and the 1-st vertical road. As none of them has been asphalted, the workers asphalt the 1-st vertical and the 1-st horizontal road; 
  2. On the second day the brigade of the workers comes to the intersection of the 1-st horizontal and the 2-nd vertical road. The 2-nd vertical road hasn't been asphalted, but as the 1-st horizontal road has been asphalted on the first day, the workers leave and do not asphalt anything; 
  3. On the third day the brigade of the workers come to the intersection of the 2-nd horizontal and the 1-st vertical road. The 2-nd horizontal road hasn't been asphalted but as the 1-st vertical road has been asphalted on the first day, the workers leave and do not asphalt anything; 
  4. On the fourth day the brigade come to the intersection formed by the intersection of the 2-nd horizontal and 2-nd vertical road. As none of them has been asphalted, the workers asphalt the 2-nd vertical and the 2-nd horizontal road.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
