Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not contain any implementation, so it cannot fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description. For any input case, including the provided examples, the program will not perform any actions since there is no logic or code to execute. 

For instance, if we take the input:

```
2
1 1
1 2
2 1
2 2
```

The program is expected to determine which days the roads will be asphalted, but since the program is empty, it will produce no output at all. This goes against the requirement of providing the days when road works will be in progress.

Therefore, the program does not work as expected, and it is incorrect.
