The value of `clr[i, j]` is assigned the result of the expression `(i + j) % 3`. The current value of `j` is 0, so the calculation simplifies to `clr[i, 0] = (i + 0) % 3`, which is equivalent to `clr[i, 0] = i % 3`. The value of `n` does not affect this operation directly, and the element at position `M[i][j]` remains 'X'. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment made to `clr[i, j]` and the unchanged values of other variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is 0, element at position `M[i][j]` is 'X', `clr[i, j]` is assigned the value `i % 3`**
