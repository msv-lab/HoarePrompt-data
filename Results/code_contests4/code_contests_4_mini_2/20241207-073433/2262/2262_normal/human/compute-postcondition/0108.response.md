According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and since `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1. Thus, `j` will be 3 for the next iteration.

State: **`use_clr` is 3, `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 3**
