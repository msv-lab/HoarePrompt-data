The variable `M` is initialized as an empty list. The value of `n` is not affected by this operation and remains as a positive integer obtained from `func_1()`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer obtained from `func_1()`; `M` is an empty list.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer obtained from `func_1()`; `M` is an empty list**
