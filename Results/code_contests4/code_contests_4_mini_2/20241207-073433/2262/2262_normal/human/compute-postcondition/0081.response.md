Output State: **`use_clr` is 3, `n` is a positive integer, `cnt[0]`, `cnt[1]`, and `cnt[2]` must be such that `cnt[0]` is greater than K or `cnt[0]` is equal to 0, `cnt[1]` is greater than K or `cnt[1]` is equal to 0, and `cnt[2]` allows the loop to terminate since `use_clr` cannot increment further.**
