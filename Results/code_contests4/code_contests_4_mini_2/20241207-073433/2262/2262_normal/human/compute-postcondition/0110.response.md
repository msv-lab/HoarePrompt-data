The value of `chg` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `chg` is unknown since it is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects the change without specifying a new value for `chg`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`use_clr` is 3, `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `M[1][3]` is 'O', and `chg` is increased by 1.**
