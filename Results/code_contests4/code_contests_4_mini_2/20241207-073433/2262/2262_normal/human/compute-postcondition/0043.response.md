According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the positive integer `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and since `n` is a positive integer, `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again. For the loop to be executed one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will be 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
