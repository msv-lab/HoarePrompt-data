To evaluate the impact of the code on the program, we analyze the provided snippet:

1. `M` has a new element appended from the return value of `func_3()`. This means `M[-1]` refers to the last element of the list `M`, which is now the output of `func_3()`.
2. The code is calculating `sum([(1) for x in M[-1] if x in 'XO'])`. This is a list comprehension that iterates over each element `x` in `M[-1]` and counts how many of those elements are either 'X' or 'O'. For each occurrence of 'X' or 'O', it adds `1` to the list.
3. The `sum` function then adds all the `1`s from the list comprehension, resulting in the total count of 'X' and 'O' in `M[-1]`.
4. Finally, `k` is incremented by this summed value.

Assuming the value of `M[-1]` (the new element from `func_3()`) is a string or list containing characters 'X' and 'O', we can say:

- Let `count` be the number of occurrences of 'X' and 'O' in `M[-1]`.
- The new value of `k` will be `k + count`.

Since the values of `n`, `_`, and the exact contents of `M[-1]` are not specified, we will express the output state in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `_` is 2, `M` has a new element from `func_3()`, `k` is increased by the count of 'X' and 'O' in `M[-1]**
