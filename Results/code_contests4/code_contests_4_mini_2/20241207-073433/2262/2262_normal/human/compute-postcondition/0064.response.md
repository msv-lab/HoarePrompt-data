The variable `cnt` at the index `(i + j) % 3` is incremented by 1. The value of `j` is 1, and `i` is unknown, thus we denote it as `i`. The expression `(i + j) % 3` evaluates to `(i + 1) % 3`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `cnt` at the index `(i + 1) % 3` is increased by 1. The values of `j` and `clr[i, j]` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`j` is 1; `cnt[(i + 1) % 3]` is increased by 1; `clr[i, j]` is updated to `(i + 1) % 3`**
