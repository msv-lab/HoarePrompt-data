The variable `k` is initialized to 0. The previous values of `n` and `M` are not affected by this assignment, as they remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer obtained from `func_1()`; `M` is an empty list; `k` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer obtained from `func_1()`; `M` is an empty list; `k` is 0**
