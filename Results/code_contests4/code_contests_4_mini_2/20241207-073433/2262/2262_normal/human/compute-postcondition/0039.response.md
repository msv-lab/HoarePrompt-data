The variable `cnt` at the index `[(i + j) % 3]` is incremented by 1. The values of `i` and `j` are known; `j` is 0, and `i` is a positive integer. Therefore, the expression `(i + j) % 3` simplifies to `i % 3`. The value of `cnt[i % 3]` is increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is 0, `M[i][j]` is 'X', `clr[i, 0]` is equal to `i % 3`, and `cnt[i % 3]` is increased by 1.**
