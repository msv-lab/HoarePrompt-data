The value of `cnt[(i + j) % 3]` is incremented by 1. The variable `j` is 1, so `i + j` becomes `i + 1`. The modulo operation `(i + 1) % 3` determines which index of the `cnt` array is affected. The previous values of `cnt` at the calculated index are unknown, but the value at `cnt[(i + 1) % 3]` is increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `clr[i, j]` is set to `(i + 1) % 3,` and `cnt[(i + 1) % 3]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `clr[i, j]` is set to `(i + 1) % 3`, and `cnt[(i + 1) % 3]` is incremented by 1.**
