The value of `chg` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `chg` is unknown. The values of the other variables `use_clr`, `n`, `i`, `j`, and `M[i][j]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `use_clr` is 3, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `M[i][j]` is 'O'; `chg` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`use_clr` is 3, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `M[i][j]` is 'O'; `chg` is increased by 1.**
