Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `j` is 0, and `i` is less than `n`. If the element at row `i` and column `j` of matrix `M` is equal to 'X', then `clr[i, j]` is assigned the value of (i + j) % 3 and `cnt[i % 3]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if the element at row `i` and column `j` of matrix `M` is not equal to 'X', `clr[i, j]` is set to -1.***
