According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop is designed to iterate `n` times, starting from `j = 0` up to `j = n-1`. 

1. The state indicates that `n` is a positive integer, which means it has a value greater than 0, allowing the loop to execute at least once.
2. For the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be equal to `n`, and the requirement for `n` (as the loop condition) to be greater than `n` is not logically possible since `n` cannot be greater than itself.
3. However, since the loop is defined to iterate `n` times, we can conclude that it executes once for each value of `j` from 0 to `n-1`.

Thus, the key points that need to be stated before the loop can execute are:
- `j` starts at 0 and will increment up to `n-1`.
- We need to ensure that `n` remains constant and valid for the loop's execution.

Therefore, for the loop to execute for the first time, `j` should be initialized to 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` must be greater than 0**
