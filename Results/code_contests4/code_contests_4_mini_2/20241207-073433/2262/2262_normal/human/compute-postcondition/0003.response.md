According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the value of `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer obtained from `func_1()`, it guarantees that `n` is at least 1. The loop will execute for a number of iterations equal to `n`, starting from 0. 

Before the loop starts, `M` is an empty list and `k` is 0, which do not affect the execution of the loop itself. However, the loop control variable `_` will take on the values from 0 to `n-1` during its iterations. 

Thus, for the loop to execute for the first time, we can set `_` to 0 as it will be the first iteration of the loop.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `M` is an empty list, `k` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `_` is 0**
