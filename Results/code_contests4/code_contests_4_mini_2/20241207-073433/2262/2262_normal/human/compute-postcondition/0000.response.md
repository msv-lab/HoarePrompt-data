The value of `n` is assigned the result of calling `func_1()`, which is a function that presumably computes or retrieves a positive integer based on the context of the problem. Since `n` is a positive integer that represents the size of the grid, it will take a value between 1 and 300. The initial state indicates that there are multiple test cases, but it does not affect the assignment for `n`. The output state will reflect that `n` is now assigned a positive integer value obtained from `func_1()`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer obtained from `func_1()`**
