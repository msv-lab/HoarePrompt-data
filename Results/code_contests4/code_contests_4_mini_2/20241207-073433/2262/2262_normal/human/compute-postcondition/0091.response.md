The value of `chg` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `chg` is unknown. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `use_clr` is 3, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `M[0][1]` is 'O', and `chg` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`use_clr` is 3, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `M[0][1]` is 'O', and `chg` is increased by 1.**
