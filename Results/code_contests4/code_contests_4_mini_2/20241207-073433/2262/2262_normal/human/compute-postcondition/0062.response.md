According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. Since `j` is currently 0 and `n` is a positive integer, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will become 1.

For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n`. Since `j` is now 1, this means `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
