The value of `chg` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `chg` is unknown, so we cannot specify its new value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `use_clr` is 3, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 2; `M[i][j]` is assigned the value 'O', and `chg` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`use_clr` is 3, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 2; `M[i][j]` is assigned the value 'O', and `chg` is increased by 1**.
