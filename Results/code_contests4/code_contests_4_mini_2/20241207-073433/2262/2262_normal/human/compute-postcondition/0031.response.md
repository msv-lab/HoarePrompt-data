The value of `cnt[(i + j) % 3]` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is 2, but the value of `i` is unknown. Thus, `i + j` can be any positive integer greater than or equal to 3, and `(i + j) % 3` will yield values of 0, 1, or 2 depending on the value of `i`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer; `j` is 2; and `cnt[(i + j) % 3]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `j` is 2; `cnt[(i + j) % 3]` is incremented by 1**
