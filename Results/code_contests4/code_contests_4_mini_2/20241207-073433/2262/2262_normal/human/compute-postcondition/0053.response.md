Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is at least `n`, `clr[i, j]` is set based on the values of `M[i][j]` for all `j` from 0 to `n-1`, and `cnt` contains the counts of how many times `(i + j) % 3` was incremented for each `j` in that range. If `M[i][j]` is 'X', then `clr[i, j]` is equal to `(i + j) % 3` and `cnt[(i + j) % 3]` reflects the total increments; otherwise, `clr[i, j]` is assigned the value -1 for each `j`.`**
