The value of `chg` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `chg` is not provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact new value of `chg`. The previous values of the affected variables are `use_clr` is 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `clr[i, j]` is equal to `use_clr`, and `M[i][j]` is 'O'. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`use_clr` is 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `clr[i, j]` is equal to `use_clr`, `M[i][j]` is 'O', and `chg` is increased by 1.**
