According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and since `n` is a positive integer, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 1. After this iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will become 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
