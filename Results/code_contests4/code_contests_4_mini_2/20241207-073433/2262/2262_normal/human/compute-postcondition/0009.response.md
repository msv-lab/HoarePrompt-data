According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, which indicates that the loop has executed once. Since `n` is a positive integer, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented to 2. Thus, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1, `_` is 2**
