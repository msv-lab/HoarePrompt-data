The variable `cnt` at the index `[(i + j) % 3]` is incremented by 1. The value of `j` is 2, so the index is calculated as `(i + 2) % 3`. The previous state of `cnt` is not specified, but we know that the count at that index will increase by 1. Therefore, the Output State reflects the change in `cnt` and maintains the values of `n` and `j`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is 2; `cnt` at index `[(i + 2) % 3]` is increased by 1**
