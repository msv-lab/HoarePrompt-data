According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the positive integer `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1. Since the loop increments `j` by 1 for the next iteration, `j` will become 2.

State: **`use_clr` is 3, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
