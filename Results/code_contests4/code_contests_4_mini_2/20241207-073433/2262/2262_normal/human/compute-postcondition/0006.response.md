According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, meaning this is the first iteration of the loop, and `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` will be incremented by 1, so `_` will be 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `M` is a list containing the result of `func_3()`, `k` is the count of 'X' and 'O' in `M[-1]`, `_` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
