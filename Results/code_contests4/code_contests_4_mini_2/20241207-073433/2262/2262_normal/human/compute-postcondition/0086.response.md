The value of `M[i][j]` is assigned the string 'O'. The values of `use_clr`, `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `use_clr` is 3, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and `M[i][j]` is 'O'.

Output State: **`use_clr` is 3, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and `M[i][j]` is 'O'**.
