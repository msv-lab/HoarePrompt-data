The value at `cnt` at the position `(i + j) % 3` is incremented by 1. The values of `i` and `j` are known, with `j` being 0. Therefore, we calculate `(i + 0) % 3`, which simplifies to `i % 3`. This means that `cnt[i % 3]` will be increased by 1. The states of the other variables (`n`, `M[i][j]`, and `clr[i, j]`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is 0, element at position `M[i][j]` is 'X', `clr[i, j]` is assigned the value `i % 3`, and `cnt[i % 3]` is increased by 1.**
