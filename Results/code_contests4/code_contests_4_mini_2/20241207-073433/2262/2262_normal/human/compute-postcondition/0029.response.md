According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the integer `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1, and since `j` will increase by 1, it will become 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2.**
