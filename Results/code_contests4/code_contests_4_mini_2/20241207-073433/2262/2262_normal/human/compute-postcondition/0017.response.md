According to the code, for the loop to execute, the variable `n` must be a positive integer, which is already specified as such in the state before the loop. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 before the loop, which is correct since `i` is not used in this loop. However, the loop uses `j`, which will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop iteration.

For the loop to execute for the first time, `j` must be 0, and since `n` is a positive integer, the loop will execute. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
