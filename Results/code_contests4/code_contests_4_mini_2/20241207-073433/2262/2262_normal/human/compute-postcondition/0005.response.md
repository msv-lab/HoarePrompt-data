To analyze the impact of the code on the program, we note the following:

1. The code `k += sum([(1) for x in M[-1] if x in 'XO'])` implies that we are modifying `k` by adding to it the result of a sum operation.
2. The expression `[(1) for x in M[-1] if x in 'XO']` creates a list comprehension that generates a list of `1`s for each element `x` in the last element of the list `M` (i.e., `M[-1]`) that is either 'X' or 'O'.
3. The `sum` function then adds up all the `1`s in the list, effectively counting how many times 'X' or 'O' appears in `M[-1]`.
4. The previous value of `k` is 0, so we will add the count of 'X' and 'O' to `k`.

Based on these observations, the output state after running the code will depend on the contents of `M[-1]`, but we know that `k` will be updated.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `M` is a list containing the result of `func_3()`, `k` is the count of 'X' and 'O' in `M[-1]`, `_` is 0**
