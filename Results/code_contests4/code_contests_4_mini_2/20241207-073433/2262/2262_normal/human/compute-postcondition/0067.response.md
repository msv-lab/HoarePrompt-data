According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. Since `n` is a positive integer, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1, making `j` equal to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
