The value of `chg` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `chg` is unknown. The other variables `use_clr`, `n`, `i`, `j`, and `M[1][2]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `use_clr` is 3, `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2; `M[1][2]` is assigned the value 'O', and `chg` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`use_clr` is 3, `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2; `M[1][2]` is assigned the value 'O', and `chg` is increased by 1.**
