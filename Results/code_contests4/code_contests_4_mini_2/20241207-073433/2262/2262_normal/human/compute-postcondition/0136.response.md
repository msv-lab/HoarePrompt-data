The function `func_5` accepts two parameters: `t`, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n`, which is also a positive integer representing the size of the grid. The grid consists of `n` strings, each containing `n` characters that are either '.' or 'X'. It is guaranteed that not all cells in the grid are empty across the test cases, and the total sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 300. 

The output of the function is not explicitly defined in the provided information, so we cannot determine the exact return value. However, based on the constraints, we can infer that the function processes the grids formed by the `n` strings and operates according to the rules defined by the problem, likely producing a result based on the configuration of 'X' and '.' in the grid.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a positive integer `n` for each test case representing the size of a grid. It processes grids based on the characters '.' and 'X' and returns results based on the grid configurations.**
