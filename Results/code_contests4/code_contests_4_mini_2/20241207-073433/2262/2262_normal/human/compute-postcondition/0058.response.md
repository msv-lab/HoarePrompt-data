The statement `cnt[(i + j) % 3] += 1` increments the value at the index `(i + j) % 3` of the `cnt` list by 1. The previous values of `i` and `j` are known, where `i` is less than `n` (a positive integer) and `j` is 0. Therefore, we can calculate `(i + j) % 3` as `(i + 0) % 3`, which simplifies to `i % 3`.

Since the specific value of `cnt` is not provided, we can only state that the value at the index determined by `i % 3` in the `cnt` list is increased by 1. The states of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is 0, `i` is less than `n`, element at row `i` and column `j` of matrix `M` is equal to 'X'; `clr[i, j]` is assigned the value of (i + j) % 3; `cnt[i % 3]` is increased by 1.**
