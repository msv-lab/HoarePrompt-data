The value of `cnt[(i + j) % 3]` is incremented by 1. The variables `n` and `j` are unaffected, as their values remain constant. The value of `j` is 2, so we need to calculate `(i + 2) % 3`. The output state reflects the increment in the `cnt` list at the calculated index. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `j` is 2, `cnt` is updated at index `(i + 2) % 3` by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is 2, `cnt` is updated at index `(i + 2) % 3` by 1**
