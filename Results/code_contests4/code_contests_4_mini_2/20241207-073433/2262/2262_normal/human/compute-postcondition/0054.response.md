According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at least `n`, so now we need to increment `i` for the next iteration.

Since `i` is currently at least `n`, and the loop does not execute again if `i` is equal to or greater than `n`, it indicates that we cannot execute the loop any further. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. 

As such, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration of the loop. Given that `j` is at least `n` and the loop body is omitted, we do not need to change any other variables except for `i`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is at least `n`, `i` is at least `n` and for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than `n`.**
