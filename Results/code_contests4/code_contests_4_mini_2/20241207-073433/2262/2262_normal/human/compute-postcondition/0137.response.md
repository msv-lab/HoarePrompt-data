Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases of grid configurations, where each grid consists of characters 'X' and '.'. For each grid, it counts the occurrences of 'X' and assigns a color based on the grid coordinates. It then determines which color to use for conversion based on certain conditions and replaces the corresponding 'X' characters with 'O'. Finally, it prints the modified grid. The function does not return any values; it only outputs the modified grids directly.**
