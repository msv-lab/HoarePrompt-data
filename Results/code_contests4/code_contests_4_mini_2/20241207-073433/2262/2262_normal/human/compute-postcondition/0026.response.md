The variable `cnt` is being accessed at the index `(i + j) % 3`, where `i` is a previously defined index and `j` is 1. The code increments the value at that calculated index by 1. The previous values of `n` and `j` do not affect this operation, but `i` will determine which index of `cnt` is modified.

Since `j` is 1, the calculation for the index becomes `(i + 1) % 3`. The count at that specific index in the `cnt` list will be increased by 1. The initial state of `cnt` is not defined, but we can infer that its values are integers, and the specific index affected depends on the value of `i`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `cnt[(i + 1) % 3]` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `cnt[(i + 1) % 3]` is increased by 1**
