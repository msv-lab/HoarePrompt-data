t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases; for each test case, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) indicating the size of the grid, followed by n strings of length n, each containing characters '.', 'X', or 'O', where 'O' is not present in the easy version. The total size of all grids combined does not exceed 300.
