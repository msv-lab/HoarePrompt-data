t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases; for each test case, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) representing the size of the grid; the grid consists of n strings, each containing n characters where each character is either '.' (empty), or 'X' (token), and it is guaranteed that not all cells are empty. The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 300.
