t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) representing the size of the grid. The grid consists of n strings, each containing n characters that are either '.' or 'X'. It is guaranteed that not all cells are empty across the test cases, and the total sum of n does not exceed 300.
