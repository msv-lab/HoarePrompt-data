You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The only difference between the easy and hard versions is that tokens of type O do not appear in the input of the easy version.

Errichto gave Monogon the following challenge in order to intimidate him from taking his top contributor spot on Codeforces.

In a Tic-Tac-Toe grid, there are n rows and n columns. Each cell of the grid is either empty or contains a token. There are two types of tokens: X and O. If there exist three tokens of the same type consecutive in a row or column, it is a winning configuration. Otherwise, it is a draw configuration.

<image> The patterns in the first row are winning configurations. The patterns in the second row are draw configurations. 

In an operation, you can change an X to an O, or an O to an X. Let k denote the total number of tokens in the grid. Your task is to make the grid a draw in at most ⌊ k/3⌋ (rounding down) operations.

You are not required to minimize the number of operations.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1≤ t≤ 100) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤ n≤ 300) — the size of the grid.

The following n lines each contain a string of n characters, denoting the initial grid. The character in the i-th row and j-th column is '.' if the cell is empty, or it is the type of token in the cell: 'X' or 'O'.

It is guaranteed that not all cells are empty.

In the easy version, the character 'O' does not appear in the input.

The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 300.

Output

For each test case, print the state of the grid after applying the operations.

We have proof that a solution always exists. If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Note

In the first test case, there are initially three 'X' consecutive in the second row and the second column. By changing the middle token to 'O' we make the grid a draw, and we only changed 1≤ ⌊ 5/3⌋ token.

In the second test case, we change only 9≤ ⌊ 32/3⌋ tokens, and there does not exist any three 'X' or 'O' consecutive in a row or column, so it is a draw.

In the third test case, we change only 3≤ ⌊ 12/3⌋ tokens, and the resulting grid is a draw.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), n is an integer representing the size of the grid for each test case (1 ≤ n ≤ 300), and each grid is represented by n strings of length n containing characters '.' or 'X', with at least one cell not empty. The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 300.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer input value that represents the number of test cases 't'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns an integer that represents the number of test cases `t`, as input by the user. It does not handle any edge cases related to input validation, so if the input is not a valid integer, it may raise an error.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases; for each test case, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) indicating the size of the grid, followed by n strings of length n, each containing characters '.', 'X', or 'O', where 'O' is not present in the easy version. The total size of all grids combined does not exceed 300.
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained by mapping the input strings split by spaces into integers
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts input from the user, which is expected to be a series of space-separated integers, and returns a list of these integers. It does not directly interact with the parameters `t` or `n`, as there is no functionality implemented to handle multiple test cases, grids, or the specific characters mentioned in the annotations. The function simply processes the input and outputs a list of integers derived from that input.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) representing the size of the grid for each test case, and the grid consists of n strings, each containing exactly n characters which are either '.' or 'X'. The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 300.
def func_3():
    s = input()
    return list(s[:len(s) - 1])
    #The program returns a list containing all characters of the string 's' except the last character, which is a row of the grid with exactly n characters that are either '.' or 'X'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and reads a string input `s`, returning a list containing all characters of the string except the last character. This effectively excludes the final character of the input string from the returned list. If the input string is empty, the function will return an empty list.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer with 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, n is an integer with 1 ≤ n ≤ 300 for each test case, and the grid consists of n strings of length n containing only the characters 'X' or '.' (no 'O' characters allowed), with at least one non-empty cell. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 300.
def func_4():
    s = input()
    return s[:len(s) - 1]
    #The program returns the string 's' excluding its last character
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns the input string `s` excluding its last character. It does not handle cases where the input string is empty, which may lead to unexpected behavior. If the input string is a single character, the function will return an empty string.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) representing the size of the grid. The grid consists of n strings, each containing n characters that are either '.' or 'X'. It is guaranteed that not all cells are empty across the test cases, and the total sum of n does not exceed 300.
def func_5():
    n = func_1()
    M = []
    k = 0
    for _ in xrange(n):
        M.append(func_3())
        
        k += sum([(1) for x in M[-1] if x in 'XO'])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `M` is a list containing the results of `func_3()` executed `n` times, `k` is the total count of 'X' and 'O' in all elements of `M`, `_` is `n`.
    K = int(k / 3.0)

        for j in xrange(n):
            if M[i][j] == 'X':
                clr[i, j] = (i + j) % 3
                cnt[(i + j) % 3] += 1
            else:
                clr[i, j] = -1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `clr` contains assigned values based on whether each element of `M` was 'X' or not for all indices, and `cnt` contains the counts of how many times `(i + j) % 3` was incremented for each `i` and `j` in that range.
    use_clr = 0
    while use_clr < 3 and (cnt[use_clr] > K or cnt[use_clr] == 0):
        use_clr += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `use_clr` is 3, `n` is a positive integer, `cnt[0]`, `cnt[1]`, and `cnt[2]` must be such that `cnt[0]` is greater than K or `cnt[0]` is equal to 0, `cnt[1]` is greater than K or `cnt[1]` is equal to 0, and `cnt[2]` allows the loop to terminate since `use_clr` cannot increment further.
    chg = 0
    for i in xrange(n):
        for j in xrange(n):
            if clr[i, j] == use_clr:
                M[i][j] = 'O'
                chg += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `use_clr` is 3, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n`, `M[i][j]` is 'O' where `clr[i, j]` equals `use_clr` for all occurrences, and `chg` is the total count of all occurrences of `use_clr` in the `clr` matrix.
    for i in xrange(n):
        print(''.join(M[i]))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `use_clr` is 3, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n`, and the output is a string formed by joining the elements of each list in M for all indices from 0 to n-1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases of grid configurations, where each grid consists of characters 'X' and '.'. For each grid, it counts the occurrences of 'X' and assigns a color based on the grid coordinates. It then determines which color to use for conversion based on certain conditions and replaces the corresponding 'X' characters with 'O'. Finally, it prints the modified grid. The function does not return any values; it only outputs the modified grids directly.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
