The function accepts input from the user, which is expected to be a series of space-separated integers, and returns a list of these integers. It does not directly interact with the parameters `t` or `n`, as there is no functionality implemented to handle multiple test cases, grids, or the specific characters mentioned in the annotations. The function simply processes the input and outputs a list of integers derived from that input.
