You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The only difference between the easy and hard versions is that tokens of type O do not appear in the input of the easy version.

Errichto gave Monogon the following challenge in order to intimidate him from taking his top contributor spot on Codeforces.

In a Tic-Tac-Toe grid, there are n rows and n columns. Each cell of the grid is either empty or contains a token. There are two types of tokens: X and O. If there exist three tokens of the same type consecutive in a row or column, it is a winning configuration. Otherwise, it is a draw configuration.

<image> The patterns in the first row are winning configurations. The patterns in the second row are draw configurations. 

In an operation, you can change an X to an O, or an O to an X. Let k denote the total number of tokens in the grid. Your task is to make the grid a draw in at most ⌊ k/3⌋ (rounding down) operations.

You are not required to minimize the number of operations.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1≤ t≤ 100) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤ n≤ 300) — the size of the grid.

The following n lines each contain a string of n characters, denoting the initial grid. The character in the i-th row and j-th column is '.' if the cell is empty, or it is the type of token in the cell: 'X' or 'O'.

It is guaranteed that not all cells are empty.

In the easy version, the character 'O' does not appear in the input.

The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 300.

Output

For each test case, print the state of the grid after applying the operations.

We have proof that a solution always exists. If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

.X.
XXX

6
XX.XXX
XXXXXX
XXX.XX
XXXXXX
XX.X.X
XXXXXX
5
XXX.X
.X..X
XXX.X
..X..
..X..


Output


.X.
XOX
.X.
XX.XXO
XOXXOX
OXX.XX
XOOXXO
XX.X.X
OXXOXX
XOX.X
.X..X
XXO.O
..X..
..X..

Note

In the first test case, there are initially three 'X' consecutive in the second row and the second column. By changing the middle token to 'O' we make the grid a draw, and we only changed 1≤ ⌊ 5/3⌋ token.

In the second test case, we change only 9≤ ⌊ 32/3⌋ tokens, and there does not exist any three 'X' or 'O' consecutive in a row or column, so it is a draw.

In the third test case, we change only 3≤ ⌊ 12/3⌋ tokens, and the resulting grid is a draw.
Program:
```
testing = len(sys.argv) == 4 and sys.argv[3] == 'myTest'
if testing:
    cmd = sys.stdout
    from time import time
    start_time = int(round(time() * 1000))
    input = open(sys.argv[1], 'r').readline
    sys.stdout = open(sys.argv[2], 'w')
else:
    input = sys.stdin.readline

def func_1():
    return int(input())

def func_2():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))

def func_3():
    s = input()
    return list(s[:len(s) - 1])

def func_4():
    s = input()
    return s[:len(s) - 1]

def func_5():
    n = func_1()
    M = []
    k = 0
    for _ in xrange(n):
        M.append(func_3())
        k += sum([1 for x in M[-1] if x in 'XO'])
    K = int(k / 3.0)
    clr = dict()
    cnt = [0] * 3
    for i in xrange(n):
        for j in xrange(n):
            if M[i][j] == 'X':
                clr[i, j] = (i + j) % 3
                cnt[(i + j) % 3] += 1
            else:
                clr[i, j] = -1
    use_clr = 0
    while use_clr < 3 and (cnt[use_clr] > K or cnt[use_clr] == 0):
        use_clr += 1
    chg = 0
    for i in xrange(n):
        for j in xrange(n):
            if clr[i, j] == use_clr:
                M[i][j] = 'O'
                chg += 1
    for i in xrange(n):
        print(''.join(M[i]))
if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in xrange(func_1()):
        func_5()
    if testing:
        sys.stdout = cmd
        print(int(round(time() * 1000)) - start_time)
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
