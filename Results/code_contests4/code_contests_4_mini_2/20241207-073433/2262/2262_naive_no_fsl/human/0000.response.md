Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, it allows changes to occur without ensuring that the final grid is a draw configuration. 

One potential case where the program fails is as follows:

Consider the input:
```
1
3
XXX
.X.
XXX
```

In this case, there are already three 'X' tokens in a row (the first or last row), which is a winning configuration. The program should ensure that it can convert enough 'X' tokens to 'O' tokens to prevent any winning configuration. However, due to the logic of the program, it might change a token to 'O' without considering the presence of existing winning configurations. 

It does not guarantee that after executing the operations, there are no three consecutive 'X' or 'O' tokens in any row or column, thereby failing to meet the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not account for all potential configurations properly.
