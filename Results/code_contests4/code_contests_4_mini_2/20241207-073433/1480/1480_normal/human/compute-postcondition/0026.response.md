The value of `b` is decremented by 1, but the previous value of `b` is unknown. The states of `a` and `s` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are integers; `s` is updated to include '1'; `b` is decreased by 1. 

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers; `s` is updated to include '1'; `b` is decreased by 1**
