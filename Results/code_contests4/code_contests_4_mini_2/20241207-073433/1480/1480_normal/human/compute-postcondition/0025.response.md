The value of `s` is updated by appending the string '1' to it. The integers `a` and `b` remain unchanged, so their values do not impact the output state. The requirement for `x` to have been at least 3 is not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are integers, `s` is updated to include '1'.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers, `s` is updated to include '1'**
