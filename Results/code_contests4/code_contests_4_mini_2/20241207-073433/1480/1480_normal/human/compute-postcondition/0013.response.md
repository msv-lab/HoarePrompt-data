The code appends the character '0' to the string `s`. The variables `a`, `b`, and `x` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. The last character of `s` was stated to not be '0', so after execution, the last character will now be '0'. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, and `x` are integers with `x` greater than 1; the last character of `s` is now '0'.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `x` are integers with `x` greater than 1; the last character of `s` is now '0'**
