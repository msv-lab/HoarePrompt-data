The line of code `a, b, x = map(int, raw_input().split(' '))` takes a single line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split string into an integer. The values are then assigned to the variables `a`, `b`, and `x`. Since `a` and `b` are integers within the range of 1 to 100, and `x` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ x < a + b, the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `x` will depend on the input provided.

Assuming the input will be a valid string of integers that meet the specified conditions, the output state will reflect that `a`, `b`, and `x` have been assigned the respective integer values from the input. However, since the actual input values are not provided, we can only state that they have been updated based on the input.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `x` are integers assigned from input values**.
