The value of `x` is decremented by 1, but since the values of `a`, `b`, and `s` are not altered by this specific line of code, the output state will reflect the current conditions of `a`, `b`, and `s`, along with the updated value of `x`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are integers; `s` remains unchanged; `x` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers; `s` remains unchanged; `x` is decreased by 1.**
