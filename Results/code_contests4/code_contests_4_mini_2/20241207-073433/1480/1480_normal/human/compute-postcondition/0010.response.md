The code appends the string '1' to the variable `s`. Since `s` ends with '0', after execution, `s` will now end with '01'. The values of `a`, `b`, and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 1, and `s` now ends with '01'.

Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 1, `s` now ends with '01'**
