According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. The loop will execute if `x` is greater than 1. Right before the loop, `x` is stated to be greater than 1, which means the loop can execute as is. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`a`, `b`, and `x` are integers, with `x` greater than 1**
