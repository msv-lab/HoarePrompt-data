According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is an integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be greater than 1. Therefore, `x` must be adjusted to be greater than 1.

State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, and for the loop to execute again `x` is greater than 1**
