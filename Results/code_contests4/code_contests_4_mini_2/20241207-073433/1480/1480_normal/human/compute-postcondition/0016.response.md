The initial state indicates that `x` is an integer greater than 1, while `a` and `b` are also integers. The code snippet `x -= 1` decrements the value of `x` by 1. 

Since `x` is greater than 1, after execution, the new value of `x` will be an integer that is still greater than 0. The values of `a` and `b` are not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, after executing the code, the output state will reflect the updated value of `x` while maintaining the original values of `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 0**
