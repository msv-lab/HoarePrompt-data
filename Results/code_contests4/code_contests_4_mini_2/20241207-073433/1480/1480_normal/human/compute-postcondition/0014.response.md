The value of `a` is decremented by 1. The values of `b` and `x` remain unchanged, and the last character of `s` is still '0'. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is decreased by 1, `b` is an integer, `x` is greater than 1, and the last character of `s` is '0'.

Output State: **`a` is decreased by 1, `b` is an integer, `x` is greater than 1, and the last character of `s` is '0'**.
