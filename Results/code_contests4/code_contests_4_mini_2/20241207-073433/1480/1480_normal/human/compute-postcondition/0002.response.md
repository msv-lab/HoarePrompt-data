The variable `s` is assigned the string value `'1'`. The initial values of `a`, `b`, and `x` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the integers and the new value of `s`.

Output State: **`a` is equal to 1; `b` is an input integer; `x` is an input integer greater than 1; `s` is '1'**
