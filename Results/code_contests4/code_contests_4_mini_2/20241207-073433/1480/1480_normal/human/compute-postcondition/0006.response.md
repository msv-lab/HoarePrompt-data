The value of `a` is decremented by 1, but the previous value of `a` is unknown. The values of `b` and `x` remain unaffected, and `s` remains '0'. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is decreased by 1; `b` is an input integer; `x` is an input integer; `s` is '0'.

Output State: **`a` is decreased by 1; `b` is an input integer; `x` is an input integer; `s` is '0'**
