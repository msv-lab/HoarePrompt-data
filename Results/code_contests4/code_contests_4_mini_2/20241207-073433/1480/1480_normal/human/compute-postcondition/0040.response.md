The function `func` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`, both of which are integers constrained by the condition 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100. Additionally, it accepts a parameter `x`, which is an integer constrained by the condition 1 ≤ x < a + b. 

Based on the output description provided, the function may have specific return values contingent upon the values of `a`, `b`, and `x`, although these return conditions were not specified in the prompt. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two integers `a` and `b`, along with an integer `x`, where `a` and `b` are within the range of 1 to 100, and `x` is within the range of 1 to less than the sum of `a` and `b`. The specific return values based on these inputs are not detailed in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters a and b, both integers within the range of 1 to 100, and x, an integer that is at least 1 and less than a + b.**
