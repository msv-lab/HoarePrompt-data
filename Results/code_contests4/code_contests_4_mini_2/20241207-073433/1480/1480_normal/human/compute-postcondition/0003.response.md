The value of `b` is decremented by 1, but the previous value of `b` is unknown as it is an input integer. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is equal to 1; `b` is an input integer decreased by 1; `x` is an input integer greater than 1; `s` is '1'.

Output State: **`a` is equal to 1; `b` is an input integer decreased by 1; `x` is an input integer greater than 1; `s` is '1'**
