The value of `a` is decremented by 1, but the previous value of `a` is unknown. The values of `b` and `s` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer and decremented by 1; `b` is an integer; `s` is updated to `s + '0'` and for the loop to execute again `x` must have been at least 3.

Output State: **`a` is an integer and decremented by 1; `b` is an integer; `s` is updated to `s + '0'` and for the loop to execute again `x` must have been at least 3.**
