Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are integers. If the last character of `s` is '0', then `b` is decreased by 1 and `s` is incremented by the string '1', allowing the loop to execute again as long as `x` is greater than 1. Otherwise, `a` is decremented by 1, `s` is concatenated with '0', and the loop will execute again since `x` is greater than 1.***
