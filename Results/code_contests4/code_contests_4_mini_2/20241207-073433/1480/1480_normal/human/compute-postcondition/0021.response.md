The value of `a` is decremented by 1. The values of `b` and `s` remain unchanged. Since `x` is greater than 1, the loop will execute again. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer (decremented by 1), `b` is an integer, `s` is concatenated with '0', and the loop will execute again since `x` is greater than 1.

Output State: **`a` is an integer (decremented by 1), `b` is an integer, `s` is concatenated with '0', and the loop will execute again since `x` is greater than 1.**
