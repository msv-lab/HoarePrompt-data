To determine the final output state after the while loop has executed, let's analyze the provided code and the initial conditions regarding the variables `a`, `b`, `x`, and `s`. The loop modifies `a`, `b`, `x`, and `s` based on the value of `s` and runs until `x` is no longer greater than 1.

Since `x` starts as greater than 1, the loop will execute multiple times. The behavior of the loop depends on the last character of the string `s`. 

1. If the last character of `s` is '0', `s` will be appended with '1', `b` will be decremented by 1, and `x` will be decremented by 1.
2. If the last character of `s` is '1', `s` will be appended with '0', `a` will be decremented by 1, and `x` will be decremented by 1.

As `x` decreases, the loop continues until `x` becomes 1, at which point the loop terminates.

Analyzing the final output state:
- Since the loop continues until `x` decrements to 1, the final state of `x` will be 1.
- The loop will manipulate `a` and `b` based on the last character of `s` until `x` reaches 1. The exact final values of `a` and `b` depend on the number of times the loop executed and the initial values of `a`, `b`, and the starting value of `s`.
  
After all iterations:
- `x` will be 1.
- `a` will have been decremented by the number of times the last character of `s` was '1'.
- `b` will have been decremented by the number of times the last character of `s` was '0'.
- `s` will have grown in length, with the last character being '0' if the last iteration changed it from '1' to '0', or '1' if it remained '1'.

Final output state after the loop execution:
Output State: **`x` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers that have been decremented based on the loop execution, and `s` is a string that has been built through the loop iterations.**
