The code `s += '0' * a` appends a string consisting of '0' repeated `a` times to the existing string `s`. The variable `s` already ends with '0' and includes '1' repeated `b` times. As a result, the final value of `s` will be the original `s` followed by `a` additional '0's.

The current state of `s` is '1' repeated `b` times followed by '0'. Therefore, after execution, `s` will be '1' repeated `b` times followed by '0' repeated `a + 1` times (because we add `a` '0's to the existing one).

The other variables, `x`, `a`, and `b`, remain unaffected.

Output State: **`x` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `s` is '1' repeated `b` times followed by '0' repeated `a + 1` times.**
