The function accepts three integers `a`, `b`, and `x`, where `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100` and `1 ≤ x < a + b`. It builds a binary string `s` based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `x`. If `x` is greater than 1 and `a` equals 1, the string starts with '1' and `b` is decremented. Otherwise, it starts with '0' and `a` is decremented. The function then alternates between appending '1's and '0's to `s` based on the last character of `s`, until `x` reaches 1. Finally, it appends the remaining '1's and '0's based on the last character in `s` and prints the final string. The function does not handle cases where `x` equals 1 or where `a` or `b` reach negative values due to decrements.
