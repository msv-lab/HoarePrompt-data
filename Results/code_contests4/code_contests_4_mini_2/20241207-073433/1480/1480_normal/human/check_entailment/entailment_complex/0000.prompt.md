You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given three integers a, b and x. Your task is to construct a binary string s of length n = a + b such that there are exactly a zeroes, exactly b ones and exactly x indices i (where 1 ≤ i < n) such that s_i ≠ s_{i + 1}. It is guaranteed that the answer always exists.

For example, for the string "01010" there are four indices i such that 1 ≤ i < n and s_i ≠ s_{i + 1} (i = 1, 2, 3, 4). For the string "111001" there are two such indices i (i = 3, 5).

Recall that binary string is a non-empty sequence of characters where each character is either 0 or 1.

Input

The first line of the input contains three integers a, b and x (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 1 ≤ x < a + b).

Output

Print only one string s, where s is any binary string satisfying conditions described above. It is guaranteed that the answer always exists.

Examples

01010100

Note

All possible answers for the first example: 

  * 1100; 
  * 0011. 



All possible answers for the second example: 

  * 110100; 
  * 101100; 
  * 110010; 
  * 100110; 
  * 011001; 
  * 001101; 
  * 010011; 
  * 001011. 
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, and x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x < a + b.
def func():
    a, b, x = map(int, raw_input().split(' '))
    if (x > 1 and a == 1) :
        s = '1'
        b -= 1
    else :
        s = '0'
        a -= 1
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a`, `b`, and `x` are integers. If `x` is greater than 1 and `a` is equal to 1, then `b` is decreased by 1 and `s` is set to '1'. Otherwise, `a` is decreased by 1, `b` remains as the input integer, `x` is the input integer, and `s` is set to '0'.
    while x > 1:
        if s[-1] == '0':
            s += '1'
            b -= 1
        else:
            s += '0'
            a -= 1
        
        x -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers that have been decremented based on the loop execution, and `s` is a string that has been built through the loop iterations.
    if (s[-1] == '0') :
        s += '1' * b
        s += '0' * a
    else :
        s += '0' * a
        s += '1' * b
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`x` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer. If the last character of `s` is '0', then `s` consists of '1' repeated `b` times followed by '0' repeated `a + 1` times. Otherwise, `s` is the original string concatenated with '1' repeated `b` times and '0' repeated `a` times.
    print(s)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three integers `a`, `b`, and `x`, where `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100` and `1 ≤ x < a + b`. It builds a binary string `s` based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `x`. If `x` is greater than 1 and `a` equals 1, the string starts with '1' and `b` is decremented. Otherwise, it starts with '0' and `a` is decremented. The function then alternates between appending '1's and '0's to `s` based on the last character of `s`, until `x` reaches 1. Finally, it appends the remaining '1's and '0's based on the last character in `s` and prints the final string. The function does not handle cases where `x` equals 1 or where `a` or `b` reach negative values due to decrements.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
