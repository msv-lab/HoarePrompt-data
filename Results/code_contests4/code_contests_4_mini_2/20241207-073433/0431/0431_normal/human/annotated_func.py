#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers representing the number of units of garbage produced each day, where each element is non-negative and satisfies 0 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9 for 0 <= i < len(a); k is a positive integer representing the maximum capacity of a bag, where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(a, k):
    bags, carry = 0, 0
    for i in a:
        if carry != 0:
            bags += 1
            i = max(0, i - carry)
        
        bags += i // k
        
        carry = i % k
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `bags` is the total number of bags calculated from all items in `a`, `carry` is the remainder from the last item in `a` when divided by `k`, and `i` is no longer relevant outside of the loop context.
    if (carry != 0) :
        bags += 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`bags` is the total number of bags calculated from all items in `a`, if `carry` is not equal to 0, then `bags` is incremented by 1. If `carry` is equal to 0, `bags` remains unchanged.
    return bags
    #The program returns the total number of bags, which is incremented by 1 if `carry` is not equal to 0, otherwise, it remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of non-negative integers `a`, each representing daily garbage production, and a positive integer `k`, representing the maximum capacity of a bag. It calculates the total number of bags needed to carry the garbage, where each bag can carry up to `k` units. If there's any leftover garbage after filling bags, it increments the total bag count by 1. The function correctly handles the case where the last day's garbage has a remainder, ensuring that it accounts for any leftover that doesn't fill a complete bag.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), k is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9), and a_i is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) for each day i (1 ≤ i ≤ n).
def func_2():
    _, k = map(int, input().split(' '))
    a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    print(min(func_1(a, k), func_1(a[::-1], k)))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers `k` and a list of integers `a`, which represents some data over `n` days. It calculates the minimum result of a function `func_1` applied to the list `a` and its reverse, with `k` as an additional parameter. It does not explicitly return a value but prints the minimal result. The behavior of `func_1` is not specified, so the exact effect of this function on the output is unknown. The function does not handle any errors or edge cases directly related to input validation, such as ensuring `a` contains exactly `n` elements.
