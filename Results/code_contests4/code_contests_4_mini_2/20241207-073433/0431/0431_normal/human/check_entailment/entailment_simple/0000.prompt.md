You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Enough is enough. Too many times it happened that Vasya forgot to dispose of garbage and his apartment stank afterwards. Now he wants to create a garbage disposal plan and stick to it.

For each of next n days Vasya knows a_i — number of units of garbage he will produce on the i-th day. Each unit of garbage must be disposed of either on the day it was produced or on the next day. Vasya disposes of garbage by putting it inside a bag and dropping the bag into a garbage container. Each bag can contain up to k units of garbage. It is allowed to compose and drop multiple bags into a garbage container in a single day.

Being economical, Vasya wants to use as few bags as possible. You are to compute the minimum number of bags Vasya needs to dispose of all of his garbage for the given n days. No garbage should be left after the n-th day.

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9) — number of days to consider and bag's capacity. The second line contains n space separated integers a_i (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the number of units of garbage produced on the i-th day.

Output

Output a single integer — the minimum number of bags Vasya needs to dispose of all garbage. Each unit of garbage should be disposed on the day it was produced or on the next day. No garbage can be left after the n-th day. In a day it is allowed to compose and drop multiple bags.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers representing the number of units of garbage produced each day, where each element is non-negative and satisfies 0 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9 for 0 <= i < len(a); k is a positive integer representing the maximum capacity of a bag, where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(a, k):
    bags, carry = 0, 0
    for i in a:
        if carry != 0:
            bags += 1
            i = max(0, i - carry)
        
        bags += i // k
        
        carry = i % k
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `bags` is the total number of bags calculated from all items in `a`, `carry` is the remainder from the last item in `a` when divided by `k`, and `i` is no longer relevant outside of the loop context.
    if (carry != 0) :
        bags += 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`bags` is the total number of bags calculated from all items in `a`, if `carry` is not equal to 0, then `bags` is incremented by 1. If `carry` is equal to 0, `bags` remains unchanged.
    return bags
    #The program returns the total number of bags, which is incremented by 1 if `carry` is not equal to 0, otherwise, it remains unchanged.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), k is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9), and a_i is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) for each day i (1 ≤ i ≤ n).
def func_2():
    _, k = map(int, input().split(' '))
    a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    print(min(func_1(a, k), func_1(a[::-1], k)))


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
