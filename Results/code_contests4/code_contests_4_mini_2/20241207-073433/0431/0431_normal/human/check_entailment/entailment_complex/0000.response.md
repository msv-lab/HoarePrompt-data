Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case where garbage needs to be disposed of across multiple days with respect to the constraints given in the problem description. 

Specifically, the issue arises in the `func_1` where the `carry` from one day is added to the next day's garbage. While the code does account for the `carry`, it does not always ensure that all garbage is disposed of in accordance with the problem requirements. The logic of dropping bags only on the same day or the next day can lead to scenarios where the garbage produced on a day is not fully accounted for by the following day's disposal.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 3
5 6 1
```
In this case:
- On Day 1, Vasya produces 5 units of garbage. He can use 2 bags (3 units in one bag, 2 units in another).
- On Day 2, he produces 6 units but has 2 units left over from Day 1. He can use 2 bags (3 units for the first bag, 3 units for the second bag) but will still have 1 unit of leftover garbage that cannot be disposed of on Day 3, since it will exceed the bag limit.
- On Day 3, he produces 1 unit of garbage but cannot dispose of the leftover from Day 2.

The expected output should be a total of 5 bags (2 for Day 1, 2 for Day 2, and 1 for Day 3), but the logic in the code does not account for this properly, thus leading to leftovers which violate the problem's constraints.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
