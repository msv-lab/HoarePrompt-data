The function accepts a list of non-negative integers `a`, each representing daily garbage production, and a positive integer `k`, representing the maximum capacity of a bag. It calculates the total number of bags needed to carry the garbage, where each bag can carry up to `k` units. If there's any leftover garbage after filling bags, it increments the total bag count by 1. The function correctly handles the case where the last day's garbage has a remainder, ensuring that it accounts for any leftover that doesn't fill a complete bag.
