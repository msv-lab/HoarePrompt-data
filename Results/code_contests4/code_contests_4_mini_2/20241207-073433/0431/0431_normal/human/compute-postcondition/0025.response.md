The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a` and `k`. The parameter `a` is a list of integers representing the number of units of garbage produced each day, where each element is non-negative and satisfies the condition 0 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9 for 0 <= i < len(a). The parameter `k` is a positive integer representing the maximum capacity of a bag, with the constraint 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. After executing the function body, it returns the total number of bags needed to carry the garbage. The total number of bags is incremented by 1 if there is any remaining garbage (`carry` is not equal to 0); otherwise, it remains unchanged. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `a` and a positive integer `k`, and return the total number of bags required to carry the garbage produced each day, accounting for any leftover garbage. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `a` representing daily garbage production and a positive integer `k` representing the maximum capacity of a bag. It returns the total number of bags needed, incremented by 1 if there is leftover garbage.**
