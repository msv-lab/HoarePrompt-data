To evaluate the output state, we observe the following:

1. The variable `a` is a list of integers, which is derived from input.
2. The function `func_1` is called twice: once with the original list `a` and once with the reversed list `a[::-1]`.
3. The outputs of both calls to `func_1` are compared using the `min` function, which returns the smaller of the two values.

Since we do not have the actual implementation details of `func_1`, we cannot determine the exact values it returns. However, we can note that the output will be the minimum of the two results from `func_1`.

Therefore, the output state will indicate that the minimum value of the two function calls is being printed.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `k` is an input positive integer; `a` is a list of integers from input; `min(func_1(a, k), func_1(a[::-1], k))` is printed.**
