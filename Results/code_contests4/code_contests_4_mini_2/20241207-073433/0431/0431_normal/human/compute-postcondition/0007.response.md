The value of `carry` is assigned the value of `i % k`. Since `carry` is not equal to 0, this means that `i` is not a multiple of `k`. The previous values of `bags` and `i` remain unchanged in this step. Therefore, the Output State is: `bags` is updated to `1 + (i // k)`, `i` is either `i - carry` or set to 0, and `carry` is assigned the value of `i % k`.

Output State: **`bags` is updated to `1 + (i // k)`, `i` is either `i - carry` or set to 0, `carry` is assigned the value of `i % k`**
