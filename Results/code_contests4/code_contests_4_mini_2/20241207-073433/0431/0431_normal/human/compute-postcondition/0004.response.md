Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `k` and a list of integers `a`, which represents some data over `n` days. It calculates the minimum result of a function `func_1` applied to the list `a` and its reverse, with `k` as an additional parameter. It does not explicitly return a value but prints the minimal result. The behavior of `func_1` is not specified, so the exact effect of this function on the output is unknown. The function does not handle any errors or edge cases directly related to input validation, such as ensuring `a` contains exactly `n` elements.**
