The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it operates on a collection of values defined within its body, adhering to the constraints provided: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9), and `a_i` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) for each day `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ n). 

The output of the function is not specified in the prompt. Therefore, without additional details, we cannot define specific return values or cases. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates on internally defined inputs to produce an unspecified output.**
