The function accepts no parameters and reads an input string from the user. It then returns a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string at each space character. If there are consecutive spaces, it will return empty strings in the resulting list for those spaces. Additionally, if the input is empty or consists solely of spaces, the function will return a list containing an empty string.
