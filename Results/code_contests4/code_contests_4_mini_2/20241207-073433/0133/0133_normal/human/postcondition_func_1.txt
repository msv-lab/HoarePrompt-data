The function accepts no parameters and returns a list of integers obtained from user input. However, it does not enforce the size of the list based on the integer n, which is assumed to be between 3 and 10^6. Instead, the function relies on user input without validating whether the number of integers entered meets this requirement. Therefore, it could return a list of any size based on the user's input, even if it does not comply with the expected range.
