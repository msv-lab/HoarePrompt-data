def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer value provided as input, which is expected to be within the range of 3 to 10^6.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer input from the user and returns that integer value. However, it does not enforce or validate that the input falls within the expected range of 3 to 10^6, meaning it could return any integer input, including those outside the specified range.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained from user input, where the size of the list is determined by the integer n, which is between 3 and 10^6.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns a list of integers obtained from user input. However, it does not enforce the size of the list based on the integer n, which is assumed to be between 3 and 10^6. Instead, the function relies on user input without validating whether the number of integers entered meets this requirement. Therefore, it could return a list of any size based on the user's input, even if it does not comply with the expected range.

def func_3():
    s = input()
    return list(s[:len(s) - 1])
    #The program returns a list containing all characters of the string 's' except for the last character.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and reads a string input from the user, returning a list of all characters from that string except for the last character. If the input string is empty, it returns an empty list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
def func_4():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing integers parsed from user input, which consists of n space-separated integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns a map object containing integers parsed from user input, which are space-separated integers provided by the user. It assumes that the input will be valid integers and does not handle any exceptions related to input parsing or invalid input formats.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
def func_5():
    s = input()
    return s.split(' ')
    #The program returns a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string 's' at each space character.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and reads an input string from the user. It then returns a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string at each space character. If there are consecutive spaces, it will return empty strings in the resulting list for those spaces. Additionally, if the input is empty or consists solely of spaces, the function will return a list containing an empty string.

    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is a prime number or 1, `ans` contains all prime factors of the original value of `n`, `i` is greater than `cap`, and `cap` is less than or equal to the square root of the original value of `n`.
    if (n > 1) :
        ans.append(n)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a prime number or 1, `ans` contains all prime factors of the original value of `n` plus `n` if `n` is greater than 1, while `i` remains greater than `cap`, and `cap` is less than or equal to the square root of the original value of `n`. If `n` is 1, the function still maintains the conditions on `ans`, `i`, and `cap`.
    return ans
    #The program returns a list of all prime factors of the original value of `n`, plus `n` if `n` is greater than 1, while maintaining conditions on `i` and `cap`. If `n` is 1, the program still returns the prime factors as per the conditions on `ans`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and returns a list of its prime factors. If `n` is equal to 1, it returns a list containing only the integer 1. If `n` is a prime number greater than 1, it returns a list containing `n` itself along with its prime factors. The function does not account for the case when `n` is 1 explicitly in its logic, as it will return an empty list for prime factors of 1, but it does handle that case by returning `[1]` instead.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and k is an integer that is not explicitly defined in the problem description but is typically used for combinatorial purposes.

        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    else :
        a = math.factorial(n)
        b = math.factorial(k)
        c = math.factorial(n - k)
        div = a // (b * c)
        return div
        #The program returns 'div', which is not defined, leading to an error due to the absence of a valid value for 'div'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters, `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and `k`. It returns 1 if `n` is equal to 1 or `k`, returns 0 if `k` is greater than `n`, and attempts to calculate the binomial coefficient C(n, k) using factorials otherwise. However, the code has an issue because the variable 'div' is not defined in the expected return statement, leading to an error if neither of the first two conditions is met. Therefore, the functionality includes returning 1, returning 0, or resulting in an error due to the undefined variable 'div'.
