Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Missing Core Logic**: The problem statement requires the implementation of a function that calculates the number of cyclic permutations of length `n` based on the defined graph structure. However, the provided functions (`func_1` to `func_7`) mainly deal with input handling and mathematical operations without any implementation related to graph construction or counting cycles in permutations.

2. **Irrelevant Functions**: The functions defined in the program, such as `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_6`, and `func_7`, are not relevant to the task of counting cyclic permutations. They deal with input parsing, prime factorization, and combinatorial calculations, which do not directly contribute to solving the problem of counting cyclic permutations as described.

3. **No Cycle Detection**: There is no implementation of a graph or cycle detection algorithm in the code. The problem description specifically mentions building a graph based on the permutation and checking for cycles, which is completely absent from the annotated program.

4. **Incorrect Return Types and Logic**: Some functions attempt to perform mathematical calculations (like those in `func_7`) but do not relate to the core requirement of counting cyclic permutations. The calculation of combinations (`div`) is misused and not relevant to the problem.

In summary, the annotated program fails to address the problem description effectively, lacking the necessary graph construction and cycle detection logic required to count cyclic permutations. Therefore, it does not meet the problem requirements.
