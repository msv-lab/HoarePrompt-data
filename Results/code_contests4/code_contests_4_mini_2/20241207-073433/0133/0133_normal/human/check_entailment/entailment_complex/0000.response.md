Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly implement the functionality required by the problem description. Specifically, it lacks the necessary logic to count the number of cyclic permutations of length `n` as described.

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires counting cyclic permutations of length `n` based on a defined graph structure derived from the permutation. However, none of the functions implement the logic to determine the cyclic permutations based on the edges defined in the problem statement.

2. **Functionality Gaps**: The functions mainly handle input and some basic operations (like prime factorization and factorial calculations), but they do not construct the graph or count the cyclic permutations. The annotations indicate that the functions do not validate inputs or enforce constraints, which could lead to incorrect results if invalid inputs are provided.

3. **Missing Output Logic**: The core logic to compute the number of cyclic permutations of the graph derived from the permutations is absent. The functions do not reflect any calculation or combinatorial logic that would yield the number of cyclic permutations.

4. **Example Failure Case**: For the case where `n = 4`, the expected output is `16`. However, none of the functions provide any mechanism to derive this output. This is a clear indication that the code does not cover the requirements of the problem statement.

In conclusion, due to the absence of crucial functionality and the lack of implementation for counting cyclic permutations as specified in the problem description, the program is incorrect.
