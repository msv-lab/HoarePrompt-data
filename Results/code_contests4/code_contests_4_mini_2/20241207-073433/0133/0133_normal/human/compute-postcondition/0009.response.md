The code attempts to compute `div` using the formula `div = a // (b * c)`. However, since `b` is not assigned a value due to the undefined variable `k`, an error occurs when trying to compute `c`. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of the variables and the resulting error due to the undefined variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6; `a` is the factorial of `n`; `k` is not defined; `b` is not assigned a value; an error occurs when trying to compute `c`.**
