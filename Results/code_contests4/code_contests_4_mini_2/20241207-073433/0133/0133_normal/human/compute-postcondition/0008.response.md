The value of `c` is assigned the value of `math.factorial(n - k)`. However, since `k` is not defined, the expression `n - k` cannot be computed, leading to an error or undefined behavior. The other variables (`n`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6; `a` is the factorial of `n`; `k` is not defined; `b` is not assigned a value due to the undefined `k`, and an error occurs when trying to compute `c`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6; `a` is the factorial of `n`; `k` is not defined; `b` is not assigned a value due to the undefined `k`, and an error occurs when trying to compute `c.**
