The value of `cap` is assigned the value of `sqrt(n)`, where `n` has been updated to `n // i`. The variable `ans` remains unchanged with `i` appended, which does not affect the calculation of `cap`. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `n` and the calculated value of `cap` based on that updated `n`.

Output State: **`n` is updated to `n // i`; `ans` remains unchanged with `i` appended; `cap` is sqrt(n)**
