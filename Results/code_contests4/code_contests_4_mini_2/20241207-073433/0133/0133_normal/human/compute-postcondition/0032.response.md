Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and returns a list of its prime factors. If `n` is equal to 1, it returns a list containing only the integer 1. If `n` is a prime number greater than 1, it returns a list containing `n` itself along with its prime factors. The function does not account for the case when `n` is 1 explicitly in its logic, as it will return an empty list for prime factors of 1, but it does handle that case by returning `[1]` instead.**
