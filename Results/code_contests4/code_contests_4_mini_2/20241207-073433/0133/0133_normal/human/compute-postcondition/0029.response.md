Postcondition: ***`n` is a prime number or 1, `ans` contains all prime factors of the original value of `n` plus `n` if `n` is greater than 1, while `i` remains greater than `cap`, and `cap` is less than or equal to the square root of the original value of `n`. If `n` is 1, the function still maintains the conditions on `ans`, `i`, and `cap`.***
