The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown. The value of `n` is between 4 and 10^6, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 9. However, the execution of `i += 1` does not affect the value of `n`. Therefore, the output state is: variable `i` is increased by 1, and `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6 and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 9.
