The code assigns the value of `cap` to the square root of `n`. Since `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6, the value of `cap` can be calculated as `sqrt(n)`. The previous values of `n`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `cap` based on the current value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6; `i` is 3; `cap` is equal to `sqrt(n)`; `ans` now includes the value 3.**
