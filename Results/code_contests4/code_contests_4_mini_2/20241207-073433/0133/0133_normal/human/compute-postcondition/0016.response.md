The value of `n` is modified by performing integer division with `i`. Given that `i` is 3, the new value of `n` will be `n // 3`. The previous state of `n` was an integer within the range [4, 10^6]. The other variables (`i`, `cap`, `ans`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6, `i` is 3, `cap` is equal to `sqrt(n)`, `ans` now includes the value 3; `n` is modified to `n // 3`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6, `i` is 3, `cap` is equal to `sqrt(n)`, `ans` now includes the value 3; `n` is modified to `n // 3**.
