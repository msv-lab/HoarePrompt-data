The code attempts to assign the value of `b` to the factorial of `k`, but `k` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the value of `b`, and the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6; `a` is the factorial of `n`; `k` is not defined; `b` is not assigned a value due to the undefined `k`.**
