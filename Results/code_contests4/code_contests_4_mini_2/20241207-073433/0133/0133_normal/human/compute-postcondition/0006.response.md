The variable `a` is assigned the value of `math.factorial(n)`, which calculates the factorial of `n`. Since `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^6\), the value of `a` will be the factorial of `n`. The value of `k` does not affect the calculation of `a`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6, and `a` is the factorial of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6; `a` is the factorial of `n`**
