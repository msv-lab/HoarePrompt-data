`n` is updated to `n // i`, where `//` is the integer division operator. The specific value of `n` is reduced by dividing it by `i`, but the exact value of `i` is not specified. Consequently, the new value of `n` will depend on the current value of `i`. The variable `ans` remains unchanged as it is only appended with `i` before this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `n` and the unchanged state of `ans`.

Output State: **`n` is updated to `n // i`; `ans` remains unchanged with `i` appended.**
