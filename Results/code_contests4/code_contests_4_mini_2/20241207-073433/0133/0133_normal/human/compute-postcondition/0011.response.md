The function `func_7` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and `k` is an integer used for combinatorial purposes. 

After executing the function body, the function has three possible return points:
- Case 1: The function returns 1.
- Case 2: The function returns 0.
- Case 3: The function attempts to return 'div', which is not defined, leading to an error due to the absence of a valid value for 'div'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_7` is to accept an integer `n` within the specified range and an integer `k`, and based on certain conditions, it may return 1, 0, or result in an error due to an undefined variable. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` (an integer between 3 and 10^6) and `k` (an integer), and returns 1, 0, or may produce an error due to an undefined variable 'div'.**
