The code `ans.append(n)` adds the value of `n` to the list `ans`. Since `n` is a prime number or 1 and is greater than 1, it will be added to `ans`, which already contains all prime factors of the original value of `n`. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a prime number or 1, `ans` now contains all prime factors of the original value of `n` plus `n`, `i` is greater than `cap`, `cap` is less than or equal to the square root of the original value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a prime number or 1, `ans` now contains all prime factors of the original value of `n` plus `n`, `i` is greater than `cap`, `cap` is less than or equal to the square root of the original value of `n`.**
