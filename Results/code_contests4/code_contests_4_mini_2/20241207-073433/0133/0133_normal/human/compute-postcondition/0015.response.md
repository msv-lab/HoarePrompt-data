The value of `i` is appended to the list `ans`. Since `i` is currently 3, the list `ans` will have 3 added to it. The values of `n` and `cap` remain unchanged, and the other states are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6, `i` is 3, `cap` is equal to `sqrt(n)`, and `ans` now includes the value 3.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6, `i` is 3, `cap` is equal to `sqrt(n)`, `ans` now includes the value 3.**
