Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer parameters, `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and `k`. It returns 1 if `n` is equal to 1 or `k`, returns 0 if `k` is greater than `n`, and attempts to calculate the binomial coefficient C(n, k) using factorials otherwise. However, the code has an issue because the variable 'div' is not defined in the expected return statement, leading to an error if neither of the first two conditions is met. Therefore, the functionality includes returning 1, returning 0, or resulting in an error due to the undefined variable 'div'. **
