The function `func_6` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^6\). If `n` is equal to 1, the function returns a list containing the prime factors of `n` based on specific conditions. If `n` is greater than 1, the function returns a list of all prime factors of `n`, including `n` itself, while maintaining certain conditions on the factors being considered. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_6` is to accept an integer `n` and return a list of prime factors of `n`, including the number itself if applicable, while handling the case where `n` is equal to 1. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n and returns a list containing the prime factors of n, including n itself if n > 1, or the prime factors as per specific conditions if n is 1.**
