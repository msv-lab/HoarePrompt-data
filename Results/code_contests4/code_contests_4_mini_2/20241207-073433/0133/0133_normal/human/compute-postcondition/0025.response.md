Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6. If `n` is divisible by `i`, `n` is updated to `n // i`, `ans` remains unchanged, and `cap` is set to the square root of the updated `n`. If `n` is not divisible by `i`, `i` is increased by 1 and `n` remains an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6, ensuring that for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 9.***
