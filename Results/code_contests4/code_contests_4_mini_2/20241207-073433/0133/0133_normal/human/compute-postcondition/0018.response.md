The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing `i` from 3 to 4. The values of `n` and `cap` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6, `i` is 4, `cap` is equal to `sqrt(n)` and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 9 if `i` is 4.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6, `i` is 4, `cap` is equal to `sqrt(n)` and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 9 if `i` is 4.**
