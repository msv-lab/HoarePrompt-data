The code `ans.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `ans`. The value of `i` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the specific value being appended. However, the initial state indicates that `n` is an integer and does not directly affect the operation of appending `i` to `ans`. Since the execution of this code only changes the contents of the list `ans` by adding `i`, we conclude that:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6; `i` is appended to `ans`.**
