According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `cap`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `cap`. At the end of the last iteration, `cap` is equal to `sqrt(n)`, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 9. Given that `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6, if `n` is less than 9, `cap` will be less than 3, meaning `i` would need to be less than or equal to `cap` for the loop to execute again.

Since `n` is currently in the range of 4 to 10^6 and has to be at least 9 for the loop to execute again, we can infer that `n` needs to be adjusted to be at least 9. The variable `i` also needs to be checked against `cap` to determine if it can maintain its value for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6 and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 9**
