Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to calculate the number of cyclic permutations of length n as described in the problem statement.

1. The code calculates the factorial of n (`ans` variable) and then subtracts `2 ** (n - 1)` from it. The logic behind this subtraction and its relation to counting cyclic permutations is not justified or explained in the code. The number of cyclic permutations is not merely the factorial of n minus some power of 2.

2. The problem specifies that the output should be the number of cyclic permutations, which requires a more complex combinatorial approach that accounts for the cycles formed in the graph described. The provided solution does not seem to incorporate this logic.

3. For example, if we take `n = 4`, the expected output according to the problem statement is `16`, but the provided code would compute a different value due to the incorrect logic. The calculation of the number of cyclic permutations is not simply based on factorial or a linear combination of factorials.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements outlined in the problem description, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
