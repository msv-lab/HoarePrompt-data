Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly read the input as specified in the problem description. The problem states that the input will be given in the format "A B" on a single line, but the program attempts to read two separate integers using two `input()` calls. 

For example, if the input is:
```
3 1
```
The program will not work correctly because it expects two separate lines of input. Instead, it should read the input in one line and then split the input string to extract both integers.

This discrepancy means that the program will fail to handle the input correctly, leading to potential errors when running with the provided input format. Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
