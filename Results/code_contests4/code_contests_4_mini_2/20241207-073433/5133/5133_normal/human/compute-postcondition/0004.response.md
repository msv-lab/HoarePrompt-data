The variable `e` is assigned the value of `a * b`, using the values of the input integers `a` and `b`. The values of `A` and `B` remain unchanged, while `c` and `d` are already assigned the values of `a + b` and `a - b`, respectively. Therefore, the output state reflects the new assignment for `e`.

Output State: **`A` and `B` are integers such that -1000 <= A, B <= 1000; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `c` is assigned the value of `a + b`; `d` is assigned the value of `a - b`; `e` is assigned the value of `a * b`.**
