The code prints the maximum value of `ary`, which has been previously assigned the list `[c, d, e]`. The values of `c`, `d`, and `e` are determined by the input integers `a` and `b`. The value of `f` is assigned the maximum value from the list `ary`. 

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we cannot determine the specific values for `c`, `d`, `e`, or `f`. However, we can describe the output state in terms of the variables involved.

Output State: **`A` and `B` are integers such that -1000 <= A, B <= 1000; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `c` is assigned the value of `a + b`; `d` is assigned the value of `a - b`; `e` is assigned the value of `a * b`; `ary` is assigned the list [c, d, e]; `f` is assigned the maximum value from `ary`; 'Max:' is printed followed by the value of `f`.**
