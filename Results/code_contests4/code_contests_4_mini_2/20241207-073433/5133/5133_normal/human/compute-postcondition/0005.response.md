The variable `ary` is assigned a list containing the values of `c`, `d`, and `e`. The values of `c`, `d`, and `e` were previously calculated based on the input integers `a` and `b`. Therefore, after the execution, `ary` will contain the results of `a + b`, `a - b`, and `a * b`. The values of `A` and `B` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this snippet.

Output State: **`A` and `B` are integers such that -1000 <= A, B <= 1000; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `c` is assigned the value of `a + b`; `d` is assigned the value of `a - b`; `e` is assigned the value of `a * b`; `ary` is assigned the list [c, d, e].**
