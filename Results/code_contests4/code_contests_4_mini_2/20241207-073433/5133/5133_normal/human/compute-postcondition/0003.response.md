The variable `d` is assigned the value of `a - b`. Since `a` and `b` are input integers, the specific values of `a` and `b` are not provided. Therefore, `d` will depend on the specific input values of `a` and `b`. The states of the other variables (`A`, `B`, and `c`) are not affected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`A` and `B` are integers such that -1000 <= A, B <= 1000; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `c` is assigned the value of `a + b`; `d` is assigned the value of `a - b`.**
