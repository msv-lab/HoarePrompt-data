Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not properly read the input values for A and B. Instead of reading both integers from a single line input as specified in the problem description, it reads them separately using two calls to `input()`. This will result in an error when trying to provide both integers on one line, as the program expects one integer per line.

Additionally, the output format does not match the requirements. The problem description states that the output should be the largest value among A+B, A-B, and AÃ—B, but the program prefixes the output with 'Max:', which is not specified in the problem description.

A corrected version of the program should read the input as a single line, split the input to extract both A and B, and directly print the largest value without any additional text.
