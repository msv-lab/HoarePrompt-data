Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, the function `func` incorrectly reads the inputs for integers A and B. It uses `int(input())` twice, which expects two separate lines of input, while the problem description specifies that A and B should be provided on a single line, separated by a space.

The correct way to read the input should be:
```python
a, b = map(int, input().split())
```
This modification would correctly read both integers from a single line.

Additionally, the output does not align with the expected output format specified in the problem description. The program prints "Max:" followed by the maximum value, while the problem description states that it should just print the largest value among A + B, A - B, and A Ã— B without any additional text.

Therefore, because of these discrepancies, the program does not correctly implement the problem requirements in every potential case.
