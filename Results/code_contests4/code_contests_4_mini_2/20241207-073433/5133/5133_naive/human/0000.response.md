Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not correctly read input as specified in the problem description. It uses `int(input())` twice, which expects two separate lines of input. However, the problem states that the input is given in a single line formatted as "A B". This will lead to a ValueError when the input is provided in the specified format. 

For example, if the input is `3 1`, the program will fail to execute correctly due to the incorrect handling of input, which is a case where it does not work as expected. Thus, the program is incorrect.
