To analyze the program, we need to consider the requirements outlined in the problem description and how the provided code attempts to fulfill those requirements.

The goal is to determine how many unique pairs of toys (a, b) exist such that:

1. The cost of the i-th toy is i burles.
2. The total cost of the selected toys is k burles.
3. Pairs (a, b) and (b, a) are considered equal, and a must not equal b.

Let's review the provided code:

```python
def func_1():
    arr = list(map(int, raw_input().strip().split(' ')))
    return arr
(n, k) = map(int, raw_input().strip().split(' '))
if n >= k:
    x = k - 1
    print(max(0, x // 2))
else:
    l = k - n
    l = n - l + 1
    print(max(0, l // 2))
```

### Analysis of the Code

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The first line reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Logic**:
   - If `n >= k`, the code computes the maximum number of pairs as `max(0, (k-1) // 2)`. This seems to handle the case where the total cost is less than or equal to the number of toys.
   - If `n < k`, the code computes `l = k - n` and then determines the number of pairs based on this value. It then computes `max(0, (n - l + 1) // 2)`.

### Edge Cases

Let's consider a few edge cases to see if the program handles them correctly:

1. **Case when `n = 1` and `k = 2`**:
   - Only one toy (cost 1) and we need a pair that sums to 2. The expected output is 0, as no valid pairs exist.
   - The program will output 0 correctly.

2. **Case when `n = 10` and `k = 11`**:
   - The pairs that sum to 11 are (1, 10), (2, 9), (3, 8), (4, 7), and (5, 6). There are 5 valid pairs.
   - The program should correctly compute this.

3. **Case when `n = 8` and `k = 5`**:
   - The valid pairs are (1, 4) and (2, 3). The expected output is 2.
   - The program will output 2 correctly.

4. **Case when `n = 7` and `k = 20`**:
   - The valid pairs would need to sum to 20, but the maximum sum from the toys is 7 + 6 = 13. The expected output is 0.
   - The program will output 0 correctly.

5. **Case when `n = 1000000000000` and `k = 1000000000001`**:
   - The valid pairs are (1, 1000000000000), (2, 999999999999), ..., (500000000000, 500000000001). The expected output is 500000000000.
   - The program will output 500000000000 correctly.

### Conclusion

After reviewing the code and checking various edge cases, it seems that the program correctly computes the number of valid pairs for all tested inputs according to the problem description.

Thus, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
