The code reads a line of input, strips any surrounding whitespace, splits the string into a list of substrings using spaces as a delimiter, and then converts each substring into an integer. This results in `arr` being assigned a list of integers based on the input. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 â‰¤ n, k â‰¤ 10^14; `arr` is a list of integers from input.**
