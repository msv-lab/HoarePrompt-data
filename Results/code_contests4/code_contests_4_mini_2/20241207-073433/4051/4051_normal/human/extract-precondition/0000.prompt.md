You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: Tanechka is shopping in the toy shop. There are exactly n toys in the shop for sale, the cost of the i-th toy is i burles. She wants to choose two toys in such a way that their total cost is k burles. How many ways to do that does she have?

Each toy appears in the shop exactly once. Pairs (a, b) and (b, a) are considered equal. Pairs (a, b), where a=b, are not allowed.

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n, k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{14}) — the number of toys and the expected total cost of the pair of toys.

Output

Print the number of ways to choose the pair of toys satisfying the condition above. Print 0, if Tanechka can choose no pair of toys in such a way that their total cost is k burles.

Examples

Input

8 5


Output

2


Input

8 15


Output

1


Input

7 20


Output

0


Input

1000000000000 1000000000001


Output

500000000000

Note

In the first example Tanechka can choose the pair of toys (1, 4) or the pair of toys (2, 3).

In the second example Tanechka can choose only the pair of toys (7, 8).

In the third example choosing any pair of toys will lead to the total cost less than 20. So the answer is 0.

In the fourth example she can choose the following pairs: (1, 1000000000000), (2, 999999999999), (3, 999999999998), ..., (500000000000, 500000000001). The number of such pairs is exactly 500000000000.
Function definition:
```
def func_1():
```
