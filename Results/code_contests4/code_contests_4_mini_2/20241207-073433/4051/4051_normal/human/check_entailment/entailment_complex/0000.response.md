Correctness: **False**

The annotated program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. The problem asks for a function that computes the number of ways Tanechka can choose two toys such that their total cost equals k. However, the provided program only reads input values and returns them as a list. 

Key points of failure:
1. **Input Handling**: The program is meant to read two integers (n and k) from input, but it does not perform any calculations regarding the number of pairs of toys that meet the condition.
2. **Logic Implementation**: There is no logic in the code to compute the pairs of toys based on the cost k, as described in the problem. The program lacks the necessary calculations to determine how many valid pairs (a, b) exist such that a + b = k and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n.
3. **Output**: The function does not produce the required output (the number of ways to select pairs) but rather just returns the input values in a list format.

Therefore, the program does not conform to the problem description and does not provide the required functionality.
