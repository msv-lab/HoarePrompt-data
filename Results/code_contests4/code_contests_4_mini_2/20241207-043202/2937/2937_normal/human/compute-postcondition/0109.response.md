The code `exit(0)` terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables `res`, `n`, and `rep` do not change since the program exits before any further execution. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of the variables along with the fact that the program is terminating.

Output State: **`res` is the count of inputs that are either less than 18 or are one of the specified alcoholic beverages; `n` is within the range of 1 to 100; `rep` is equal to `n - 1` after all iterations; and the program is terminating.**
