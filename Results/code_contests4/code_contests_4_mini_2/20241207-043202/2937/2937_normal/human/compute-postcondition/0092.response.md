`res` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `res` is an integer, but it is not specified. Therefore, after execution, `res` will be one unit greater than its initial value. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`res` is an integer increased by 1, `rep` is set to 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `inp` is an input string.**
