`res` is assigned the value `res + 1`. The previous value of `res` is 0, so after execution, `res` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is 1, `n` is within the range of 1 to 100, `rep` is 0, `inp` is an input string that is equal to 'BEER'.

Output State: **`res` is 1, `n` is within the range of 1 to 100, `rep` is 0, `inp` is 'BEER'**
