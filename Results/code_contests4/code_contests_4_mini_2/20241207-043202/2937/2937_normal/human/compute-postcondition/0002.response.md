According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Given that `n` is an integer input within the range of 1 to 100, the loop will execute since `n` is guaranteed to be at least 1. At the start of the loop, the variable `rep` will take on the initial value of 0 during the first iteration. The `res` variable is not directly related to the loop execution, but it is initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

State: **`res` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is within the range of 1 to 100, `rep` is 0**
