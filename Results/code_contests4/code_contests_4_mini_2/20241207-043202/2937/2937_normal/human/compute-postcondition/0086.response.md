The value of `res` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `res` is unknown, but it is an integer. The other variables `rep` and `n` remain unchanged, with `rep` being 1 and `n` being greater than 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is an integer, `rep` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and `res` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`res` is an integer, `rep` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and `res` is increased by 1**
