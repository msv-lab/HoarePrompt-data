Postcondition: ***`res` is 1 if the first character of `inp` is a digit and the integer value of `inp` is less than 18, otherwise `res` remains unchanged. If the first character of `inp` is not a digit, then `res` is 1 if `inp` is 'ABSINTH' or any of the alcoholic beverages listed; for 'GIN' or 'RUM', `res` is also set to 1. The variable `n` remains within the range of 1 to 100, `rep` remains 0, and `inp` remains unchanged unless it is 'GIN' or 'RUM'.***
