Postcondition: ***`res` is 1 if `inp` is 'GIN' or 'RUM', or if `inp` is one of 'SAKE', 'TEQUILA', 'VODKA', 'WISKEY', or 'WINE'. Otherwise, `res` remains 0. The variable `n` remains within the range of 1 to 100, `rep` remains 0, and `inp` remains unchanged except when it is 'GIN' or 'RUM', in which case `res` is set to 1.***
