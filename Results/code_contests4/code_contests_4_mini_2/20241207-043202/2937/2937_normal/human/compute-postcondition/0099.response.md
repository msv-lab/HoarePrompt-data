Postcondition: ***`res` is an integer increased by 1 if `inp` is 'SAKE'. If `inp` is 'TEQUILA', `res` is increased by 1. If `inp` is 'VODKA', `res` is increased by 1 while `rep` is set to 1, and `n` remains greater than 1. If `inp` is not 'VODKA', `rep` is set to 1 and `n` is greater than 1; if `inp` is 'WISKEY', the values of `res`, `rep`, and `n` remain unchanged. If `inp` is not 'WISKEY', `res` is incremented by 1 if `inp` is not equal to 'WINE' and remains unchanged otherwise, while `rep` is still set to 1 and `n` remains greater than 1.***
