`res` is incremented by 1, and since `res` is initially 0, after execution, `res` becomes 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is 1, `n` is within the range of 1 to 100, `rep` is 0, `inp` is an input string that is equal to 'TEQUILA'.

Output State: **`res` is 1, `n` is within the range of 1 to 100, `rep` is 0, `inp` is an input string that is equal to 'TEQUILA'**
