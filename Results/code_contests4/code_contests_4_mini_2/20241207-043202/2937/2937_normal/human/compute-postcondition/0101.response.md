Postcondition: ***`res` is an integer that is incremented by 1 if `inp` is 'GIN'. If `inp` is 'RUM', `res` is incremented by 1. If `inp` is 'SAKE', 'TEQUILA', or 'VODKA', `res` is also increased by 1. If `inp` is 'VODKA', `rep` is set to 1, and `n` remains greater than 1. If `inp` is not 'VODKA', `rep` is set to 1, and `n` still remains greater than 1. If `inp` is 'WISKEY', the values of `res`, `rep`, and `n` remain unchanged. If `inp` is not 'WISKEY', `res` is incremented by 1 if `inp` is not 'WINE' and remains unchanged otherwise, while `rep` is still set to 1 and `n` is greater than 1.***
