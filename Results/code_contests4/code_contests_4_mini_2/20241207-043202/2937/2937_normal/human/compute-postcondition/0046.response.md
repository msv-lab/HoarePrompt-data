Postcondition: ***`res` is 1 if `inp` is 'RUM'. If `inp` is 'SAKE', 'TEQUILA', 'VODKA', 'WISKEY', or 'WINE', then `res` is also set to 1, while `n` remains within the range of 1 to 100, and `rep` remains 0. If `inp` does not match any of these values, `res` remains 0, `n` is still within the range of 1 to 100, `rep` remains 0, and `inp` is unchanged.***
