`res` is assigned the value of `res + 1`. Since the initial value of `res` is 0, after execution, `res` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is 1, `n` is within the range of 1 to 100, `rep` is 0, `inp` is 'WISKEY'.
Output State: **`res` is 1, `n` is within the range of 1 to 100, `rep` is 0, `inp` is 'WISKEY'**
