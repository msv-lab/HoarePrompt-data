Postcondition: ***`res` is an integer, `rep` is set to 1, `n` is greater than 1, and if `inp` is 'ABSINTH', `res` is increased by 1. If `inp` is 'BEER', `res` is incremented by 1. If `inp` is 'BRANDY', 'CHAMPAGNE', 'GIN', 'RUM', 'SAKE', or 'TEQUILA', `res` is also increased by 1. If `inp` is 'VODKA', `rep` remains 1 and `n` stays greater than 1. If `inp` is 'WISKEY', the values of `res`, `rep`, and `n` remain unchanged. For any other input not equal to 'WISKEY', if `inp` is not 'WINE', `res` is incremented by 1, while `rep` is set to 1 and `n` remains greater than 1.***
