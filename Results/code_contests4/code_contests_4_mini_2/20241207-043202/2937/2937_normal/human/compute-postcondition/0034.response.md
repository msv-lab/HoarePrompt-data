`res` is incremented by 1, and since its initial value is 0, `res` becomes 1. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is 1, `n` is within the range of 1 to 100, `rep` is 0, `inp` is equal to 'VODKA'.

Output State: **`res` is 1, `n` is within the range of 1 to 100, `rep` is 0, `inp` is equal to 'VODKA'**
