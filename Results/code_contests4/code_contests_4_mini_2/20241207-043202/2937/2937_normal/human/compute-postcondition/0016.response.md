`res` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `res` is 0, so after execution, `res` becomes 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is 1, `n` is within the range of 1 to 100, `rep` is 0, `inp` is an input string not starting with a character between '0' and '9', `inp` is not equal to 'ABSINTH', `inp` is not equal to 'BEER', and `inp` is equal to 'BRANDY'.
