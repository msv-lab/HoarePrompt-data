Postcondition: ***`res` is an integer that is incremented by 1 if `inp` starts with a digit and `int(inp) < 18`. If `inp` is 'ABSINTH', 'BEER', 'BRANDY', 'CHAMPAGNE', 'GIN', 'RUM', 'SAKE', or 'TEQUILA', `res` is also increased by 1. If `inp` is 'VODKA', `rep` remains 1 and `n` stays greater than 1. If `inp` is 'WISKEY', the values of `res`, `rep`, and `n` remain unchanged. For any other input not equal to 'WISKEY' and not 'WINE', `res` is incremented by 1, while `rep` is set to 1 and `n` remains greater than 1. `rep` is set to 1 and `n` is greater than 1 throughout the execution.***
