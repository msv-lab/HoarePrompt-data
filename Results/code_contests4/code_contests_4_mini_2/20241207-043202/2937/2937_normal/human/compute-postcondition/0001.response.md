The variable `res` is initialized and assigned the value of `0`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer input within the range of 1 to 100; `res` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input within the range of 1 to 100; `res` is 0**
