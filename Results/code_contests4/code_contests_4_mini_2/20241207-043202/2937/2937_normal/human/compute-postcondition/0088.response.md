The value of `res` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `res` is unknown. The values of `rep` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is an integer (now incremented by 1), `rep` is set to 1, `n` must be greater than 1.

Output State: **`res` is an integer (now incremented by 1), `rep` is set to 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
