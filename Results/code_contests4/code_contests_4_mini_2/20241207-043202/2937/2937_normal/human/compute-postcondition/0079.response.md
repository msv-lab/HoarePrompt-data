Postcondition: ***`res` is an integer. If the first character of `inp` is a digit and the integer value of `inp` is less than 18, `res` is incremented by 1, `rep` is set to 1, and `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute a second time. If the first character of `inp` is not a digit, `res` remains unchanged unless `inp` is 'ABSINTH', which increments `res` by 1 and sets `rep` to 1 if `n` is greater than 1. If `inp` is 'BEER', `res` is set to 2. If `inp` is 'BRANDY' or 'CHAMPAGNE', `res` is incremented by 1. If `inp` is 'GIN' or 'RUM', `res` is incremented by 1 and `rep` is set to 1 if `n` is greater than 1. If `inp` is 'SAKE', 'TEQUILA', or 'VODKA', `res` is incremented by 1 and `rep` is set to 1 for the loop to execute again if `n` is greater than 1. If `inp` is 'WISKEY', `res` is set to 2. If `inp` is 'WINE', `res` is incremented by 1 and `rep` is set to 1 for the loop to execute a second time if `n` is greater than 1. If `inp` is not one of the specified beverages, `res`, `rep`, and `n` remain unchanged.***
