Postcondition: ***`res` is 1, `n` is within the range of 1 to 100, `rep` is 0, `inp` is an input string from raw_input(), the first character of `inp` is a digit (between '0' and '9'), and if the integer value of `inp` is less than 18, then `res` is set to 1. Otherwise, the program does not alter the value of `res`.***
