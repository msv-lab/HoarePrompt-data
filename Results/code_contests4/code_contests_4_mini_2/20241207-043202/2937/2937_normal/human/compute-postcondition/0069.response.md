Postcondition: ***`res` is 2 if `inp` is 'WISKEY'; if `inp` is 'WINE', `res` is increased by 1, while `rep` is set to 1 allowing the loop to execute a second time if `n` is greater than 1. If `inp` is neither 'WISKEY' nor 'WINE', `res` remains unchanged, and the values of `rep` and `n` are unaffected.***
