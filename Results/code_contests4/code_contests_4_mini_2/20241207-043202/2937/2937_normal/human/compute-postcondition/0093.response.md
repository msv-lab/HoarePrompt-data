The value of `res` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `res` is unknown, but it remains an integer. The other variables `rep` and `n` are unaffected, and `inp` being a string does not impact the calculation. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is an integer, `rep` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1.

Output State: **`res` is an integer, `rep` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
