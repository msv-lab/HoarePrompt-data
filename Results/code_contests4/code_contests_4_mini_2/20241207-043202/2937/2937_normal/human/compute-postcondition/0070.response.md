Postcondition: ***`res` is increased by 1 if `inp` is 'VODKA', and `rep` is set to 1 allowing the loop to execute a second time if `n` is greater than 1. If `inp` is 'WISKEY', then `res` is set to 2. If `inp` is 'WINE', `res` is increased by 1 and `rep` is set to 1 allowing the loop to execute a second time if `n` is greater than 1. If `inp` is neither 'VODKA', 'WISKEY', nor 'WINE', `res` remains unchanged, and the values of `rep` and `n` are unaffected.***
