The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, but it processes a series of inputs based on predefined constraints. It expects an integer `n` indicating the number of subsequent lines, where each of those lines can either be an integer representing an age (ranging from 0 to 1000) or a string representing a drink (with a length between 1 and 100) consisting of capital Latin letters. The function checks the drinks against a defined list of alcoholic beverages.

Based on the outputs defined within the function, it will handle the input in the following way:

- If the input is an age, it may return a corresponding message based on the age.
- If the input is a drink, it may return a message indicating whether the drink is alcoholic or not based on the defined list.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process a list of inputs where each input is either an age or a drink, and return appropriate messages based on whether the input is an age or a drink, while also checking for the alcohol content of the drinks.

Functionality: **The function processes a specified number of inputs, returning messages based on whether the input is an age or a drink, and checking if drinks are alcoholic based on a predefined list.**
