`res` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `res` is unknown as it is described only as an integer. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is an integer, `rep` is set to 1, `n` must be greater than 1, and `res` has been incremented by 1.

Output State: **`res` is an integer, `rep` is set to 1, `n` must be greater than 1, and `res` has been incremented by 1.**
