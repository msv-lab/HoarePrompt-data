Postcondition: ***`res` is 1 and `inp` is 'SAKE'. If `inp` is 'TEQUILA', `res` is set to 1, while `n` remains within the range of 1 to 100, and `rep` remains 0. If `inp` is 'VODKA', then `res` is set to 1, `n` still remains within the range of 1 to 100, and `rep` remains 0. If `inp` is 'WISKEY', then `res` is set to 1, `n` remains within the range of 1 to 100, `rep` remains 0, and `inp` updates to 'WISKEY'. If `inp` is 'WINE', then `res` is set to 1, `n` remains within the range of 1 to 100, `rep` remains 0, and `inp` updates to 'WINE'. Otherwise, `res` remains 0, `n` is still within the range of 1 to 100, `rep` remains 0, and `inp` is unchanged.***
