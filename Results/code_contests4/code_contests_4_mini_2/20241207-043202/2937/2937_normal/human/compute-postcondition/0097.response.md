Postcondition: ***`res` is an integer. If `inp` is equal to 'VODKA', `res` is increased by 1, while `rep` is set to 1 and `n` remains greater than 1. If `inp` is not 'VODKA', then `rep` is set to 1 and `n` is greater than 1; if `inp` equals 'WISKEY', the values of `res`, `rep`, and `n` remain unchanged. If `inp` is not 'WISKEY', `res` is incremented by 1, and if `inp` is equal to 'WINE', `res` is incremented by an additional 1; otherwise, `res` remains unchanged while `rep` is still set to 1 and `n` remains greater than 1.***
