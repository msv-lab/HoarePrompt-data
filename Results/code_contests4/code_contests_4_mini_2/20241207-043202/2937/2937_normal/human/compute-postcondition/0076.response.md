Postcondition: ***`res` is incremented by 1 if `inp` is 'BRANDY'. If `inp` is 'CHAMPAGNE', `res` is also incremented by 1. If `inp` is 'GIN' or 'RUM', `res` is incremented by 1 and `rep` is set to 1, allowing the loop to execute a second time if `n` is greater than 1. If `inp` is 'SAKE', 'TEQUILA', or 'VODKA', `res` is incremented by 1 and `rep` is set to 1 for the loop to execute again if `n` is greater than 1. If `inp` is 'WISKEY', `res` is set to 2. If `inp` is 'WINE', `res` is incremented by 1 and `rep` is set to 1 for the loop to execute a second time if `n` is greater than 1. If `inp` is not one of the specified beverages, `res` remains unchanged, and the values of `rep` and `n` are unaffected.***
