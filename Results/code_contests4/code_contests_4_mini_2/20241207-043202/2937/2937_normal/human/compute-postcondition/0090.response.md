The value of `res` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `res` is unknown, but it is an integer. The values of the other variables are not affected, so the output state reflects that `res` has been increased by 1. 

Output State: **`res` is an integer increased by 1, `rep` is set to 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `inp` is an input string**
