The value of `res` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `res` is unknown. The values of `rep`, `n`, and `inp` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is an integer (increased by 1), `rep` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `inp` is an input string.

Output State: **`res` is an integer (increased by 1), `rep` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `inp` is an input string**
