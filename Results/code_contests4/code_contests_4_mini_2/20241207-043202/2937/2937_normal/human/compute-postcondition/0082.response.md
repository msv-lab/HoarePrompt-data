`res` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `res` is unknown since it is just stated as an integer. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `res` is an integer incremented by 1, `rep` is set to 1, `n` must be greater than 1, and `inp` is an input string.

Output State: **`res` is an integer incremented by 1, `rep` is set to 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `inp` is an input string**
