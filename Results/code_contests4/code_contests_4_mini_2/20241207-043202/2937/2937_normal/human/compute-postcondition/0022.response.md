The variable `res` is incremented by 1. Initially, `res` is 0, so after execution, `res` becomes 1. The other variables (`n`, `rep`, `inp`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is 1, `n` is within the range of 1 to 100, `rep` is 0, `inp` is 'GIN'.

Output State: **`res` is 1, `n` is within the range of 1 to 100, `rep` is 0, `inp` is 'GIN'**
