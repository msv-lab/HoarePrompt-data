Postcondition: ***`res` is 1, `n` is within the range of 1 to 100, and `rep` is 0 if `inp` is 'TEQUILA'. If `inp` is 'VODKA', then `res` is 1, `n` remains within the range of 1 to 100, and `rep` is 0. If `inp` is 'WISKEY', then `res` is 1, `n` remains within the range of 1 to 100, `rep` is 0, and `inp` is 'WISKEY'. If `inp` is 'WINE', then `res` is 1, `n` remains within the range of 1 to 100, `rep` is 0, and `inp` is 'WINE'. Otherwise, `res` remains 0, `n` is still within the range of 1 to 100, `rep` remains 0, and `inp` is unchanged.***
