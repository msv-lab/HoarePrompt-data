Postcondition: ***`res` is an integer, `rep` is set to 1, `n` is greater than 1, and `inp` is a string. If `inp` is equal to 'WISKEY', the values of `res`, `rep`, and `n` remain unchanged. If `inp` is not 'WISKEY', then `res` is incremented by 1. If `inp` is equal to 'WINE', `res` is incremented by an additional 1; otherwise, `res` remains unchanged while `rep` is still set to 1 and `n` remains greater than 1.***
