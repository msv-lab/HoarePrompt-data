The value of `res` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `res` becomes 1. The values of `n`, `rep`, and `inp` remain unchanged since they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is 1, `n` is within the range of 1 to 100, `rep` is 0, `inp` is 'ABSINTH'.

Output State: **`res` is 1, `n` is within the range of 1 to 100, `rep` is 0, `inp` is 'ABSINTH'**
