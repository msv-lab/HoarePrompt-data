The value of `res` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `res` is unknown, but it is an integer. The states of the other variables (`rep`, `n`, and `inp`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is an integer (incremented by 1), `rep` is set to 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `inp` is an input string.

Output State: **`res` is an integer (incremented by 1), `rep` is set to 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `inp` is an input string**
