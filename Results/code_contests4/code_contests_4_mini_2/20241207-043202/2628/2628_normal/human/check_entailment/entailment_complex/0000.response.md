Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic required to meet the problem description. Here are the issues identified:

1. **Logic for Determining Shared Number**: The program attempts to determine the shared number but does so incorrectly. The conditions under which it prints the answer do not ensure that it correctly identifies the unique shared number. Instead, it just checks if the counts from `A` or `B` are equal to 1, which does not guarantee that the unique shared number is found correctly.

2. **Handling of Answer Cases**: According to the problem description, if both participants have a number that they know, but the verifier cannot deduce it uniquely, the function should return `0`. The program does not adequately check for all scenarios where the participants might know the shared number, leading to incorrect output.

3. **Insufficient Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where `n` or `m` could be zero or when there might be multiple valid shared numbers leading to ambiguity. The use of `exit()` to terminate the program on conflicting conditions is also not a good practice and does not provide a proper return value as specified in the problem description.

4. **Final Output Logic**: The logic to determine the final output (printing `ans`, `0`, or `-1`) does not consider all possible conditions specified in the problem description accurately. The checks for the sums of `A` and `B` do not correlate properly to the unique shared number requirement.

In summary, the program fails to implement the logical conditions necessary to accurately reflect the requirements of the problem description. It lacks proper handling of various scenarios and does not guarantee that the shared number is determined correctly, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
