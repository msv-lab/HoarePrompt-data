The function accepts two integers, `n` and `m`, representing the number of distinct pairs communicated by two participants. It processes these pairs and counts matches based on specific conditions. If exactly one match is found among the pairs, it prints the corresponding number from the match; otherwise, it prints 0. If any conflicting conditions are detected during the matching process, the function exits with -1. The function does not handle cases where `n` or `m` is zero, which could potentially lead to unhandled edge cases.
