Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `b[i]`, `j` is 2, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `a[2]`. If `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, `B[i][0]` is increased by 1, and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.***
