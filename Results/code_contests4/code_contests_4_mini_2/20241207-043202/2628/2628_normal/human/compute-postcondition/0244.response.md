Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `b[i]`, `j` is 0, and the sets of `b[i]` and `a[j]` are not equal. If `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, -1 is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1, and `B[i][1]` is now equal to `x1`. Additionally, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `a[0]`, and either `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`.***
