The variable `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. The initial state indicates that `y1` is assigned from `a[0]`, and since `y1` has a specific value from that assignment, we can state the value of `A[i][1]` after execution. The initial states of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values from `a[0]`, `m` is greater than 1, `j` is 1; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[1]; A[i][0] is incremented by 1; A[i][1] is assigned the value of y1.**
