The variable `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. Since `y1` is defined as `a[2][1]`, `A[i][1]` now reflects this value. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `x1` is `a[2][0]`, `y1` is `a[2][1]`, `m` is greater than 0, `A[i][0]` is increased by 1, `A[i][1]` is now equal to `y1`, `j` is 1, `x2` is `b[1][0]`, `y2` is `b[1][1]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `x1` is `a[2][0]`, `y1` is `a[2][1]`, `m` is greater than 0, `A[i][0]` is increased by 1, `A[i][1]` is now equal to `y1`, `j` is 1, `x2` is `b[1][0]`, `y2` is `b[1][1]`**
