The code `exit()` terminates the execution of the program. No variables are modified, and the program simply exits without returning a value. Therefore, the Output State reflects that the program has exited.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `x1` is `a[2][0]`, `y1` is `a[2][1]`, `m` is greater than 0, `A[i][0]` reflects the count of how many times the conditions were satisfied during the loop, `A[i][1]` reflects the last assigned value based on the conditions met during the loop, `j` is 1, `x2` is `b[1][0]`, `y2` is `b[1][1]`, and -1 has been printed. Program execution has been terminated.**
