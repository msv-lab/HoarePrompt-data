The code `exit()` is executed, which terminates the program immediately. This means that none of the variable states will be affected after this point, and the program will stop running without any further computation. Therefore, the Output State remains unchanged, and the previously printed value of -1 is retained.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 0, `A[i][0]` reflects the count of how many times the conditions were satisfied during the loop, `A[i][1]` reflects the last assigned value based on the conditions met during the loop, `j` is 2, `x1` is `a[2][0]`, `y1` is `a[2][1]`, `x2` is `b[2][0]`, `y2` is `b[2][1]` and -1 has been printed to the output.**
