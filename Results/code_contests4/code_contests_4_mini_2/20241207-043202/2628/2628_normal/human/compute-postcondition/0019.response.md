Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values from `a[0]`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[0]`. The sets of elements in `a[i]` and `b[j]` are not equal. Either `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`. If `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, the output is -1. Otherwise, `A[i][1]` becomes equal to `x1`.***
