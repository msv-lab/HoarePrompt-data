Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values from `a[0]`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[0]`. The set of elements in `a[i]` is not equal to the set of elements in `b[j]`. Either `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`. The value of `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`.***
