The code `exit()` is executed, which terminates the program. As a result, the values of the variables do not change, but the program stops running. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `b[i]`, `j` is 2, `x2`, `y2` are now assigned values from `a[2]`, and -1 is printed. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `b[i]`, `j` is 2, `x2`, `y2` are now assigned values from `a[2]`, and -1 is printed.**
