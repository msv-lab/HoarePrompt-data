The code `exit()` terminates the program immediately without modifying any variable values. Therefore, the output state reflects the condition of the variables prior to the termination of the program.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `b[i]`, `j` is 1, `x2` and `y2` are assigned new values from `a[j]`, and the sets created from `b[i]` and `a[j]` are not equal; -1 is printed.**
