Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `b[i]`, `j` is 0, and the sets of `b[i]` and `a[j]` are not equal. If `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, then if `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `B[i][1]` is not equal to `y1`, the program prints -1 and exits without further changes. Otherwise, `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1, and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`, making `B[i][1]` now equal to `y1`. If the condition is not met, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
