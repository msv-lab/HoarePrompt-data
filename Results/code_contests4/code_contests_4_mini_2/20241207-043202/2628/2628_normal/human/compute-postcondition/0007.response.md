According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. The variable `i` will start from 0 at the beginning of the loop. 

Since `n` is assigned from input, we need to ensure that it has a value greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
