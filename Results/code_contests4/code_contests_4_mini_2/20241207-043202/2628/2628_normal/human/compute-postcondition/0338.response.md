The code assigns the value of `y1` to the element `B[i][1]`. The variable `i` is 2, so the assignment affects the element `B[2][1]`. The previous values of `n`, `j`, and the element `B[2][0]` do not impact this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 3; `B[2][0]` is increased by 1, and `B[2][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 3; `B[2][0]` is increased by 1, `B[2][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.**
