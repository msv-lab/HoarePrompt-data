The variable `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. Since `x1` has been previously assigned a value from `b[2]`, the output state reflects that `B[i][1]` now holds that value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `b[2]`, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `a[j]`, the sets of `b[i]` and `a[j]` are not equal, either `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`, and `B[i][1]` is now equal to `x1`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `b[2]`, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `a[j]`, the sets of `b[i]` and `a[j]` are not equal, either `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`, and `B[i][1]` is equal to `x1`.**
