The code `exit()` is called, which terminates the program immediately. As a result, no changes are made to the state of the variables since we exit the program before any further execution can occur. Therefore, the Output State retains the initial values.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values from `a[0]`, `m` is greater than 1, `j` is 2; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[2]` and -1 is printed.**
