Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 0. If `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`, then if `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, `-1` has been printed. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is increased by 1 and `A[i][1]` becomes equal to `A[2][0]`. If `x1` is not equal to `x2` and `x1` is not equal to `y2`, then if `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, and if `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, `-1` has been printed. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is increased by 1 and `A[i][1]` becomes equal to `y1`, while the values of `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` remain unchanged.***
