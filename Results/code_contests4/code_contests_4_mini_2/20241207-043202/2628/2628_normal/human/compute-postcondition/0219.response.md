The code `exit()` is called, which terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change as the program exits before any further processing. Therefore, the output state will indicate that we are exiting the program without any changes to the variable values.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `b[i]`, `j` is 2, `x2` and `y2` are assigned new values from `a[j]`, and the sets created from `b[i]` and `a[j]` are not equal; and -1 is printed, and we exit the program.**
