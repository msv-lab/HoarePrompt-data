The values of `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values from the array `a` at index `i`. Since `i` is 1, `x1` and `y1` will take the values from `a[1]`. The variables `n`, `m`, `A[i][0]`, and `A[i][1]` remain unaffected during this assignment. The output state will reflect the new values of `x1` and `y1` based on the current state of array `a`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x1` is a[1][0], `y1` is a[1][1], `m` is greater than or equal to 0; `A[i][0]` is the count of how many times the conditions were satisfied, `A[i][1]` reflects the last assigned value based on the conditions met during the loop.**
