Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values from `a[0]`, `m` is greater than 1, `j` is 2; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[2]`. If `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, -1 is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1` (which is from `a[0]`).***
