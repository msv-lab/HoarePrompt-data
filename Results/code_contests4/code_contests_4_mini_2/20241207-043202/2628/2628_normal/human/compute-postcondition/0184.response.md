The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. This means that the execution will stop and no further lines of code will be executed. The values of the variables do not change, but we exit the program. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `b[i]`, `j` is 0, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `a[0]`, the sets created from `b[i]` and `a[j]` are not equal, either `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`, and `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `B[i][1]` is not equal to `x1`, and we exit the program.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `b[i]`, `j` is 0, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `a[0]`, the sets created from `b[i]` and `a[j]` are not equal, either `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`, and `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `B[i][1]` is not equal to `x1`, and we exit the program.**
