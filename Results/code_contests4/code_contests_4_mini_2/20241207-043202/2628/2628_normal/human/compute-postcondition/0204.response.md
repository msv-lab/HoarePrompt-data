The code `exit()` terminates the program execution immediately. This means that no further calculations or changes to the variable states occur. The values of the variables before the execution of `exit()` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the current states of the variables as no modifications are made:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `b[i]`, `j` is 1, `x2` and `y2` are assigned new values from `a[j]`, the sets created from `b[i]` and `a[j]` are not equal, and -1 is printed.**
