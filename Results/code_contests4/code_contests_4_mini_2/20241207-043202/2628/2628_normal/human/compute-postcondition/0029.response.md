Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values from `a[0]`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[0]`. If `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, then if `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and is not equal to `y1`, `-1` is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is increased by 1, and `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. If `y1` is not equal to `x2` or `y1` is not equal to `y2`, the program does not execute any operations.***
