The execution of the code snippet `exit()` will terminate the program immediately without changing any of the variable states. Therefore, we will retain the initial values of all variables, and no return value will be produced as the program exits.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 0, `A[i][0]` reflects the count of how many times the conditions were satisfied during the loop, `A[i][1]` reflects the last assigned value based on the conditions met during the loop, `j` is 2, `x1` is `a[2][0]`, `y1` is `a[2][1]`, `x2` is `b[2][0]`, `y2` is `b[2][1]`, and `-1` has been printed.**
