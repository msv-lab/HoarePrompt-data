Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, and `j` is less than `n - 1`. If the sets of `b[i]` and `a[j]` are not equal, then if `x1` is equal to `x2` or `y2`, and `B[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `x1`, the program exits without any changes to the variable values. Otherwise, `B[i][0]` is increased by 1 and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. If `x1` is not equal to `x2` or `y2`, and if `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y2`, then if `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, `B[i][0]` is increased by 1 and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.***
