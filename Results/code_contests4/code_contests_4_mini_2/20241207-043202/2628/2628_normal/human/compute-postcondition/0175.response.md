Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `A[i][0]` is the count of how many times the conditions were satisfied for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `A[i][1]` reflects the last assigned value based on the conditions met during the loop for each corresponding `i`, and if no conditions are met for any `i`, `A[i][0]` remains 0 and `A[i][1]` retains its initial value of 0.**
