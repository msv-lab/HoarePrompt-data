The values of `x1` and `y1` are assigned from `b[i]`. Since `i` is 2, `x1` and `y1` will be set to the values found at the third index of the list `b`. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `B`, etc.) are not directly affected by this assignment, and we do not know the specific values in `b[2]`, so we cannot specify the exact values of `x1` and `y1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2, and `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `b[2]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2, and `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `b[2]**
