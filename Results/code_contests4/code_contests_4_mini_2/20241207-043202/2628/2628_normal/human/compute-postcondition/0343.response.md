Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `b[2]`, `B[i][0]` is the count of valid pairs found during the iterations, and `B[i][1]` is set to either `x1` or `y1` based on the conditions evaluated during the loop, or remains unchanged if no valid pairs were found.**
