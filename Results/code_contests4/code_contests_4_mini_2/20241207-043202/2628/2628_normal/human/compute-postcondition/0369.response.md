Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `B[i][0]` is the count of valid matches found for each `i` from 0 to `m-1`, `B[i][1]` is the last valid value assigned from `x1` or `y1` for each `i`, or remains unchanged if no valid matches were found. If `m` is 0, then `B[i][0]` remains 0 and `B[i][1]` retains its initial value of 0 for all `i`. The sum of the first elements of `A` over the range `n` is not equal to 1 and the sum of the first elements of `B` over the range `m` is not equal to 1.***
