The `exit()` command terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change as the program ends before any further execution occurs. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `b[i]`, `j` is 0, `B[i][0]` is the count of valid matches found during the loop iterations, `B[i][1]` is the last valid value assigned from `x1` or `y1`, or remains unchanged if no valid matches were found; `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `a[0]`, the sets of `b[i]` and `a[j]` are not equal, `x1` is not equal to `x2`, `x1` is not equal to `y2`, either `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `B[i][1]` is not equal to `y1`, and the output of the print statement is -1, and the program exits without further changes.
