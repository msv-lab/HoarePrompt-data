According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making `j` now equal to 1. The loop will execute again as long as `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `b[i]`, `j` is 1, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `a[0]`, and the sets created from `b[i]` and `a[j]` are not equal. For the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 1.**
