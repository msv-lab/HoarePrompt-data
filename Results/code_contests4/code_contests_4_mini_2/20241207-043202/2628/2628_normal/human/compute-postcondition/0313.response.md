According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `j` is not explicitly mentioned, but we know that `n` is greater than 0 and `j` must currently be less than `n` for the loop to execute again. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` must be increased by 1.

Since `j` is not provided in the previous state, we cannot determine its exact value, but we know it must be less than `n`. For the loop to execute a third time, `n` must be greater than `j + 1`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a third time `j` must be less than `n - 1`**
