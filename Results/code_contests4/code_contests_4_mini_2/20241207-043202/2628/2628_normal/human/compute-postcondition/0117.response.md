Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x1` is `a[1][0]`, `y1` is `a[1][1]`, `m` is greater than 2, and `A[i][0]` reflects the count of how many times the conditions were satisfied. If the sets of `a[i]` and `b[j]` are not equal, and if `x1` equals `x2` or `y1` equals `y2`, the program checks the value of `A[i][1]`. If `A[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `x1` or `y1`, -1 is printed and the program terminates; otherwise, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1, and `A[i][1]` is updated to `x1` or `y1` correspondingly, with `j` remaining 2. If neither `x1` nor `y1` equals the corresponding values in `b`, `A[i][0]` remains unchanged and `A[i][1]` also remains unchanged. The values of `x2` and `y2` are `b[2][0]` and `b[2][1]`, respectively.***
