The code snippet `exit()` terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change, but the program is stopped from executing any further instructions. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x1` is `a[1][0]`, `y1` is `a[1][1]`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `A[i][0]` is the count of how many times the conditions were satisfied, `A[i][1]` reflects the last assigned value based on the conditions met during the loop, `j` is 1, `x2` is `b[1][0]`, `y2` is `b[1][1]`, and `-1` has been printed, and the program has exited.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x1` is `a[1][0]`, `y1` is `a[1][1]`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `A[i][0]` is the count of how many times the conditions were satisfied, `A[i][1]` reflects the last assigned value based on the conditions met during the loop, `j` is 1, `x2` is `b[1][0]`, `y2` is `b[1][1]`, and `-1` has been printed, and the program has exited.**
