Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values from `a[0]`, `m` is greater than 1, `j` is 1; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[1]`. If `A[i][1]` is not 0 and is not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1 and `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.***
