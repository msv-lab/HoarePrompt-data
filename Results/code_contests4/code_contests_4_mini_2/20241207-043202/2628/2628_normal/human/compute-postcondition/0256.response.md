Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `b[i]`, `j` is 0, and the sets of `b[i]` and `a[j]` are not equal. If `x1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, the program will print -1 and exit if `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1` or `y1`. If these conditions are not met, `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1 and `B[i][1]` is updated to `x1` or `y1` accordingly. If the sets of `b[i]` and `a[j]` are equal, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
