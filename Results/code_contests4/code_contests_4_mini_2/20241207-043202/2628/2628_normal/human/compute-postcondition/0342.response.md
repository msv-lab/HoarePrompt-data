Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values based on the element at index `j` of array `a`. If the sets of `b[i]` and `a[j]` are not equal, then if `x1` equals `x2` or `y2`, `B[i][1]` is checked; if it's not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, -1 is printed and the program exits. If that condition is not met, `B[i][0]` is increased by 1 and `B[2][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. If `x1` does not equal `x2` or `y2`, and if `y1` equals `x2` or `y1` equals `y2`, then `B[2][1]` is checked; if it's not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed and the program exits. If that condition is not met, `B[2][0]` is increased by 1 and `B[2][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. If none of these conditions are met, no changes occur.***
