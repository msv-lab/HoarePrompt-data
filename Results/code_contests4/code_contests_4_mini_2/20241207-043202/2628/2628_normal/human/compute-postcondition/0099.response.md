Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x1` is `a[1][0]`, `y1` is `a[1][1]`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `A[i][0]` is the count of how many times the conditions were satisfied. If `A[i][1]` is not 0 and `A[i][1]` is not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed to the output and the program exits. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1, `A[i][1]` is now equal to `y1`, `j` is 1, `x2` is `b[1][0]`, and `y2` is `b[1][1]`.***
