Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `x1` is `a[2][0]`, `y1` is `a[2][1]`, `m` is greater than 0, `A[i][0]` reflects the count of how many times the conditions were satisfied during the loop, and `A[i][1]` reflects the last assigned value based on the conditions met during the loop. If `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, -1 is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1, and `A[i][1]` is now equal to `x1`, while the sets of the elements in `a[i]` and `b[j]` remain not equal.***
