Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `m + len(A)` if the sum of the first elements of `A` over the range `n` equals 1 or the sum of the first elements of `B` over the range `m` equals 1, in which case `ans` becomes the second element of the last `Bi` in `B` where `Bi[0]` equals 1, or remains unchanged if no such `Bi` satisfies the condition. If neither sum equals 1, then `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `m`, `B[i][0]` remains the count of valid matches found for each `i` from 0 to `m-1`, `B[i][1]` is the last valid value assigned from `x1` or `y1`, or remains unchanged if no valid matches were found, and the value `0` has been printed.***
