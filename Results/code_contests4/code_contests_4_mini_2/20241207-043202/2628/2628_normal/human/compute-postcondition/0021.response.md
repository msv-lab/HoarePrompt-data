Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values from `a[0]`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[0]`. The set of elements in `a[i]` is not equal to the set of elements in `b[j]`, and neither `x1` is equal to `x2` nor `x1` is equal to `y2`. Additionally, either `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`.***
