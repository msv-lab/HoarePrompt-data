Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `x1` is `a[2][0]`, `y1` is `a[2][1]`, `m` is greater than 0, `A[i][0]` reflects the count of how many times the conditions were satisfied during the loop, and `A[i][1]` reflects the last assigned value based on the conditions met during the loop. If the sets of the elements in `a[i]` and `b[j]` are not equal, then if `x1` is equal to `x2` or `y2`, and `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, -1 is printed and the program exits; otherwise, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1 and `A[i][1]` is now equal to `x1`. Similarly, if `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, and `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed and the program exits; otherwise, `A[i][0]` is increased by 1 and `A[i][1]` is set to `y1`. The relationships among the sets and values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` remain satisfied. If the sets of the elements in `a[i]` and `b[j]` are equal, no changes occur.***
