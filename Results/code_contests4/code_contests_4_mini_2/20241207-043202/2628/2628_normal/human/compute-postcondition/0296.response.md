The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. None of the variables are modified or returned, but the program will stop executing at this point. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `b[2]`, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `a[j]`, the sets of `b[i]` and `a[j]` are not equal, either `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`, `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `B[i][1]` is not equal to `x1`, and the program exits.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `b[2]`, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `a[j]`, the sets of `b[i]` and `a[j]` are not equal, either `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`, `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `B[i][1]` is not equal to `x1`, and the program exits.**
