Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `m + 2`, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `A` is a list with at least 3 elements, and `Ai` is the third element of `A`. If `Ai[0]` equals 1, then `ans` takes the value of the second element of `Ai`. If `Ai[0]` does not equal 1, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
