According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. To execute the loop for a second time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 1, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `b[i]`, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
