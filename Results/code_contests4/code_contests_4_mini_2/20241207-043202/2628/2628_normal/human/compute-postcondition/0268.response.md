Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `b[i]`, `j` is 1, `x2`, `y2` are assigned values from `a[1]`. If `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `B[i][1]` is not equal to `y1`, -1 has been printed and the program execution has exited. Otherwise, `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1 and `B[i][1]` is set to `y1`.***
