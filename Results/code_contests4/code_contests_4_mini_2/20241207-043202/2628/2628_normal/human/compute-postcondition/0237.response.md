Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `b[i]`, `j` is 0, `B[i][0]` is the count of valid matches found during the loop iterations, `B[i][1]` is the last valid value assigned from `x1` or `y1`, or remains unchanged if no valid matches were found; `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `a[0]`, the sets of `b[i]` and `a[j]` are not equal, and either `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`.***
