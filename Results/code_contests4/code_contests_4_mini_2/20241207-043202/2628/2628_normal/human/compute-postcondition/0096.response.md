The code `exit()` terminates the program immediately. It does not modify any variable values or states but stops any further execution. Therefore, the output state reflects that the program has exited without changes to the existing variables.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x1` is `a[1][0]`, `y1` is `a[1][1]`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `A[i][0]` is the count of how many times the conditions were satisfied, `A[i][1]` reflects the last assigned value based on the conditions met during the loop, `j` is 1, `x2` is `b[1][0]`, `y2` is `b[1][1]` and -1 is printed to the output. The program has exited.**
