The variable `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. The initial values of `x1` and `y1` are assigned from `b[i]`, and since `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `m` is greater than 0, this implies that `b[i]` has valid values. The states of `B[i][0]` have already been modified by increasing it by 1, but this does not affect the assignment of `B[i][1]`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `b[i]`, `j` is 1, `x2` and `y2` are assigned new values from `a[j]`, the sets created from `b[i]` and `a[j]` are not equal; `B[i][0]` is increased by 1; `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `b[i]`, `j` is 1, `x2` and `y2` are assigned new values from `a[j]`, the sets created from `b[i]` and `a[j]` are not equal; `B[i][0]` is increased by 1; `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`.**
