Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x1` is `a[1][0]`, `y1` is `a[1][1]`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1. If `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `A[i][1]` is not equal to `x1`, then the value `-1` has been printed and the program has exited. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is increased by 1, `A[i][1]` is set to `x1`, and the sets of elements in `a[i]` and `b[j]` are not equal, with either `x1` being equal to `x2` or `x1` being equal to `y2`.***
