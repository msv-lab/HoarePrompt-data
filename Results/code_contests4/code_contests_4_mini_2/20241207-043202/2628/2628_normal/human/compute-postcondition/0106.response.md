The code `exit()` terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change, but the program ends execution. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x1` is `a[1][0]`, `y1` is `a[1][1]`, `m` is greater than 2, `A[i][0]` reflects the count of how many times the conditions were satisfied, `A[i][1]` represents the last assigned value based on the conditions met during the loop, `j` is 2; `x2` is `b[2][0]`, `y2` is `b[2][1]` and -1 is printed to the output, and the program is terminated.
