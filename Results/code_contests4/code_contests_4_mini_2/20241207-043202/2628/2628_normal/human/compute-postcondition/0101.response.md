Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x1` is `a[1][0]`, `y1` is `a[1][1]`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `A[i][0]` reflects the count of how many times the conditions were satisfied, and `A[i][1]` represents the last assigned value based on the conditions met during the loop. If `x1` is equal to either `x2` or `y2`, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1, and `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`, unless `A[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `x1`, in which case -1 is printed and the program exits. If `y1` is equal to either `x2` or `y2`, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1, `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`, `j` is reset to 1, and if `A[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, the program continues without changes to the variables.***
