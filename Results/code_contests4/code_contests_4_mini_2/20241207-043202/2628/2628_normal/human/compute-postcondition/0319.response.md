Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is less than `n - 1`, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of `a[j]`. If `B[i][1]` is not 0 and `B[i][1]` is not equal to `x1`, the program exits without any changes to the variable values. Otherwise, `B[i][0]` is increased by 1 and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`.***
