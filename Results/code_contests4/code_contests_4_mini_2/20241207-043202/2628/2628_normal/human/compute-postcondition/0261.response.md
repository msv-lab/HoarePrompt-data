The expression `B[i][0] += 1` increments the value at the first column of the `i`-th row of the array `B` by 1. Since `i` is currently 1, this operation affects `B[1][0]`, which is part of the state of the program. Other variables remain unchanged.

The previous values of the affected variable `B[1][0]` are not specified, but we know that it must be a number since it is being incremented. Therefore, we note that `B[1][0]` is increased by 1.

The Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `b[i]`, `j` is 1, `x2`, `y2` are assigned values from `a[1]`, and `B[1][0]` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `b[i]`, `j` is 1, `x2`, `y2` are assigned values from `a[1]`, and `B[1][0]` is increased by 1.**
