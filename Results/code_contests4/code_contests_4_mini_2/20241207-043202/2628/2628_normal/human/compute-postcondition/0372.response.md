The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It handles input from two participants, where the first participant communicates `n` distinct pairs of integers, and the second participant communicates `m` distinct pairs of integers. Each pair consists of two different integers within the range of 1 to 9. Based on the communication of these pairs, the function will presumably process the information provided by both participants. However, without specific output details provided, we cannot ascertain the exact return value or the nature of the output based on the pairs communicated. Therefore, the functionality of the function is not entirely clear without additional output information.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and processes input from two participants who communicate distinct pairs of integers from 1 to 9. The exact output based on this input is not specified.**
