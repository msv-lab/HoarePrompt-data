Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `x1` is `a[2][0]`, `y1` is `a[2][1]`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `x2` is `b[1][0]`, `y2` is `b[1][1]`. If `y1` is equal to either `x2` or `y2`, then if `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `A[i][1]` is not equal to `y1`, all variable values remain unchanged. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is increased by 1, and `A[i][1]` is now equal to `y1`, while `j`, `x2`, and `y2` remain unchanged.***
