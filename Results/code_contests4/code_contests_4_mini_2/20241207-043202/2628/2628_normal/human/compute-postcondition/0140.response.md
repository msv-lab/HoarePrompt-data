Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `x1` is `a[2][0]`, `y1` is `a[2][1]`, `m` is greater than 0. If `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `A[i][1]` is not equal to `y1`, then -1 is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is increased by 1, `A[i][1]` is set to `y1`, and the conditions regarding the inequality and equality of the sets and values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` remain satisfied.***
