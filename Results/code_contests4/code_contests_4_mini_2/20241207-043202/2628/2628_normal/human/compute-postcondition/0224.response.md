The execution of the code `exit()` terminates the program immediately. No variable values are changed during this operation. Therefore, the output state remains as it was before the execution of the exit command. The program will print `-1` before exiting. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `b[i]`, `j` is 2, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `a[j]`, the sets created from `b[i]` and `a[j]` are not equal; `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `a[j]`; -1 is printed, and the program exits.**
