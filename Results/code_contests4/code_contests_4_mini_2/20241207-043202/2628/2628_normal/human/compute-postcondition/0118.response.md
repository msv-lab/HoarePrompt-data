Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x1` is `a[1][0]`, `y1` is `a[1][1]`, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `A[i][0]` is the count of how many times the conditions were satisfied during the loop, `A[i][1]` reflects the last assigned value based on the conditions met during the loop, and `j` is equal to `m` after all iterations of the loop have executed.**
