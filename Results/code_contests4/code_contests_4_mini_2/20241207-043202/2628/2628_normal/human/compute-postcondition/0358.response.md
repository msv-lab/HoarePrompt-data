Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `m + len(A)`, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `A` is a list with at least 0 elements, `ans` is the second element of the last `Ai` in `A` where `Ai[0]` equals 1, or remains unchanged if no `Ai` satisfies the condition, `B` is a non-empty list, and the first element of `Bi` is equal to 1.***
