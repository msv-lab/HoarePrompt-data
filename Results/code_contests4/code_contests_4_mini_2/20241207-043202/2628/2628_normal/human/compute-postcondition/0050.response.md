The code `exit()` terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change, but we effectively end the program's execution at this point. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values from `a[0]`, `m` is greater than 1, `j` is 2; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[2]` and -1 is printed, and the program exits.
