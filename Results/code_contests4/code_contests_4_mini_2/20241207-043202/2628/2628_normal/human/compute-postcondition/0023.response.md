The code executes a print statement that outputs `-1`. This does not affect the values of any variables, and they remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values from `a[0]`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[0]`, the set of elements in `a[i]` is not equal to the set of elements in `b[j]`, neither `x1` is equal to `x2` nor `x1` is equal to `y2`, either `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, and `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `A[i][1]` is not equal to `y1`. Additionally, the value `-1` has been printed.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values from `a[0]`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[0]`, the set of elements in `a[i]` is not equal to the set of elements in `b[j]`, neither `x1` is equal to `x2` nor `x1` is equal to `y2`, either `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, and `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `A[i][1]` is not equal to `y1`; `-1` has been printed.**
