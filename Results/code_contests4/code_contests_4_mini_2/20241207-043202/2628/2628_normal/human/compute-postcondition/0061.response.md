Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values from `a[0]`, `m` is greater than 1, `j` is 2; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[2]`. If the sets of `a[i]` and `b[j]` are not equal, then if `x1` is equal to `x2` or `y2`, and if `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, -1 is printed and the program exits; otherwise, `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. If `y1` is equal to either `x2` or `y2`, and if `A[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed; otherwise, `A[i][0]` is increased by 1 and `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. If `y1` is not equal to `x2` or `y2`, no changes are made to `A[i][0]` or `A[i][1]`. If the sets of `a[i]` and `b[j]` are equal, no changes occur to `A[i][0]` or `A[i][1]`.***
