Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values from `a[0]`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[0]`. If the sets of `a[i]` and `b[j]` are not equal, if `x1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, then `A[i][1]` is updated based on the specified conditions; otherwise, if neither condition is satisfied, `A[i][0]` is increased by 1 and `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. If `y1` does not equal `x2` or `y2`, no operations are executed. If the sets of `a[i]` and `b[j]` are equal, no operations are executed.***
