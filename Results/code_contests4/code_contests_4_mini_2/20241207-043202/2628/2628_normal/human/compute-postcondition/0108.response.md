The value of `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. Since `x1` is `a[1][0]`, `A[i][1]` now takes the value of `a[1][0]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x1` is `a[1][0]`, `y1` is `a[1][1]`, `m` is greater than 2, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1, `A[i][1]` is now `a[1][0]`, `j` is 2; `x2` is `b[2][0]`, `y2` is `b[2][1]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x1` is `a[1][0]`, `y1` is `a[1][1]`, `m` is greater than 2, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1, `A[i][1]` is now `a[1][0]`, `j` is 2; `x2` is `b[2][0]`, `y2` is `b[2][1]`**
