Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 0, `A[i][0]` reflects the count of how many times the conditions were satisfied during the loop. If `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and also not equal to `y1`, then `-1` has been printed. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is increased by 1, `A[i][1]` is now equal to `y1`, and the values of `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` remain unchanged.***
