Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `b[i]`, `j` is 0. If `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `B[i][1]` is not equal to `y1`, the output of the print statement is -1, and the program exits without further changes. Otherwise, `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1, `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`, and `B[i][1]` is now equal to `y1`.***
