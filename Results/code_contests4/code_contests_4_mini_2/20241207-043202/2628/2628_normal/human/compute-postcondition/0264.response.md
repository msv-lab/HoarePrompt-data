The code snippet `print(-1)` outputs the value `-1` to the console. It does not modify any of the existing variables but simply displays `-1`. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `b[i]`, `j` is 1, and `x2`, `y2` are assigned values from `a[1]`, and `-1` has been printed.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `b[i]`, `j` is 1, and `x2`, `y2` are assigned values from `a[1]`, and `-1` has been printed.**
