Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x1` is `a[1][0]`, `y1` is `a[1][1]`, `m` is greater than 2, and `A[i][0]` reflects the count of how many times the conditions were satisfied. If `x1` equals `x2` or `x1` equals `y2`, if `A[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `x1`, -1 is printed and the program terminates; otherwise, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1, `A[i][1]` is updated to `x1`, and `j` remains 2. If `y1` equals `x2` or `y1` equals `y2`, if `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed and the program exits; otherwise, `A[i][0]` is increased by 1, `A[i][1]` becomes `y1`, and the program continues with `j` as 2, `x2` as `b[2][0]`, and `y2` as `b[2][1]***.
