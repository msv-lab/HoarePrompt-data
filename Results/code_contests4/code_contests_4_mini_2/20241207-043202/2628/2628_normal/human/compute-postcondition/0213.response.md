Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `b[i]`, `j` is 1, `x2` and `y2` are assigned new values from `a[j]`, and the sets created from `b[i]` and `a[j]` are not equal. If `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, then if `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed; otherwise, `B[i][0]` is increased by 1, and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. If `y1` is not equal to `x2` and `y1` is not equal to `y2`, no changes are made.***
