Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x1` is `a[1][0]`, `y1` is `a[1][1]`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `A[i][0]` is the count of how many times the conditions were satisfied, `A[i][1]` reflects the last assigned value based on the conditions met during the loop, `j` is 1, `x2` is `b[1][0]`, `y2` is `b[1][1]`. If `A[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `x1`, then `-1` has been printed, and the program has exited. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1, and `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `a[1][0]`.***
