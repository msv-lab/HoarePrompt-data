Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x1` is `a[1][0]`, `y1` is `a[1][1]`, `m` is greater than 2, `A[i][0]` reflects the count of how many times the conditions were satisfied, `A[i][1]` represents the last assigned value based on the conditions met during the loop, `j` is 2; `x2` is `b[2][0]`, `y2` is `b[2][1]`. If `y1` equals `x2` or `y1` equals `y2`, and if `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `A[i][1]` is not equal to `y1`, -1 will be printed to the output and the program will exit. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` will be increased by 1, `A[i][1]` will now be `y1`, and the program will continue with `j` as 2, `x2` as `b[2][0]`, and `y2` as `b[2][1]`.***
