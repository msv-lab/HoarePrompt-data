Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `m + len(A)`, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `A` is a list with at least 0 elements, `B` is a list with at least 2 elements. If `Bi[0]` is equal to 1, `ans` is assigned the value of the second element of `B`, which is `Bi[1]`.***
