Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x1` is `a[1][0]`, `y1` is `a[1][1]`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, if `A[i][1]` is not 0 and is not equal to `y1`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is increased by 1, `A[i][1]` is equal to `y1`, `j` is 0, `x2` is `b[0][0]`, `y2` is `b[0][1]`, the sets of elements in `a[i]` and `b[j]` are not equal, neither `x1` is equal to `x2` nor `x1` is equal to `y2`, and either `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`.***
