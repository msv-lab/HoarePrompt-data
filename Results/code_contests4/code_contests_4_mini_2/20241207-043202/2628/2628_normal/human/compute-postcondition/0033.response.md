The code assigns the values from `b[j]` to `x2` and `y2`. The variable `j` is currently 1, which means `x2` and `y2` will receive the values from the second element of the `b` list (since indexing starts at 0). The initial values of `x1` and `y1` remain unchanged, as well as `n`, `i`, and `m`. Therefore, the Output State reflects the new values of `x2` and `y2` based on the assignment.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values from `a[0]`, `m` is greater than 1, `j` is 1; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[1]**
