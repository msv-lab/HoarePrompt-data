The execution of the `exit()` function terminates the program immediately. This means that no further lines of code will be executed, and the current state of the variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the values of `n`, `i`, `j`, `x2`, and `y2` are unaffected by this command.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 3; `x2` and `y2` are assigned values based on the element at index `j` of array `a`; -1 is printed and the program exits.**
