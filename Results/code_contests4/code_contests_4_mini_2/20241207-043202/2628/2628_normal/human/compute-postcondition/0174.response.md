Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `A[i][0]` reflects the total count of how many times the conditions were satisfied during the loop, `A[i][1]` reflects the last assigned value based on the conditions met during the loop, `x1` is `a[2][0]`, `y1` is `a[2][1]`, and if the sets of `a[i]` and `b[j]` are not equal, the values of `A[i][0]` and `A[i][1]` will have been updated based on the conditions met throughout all iterations. If the sets are equal, no changes occur to `A[i][0]` and `A[i][1]`.**
