The code `exit()` is called, which terminates the program immediately. Therefore, no changes are made to the values of `n`, `i`, `j`, `x2`, or `y2`. The output state will reflect that the program has exited without modifying any variables.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 3; `x2` and `y2` are assigned values based on the element at index `j` of array `a`, and -1 is printed; the program has exited.**
