The variable `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. The value of `x1` is `A[2][0]`, which means `A[i][1]` is now equal to `A[2][0]`. The previous value of `A[i][1]` is not specified, but it is updated based on the assignment. The states of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 0, `A[i][0]` is increased by 1, `A[i][1]` is now equal to `A[2][0]`, `j` is 2, `x1` is `A[2][0]`, `y1` is `A[2][1]`, `x2` is `b[2][0]`, `y2` is `b[2][1]**
