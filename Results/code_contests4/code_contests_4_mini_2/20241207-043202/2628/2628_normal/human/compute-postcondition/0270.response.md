Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `b[i]`, `j` is 1, and `x2`, `y2` are assigned values from `a[1]`. If `x1` is equal to `x2` or `y2`, and if `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `B[i][1]` is not equal to `x1`, -1 is printed and the program execution terminates. Otherwise, `B[1][0]` is increased by 1 and `B[1][1]` is set to `x1`. If the condition is not met, and `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y2`, then if `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed and the program execution exits. Otherwise, `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1 and `B[i][1]` is set to `y1`. If `y1` is not equal to `x2` and not equal to `y2`, there are no changes made to `B[i][0]` or `B[i][1]`.***
