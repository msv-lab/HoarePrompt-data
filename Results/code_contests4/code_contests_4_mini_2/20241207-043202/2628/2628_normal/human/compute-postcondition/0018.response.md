The variable `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. The values of `x1` and `y1` were previously assigned from `a[0]`, and since `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` takes a specific value from `a[0]`. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values from `a[0]`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[0]`, and `A[i][1]` is now equal to `x1`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values from `a[0]`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[0]`, and `A[i][1]` is now equal to `x1`.**
