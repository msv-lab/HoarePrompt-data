Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x1` is `a[1][0]`, `y1` is `a[1][1]`, `m` is greater than 2, and `A[i][0]` reflects the count of how many times the conditions were satisfied. If `A[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `x1`, -1 is printed to the output and the program is terminated. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1, `A[i][1]` is updated to `a[1][0]`, and `j` remains 2 with `x2` as `b[2][0]` and `y2` as `b[2][1]`.***
