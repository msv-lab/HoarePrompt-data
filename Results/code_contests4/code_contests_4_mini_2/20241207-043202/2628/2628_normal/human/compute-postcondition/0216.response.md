According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` becomes 2 and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `b[i]`, `j` is 2, `x2` and `y2` are assigned new values from `a[j]`, and the sets created from `b[i]` and `a[j]` are not equal. For the loop to execute a third time, `n` must be greater than 2.**
