Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `b[i]`, `B[i][0]` is the count of valid matches found in the loop iterations, and `B[i][1]` is the last valid value assigned from `x1` or `y1`, or remains unchanged if no valid matches were found.**
