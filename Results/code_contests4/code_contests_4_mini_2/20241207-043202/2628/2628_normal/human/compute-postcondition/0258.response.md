The variables `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a[j]`. The current value of `j` is 1, so `x2` and `y2` will take the values from the second element of the list `a` (since indexing starts at 0). The initial state indicates that `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `m` is greater than 0, but the specific values of `a` and the elements of `b[i]` are not provided. The values of `x1` and `y1` are also not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects that `x2` and `y2` have been assigned values based on `a[j]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `b[i]`, `j` is 1, and `x2`, `y2` are assigned values from `a[1]`.**
