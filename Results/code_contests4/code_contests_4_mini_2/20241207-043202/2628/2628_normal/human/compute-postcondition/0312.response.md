Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `b[2]`; `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `a[j]`. If the sets of `b[i]` and `a[j]` are not equal, then if either `x1` equals `x2` or `x1` equals `y2`, `B[i][1]` is updated to `x1` unless it is not equal to 0 and `x1`; otherwise, the program exits. If neither `x1` equals `x2` nor `x1` equals `y2`, and either `y1` equals `x2` or `y1` equals `y2`, then if `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, `-1` is printed and the program exits; otherwise, `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1` and `B[i][0]` is increased by 1. If the sets of `b[i]` and `a[j]` are equal, the state of `B` remains unchanged.***
