The execution of the code `exit()` causes the program to terminate immediately. No variables change their values as a result of this command. Therefore, the Output State reflects the fact that the program exits without any changes to the variable values, but acknowledges the termination of the program.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `b[i]`, `j` is 2, `x2`, `y2` are assigned values from `a[2]` and the program exits.**
