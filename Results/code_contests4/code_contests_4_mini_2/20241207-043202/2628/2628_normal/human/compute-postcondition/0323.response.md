The code assigns the value of `y1` to `B[i][1]`. The value of `i` is 2, but the values of `B` and `y1` are not provided in the initial state. The previous values of `B[i][1]` are unknown as well, but `B[i][0]` has been increased by 1. The output state will reflect the assignment without knowing the exact values of `B` or `y1`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is less than `n - 1; B[i][0]` is increased by 1; `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.**
