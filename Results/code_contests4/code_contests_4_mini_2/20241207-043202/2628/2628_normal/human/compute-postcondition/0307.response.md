Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `b[2]`, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `a[j]`, the sets of `b[i]` and `a[j]` are not equal, and neither `x1` is equal to `x2` nor `x1` is equal to `y2`. Additionally, either `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`. Moreover, `B[i][1]` is equal to 0 or `B[i][1]` is equal to `y1`; `B[i][0]` is increased by 1.**
