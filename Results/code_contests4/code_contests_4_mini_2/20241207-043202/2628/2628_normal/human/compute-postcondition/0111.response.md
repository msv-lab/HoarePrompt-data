The execution of the code `exit()` terminates the program immediately. No changes are made to the values of any variables, and all other processes are halted. Therefore, the output state reflects the existing values of the variables at the time of termination.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x1` is `a[1][0]`, `y1` is `a[1][1]`, `m` is greater than 2, `A[i][0]` reflects the count of how many times the conditions were satisfied, `A[i][1]` represents the last assigned value based on the conditions met during the loop, `j` is 2, `x2` is `b[2][0]`, `y2` is `b[2][1]`, and -1 has been printed to the output, and the program has exited.**
