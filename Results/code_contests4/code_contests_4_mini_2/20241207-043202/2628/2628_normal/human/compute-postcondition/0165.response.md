Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 0. If `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `A[i][1]` is not equal to `x1`, then -1 has been printed to the output. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is increased by 1, and `A[i][1]` is now equal to `A[2][0]`. The values of `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` remain unchanged, where `j` is 2, `x1` is `A[2][0]`, `y1` is `A[2][1]`, `x2` is `b[2][0]`, and `y2` is `b[2][1]`.***
