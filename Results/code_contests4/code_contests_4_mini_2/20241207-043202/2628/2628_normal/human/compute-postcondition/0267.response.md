The variable `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. Since `y1` was assigned a value from `b[i]`, the output state will reflect that `B[i][1]` now holds that value. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `b[i]`, `j` is 1, `x2`, `y2` are assigned values from `a[1]`, `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1, and `B[i][1]` is `y1`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `b[i]`, `j` is 1, `x2`, `y2` are assigned values from `a[1]`, `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1, `B[i][1]` is `y1`.**
