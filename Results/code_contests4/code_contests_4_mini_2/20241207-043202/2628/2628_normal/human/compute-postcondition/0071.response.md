The code `exit()` terminates the program, and thus no variables are modified or assigned new values. The program will stop executing at this point. Therefore, the output state reflects the condition before the program exited.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x1` is `a[1][0]`, `y1` is `a[1][1]`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `A[i][0]` is the count of how many times the conditions were satisfied, `A[i][1]` reflects the last assigned value based on the conditions met during the loop, `j` is 0, `x2` is `b[0][0]`, `y2` is `b[0][1]`, the sets of elements in `a[i]` and `b[j]` are not equal, either `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`, and `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `A[i][1]` is not equal to `x1`, and the value `-1` has been printed, and the program has exited.**
