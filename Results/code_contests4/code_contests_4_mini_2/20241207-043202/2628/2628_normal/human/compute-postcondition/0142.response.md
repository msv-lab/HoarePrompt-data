Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `x1` is `a[2][0]`, `y1` is `a[2][1]`, `m` is greater than 0, and the sets of the elements in `a[i]` and `b[j]` are not equal. If `x1` is equal to `x2` or `y2`, then if `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, -1 is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1 and `A[i][1]` is now equal to `x1`. If `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, then if `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is increased by 1 and `A[i][1]` is set to `y1`, while the relationships among the sets and values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` remain satisfied.***
