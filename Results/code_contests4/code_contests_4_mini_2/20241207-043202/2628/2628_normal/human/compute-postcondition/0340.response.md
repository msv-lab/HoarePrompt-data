Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, and if `y1` equals `x2` or `y1` equals `y2`, if `B[2][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed and the program exits; otherwise, `B[2][0]` is increased by 1, and `B[2][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. If neither condition is met, no changes occur.***
