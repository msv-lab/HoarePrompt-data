Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `m + len(A)`, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `A` is a list with at least 0 elements, `ans` is equal to `Bi[1]` if the first element of `Bi` is equal to 1, and `B` is a non-empty list. If the first element of `Bi` is 1, `ans` is updated to `Bi[1]`.***
