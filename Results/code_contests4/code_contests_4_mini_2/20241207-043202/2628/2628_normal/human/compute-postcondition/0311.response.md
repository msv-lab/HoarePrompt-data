Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `b[2]`, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `a[j]`, and the sets of `b[i]` and `a[j]` are not equal. If either `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`, then if `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `B[i][1]` is not equal to `x1`, the program exits; otherwise, `B[i][1]` is equal to `x1`. If neither `x1` is equal to `x2` nor `x1` is equal to `y2`, then if either `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, and if `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, then `-1` is printed and the program exits; if `B[i][1]` is equal to 0 or equal to `y1`, then `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1` and `B[i][0]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the state of `B` remains unchanged.***
