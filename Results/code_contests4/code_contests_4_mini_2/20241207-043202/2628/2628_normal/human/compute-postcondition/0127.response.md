Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `x1` is `a[2][0]`, `y1` is `a[2][1]`, `m` is greater than 0, `A[i][0]` is the count of how many times the conditions were satisfied during the loop, `A[i][1]` reflects the last assigned value based on the conditions met during the loop, `j` is equal to `m`, `x2` is assigned the value `b[j][0]`, `y2` is assigned the value `b[j][1]`, the sets of the elements in `a[i]` and `b[j]` are not equal, either `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`, and `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `A[i][1]` is not equal to `x1`; -1 is printed and the program exits.**
