Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x1` is `a[1][0]`, `y1` is `a[1][1]`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `A[i][0]` is the count of how many times the conditions were satisfied, `A[i][1]` reflects the last assigned value based on the conditions met during the loop, `j` is 0; `x2` is `b[0][0]`, `y2` is `b[0][1]`. If the sets of elements in `a[i]` and `b[j]` are not equal, and `x1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, then if `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and is not equal to either `x1` or `y1`, `-1` is printed, and the program exits. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is increased by 1, and `A[i][1]` is set to `x1` or `y1` based on the respective conditions. The sets of elements in `a[i]` and `b[j]` remain unequal, and neither `x1` is equal to `x2` nor `x1` is equal to `y2`.***
