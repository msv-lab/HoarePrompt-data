Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `x1` is `a[2][0]`, `y1` is `a[2][1]`, `m` is greater than 0, `A[i][0]` reflects the count of how many times the conditions were satisfied during the loop, `A[i][1]` reflects the last assigned value based on the conditions met during the loop, `j` is 1, `x2` is `b[1][0]`, `y2` is `b[1][1]`. If `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, then -1 has been printed and the program execution has been terminated. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is increased by 1, and `A[i][1]` is now set to `a[2][0]`.***
