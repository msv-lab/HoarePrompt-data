According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and its relationship with `n`. Since `j` is currently less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again for the next value of `j`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is less than `n - 1,` which means that `j` must be increased by 1 for the next iteration. After incrementing, `j` will be equal to `n - 1`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than `j` (which is now `n - 1`). 

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be greater than 3.**
