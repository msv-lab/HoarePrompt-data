To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze both the problem description and the program itself.

**Problem Description:**
- We need to find the maximum possible amount of allowance by arranging three integer panels (A, B, C) and one operator panel (`+`) to form a formula of the type X + Y.
- The largest digit must be placed in the tens position, and the other two digits will be in the units position. 
- Given that A, B, and C are all between 1 and 9, we need to maximize the resulting value.

**Program:**
```python
lst = raw_input().split()
lst.sort()
lst.reverse()
lst = list(map(int, lst))
ans = 10 * lst[0] + lst[1] + lst[2]
print(ans)
```

**Analysis of the Program:**
1. The program reads the input values, which are expected to be A, B, and C.
2. It sorts these values in descending order.
3. It constructs the final answer by multiplying the largest value by 10 (to place it in the tens position) and adding the other two digits.

**Checking for Correctness:**
The maximum arrangement for the panels would be:
- The largest digit should be multiplied by 10.
- The next two digits should be added directly.

This logic seems correct, but let's check if it handles all possible cases correctly.

### Example Cases:
1. **Input: 1 5 2**
   - Sorted values: 5, 2, 1
   - Calculation: 10 * 5 + 2 + 1 = 53 (Correct)

2. **Input: 9 9 9**
   - Sorted values: 9, 9, 9
   - Calculation: 10 * 9 + 9 + 9 = 108 (Correct)

3. **Input: 6 6 7**
   - Sorted values: 7, 6, 6
   - Calculation: 10 * 7 + 6 + 6 = 82 (Correct)

### Edge Cases:
- **Input: 1 1 1**
  - Sorted values: 1, 1, 1
  - Calculation: 10 * 1 + 1 + 1 = 12 (Correct)

- **Input: 1 2 3**
  - Sorted values: 3, 2, 1
  - Calculation: 10 * 3 + 2 + 1 = 32 (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum allowance for all tested scenarios. The logic of sorting the values and placing the largest one in the tens position while adding the other two digits is sound. Given the constraints (1 ≤ A, B, C ≤ 9), the program will always yield the correct result.

Correctness: **True**.
