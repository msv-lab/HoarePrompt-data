Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` which is not compatible with Python 3. It should use `input()` instead.

2. **Sorting Logic**: The program sorts the digits in ascending order and then reverses the list to get the maximum digit first. However, it doesn't take into account the specific position of the operator `+`. The logic for forming the maximum possible amount of allowance should consider all combinations of placing `+` between two of the three digits.

3. **Formula Construction**: The program calculates the allowance as `10 * lst[0] + lst[1] + lst[2]`, which assumes that the largest digit is always on the left (in the tens place). This is not necessarily valid. The correct approach would be to evaluate all combinations of the three digits placed around the `+` operator to find the maximum sum.

For example, given the input `1 5 2`, the combinations to consider would be:
- 1 + 52 = 53
- 2 + 51 = 53
- 5 + 12 = 17

The maximum of these combinations is 53, which the program outputs correctly for this specific input. However, it is not guaranteed to work for all inputs, especially since it does not evaluate all permutations.

In conclusion, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description because it does not correctly compute the maximum possible allowance for all arrangements of the three digits and the operator `+`.
