Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The program sorts the input values A, B, and C in descending order and then calculates the allowance using the formula `10 * largest + second_largest + third_largest`. This formula does not accurately represent the intended operation of forming a valid expression of the form `X + Y`.

In the context of the problem, the task is to find the maximum possible amount of the allowance by arranging the digits correctly in the format `X + Y`, where `X` and `Y` must be formed using the given digits. The correct maximum should consider combinations such as:

- For input `1 5 2`, the possible combinations (considering the operator `+` must be in the middle) yield:
  - `15 + 2 = 17`
  - `12 + 5 = 17`
  - `25 + 1 = 26`
  - `51 + 2 = 53`
  - `52 + 1 = 53` (maximum)
  
- For input `9 9 9`, the maximum is `99 + 9 = 108`.

- For input `6 6 7`, the maximum is `76 + 6 = 82`.

The program does not explore all valid combinations of `X` and `Y` formed from the three digits; it only computes a single value based on a fixed formula rather than evaluating all possible expressions. Therefore, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description. The correct approach would involve generating all valid combinations of digits to find the maximum result, which the current implementation does not do.
