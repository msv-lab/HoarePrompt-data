The command `lst.reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in the list `lst`. Since `lst` is a sorted list of string inputs, reversing it will result in the elements being arranged in descending order. The values of integers `A`, `B`, and `C` remain unchanged, and are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the reversed list along with the unchanged integers.

Output State: **`A`, `B`, and `C` are integers between 1 and 9 (inclusive); `lst` is a sorted list of string inputs reversed.**
