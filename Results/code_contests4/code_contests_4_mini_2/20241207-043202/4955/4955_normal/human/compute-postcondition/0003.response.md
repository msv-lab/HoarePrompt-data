The code takes `lst`, which is a sorted list of string inputs, and applies `map(int, lst)` to convert each string in the list to an integer. The result of this mapping is then converted back to a list and assigned to `lst`. Since `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers between 1 and 9, they are not directly affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers between 1 and 9 (inclusive); `lst` is a list of integers derived from the original string inputs.

Output State: **`A`, `B`, and `C` are integers between 1 and 9 (inclusive); `lst` is a list of integers derived from the original string inputs.**
