The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `node` and `key`. The parameter `node` is the root of a binary search tree where each node contains a unique integer key, and `key` is an integer within the range [-2,000,000,000, 2,000,000,000]. 

After executing the function body, the function handles the following cases:
- If `node` is not present (null or None), the function returns `False`.
- If the key of the node is equal to the provided `key`, the function returns `True`.
- If the provided `key` is less than the key of the current `node`, the function recursively calls itself with the left child of the node and the provided `key`.
- If the provided `key` is greater than the key of the current `node`, the function recursively calls itself with the right child of the node and the provided `key`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a binary search tree node and an integer key, returning whether the key exists in the binary search tree as follows: it returns `False` if the node is absent, `True` if the key matches the node's key, or continues searching in the left or right child based on the relationship between the node's key and the provided key. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a binary search tree node and an integer key, returns False if the node is not present, True if the node's key matches the provided key, or continues searching in the left or right child based on the comparison of the keys.**
