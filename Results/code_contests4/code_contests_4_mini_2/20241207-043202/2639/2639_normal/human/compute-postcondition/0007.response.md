The function `func_4` accepts a parameter `node`. `node` is the root of a binary search tree. The function performs operations on the tree, including inserting unique integer keys, finding integer keys, and printing the tree using inorder and preorder traversals. The number of operations is a non-negative integer not exceeding 500,000, and the keys are integers within the range of -2,000,000,000 to 2,000,000,000. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_4` is to accept the root of a binary search tree and perform various operations such as inserting, finding, and printing the keys in the tree.
