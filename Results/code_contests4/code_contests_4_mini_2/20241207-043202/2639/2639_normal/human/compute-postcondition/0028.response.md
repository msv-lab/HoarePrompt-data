Postcondition: ***`top` is the root node of a binary search tree, `y` is the last node visited where `z.key` will be inserted, `x` is None, and `z.parent` is assigned the value of `y`. If `z.key` is less than `y.key`, then `y.left` is now `z`. Otherwise, `y.right` is now assigned the value of `z`.***
