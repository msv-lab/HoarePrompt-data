Functionality: ** The function accepts a node from a binary search tree and an integer key. It returns False if the node is None, True if the key of the node matches the provided key, and continues searching recursively in the left child if the key is less than the node's key, or in the right child if the key is greater. The function does not handle the case where the key is equal to the node's key in the context of further searching after the initial check, but it correctly navigates the binary search tree to find the key. **
