The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `top`, which is the root node of a binary search tree, and `z`, which is a list of operations. Each operation in `z` can either be 'insert k', 'find k', or 'print', where `k` is an integer that falls within the range of -2,000,000,000 to 2,000,000,000. The total number of operations in `z` does not exceed 500,000. After executing the function, it returns the modified root node `top` of the binary search tree. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a root node of a binary search tree and a list of operations that modify the tree based on the operations provided, ultimately returning the potentially modified root node. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `top`, which is the root node of a binary search tree, and a parameter `z`, which is a list of operations. It returns the modified root node `top` of the binary search tree after performing the operations specified in `z`.**
