Postcondition: ***`top` is the root node of a binary search tree. If `y` is None, then `top` is assigned the value of `z`, and `z.parent` is set to None. If `y` is not None, then `z.parent` is assigned the value of `y`, and if `z.key` is less than `y.key`, `y.left` is now `z`, otherwise `y.right` is now `z`.***
