The operation assigns `z` as the left child of `y`. Given that `z.key` is less than `y.key`, this insertion maintains the properties of the binary search tree. The parent of `z` is set to `y`, confirming the hierarchical relationship. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `top` is the root node of a binary search tree, `y` is the last node visited where `z.key` will be inserted, `x` is None, indicating search completion, `z.parent` is assigned the value of `y`, `z.key` is less than `y.key`, and `y.left` is now `z`.

Output State: **`top` is the root node of a binary search tree, `y` is the last node visited where `z.key` will be inserted, `x` is None, `z.parent` is assigned the value of `y`, `z.key` is less than `y.key`, and `y.left` is now `z`.**
