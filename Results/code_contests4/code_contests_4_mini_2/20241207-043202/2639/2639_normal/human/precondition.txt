The input consists of an integer m representing the number of operations (1 <= m <= 500,000), followed by m lines of operations that are either "insert k" or "find k" where k is an integer (-2,000,000,000 <= k <= 2,000,000,000). The "print" operation does not require additional input. All keys in the binary search tree are distinct.
