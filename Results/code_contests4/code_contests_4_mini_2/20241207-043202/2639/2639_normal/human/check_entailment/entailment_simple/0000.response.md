To analyze the correctness of the given Python program against the specified problem description, we need to check if the program implements the required operations on a binary search tree (BST): insertion, finding a key, and printing the tree in both inorder and preorder traversals.

1. **Insertion (`insert k`)**:
   - The function `func_1` handles the insertion of a new node into the BST. It correctly traverses the tree to find the appropriate parent node (`y`) for the new node (`z`), ensuring that the properties of the BST are maintained (left children are less than the parent, right children are greater).
   - The implementation correctly handles cases where the tree is empty (setting `top` to the new node) and correctly links the new node to its parent.

2. **Finding (`find k`)**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly searches for a key in the BST. It recursively traverses left if the key is less than the current node's key and right if it is greater. It returns `True` if the key is found and `False` otherwise.
   - This implementation follows the properties of a BST, ensuring that the search is efficient.

3. **Printing (`print`)**:
   - The functions `func_3` and `func_4` are intended for inorder and preorder traversals, respectively. However, the implementation of these functions does not seem to return or format the output correctly as specified in the problem description. 
   - The problem description specifies that there should be a space before each key printed during the inorder and preorder traversals, and the output should be on separate lines for each traversal. The current implementation only prints keys without ensuring this format.

4. **Output for `find` operations**:
   - The program does not seem to collect the results of the `find` operations to print them as specified in the description (i.e., "yes" or "no"). It simply executes the function without capturing or printing the results in the required format.

Based on the analysis, the program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description, particularly in the output formatting for the `print` operations and the handling of the `find` operations. 

Therefore, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **False** 

### Explanation:
The program fails to correctly format the output for the `print` operations and does not provide the expected results for the `find` operations as specified (i.e., printing "yes" or "no"). It also does not return the results in the required structured format. These issues mean that the program does not fulfill the problem's requirements in every potential case.
