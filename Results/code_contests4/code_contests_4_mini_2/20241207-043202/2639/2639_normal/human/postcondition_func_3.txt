The function accepts a node, which is the root of a binary search tree, and performs a preorder traversal of the tree. It prints the key of each node, preceded by a space, along with recursively traversing and printing the left and right children if they exist. The function does not handle the case where the node is None, which could lead to an error if called with a None value instead of a valid node.
