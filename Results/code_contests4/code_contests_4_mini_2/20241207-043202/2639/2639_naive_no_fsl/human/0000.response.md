To verify the correctness of the provided Python program based on the given problem description, we need to analyze its implementation against the specified requirements.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. **Insert `k`**: Insert a node containing `k` as a key into the binary search tree (BST).
2. **Find `k`**: Report whether the BST has a node containing `k`.
3. **Print**: Print the keys of the BST using inorder and preorder traversals.
4. **Constraints**: 
   - The total number of operations is ≤ 500,000.
   - The number of print operations is ≤ 10.
   - Keys in the BST are all different.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Insertion (func_1)**:
   - The `func_1` function correctly handles the insertion of nodes into the BST. It finds the appropriate position for the new node `z` based on its key and maintains the BST properties.
   - The function correctly assigns the parent of the newly inserted node.

2. **Finding (func_2)**:
   - The `func_2` function recursively searches for the key in the BST. It returns `True` if the key is found and `False` otherwise. This implementation adheres to the behavior expected from a search operation in a BST.

3. **Printing (func_3 and func_4)**:
   - The `func_3` function implements inorder traversal, which prints the keys of the BST in sorted order.
   - The `func_4` function implements preorder traversal, which prints the keys in a top-down manner.
   - Both functions correctly format the output with a leading space before each key.

### Edge Cases:
- The program does not handle the case where a duplicate key is attempted to be inserted. According to the constraints, the keys in the BST should be unique, but if the logic were to allow duplicate insertions, it would violate the BST property.
- The program does not handle the case where a "print" command is issued when the BST is empty. While not explicitly mentioned in the problem description, it would be reasonable to assume that the output should be handled gracefully.

### Conclusion:
Upon reviewing the code, it seems to correctly implement the required functionalities. However, while it adheres to the unique key constraint, it does not actively prevent duplicate insertions or handle empty trees gracefully when printing. Despite this, since the problem states that "the keys in the binary search tree are all different," we assume that the input adheres to this constraint. Therefore, this aspect does not invalidate the correctness under the given constraints.

Given that the implementation meets the requirements of insertion, searching, and printing correctly for valid inputs, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**
