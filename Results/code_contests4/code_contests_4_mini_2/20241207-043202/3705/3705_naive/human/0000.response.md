To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and the task it is meant to accomplish.

### Problem Overview
The problem describes a sequence of numbers being written in stages, alternating between odd and even numbers, with each stage writing double the number of numbers from the previous stage. The task is to compute the sum of numbers in a specified range [l, r].

### Code Analysis
```python
def func_1(n):
    f = 0
    s = 0
    p = 1
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    for i in range(100):
        if i % 2:
            s += min(p, n)
        else:
            f += min(p, n)
        n -= p
        if n <= 0:
            break
        p *= 2
    return f * f + s * (s + 1)

(l, r) = [int(i) for i in raw_input().split()]
print(func_1(r) - func_1(l - 1)) % 1000000007
```

### Key Points in the Code
1. **Stage Calculation**: The loop iterates a fixed number of times (100), which is arbitrary and may not cover all potential stages needed for large values of `r` (up to \(10^{18}\)).
2. **Sum Calculation Logic**: The sums for odd and even numbers are calculated in `f` and `s`, respectively. The logic of summing is somewhat unclear and may not handle the sequences correctly.
3. **Handling Large Ranges**: The function `func_1` relies on limiting the number of iterations to 100, which could lead to incorrect behavior when `n` is very large, as it may not compute enough terms to accurately reflect the sums needed.

### Potential Case
Let's consider a specific case where:
- Input: `l = 1`, `r = 10^18` (the upper limit).

In this case, the program would not iterate enough times (only 100) to account for the full range of numbers that would be generated in the sequence. The algorithm may terminate prematurely without calculating the correct sums for such large values.

Thus, there exists an input where the program does not compute the correct result due to the fixed iteration limit.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem statement, especially for large ranges of `l` and `r`. Therefore, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
