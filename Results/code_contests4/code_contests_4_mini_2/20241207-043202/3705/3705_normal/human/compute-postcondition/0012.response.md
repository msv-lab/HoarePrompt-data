The line `n -= p` decreases the value of `n` by `p`. Since `p` is initialized to 1, `n` is decreased by 1. The previous value of `n` is not specified other than it being not equal to 0, but we know it will now be 1 less than it was previously. The values of `l`, `r`, `f`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` and `r` are positive integers, `f` is 0 and `s` is 1 if `i` is an odd integer (1 if `i` is odd); if `i` is even, then `f` is 1 and `s` is 0; `p` is 1; `n` is now not equal to its previous value (decreased by 1); `i` is 0.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are positive integers, `f` is 0 and `s` is 1 if `i` is an odd integer; if `i` is even, then `f` is 1 and `s` is 0; `p` is 1; `n` is now not equal to its previous value (decreased by 1); `i` is 0.**
