Postcondition: ***`l` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer, `p` is multiplied by 2, `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute a hundredth time, and `i` is 100. If `i` is odd, `s` is increased by the minimum of `p` and `n`. Otherwise, `f` is increased by the minimum of `p` and `n`.***
