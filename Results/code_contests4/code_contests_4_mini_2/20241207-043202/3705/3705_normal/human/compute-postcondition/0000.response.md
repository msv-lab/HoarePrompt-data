`f` is assigned the value 0, and since there are no other variable changes, the output state only reflects this assignment. The values of `l` and `r` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `l` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer, `f` is 0.

Output State: **`l` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer, `f` is 0**
