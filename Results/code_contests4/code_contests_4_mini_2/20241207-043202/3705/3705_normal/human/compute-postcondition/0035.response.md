The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18. After executing the function body, if certain conditions are met, the function will return 0. In another case, the function returns the value of `f` squared plus `s` multiplied by `(s + 1)`, where `f` is the sum of the minimum of `p` and the values of `n` chosen in the even iterations of the loop, and `s` is the sum of the minimum of `p` and the values of `n` chosen in the odd iterations of the loop. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return either 0 or a calculated value based on the sums `f` and `s` derived from the values of `n`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, and returns 0 in certain cases, or a calculated value based on sums derived from n in other cases.**
