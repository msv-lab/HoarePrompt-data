The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer, `p` is multiplied by 2, `n` is now less than or equal to its previous value minus `p`, `i` is 100, and `s` and `f` are unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
