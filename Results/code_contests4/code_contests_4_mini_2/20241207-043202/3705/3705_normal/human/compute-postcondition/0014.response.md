The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` and `r` are positive integers, `f` is 0 and `s` is 1 if `i` is an odd integer; if `i` is even, then `f` is 1 and `s` is 0; `p` is 1; `n` is not equal to its previous value (decreased by 1); `i` is 0; and `n` is less than or equal to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
