The code `s += min(p, n)` updates the value of `s` by adding to it the minimum of `p` and `n`. Given the initial state, `p` has been multiplied by 2, and `n` is less than or equal to its previous value minus `p`. However, the exact values of `p` and `n` are not specified.

Since `p` is multiplied by 2 and `n` is less than or equal to some previous value minus `p`, we can deduce that `min(p, n)` will be determined by the specific values of `p` and `n`. 

As `s` is updated with the result of `min(p, n)`, this means `s` will change, but the final output state cannot specify exact values since `p` and `n` are not explicitly defined. The other variables `l`, `r`, `i`, and `f` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `s` has been updated based on the minimum of `p` and `n`, without providing specific values for those variables.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are positive integers; `p` has been multiplied by 2; `n` is less than or equal to its previous value minus `p`; `i` is 101; `s` has been updated by adding min(p, n); `f` is unchanged.**
