According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `i`, which is initialized to 100 in the first iteration. The range in the for loop is from 0 to 99, meaning that in order for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than 100. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 100. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented, which would result in `i` being 101, and it will not be able to execute again since 101 is not less than 100.

State: **`l` and `r` are positive integers; `p` is multiplied by 2; `n` is less than or equal to its previous value minus `p`; `i` is 101; `s` and `f` are unchanged; for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than 100.**
