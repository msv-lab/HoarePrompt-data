The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` and `r` are positive integers; `i` is 101; `s` is updated by adding the minimum of `p` and `n` if `i` is odd, and `f` remains unchanged; if `i` is even, `f` is increased by the minimum of `p` and `n`, and `s` remains unchanged; `p` has been multiplied by 2; `n` is less than or equal to its previous value minus `p`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
