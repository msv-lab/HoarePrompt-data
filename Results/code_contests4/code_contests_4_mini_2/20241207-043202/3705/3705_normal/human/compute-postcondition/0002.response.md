The variable `p` is assigned the value 1. The values of the other variables (`l`, `r`, `f`, and `s`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer, `f` is 0, `s` is 0; `p` is 1.

Output State: **`l` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer, `f` is 0, `s` is 0; `p` is 1**
