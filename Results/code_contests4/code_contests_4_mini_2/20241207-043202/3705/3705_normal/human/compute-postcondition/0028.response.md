Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are positive integers. If `i` is odd, `s` is updated by adding the minimum of `p` and `n`, while `f` remains unchanged. If `i` is even, `f` is increased by the minimum of `p` and `n`, while `s` remains unchanged. In both cases, `p` has been multiplied by 2, `n` is less than or equal to its previous value minus `p`, and `i` is 101.***
