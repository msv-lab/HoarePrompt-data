The value of `n` is decremented by `p`. Since `p` is multiplied by 2, we can denote it as `p = 2 * previous_p`. The previous value of `n` is greater than 0, so the operation will reduce the value of `n`. The values of `l`, `r`, `i`, `s`, and `f` remain unchanged, but `n` will be decreased by the value of `p`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer, `p` is multiplied by 2, `n` is now less than or equal to its previous value minus `p`, `i` is 100, and `s` and `f` are unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer, `p` is multiplied by 2, `n` is now less than or equal to its previous value minus `p`, `i` is 100, and `s` and `f` are unchanged.**
