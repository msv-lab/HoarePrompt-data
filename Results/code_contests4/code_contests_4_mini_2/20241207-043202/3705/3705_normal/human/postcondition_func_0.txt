The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns 0 if `n` is 0. If `n` is greater than 0, it calculates two sums: `f`, which is the sum of the minimum of `p` (which doubles each iteration) and `n` during even iterations, and `s`, which is the sum during odd iterations. The function then returns the result of the calculation `f * f + s * (s + 1)` based on these sums. The loop continues until `n` is decremented to 0 or below, ensuring that the calculations do not exceed the initial value of `n`.
