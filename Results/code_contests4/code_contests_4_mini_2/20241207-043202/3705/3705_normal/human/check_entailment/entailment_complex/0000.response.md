The given Python program is intended to compute the sum of numbers within a specific range based on the problem description provided. However, upon analyzing the program, it is evident that it does not fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description. 

### Explanation of the Problem Description:
1. The problem describes a sequence of numbers generated from two infinite sets: odd numbers and even numbers.
2. The numbers are written in stages, which alternate between odd and even sets, with each stage doubling the count of numbers written compared to the previous stage.
3. The task is to compute the sum of numbers indexed from `l` to `r`.

### Explanation of the Program:
1. The function `func_1(n)` is designed to calculate some values based on the input `n`, which is supposed to represent the range of indices. However, the logic does not construct or access the generated sequence of numbers.
2. The loop iterates a fixed number of times (100), which does not correspond to the infinite or variable nature of the sequence described in the problem.
3. The calculations within the loop do not accurately reflect the actual sequence that is generated according to the problem description, as it only accumulates values based on the current value of `n` and the variable `p`, which doubles but does not relate to the actual indices of the numbers in the sequence.
4. The return statement calculates `f * f + s * (s + 1)`, which is not a valid representation of the required sum of the numbers from index `l` to `r`.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to construct or access the specific numbers from the sequence as per the problem description, leading to incorrect calculations. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem requirements, and we conclude:

Correctness: **False**
