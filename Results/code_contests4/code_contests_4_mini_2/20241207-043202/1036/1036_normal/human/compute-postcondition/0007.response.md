According to the code, the loop executes as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 3. The loop can continue as long as `i` is still less than `n`, which means that `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `count` is equal to `n`, `i` is 3**
