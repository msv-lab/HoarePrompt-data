The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `count` remains equal to the previous value of `count`, `i` is 2, `b` remains equal to the previous value of `b`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
