According to the code, the loop is set to execute for values of `i` starting from 2 up to `n-1`. Since `n` is a positive integer and is guaranteed to be at least 2, the loop will execute at least once when `n` is 2, which means `i` will take the value of 2 in the first iteration.

The current state indicates that `count` is equal to `n`, but this variable is not involved in determining the execution of the loop. The key variables to consider are `i` and `n`. 

For the first execution of the loop:
- `i` should be initialized to 2, as that is the starting point specified in the range.
- The condition for the loop to execute is inherently satisfied since `n` is at least 2.

Thus, the adjusted states are:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `count` is equal to `n`, `i` is 2 for the loop to execute the first time**.
