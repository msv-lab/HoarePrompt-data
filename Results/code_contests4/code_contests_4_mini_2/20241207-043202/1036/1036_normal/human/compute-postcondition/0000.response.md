The variable `n` is reassigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts a new input and `int()` converts that input to an integer. This means the previous value of `n` is overwritten by the new integer input, which is still a positive integer and will satisfy the condition 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 based on new input**.
