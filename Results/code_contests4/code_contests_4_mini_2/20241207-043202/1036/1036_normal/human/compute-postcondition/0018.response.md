The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is updated based on whether it is composite or prime; `count` remains equal to the previous value of `count`; `i` remains unchanged; `b` remains equal to the previous value of `b`, and `b` is equal to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
