According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is not equal to 1. Right before the loop, `n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9 and `count` is equal to `n`. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 2, it will not equal 1 at the start. Therefore, the loop can execute one time without any adjustments needed.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `count` is equal to `n`**
