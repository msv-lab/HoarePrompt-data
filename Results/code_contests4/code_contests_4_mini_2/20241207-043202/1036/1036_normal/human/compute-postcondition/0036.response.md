The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2; `count` is updated by adding `b`; `i` is either equal to `n` or the smallest integer greater than 1 that does not divide `n`; `n` is decreased by `b`; and `b` is equal to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
