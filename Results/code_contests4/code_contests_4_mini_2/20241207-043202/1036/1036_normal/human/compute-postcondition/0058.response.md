The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates on a positive integer `n`, which is constrained to the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. The specific output of the function is not provided, so we cannot ascertain any return values or conditions based on the input. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept no parameters and operate on a predefined positive integer `n` within the specified constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and operates on a positive integer n such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.**
