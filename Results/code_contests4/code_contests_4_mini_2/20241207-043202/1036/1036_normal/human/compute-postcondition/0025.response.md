According to the code, the loop can execute again if the value of `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2, and `i` is currently 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 3. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`count` remains equal to its previous value, `i` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be greater than 3**
