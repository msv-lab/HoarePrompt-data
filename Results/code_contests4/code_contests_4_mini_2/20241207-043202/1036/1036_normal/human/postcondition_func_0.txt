The function accepts a positive integer `n` (with the constraint 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and calculates a cumulative count based on the quotients of `n` divided by its smallest divisor greater than 1, iterating until `n` reduces to 1. It prints the final count, which is the sum of all these quotients. However, the function does not return any value; it only prints the result.
