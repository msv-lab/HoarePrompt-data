The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `k`. The parameter `k` is an integer that represents the number of elements to consider from the list `b` and the list `p`. After executing the function body, the function returns two values: the updated value of the list `b` and the variable `left`, which is calculated as `a` minus the total reduction determined by the expression `max(0, bikes[i] - person[pi])` for each index `i` in the range of `k`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `k` and return the updated list `b` along with the value of `left`, which reflects the remaining amount after considering the reductions based on the elements in lists `b` and `p`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter k and returns the updated value of b and the value of left, which is equal to a minus the total reduction calculated by max(0, bikes[i] - person[pi]) for i in range(k).**
