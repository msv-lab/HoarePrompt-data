The variable `pi` is assigned the value `-k + i`. Given the initial state where `k` is greater than 1 and `i` is 1, we can calculate `pi` as follows:

Since `k` is greater than 1, we can denote it as some value greater than 1, say `k = 2` (for calculation purposes, but it can be any value greater than 1). Then:

```
pi = -k + i
pi = -2 + 1 = -1 
```

Thus, `pi` is now -1. The other variables (`left`, `b`, `k`, `i`) remain unchanged. The output state reflects the updated value of `pi`.

Output State: **`left` is reduced by a non-negative value, `b` is 0, `k` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `pi` is -1**
