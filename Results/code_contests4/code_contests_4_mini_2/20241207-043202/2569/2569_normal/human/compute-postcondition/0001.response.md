The value of `b` is assigned the value `0`. The previous state of `b` was a list of integers, but it is now overwritten by `0`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `a`, `p`, and `left`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5; `a` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ a ≤ 10^9; `p` is a list of m integers where each integer pj satisfies 1 ≤ pj ≤ 10^9; `left` is equal to `a`; `b` is now 0.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5; `a` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ a ≤ 10^9; `p` is a list of m integers where each integer pj satisfies 1 ≤ pj ≤ 10^9; `left` is equal to `a`; `b` is now 0.**
