The code assigns the value of `pi` as `-k + i`. Given that `k` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0, we can express `pi` as `-k + 0`, which simplifies to `-k`. 

Since `k` is greater than 0, `pi` will always be a negative integer. The values of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `a`, `left`, `b`) are unaffected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5; `a` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ a ≤ 10^9; `p` is a list of m integers where each integer pj satisfies 1 ≤ pj ≤ 10^9; `left` is equal to `a`; `b` is now 0; `k` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `pi` is -k.**
