The variable `left` is assigned the value of `a`. Since `a` is a non-negative integer within the range of 0 to 10^9, the value of `left` now reflects that same value. The states of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `b`, and `p`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5; `a` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ a ≤ 10^9; `b` is a list of n integers where each integer bi satisfies 1 ≤ bi ≤ 10^4; `p` is a list of m integers where each integer pj satisfies 1 ≤ pj ≤ 10^9; `left` is equal to `a`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5; `a` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ a ≤ 10^9; `b` is a list of n integers where each integer bi satisfies 1 ≤ bi ≤ 10^4; `p` is a list of m integers where each integer pj satisfies 1 ≤ pj ≤ 10^9; `left` is equal to `a`**.
