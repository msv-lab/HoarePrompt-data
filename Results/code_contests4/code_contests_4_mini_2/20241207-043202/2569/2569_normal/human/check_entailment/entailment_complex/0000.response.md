Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Indexing Logic**: The line `pi = -k + i` is attempting to index into the `person` list incorrectly. This will lead to incorrect indexing when `k` exceeds the number of boys, or at the very least, does not align with the intended logic of associating boys to bikes based on their available personal money.

2. **Failure to Sort Lists**: The problem requires that the bikes and personal money be managed in a way that maximizes the number of boys who can rent bikes while minimizing the total personal money spent. To achieve this, the program should sort both the list of boys' personal money and the list of bike prices. The current implementation does not take sorting into account, which is essential for properly matching boys to the cheapest available bikes they can afford.

3. **Logic of Remaining Budget**: The program's handling of the `left` variable, which is intended to represent the shared budget, does not correctly reflect the budget constraints. The calculation of `left` does not take into account the possibility that shared budget may need to be used to subsidize costs beyond what boys can personally afford.

4. **Output Values**: The return values from the function do not match the expected output format of the problem description. The problem expects to return both the maximum number of boys who can ride bikes and the total personal money spent by them. The current logic is flawed in how it calculates the total personal money spent.

In summary, the program fails to capture the necessary logic for maximizing the number of schoolboys who can rent bikes while minimizing personal expenses, and it does not properly handle the relationships between the boys and the bikes. This leads to the conclusion that the program does not fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description.
