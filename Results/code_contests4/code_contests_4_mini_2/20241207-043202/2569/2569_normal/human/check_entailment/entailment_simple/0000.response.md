Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Misinterpretation of Inputs**: The function `func_1(k)` has parameters that do not correspond to the problem's requirements. The program should be processing the boys' personal budgets and the bike prices directly, rather than manipulating a variable `k` which seems to represent the number of iterations without clear context.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Remaining Budget**: The line `left -= max(0, bikes[i] - person[pi])` attempts to determine how much of the shared budget is left after attempting to rent bikes, but it does so in a way that does not take into account how many boys can actually afford the bikes. The logic does not ensure that it checks if each boy can afford the bike with their personal money before adjusting the shared budget.

3. **Mismanagement of Personal Budget Calculation**: The variable `b` is intended to track the total personal money spent. The line `b += min(person[pi], bikes[i])` does not correctly calculate the minimum total of personal money needed for the boys who can actually rent the bikes. It uses an incorrect index `pi = -k + i`, which does not correspond to the boys' indices or their personal budgets correctly.

4. **Return Values Misalignment**: The function returns `b` and `left`, which does not align with the expected output format of `r` (the number of boys who can rent bikes) and `s` (the minimum total personal money spent). The values returned do not represent the desired metrics outlined in the problem statement.

In summary, the program incorrectly processes the inputs and fails to accurately compute the number of schoolboys who can rent bikes and the associated costs. Thus, it does not fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description.
