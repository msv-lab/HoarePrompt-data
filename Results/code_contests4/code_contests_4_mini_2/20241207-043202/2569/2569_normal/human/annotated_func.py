#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5; a is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ a ≤ 10^9; b is a list of n integers where each integer bi satisfies 1 ≤ bi ≤ 10^4; p is a list of m integers where each integer pj satisfies 1 ≤ pj ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(k):
    left = a
    b = 0
    for i in range(k):
        pi = -k + i
        
        left -= max(0, bikes[i] - person[pi])
        
        b += min(person[pi], bikes[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `left` is equal to `a` minus the total reduction calculated by max(0, bikes[i] - person[pi]) for i in range(k), `b` is the sum of min(person[pi], bikes[i]) for i in range(k), `k` is the number of iterations executed (0 ≤ k ≤ m).
    b -= left
    return b, left
    #The program returns the updated value of b and the value of left, which is equal to a minus the total reduction calculated by max(0, bikes[i] - person[pi]) for i in range(k)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `k` and calculates two values: `b`, which is updated to be the total number of bikes allocated to individuals (limited by their capacity), and `left`, which represents the remaining capacity after accounting for the maximum bikes that could be taken by individuals. It returns the updated value of `b` and the remaining capacity `left`. The function does not handle cases where `k` exceeds the length of the lists `bikes` or `person`, which could lead to index errors if not properly managed.
