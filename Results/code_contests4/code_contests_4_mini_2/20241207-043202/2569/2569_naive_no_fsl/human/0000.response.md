To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the given problem description, let's analyze the code step by step:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of schoolboys `n`, the number of bikes `m`, and the shared budget `a`.
   - It then collects the personal budgets of the boys and the renting prices of the bikes.

2. **Sorting:**
   - Both the personal budgets of the boys and the bike prices are sorted. This is a common approach to optimize the allocation of resources (in this case, bikes).

3. **Binary Search:**
   - The program uses binary search to find the maximum number of schoolboys (`k`) who can rent bikes.
   - The function `func_1(k)` calculates the total personal money spent and the remaining left of the shared budget after attempting to rent `k` bikes.

4. **Logic of `func_1`:**
   - In this function, for each boy trying to rent a bike, it checks if the rental price can be covered by their personal budget, and it also accounts for the shared budget.
   - The function returns the total personal money spent and the remaining budget.

5. **Output:**
   - Finally, it outputs the maximum number of schoolboys who can rent bikes and the minimum total personal money needed.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **No Bikes Available:**
   - If `m` is 0, the output should be `0 0`, but the code does not explicitly handle the case of no bikes.

2. **All Boys Have Insufficient Funds:**
   - If all boys have personal budgets less than the cheapest bike, the output should also be `0 0`.

3. **Exact Budget Matching:**
   - Cases where the combined personal budgets equal the exact cost of the bikes should be tested to ensure the program correctly accounts for the shared budget and personal budgets.

4. **Exceeding Shared Budget:**
   - If the total cost of all bikes exceeds the shared budget with boys having enough personal funds, the program should still return the right number of boys who can rent bikes and the correct personal money spent.

### Conclusion:
Upon reviewing these scenarios, I can see that the program does not explicitly handle the case where there are no bikes available (`m = 0`). This would result in an incorrect output for such an input scenario, indicating that the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description under all potential cases.

Therefore, I conclude that the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
