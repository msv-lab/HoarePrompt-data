To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze what the program is supposed to do according to the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input Details**:
   - `n`: Number of boys.
   - `m`: Number of bikes.
   - `a`: Total shared budget.
   - `b[i]`: Personal money of the `i-th` boy.
   - `p[j]`: Price to rent the `j-th` bike.

2. **Output Requirements**:
   - Two integers: the maximum number of boys who can rent bikes (`r`) and the minimum total personal money they need to spend to rent those bikes (`s`).

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Sorting**:
   - The program sorts the personal budgets and bike prices, which is crucial for efficiently pairing boys with bikes.

2. **Binary Search**:
   - The program attempts to find the maximum number of boys that can rent bikes using binary search.
   - It checks the feasibility of letting `mid` boys rent bikes by calling `func_1(mid)`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates how much personal money is spent by the selected boys and how much of the shared budget remains.
   - The logic seems to ensure that boys are matched with bikes without exceeding their personal budgets and the shared budget.

### Edge Cases and Testing:
Now, let's consider potential edge cases:
- Scenario where all boys have personal money less than the cheapest bike.
- Scenario where the shared budget `a` is zero.
- Scenarios where there are more boys than bikes and vice versa.

### Potential Case for Failure:
Consider the following input where the cheapest bike is more expensive than all boys' personal budgets:
```
Input:
3 2 10
1 2 3
5 6
```
Expected Output:
```
r = 0, s = 0
```
However, the program may count the boys without properly checking if they can afford even the cheapest bike with their personal money. The implementation of how it checks the feasibility in `func_1` may not correctly handle this.

### Conclusion:
The program does not account for the situation where the boys' personal budgets are insufficient for the available bikes, leading to a potential miscalculation of `r` and `s`.

Correctness: **False**.
