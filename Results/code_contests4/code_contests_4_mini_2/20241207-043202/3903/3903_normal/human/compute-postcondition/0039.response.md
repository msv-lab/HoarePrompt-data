The value of `maximum_count` is assigned the maximum of its current value and the value of `count`. Since `maximum_count` is either 0 or equal to `count`, the new value of `maximum_count` will be either `count` (if `count` is greater than 0) or remain 0 (if `count` is 0). The other variables `n`, `b`, and `end` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `maximum_count` is either 0 or `count`; `start` is less than or equal to `end`; `b` is a list with indices from `start` to `end` toggled; `count` is the sum of elements in `b`; `end` is now `end + 1`.
