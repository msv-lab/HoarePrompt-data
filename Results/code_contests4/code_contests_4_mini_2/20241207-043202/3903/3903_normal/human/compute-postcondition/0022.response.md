The value at index `i` of the list `b` is updated from its previous value to `1 - b[i]`. The other variables are not affected. The value of `i` is `start + 1`, which is within the bounds of the list `b`. The output state will reflect the updated value of `b[i]`, but we do not know the specific previous value of `b[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `maximum_count` is either 0 or `count`, `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `b` contains updated values with b[i] now being 1 - b[i], `count` is the sum of the values in `b` from index `start` to `end`, `i` is `start + 1`.**
