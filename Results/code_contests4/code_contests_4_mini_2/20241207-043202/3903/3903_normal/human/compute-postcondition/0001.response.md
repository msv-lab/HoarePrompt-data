The variable `a` is assigned the value of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which processes the input from `raw_input()`, splitting it into separate elements, converting each element to an integer, and creating a map object. The previous values of `n` remain unchanged, but the list of integers is now being read from input. Therefore, the output state reflects that `a` now represents a map of integers based on the input provided.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a map of integers from input (0 or 1)**
