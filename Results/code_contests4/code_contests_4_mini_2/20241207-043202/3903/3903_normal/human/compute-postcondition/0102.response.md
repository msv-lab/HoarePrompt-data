The value of `b[i]` is toggled from its previous value. Since `b[i]` can either be 0 or 1, after executing `b[i] = 1 - b[i]`, if `b[i]` was 0, it becomes 1, and if it was 1, it becomes 0. The values of `n`, `start`, `end`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `start` is equal to `n`; `end` is at least `n + 2`; `i` is `n + 2`; `b[i]` is toggled to its opposite value (0 to 1 or 1 to 0).

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `start` is equal to `n`; `end` is at least `n + 2`; `i` is `n + 2`; `b[i]` is toggled to its opposite value (0 to 1 or 1 to 0).**
