The code attempts to toggle the value of `b[i]` by setting it to `1 - b[i]`. However, since `b` is not defined due to the absence of `a`, this line will result in an error, and no values can be assigned to `b`. Therefore, the values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `start` is equal to `n`, `end` is equal to `n`, and `b` is not defined due to the absence of `a`.**
