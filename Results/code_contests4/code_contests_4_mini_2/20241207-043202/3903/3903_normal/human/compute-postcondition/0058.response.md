According to the code, the loop will execute based on the values of `start` and `end`. The loop iterates from `start` to `end + 1`, so `end` must be greater than or equal to `start` for the loop to execute at least once. Given that `end` is `k + 1`, we need to ensure that `start` is less than or equal to `end`. 

Since `n` is an integer within the range of 1 to 100, it does not directly affect the execution of the loop but could provide context for values of `start` and `end`. However, the key states to ensure the loop executes are `start` and `end`.

Assuming `start` is a valid integer that satisfies the condition (1 ≤ `start` ≤ `end`), before the loop starts, the first iteration will have `i` initialized to `start`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute the first time, we need to confirm:
- `end` is at least `start` (meaning `k + 1` must be at least `start`).
- `i` is initialized to `start`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `start` is valid, `end` is `k + 1`, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is `start`**
