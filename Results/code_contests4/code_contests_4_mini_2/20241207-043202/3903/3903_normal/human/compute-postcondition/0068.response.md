According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `end` and the integer `n`. The loop will execute as long as `end` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `end` is `k + 1`, which is guaranteed to be less than or equal to `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `end` needs to be incremented by 1.

At the end of the last iteration, `end` is `k + 1`. Therefore, to execute the loop again, `end` must be `k + 2`, and `n` must remain the same, as it defines the upper limit for `end`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `start` is valid, `end` is `k + 2`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `k + 2.**
