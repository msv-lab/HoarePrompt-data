The code assigns the maximum of `maximum_count` and `count` to `maximum_count`. The values of `maximum_count` and `count` are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine their exact values. However, we know that `count` is the sum of `b` after toggling `b[n]` once, and `maximum_count` retains its prior value unless `count` exceeds it.

Thus, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `start` is equal to `n`; `end` is equal to `n`; `i` is `n`; `count` is the sum of `b` after toggling `b[n]` once; `maximum_count` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `count`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `start` is equal to `n`; `end` is equal to `n`; `i` is `n`; `count` is the sum of `b` after toggling `b[n]` once; `maximum_count` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `count`.**
