In the given code snippet, `b[i]` is being assigned the value `1 - b[i]`. 

We know that:
- `i` is `n + 2`, which means it is an integer greater than or equal to 3 (since `n` is at least 1).
- The value of `b[i]` will be toggled between 0 and 1 depending on its current value.

The impact of the code is that it modifies the value of `b[i]`. However, we do not have information about the initial value of `b[i]`, so we cannot determine the final state of `b[i]`. 

Thus, the output state reflects that `b[i]` changes based on its current value but we cannot specify the exact outcome.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `start` is equal to `n`, `end` is equal to `n + 1`, `i` is `n + 2`, and `b[i]` is toggled between 0 and 1.**
