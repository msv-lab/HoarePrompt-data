Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `maximum_count` is either 0 or `count`; `start` is less than or equal to `end`. If `start` is less than or equal to `end`, then `b` is a list with indices from `start` to `end` toggled, `count` is the sum of elements in `b`, and `end` is now `end + 1.***
