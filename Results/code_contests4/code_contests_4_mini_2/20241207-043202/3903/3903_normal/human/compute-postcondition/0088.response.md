The code snippet assigns a value to `b[i]`, where `i` is equal to `n + 1`. In this context, `b[i]` is updated to `1 - b[i]`. However, since `i` is equal to `n + 1`, we need to ensure that `b` is defined for that index. Given that the loop has previously executed and `i` is `n + 1`, the output state will reflect that the assignment takes place at the index `n + 1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `start` is equal to `n`; `end` is equal to `n`; `i` is `n + 1`; and `b[i]` is updated to `1 - b[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `start` is equal to `n`; `end` is equal to `n`; `i` is `n + 1`; and `b[i]` is updated to `1 - b[i]`.**
