According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `start` and `end`. For the loop to execute, the condition `start` must be less than or equal to `end`. Given that `end` is initialized to 0, `start` must also be less than or equal to 0 for the loop to run. Since `start` is stated as an incremented value, it is likely greater than 0, which means the current state will not allow the loop to execute.

To allow the loop to execute, we need to adjust the states so that `start` is less than or equal to `end`. Therefore, we can set `start` to be 0 (or a negative value if permitted by the context) to satisfy the condition.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `maximum_count` is the maximum count of 1s found in `b`, `start` is 0, `end` is 0 for the loop to execute, `b` is now a list created from `a`**
