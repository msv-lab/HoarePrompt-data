The loop toggles the elements of the list `b` between 0 and 1 for each index from `start` to `end` (inclusive). After all iterations of the loop have executed, each element in the list `b` at the indices from `start` to `end` will have been toggled an odd number of times if the index is within that range, and will retain its original value if the index is outside of that range.

If `start` is greater than `end`, the loop will not execute, and all elements in `b` will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `start` is valid, `end` is `k + 1`, `b[i]` is toggled for all `i` in the range [start, end], and unchanged for all other indices in `b`.**
