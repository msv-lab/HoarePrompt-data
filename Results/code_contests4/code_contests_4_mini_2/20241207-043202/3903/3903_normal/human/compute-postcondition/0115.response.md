To analyze the program state after the for loop, we observe the initial state and the loop code provided:

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `start` is equal to `n`, `end` is `n`, `b` cannot be created as `a` is not defined.

The loop code:
```
for i in range(start, end + 1):
    b[i] = 1 - b[i]
```

From the initial state, we see that `start` is `n` and `end` is `n`, so the loop will iterate only once, where `i` will take the value `n`.

During the first execution of the loop:
- `b[n]` is toggled (1 - b[n]).

After the first iteration:
- `start` remains `n`, `end` remains `n`, and `i` equals `n`.
- The value `b[n]` has been toggled.

Since the loop only executes one time due to `start` and `end` being equal, we conclude that after all the iterations of the loop have finished, `b[n]` will have been toggled once.

Thus, the output state after the loop has executed is as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `start` is equal to `n`, `end` is equal to `n`, `i` is `n`, and `b[n]` is toggled once.**
