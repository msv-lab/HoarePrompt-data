The value of `b[i]` is updated to `1 - b[i]`, which means if `b[i]` was 0, it becomes 1, and if it was 1, it becomes 0. Since `i` is equal to `start`, this specifically changes the value at index `start` in list `b`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `maximum_count` is either 0 or `count`, `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `b` contains updated values based on the change at index `start`, `count` is the sum of the values in `b` from index `start` to `end`, `i` is `start`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `maximum_count` is either 0 or `count`, `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `b` contains updated values based on the change at index `start`, `count` is the sum of the values in `b` from index `start` to `end`, `i` is `start`.**
