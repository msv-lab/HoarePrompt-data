Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; if `start` is less than or equal to `end`, then `maximum_count` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `count`, `start` retains its final value, `end` retains its final value, `b` is the list with toggled values at indices from `start` to `end`, and `count` is the sum of the values in list `b`.***
