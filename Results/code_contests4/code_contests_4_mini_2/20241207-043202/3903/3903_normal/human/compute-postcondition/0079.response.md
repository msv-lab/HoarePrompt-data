Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `start` is valid, `end` is `k + 2`. If `start` is less than or equal to `end`, then `count` is the sum of the toggled values in `b` for each `i` in the range from `start` to `end` inclusive, and `maximum_count` is updated to the maximum of `maximum_count` and `count`.***
