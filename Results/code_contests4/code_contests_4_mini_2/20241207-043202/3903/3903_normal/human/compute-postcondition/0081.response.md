According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `start` and the upper limit `n`. The loop will execute as long as `start` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `start` is equal to the final value after all iterations, which means it is currently `n - 1` if `start` is less than `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `start` must be incremented by 1, leading to `start` being equal to `n`. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `start`, which would be `n` and `start` will be incremented to `n`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `start` is `n`, for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than `n`.**
