According to the code, the loop iterates from `start` to `end`, inclusive. The current state shows that `start` is equal to `n`, `end` is also equal to `n`, and `i` is `n`. Since the loop is defined to run for `i` in the range from `start` to `end + 1`, it indicates that the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `end`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n`, which is also the value of `end`. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `n + 1`. For the loop to execute again, both `start` and `end` must allow for this increment. Since `end` is `n`, which allows for a `next` iteration only if `i` is less than or equal to `end`, we need to ensure that `end` is at least `n + 1`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `start` is equal to `n`, `end` is equal to `n + 1`, `i` is `n + 1`**
