The code assigns `maximum_count` the maximum value between its current value and `count`. The variables `maximum_count` and `count` are both integers, but their specific values are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects that `maximum_count` will be updated to the greater of the two values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `start` is valid; `end` is `k + 2; count` is the sum of the toggled values in `b` for each `i` in the range from `start` to `end` inclusive; `maximum_count` is updated to the maximum of `maximum_count` and `count`.**
