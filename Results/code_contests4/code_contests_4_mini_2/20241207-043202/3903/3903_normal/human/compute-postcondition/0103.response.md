To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop and its effects. 

The loop iterates from `start` to `end`, toggling the values in list `b` at index `i`. Given that `start` is equal to `n` and the loop continues until `end`, which can be at least `n + 2` (as indicated in the output states provided), we can conclude:

1. The loop will execute `end - start + 1` times, which means when the loop starts at `n` and goes to `n + 2`, it will execute a total of 3 times (for `i = n`, `i = n + 1`, and `i = n + 2`).
2. Each execution toggles the value of `b[i]` at the corresponding index. Since toggling occurs, the final value of `b[i]` will depend on its initial value before the loop starts.

After all iterations of the loop have completed:

- `b[n]` will be toggled once (from its initial value).
- `b[n + 1]` will be toggled once (from its initial value).
- `b[n + 2]` will also be toggled once (from its initial value).

Thus, after the loop completes, given that all indices are toggled exactly once, the final output state will reflect the toggled state of `b` at these indices.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `start` is equal to `n`; `end` is at least `n + 2; b[n]` is toggled from its initial value; `b[n + 1]` is toggled from its initial value; `b[n + 2]` is toggled from its initial value.**
