Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `start` is the final value after all iterations; `end` is `n - 1` if `start` is less than `n`; `maximum_count` is the maximum count of 1s found in `b` after all toggles; `b` contains toggled values based on indices from `start` to `end`, and `count` is the sum of the values in list `b` after the last iteration.**
