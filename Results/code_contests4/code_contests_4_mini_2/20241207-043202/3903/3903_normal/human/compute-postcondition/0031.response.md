According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `start` and `end`. The `range(start, end + 1)` function will create a range of integers starting from `start` and ending at `end` (inclusive). For the loop to execute at least once, `start` must be less than or equal to `end`.

Given that `end` is currently `end + 1`, we need to adjust `end` back to its original value to ensure that the loop can execute. As `start` is already less than or equal to `end`, we don't need to change it. 

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:
- Set `end` back to its original value (which is now `end - 1`).

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `maximum_count` is either 0 or `count`; `start` is less than or equal to `end - 1; b` is a list created from `a`, `end` is now `end - 1`**
