According to the code, the loop's ability to execute again depends on the value of `end` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `end` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `start` is equal to `n`, and since `start` is not less than or equal to `end`, there is no error. 

Given that `end` is currently at its maximum value of `n-1` for the loop to execute one more time, `end` needs to increase by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `end` must be `n`. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `start` is equal to `n`, for the loop to execute a second time `end` must be equal to `n`**
