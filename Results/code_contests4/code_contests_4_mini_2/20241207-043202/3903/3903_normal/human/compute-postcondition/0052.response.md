Based on the provided information regarding the loop and its iterations, we can deduce the following:

- The loop toggles the values of `b[i]`, changing 1s to 0s and 0s to 1s.
- The iterations of the loop will depend on the values of `start` and `end`.
- If `start` is less than or equal to `end`, the loop executes for all indices from `start` to `end`.

After analyzing the loop’s structure and the given states after the first few iterations, we can conclude:

1. If the loop executes, it will toggle `b[i]` for each index from `start` to `end`.
2. The final value of `end` after all iterations will dictate how many times the toggling occurs.
3. If `start` is equal to `end`, `b[i]` will be toggled once.
4. If the loop does not execute (when `start` is greater than `end`), `b` remains unchanged.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop have concluded:

- `n` remains as an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100.
- `maximum_count` remains the maximum count of 1s found in `b`.
- `start` will still hold its final value.
- `end` will reflect the last value it was set to.
- `b` will contain the modified values after all toggles have been applied.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `maximum_count` is the maximum count of 1s found in `b`, `start` is the final value of `start`, `end` is the final value of `end`, `b` is the list with toggled values at indices from `start` to `end`.**
