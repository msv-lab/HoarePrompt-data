The value of `b[i]` is updated to be `1 - b[i]`. Since `i` is equal to `n`, we are modifying the value of `b[n]`. The initial value of `b[n]` is unknown since it is not provided in the initial state; thus, we cannot determine the exact value after the operation. However, we know that the value of `b[n]` will be toggled (if it was 0, it becomes 1, and if it was 1, it becomes 0). The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `start` is equal to `n`, `end` is equal to `n`, `i` is `n`, and `b[n]` is toggled (1 - b[n]).**
