The code attempts to assign a value to `maximum_count` using the `max` function, which compares `maximum_count` and `count`. However, since `maximum_count` and `count` are not defined in the initial state, this results in an error. The previous values of the affected variables cannot be checked since they do not exist. Therefore, the output state indicates the error.

Output State: **Error: variable `maximum_count` is not defined, variable `count` is not defined**
