The value of `b[i]` is toggled to `1 - b[i]`, meaning if `b[i]` was `0`, it becomes `1`, and if it was `1`, it becomes `0`. The value of `i` is `start + 1`, and since `b[i]` is being modified, we know that `b[i]` will change its state based on its previous value. Other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `start` is valid, `end` is `k + 1`, `i` is `start + 1`, and `b[i]` is toggled to `1 - b[i]`.**
