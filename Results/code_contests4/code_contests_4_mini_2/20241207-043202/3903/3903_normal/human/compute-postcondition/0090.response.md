The value of `b[i]` is updated to `1 - b[i]`. The previous value of `b[i]` is not specified, but since `i` is equal to `n + 2`, `b[i]` will take on the opposite value (0 becomes 1 and 1 becomes 0). The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `start` is equal to `n`, `end` is greater than or equal to `n + 2`, `i` is `n + 2`, and `b[i]` has been toggled (updated to `1 - b[i]`).

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `start` is equal to `n`, `end` is greater than or equal to `n + 2`, `i` is `n + 2`, and `b[i]` has been toggled (updated to `1 - b[i]`).**
