Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `start` is equal to `n`, and `end` is at least `n + 2. If `start` is less than or equal to `end`, then `b[n]`, `b[n + 1]`, and `b[n + 2]` are toggled, `count` is the sum of the toggled values of `b`, and `maximum_count` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `count`.***
