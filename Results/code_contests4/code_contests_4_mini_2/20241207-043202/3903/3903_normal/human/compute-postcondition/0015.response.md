The code updates the variable `maximum_count` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `count`. The previous values of the variables are `maximum_count` is 0 and `count` is the sum of the values in `b` from index `start` to `end`. Therefore, `maximum_count` will be updated to either 0 or the value of `count`. Since `count` is a sum of values and can be greater than 0, we conclude that `maximum_count` will take the value of `count` if it is greater than 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `maximum_count` is either 0 or `count`; `start` is less than or equal to `end`; `end` is at least `start`; `b` contains toggled values from index `start` to `end`; `count` is the sum of the values in `b` from index `start` to `end.**
