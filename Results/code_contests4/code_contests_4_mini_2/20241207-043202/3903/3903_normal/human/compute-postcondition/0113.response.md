According to the code, the loop iterates from `start` to `end + 1`. Given that `start` is equal to `n` and `end` is equal to `n + 1`, the loop will execute for `i` values starting from `n` to `n + 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` would need to be incremented to `n + 2`. However, the loop condition specifies that `i` must be less than or equal to `end + 1`, which is `n + 2`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be within the range such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 100` remains satisfied.

Thus, after the last iteration, we adjust the value of `i` to `n + 2`, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must still satisfy the boundary conditions.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `start` is equal to `n`, `end` is equal to `n + 1`, `i` is `n + 2` for the loop to execute a third time.**
