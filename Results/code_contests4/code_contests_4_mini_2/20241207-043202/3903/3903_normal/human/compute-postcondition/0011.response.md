According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `start`, and `end`. The loop will execute while `i` is in the range from `start` to `end + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `start` is 0, and `end` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

Since `i` is currently 1, the next value of `i` will be 2. The loop will execute again as long as `i` remains less than or equal to `end`. Given that `end` is at least 1, for the loop to execute again, `end` must be at least 2.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `i` will change from 1 to 2.
- `end` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `maximum_count` is 0, `start` is 0, `end` is at least 2, `i` is 2; `b[i]` is toggled between 0 and 1.**
