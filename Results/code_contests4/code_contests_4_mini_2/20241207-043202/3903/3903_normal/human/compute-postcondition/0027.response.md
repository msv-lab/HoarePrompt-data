The code assigns `maximum_count` the maximum value between its current value and `count`. Given that `maximum_count` is either 0 or the value of `count`, it will now hold the greater of these two values. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `maximum_count` is either 0 or `count`, `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `b` contains updated values with each element from index `start` to `end` toggled, `count` is updated to the sum of the values in `b` from index `start` to `end`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `maximum_count` is either 0 or `count`, `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `b` contains updated values with each element from index `start` to `end` toggled, `count` is updated to the sum of the values in `b` from index `start` to `end, `maximum_count` is now the maximum of its previous value and `count`.**
