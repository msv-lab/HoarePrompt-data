To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, let's analyze the loop and the initial state provided.

- The loop iterates from `start` to `end`, toggling the values in the list `b` at each index `i`.
- The final value of `end` is now `end + 1`, meaning that after the loop completes, `end` will be one index past the last index that was toggled.

Considering the output states provided after each iteration:
1. After the first iteration, `b[i]` is toggled, and `end` is decreased by 1.
2. After the second iteration, `b[i]` (where `i` is now equal to `end`) is toggled again.
3. After the third iteration, `i` is equal to `end + 1`, indicating that no further changes have been made, and the loop has effectively completed.

At the end of the loop:
- The range of `i` would have covered from `start` to `end`, meaning that all indices from `start` to `end` have had their values toggled.
- `end` will be `end + 1` (as stated in the initial state).

Based on this understanding, the final output state after all iterations of the loop would be:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `maximum_count` is either 0 or `count`; `start` is less than or equal to `end; b` is a list with indices from `start` to `end` toggled; `end` is now `end + 1`.**
