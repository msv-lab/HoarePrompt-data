The variable `count` is assigned the value of `sum(b)`. The value of `b` is a list with indices from `start` to `end`, which means it contains elements that can be either 0 or 1 (toggled). The sum function will calculate the total number of 1's in the list `b`, resulting in a specific integer value for `count`. The initial states of `n`, `maximum_count`, `start`, and `end` remain unchanged, but `count` now holds the sum of the elements in the list `b`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `maximum_count` is either 0 or `count`; `start` is less than or equal to `end; b` is a list with indices from `start` to `end` toggled; `count` is the sum of elements in `b`; `end` is now `end + 1`.**
