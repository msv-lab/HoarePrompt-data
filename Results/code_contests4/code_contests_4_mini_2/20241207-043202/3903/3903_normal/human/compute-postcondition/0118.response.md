Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `start` is equal to `n`; `end` is equal to `n`; if `start` is less than or equal to `end`, then `i` is set to `n`, `count` is the sum of `b` after toggling `b[n]` once, and `maximum_count` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `count`.***
