According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `end` and the value of `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `end` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `end` has reached its final value within the range, specifically at `end = k` (where `k` is the final value it held before the loop condition was checked). 

For the loop to execute one more time, `end` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `end` will become `k + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `k + 1`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `start` retains its final value, `end` is `k + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than `k + 1`**.
