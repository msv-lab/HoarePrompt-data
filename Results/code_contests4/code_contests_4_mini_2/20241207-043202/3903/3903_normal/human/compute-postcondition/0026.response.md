The variable `count` is assigned the value of `sum(b)`, which calculates the sum of the elements in the list `b` from index `start` to `end`. The previous value of `count` is not specified, but it will now be updated to the sum of the specified range in `b`. The other variables `n`, `maximum_count`, `start`, `end`, and the contents of `b` are not directly altered by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `maximum_count` is either 0 or `count`, `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `b` contains updated values with each element from index `start` to `end` toggled, and `count` is now updated to the sum of the values in `b` from index `start` to `end`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `maximum_count` is either 0 or `count`, `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `b` contains updated values with each element from index `start` to `end` toggled, `count` is updated to the sum of the values in `b` from index `start` to `end.**
