According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `start`, `end`, and `i`. The loop iterates from `start` to `end`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `start` is equal to `n`, `end` is at least `n`, and `i` is also `n`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1. Therefore, `i` will become `n + 1`. To ensure that the loop can execute again, `end` must be at least `n + 1`. 

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` will be `n + 1`
- For the loop to execute a second time, `end` must be at least `n + 1`

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `start` is equal to `n`; `end` is at least `n + 1`; `i` is `n + 1`; `b[i]` is toggled between 0 and 1**
