Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `maximum_count` is either 0 or `count`, and `start` is less than or equal to `end`. If `start` is less than or equal to `end`, then `b` contains updated values with each element from index `start` to `end` toggled, `count` is updated to the sum of the values in `b` from index `start` to `end`, and `maximum_count` is now the maximum of its previous value and `count`.***
