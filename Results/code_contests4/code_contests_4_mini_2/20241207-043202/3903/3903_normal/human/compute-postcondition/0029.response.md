According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `end` and the upper limit `n`. If `end` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `end` is currently less than `n`. 

Since `end` is in the range from 0 to `n-1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `end` will be increased by 1. Therefore, it will be `end + 1`, and for the loop to execute again, `end` must be less than `n`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `maximum_count` is either 0 or `count`, and `start` is less than or equal to `end`, for the loop to execute a second time `end` must be less than `n`, and `end` is now `end + 1`.**
