Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `maximum_count` is either 0 or `count`; if `start` is less than or equal to `end`, then `end` is at least `start`, `b` contains toggled values from index `start` to `end`, and `count` is the sum of the values in `b` from index `start` to `end.***
