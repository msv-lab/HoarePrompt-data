The `print(maximum_count)` statement outputs the value of `maximum_count`. The value of `maximum_count` is not changed by this statement; it simply prints its current value. Since the initial state specifies that `maximum_count` holds the maximum count of 1s found in all possible toggled versions of the map `a`, we can assume it is an integer value based on the context provided.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `maximum_count` is printed; `b` is a list of integers that may contain toggled values based on the indices from all possible pairs of `start` and `end`.**
