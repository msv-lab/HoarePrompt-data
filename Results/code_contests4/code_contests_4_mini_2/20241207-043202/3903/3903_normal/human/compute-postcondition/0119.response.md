Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `start` is equal to `n`; `end` is equal to `n - 1`; `b` is a list of length `n` where some of its values may have been toggled; `count` is the sum of the values in `b` after the toggling operations; `maximum_count` is the maximum value computed from all iterations of the loop.**
