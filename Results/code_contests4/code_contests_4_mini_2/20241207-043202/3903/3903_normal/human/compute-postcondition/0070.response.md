According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `start` and `end`. The loop will execute if `start` is less than or equal to `end + 1`. Given that `end` is `k + 2`, we need to ensure `start` is within the specified range such that `start` is less than or equal to `k + 3`. The variable `i` will start at `start`. 

Assuming `start` is a valid integer, we also need to set `i` to the initial value of `start` for the first iteration of the loop. 

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `start` must be less than or equal to `k + 2`, and `i` is now `start`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `start` is valid, `end` is `k + 2`, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is `start`**
