The value of `b[i]` is updated to `1 - b[i]`. The specific value of `b[i]` depends on the current state of the array `b`, but this operation flips the value at index `i`. Since `i` is defined as `start + 2`, and since `start` is less than or equal to `end`, the operation will execute as long as `end` is at least `start + 2`. The values of `n`, `maximum_count`, `start`, `end`, `count`, and other elements in `b` remain unchanged except for the specific index `i` in `b`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `maximum_count` is either 0 or `count`, `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `b` contains updated values with `b[i]` now being `1 - b[i]`, `count` is the sum of the values in `b` from index `start` to `end`, `i` is `start + 2`.**
