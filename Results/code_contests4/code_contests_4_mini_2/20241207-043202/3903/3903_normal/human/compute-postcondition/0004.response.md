According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. Since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. The loop will iterate from `end = 0` to `end = n - 1`. Given that `start` is 0, it indicates that the loop can begin execution with `end` starting at its first value of 0. 

Since `maximum_count` is 0 and does not impact the execution of the loop, it remains unchanged. Therefore, for the loop to execute for the first time, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `end` would be 0 in the first iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `maximum_count` is 0, `start` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `end` is 0**
