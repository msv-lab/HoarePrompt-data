The value of `b[i]` is toggled between 0 and 1 using the expression `1 - b[i]`. Since `i` is `n + 1`, `b[i]` will change its value based on its current state. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `start` is equal to `n`; `end` is at least `n + 1`; `i` is `n + 1`; `b[i]` is toggled to either 0 or 1, depending on its previous value.
