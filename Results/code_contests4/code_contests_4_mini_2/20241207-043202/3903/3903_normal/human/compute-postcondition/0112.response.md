The code modifies the value at index `i` of the list `b`. The variable `i` is given as `n + 1`. Since `end` is equal to `n + 1`, `i` will also be equal to `end` which means we are trying to access `b[end]`. 

The value of `b[i]` is being toggled between 0 and 1 by the expression `1 - b[i]`. However, without knowing the initial value of `b[i]`, we cannot determine the final value explicitly. The initial state of `b[i]` also depends on whether `b` has been initialized and what its values are prior to this operation.

Therefore, the output state reflects the initial conditions and the operation performed:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `start` is equal to `n`, `end` is equal to `n + 1`, `i` is `n + 1`; the value at `b[i]` is toggled between 0 and 1.**
