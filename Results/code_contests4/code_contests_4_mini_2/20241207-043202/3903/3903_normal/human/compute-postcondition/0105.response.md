Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `start` is equal to `n`; `end` is at least `n + 2; b[n]` is toggled; `b[n + 1]` is toggled; `b[n + 2]` is toggled; `count` is the sum of the toggled values of `b`; `maximum_count` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `count`.**
