To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we analyze the loop code and the initial state provided.

The loop code provided is:
```
for i in range(start, end + 1):
    b[i] = 1 - b[i]
```

From the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100.
- `start` is valid.
- `end` is `k + 2`, where `k` must be at least `start - 2` for the loop to be valid (meaning `end` must be at least `start`).

The loop toggles the values in the list `b` from `start` to `end`. Each element `b[i]` is changed to `1 - b[i]`, meaning if `b[i]` was `0`, it becomes `1`, and if it was `1`, it becomes `0`.

### Analysis of the Loop Execution:
- The loop will execute for every integer `i` from `start` to `end` inclusive.
- The number of iterations is `(end - start + 1)`, which is `(k + 2 - start + 1)`, or `(k - start + 3)`.
- If `start` is greater than `end`, the loop does not execute, and no changes are made to the list `b`.

### Final Output State:
1. If the loop executes:
   - Each element from `b[start]` to `b[end]` will have been toggled.
   - The values in `b` for indices `start` to `end` will reflect this toggling.

2. If the loop does not execute (i.e., `start` > `end`):
   - The list `b` remains unchanged.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `start` is valid; `end` is `k + 2; `b[i]` is toggled for each `i` in the range from `start` to `end` inclusive.**
