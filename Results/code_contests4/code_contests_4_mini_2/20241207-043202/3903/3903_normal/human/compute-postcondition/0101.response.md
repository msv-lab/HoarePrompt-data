According to the code, the loop iterates from `start` to `end + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than or equal to `end`. Since `end` is at least `n + 1`, and `i` is currently `n + 1`, the next value of `i` will be `n + 2`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `end` must be at least `n + 2`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `start` is equal to `n`; `end` is at least `n + 2`; `i` is `n + 2`, and `b[i]` is toggled to either 0 or 1, depending on its previous value.**
