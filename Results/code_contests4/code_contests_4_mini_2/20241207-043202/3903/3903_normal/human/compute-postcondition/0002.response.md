The variable `maximum_count` is initialized to 0. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a map of integers from input (0 or 1); `maximum_count` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a map of integers from input (0 or 1); `maximum_count` is 0**.
