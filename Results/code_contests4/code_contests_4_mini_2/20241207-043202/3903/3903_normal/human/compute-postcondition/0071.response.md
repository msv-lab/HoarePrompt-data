The value of `b[i]` is updated to `1 - b[i]`, which toggles the value of `b[i]`. The initial state does not provide the specific value of `b[i]`, but since it is being toggled, it can either be 0 or 1. Therefore, after execution, `b[i]` will be its opposite value. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `start` is valid, `end` is `k + 2`, `b[i]` is toggled to `1 - b[i]`**
