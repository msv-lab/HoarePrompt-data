The code modifies the value of `b[i]`, which is an element in the list `b`. The value at index `i` is updated to `1 - b[i]`. Since `i` is equal to `end`, which is a value between `start` and `end`, `b[i]` will effectively toggle between 0 and 1. Other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `maximum_count` is either 0 or `count`; `start` is less than or equal to `end; b` is a list created from `a`; `i` is equal to `end`, and `b[i]` is toggled to `1 - b[i]`.
