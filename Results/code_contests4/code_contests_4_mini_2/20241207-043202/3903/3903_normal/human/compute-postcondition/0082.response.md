According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute for each value of `end` in the range from 0 to `n-1`, so it will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. The state indicates that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, which means `n` is at least 1 and the loop will execute. The variable `end` will start at 0 for the first iteration. 

Thus, for the loop to execute properly, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `start` is `n`, for the loop to execute for the first time `end` is 0**
