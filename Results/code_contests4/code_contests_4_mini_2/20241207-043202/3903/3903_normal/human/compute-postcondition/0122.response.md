The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it operates under the constraint that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and that there is a list of integers (not shown in the function signature) containing exactly `n` elements where each element is either 0 or 1. The function's output is not described in detail, but it is implied that the output will depend on the values in this list of integers.

Since the specifics of the return value are not provided, we can summarize the functionality based on the constraints given.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers containing exactly n elements (where n is an integer between 1 and 100) with each element being either 0 or 1, and it returns a result based on the processing of these elements.**
