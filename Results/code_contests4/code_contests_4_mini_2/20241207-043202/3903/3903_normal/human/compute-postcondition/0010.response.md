The value of `b[i]` is toggled between 0 and 1. The previous value of `b[i]` is not specified, but it can be either 0 or 1. After executing the code, if `b[i]` was 0, it becomes 1; if it was 1, it becomes 0. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `maximum_count` is 0, `start` is 0, `end` is at least 1, `i` is 1; `b[i]` is toggled between 0 and 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `maximum_count` is 0, `start` is 0, `end` is at least 1, `i` is 1; `b[i]` is toggled between 0 and 1.**
