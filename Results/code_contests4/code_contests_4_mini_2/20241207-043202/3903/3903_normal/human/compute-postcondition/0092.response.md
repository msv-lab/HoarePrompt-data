The code attempts to sum the values in `b`, which is not defined due to the absence of `a`. As a result, the execution will lead to an error since `b` cannot be used in the `sum()` function.

Given that the other variables `n`, `start`, and `end` are not affected by this line, the output state reflects the error encountered.

Output State: **Error: variable `b` is not defined**
