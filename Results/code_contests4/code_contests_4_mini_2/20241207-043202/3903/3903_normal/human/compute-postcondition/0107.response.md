According to the code, the loop iterates over the range defined by `n`, which means it will execute for values of `end` from 0 to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `end` is currently at its maximum value of `n - 1`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `end` needs to increment by 1. Therefore, `end` will become `n`, which is the first value outside of the current range. However, since `end` must still be less than `n` for the loop to continue executing, it cannot execute again.

Additionally, the variables `n`, `start`, and `end` do not need to change for this particular scenario because they are already defined correctly based on the given conditions.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `start` is equal to `n`, `end` is `n`, for the loop to execute one more time `end` must be less than `n`**
