The variable `b[i]` is assigned the value `1 - b[i]`, which toggles its current state between 0 and 1. Since `b[i]` is toggled, if it was previously 0, it will now become 1, and if it was 1, it will become 0. The other variables (`n`, `maximum_count`, `start`, `end`, `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `b[i]` based on its previous value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `maximum_count` is 0, `start` is 0, `end` is at least 2, `i` is 2; `b[i]` is toggled between 0 and 1.**
