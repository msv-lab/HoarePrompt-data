To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

1. **Input Reading**: 
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of elements.
   - It then reads a list of integers `a` of size `n`, where each integer is either `0` or `1`.

2. **Logic for Flipping**:
   - The program uses nested loops to iterate through all possible pairs of indices `(start, end)` where `0 ≤ start ≤ end < n`.
   - For each pair, it creates a copy of the list `a` named `b`.
   - The program flips the elements of `b` in the range `[start, end]`, changing `0` to `1` and `1` to `0`.
   - After flipping, it counts the number of `1`s in the list `b` and updates `maximum_count` if this count is greater than the previously recorded maximum.

3. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints the maximum count of `1`s found after performing exactly one flip.

### Correctness Evaluation:
The program appears to follow the problem description correctly, as it:
- Considers every possible range of indices for flipping.
- Accurately flips the values in the specified range.
- Counts the number of `1`s after each flip and keeps track of the maximum count across all flips.

### Important Consideration:
- The program ensures it performs exactly one flip by iterating through all valid `(start, end)` pairs.
- It handles edge cases, such as when `n` is `1`, where flipping the only element would either turn `0` to `1` or `1` to `0`.

### Potential Issue:
There is a small issue in the way the list `a` is being handled. The function uses `map(int, raw_input().split())`, but `raw_input()` is not defined in Python 3; it should be `input()`. Additionally, `map` creates an iterable, and converting it directly to a list is necessary before using it in further operations. This could lead to an error in execution. However, since the problem does not specify the Python version and if the input is properly converted to a list, the logic remains valid.

### Conclusion:
Considering that the program's logic adheres to the requirements stated in the problem description, it can be deemed correct if we assume that the input is handled properly.

Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Correctness: **True**
