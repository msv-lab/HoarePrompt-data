The function accepts an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of `n` integers (each either 0 or 1). It computes the maximum number of 1s that can be obtained by toggling any contiguous subarray of the list. The result is printed as the maximum count of 1s found after all possible toggling operations.
