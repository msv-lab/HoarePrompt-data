You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: The number "zero" is called "love" (or "l'oeuf" to be precise, literally means "egg" in French), for example when denoting the zero score in a game of tennis. 

Aki is fond of numbers, especially those with trailing zeros. For example, the number 9200 has two trailing zeros. Aki thinks the more trailing zero digits a number has, the prettier it is.

However, Aki believes, that the number of trailing zeros of a number is not static, but depends on the base (radix) it is represented in. Thus, he considers a few scenarios with some numbers and bases. And now, since the numbers he used become quite bizarre, he asks you to help him to calculate the beauty of these numbers.

Given two integers n and b (in decimal notation), your task is to calculate the number of trailing zero digits in the b-ary (in the base/radix of b) representation of n ! ([factorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial) of n). 

Input

The only line of the input contains two integers n and b (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^{18}, 2 ≤ b ≤ 10^{12}).

Output

Print an only integer — the number of trailing zero digits in the b-ary representation of n!

Note

In the first example, 6!_{(10)} = 720_{(10)} = 880_{(9)}.

In the third and fourth example, 5!_{(10)} = 120_{(10)} = 1111000_{(2)}.

The representation of the number x in the b-ary base is d_1, d_2, …, d_k if x = d_1 b^{k - 1} + d_2 b^{k - 2} + … + d_k b^0, where d_i are integers and 0 ≤ d_i ≤ b - 1. For example, the number 720 from the first example is represented as 880_{(9)} since 720 = 8 ⋅ 9^2 + 8 ⋅ 9 + 0 ⋅ 1.
