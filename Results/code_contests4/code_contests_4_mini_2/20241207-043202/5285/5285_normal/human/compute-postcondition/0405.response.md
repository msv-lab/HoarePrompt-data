Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) and an integer `b` (2 ≤ b ≤ 10^12). It calculates the prime factorization of `b` and then computes the minimum value of a certain derived metric based on the prime factors of `b` and the integer `n`. The function prints this minimum value, which represents a count of certain combinations based on the prime factors and their powers. The function does not handle any edge cases related to invalid input or constraints, and the variable `s` remains unused throughout the code. **
