The value of `newnewk` is updated by multiplying it by `newk`. Since `newnewk` was previously computed as `newk * newk`, the new value of `newnewk` becomes `newk * newk * newk`, which simplifies to `newk^3`. The value of `st` remains unchanged as the operation does not affect it. The condition for the loop to execute again remains the same: `newn` must be greater than `newnewk`. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is now `newk^3`, `st` is increased by 1, and `newn` must be at least `newk^3 + 1` for the loop to continue.

Output State: **`newnewk` is now `newk^3`, `st` is increased by 1, and `newn` must be at least `newk^3 + 1` for the loop to continue.**
