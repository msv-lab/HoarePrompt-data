Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to 0, `izv` is 0, `i` is less than or equal to 10, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `newk` remains unchanged, `st` is 0, `newizv` remains unchanged, `mlt` is assigned the value of `izv // d_osn[k]`, if `res` was -1, then `res` is now equal to `mlt`, otherwise if `mlt` is less than `res`, then `res` is now equal to `mlt`, and for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be the next element in `d_osn`.**
