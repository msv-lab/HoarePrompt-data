The value of `newnewk` is assigned the product of `newnewk` and `newk`. The previous value of `newnewk` is `newk`, so after execution, `newnewk` becomes `newk * newk`. The value of `st` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is `newk * newk`, `st` is increased by 1, and for the loop to execute again, `newn` must be greater than `newnewk`.

Output State: **`newnewk` is `newk * newk`, `st` is increased by 1, and for the loop to execute again, `newn` must be greater than `newnewk`.**
