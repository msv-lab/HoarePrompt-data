The variable `newizv` is assigned the value `0`. The previous value of `izv` is `0`, but `newizv` is a new variable and does not affect any existing variables. Therefore, the output state remains focused on the new variable's assignment. 

Output State: **`b` is a prime number greater than 2, `d_osn` contains at least one key, `cur` remains at least the square root of the original value of `b`, `s` remains 0, `res` is -1, `izv` is 0, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `i` is increased by 1, `st` is 0, `newizv` is 0.**
