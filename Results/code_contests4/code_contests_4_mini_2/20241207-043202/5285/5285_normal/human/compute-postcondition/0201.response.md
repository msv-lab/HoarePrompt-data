The value of `izv` is incremented by `newizv`, so after execution, `izv` will be increased by the value of `newizv`. The states of the other variables are not affected, but the relationship between `newn`, `newk`, and `st` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is adjusted to ensure `newn > newk`, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, and for the loop to execute again, `newn` must be greater than `newk * st`.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is adjusted to ensure `newn > newk`, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, and for the loop to execute again, `newn` must be greater than `newk * st`.**
