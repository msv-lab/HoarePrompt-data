According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `st`. If `st` is greater than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `st` is 1. So, for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 1. For the loop to execute again, `st` must be greater than 1.

State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of 1, `st` is 1, `i` is 1; for the loop to execute a second time `st` must be greater than 1**
