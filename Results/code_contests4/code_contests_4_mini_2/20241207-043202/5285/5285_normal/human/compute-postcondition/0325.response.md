The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but since the previous value of `i` is not specified and we only know that `i` needs to be less than 10, we cannot determine the exact new value of `i`. The other variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `st` is 0.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `st` is 0**
