The variable `st` is assigned the value of 0. The previous values of the other variables (`newn`, `newk`, and `i`) are not affected, and their states remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` needs to be less than 10, and `st` is now 0.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` needs to be less than 10, and `st` is 0**
