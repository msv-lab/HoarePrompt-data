The value of `st` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `st` is unknown. The values of `newn` and `newnewk` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to 0; `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`; `st` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to 0; `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`; `st` is increased by 1**
