According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. The loop can execute if `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`. 

Right before the loop, we have:
- `newnewk` is equal to `newk`,
- `newn` is decreased to a value less than or equal to 0.

For the loop to execute at least once, `newnewk` (which is equal to `newk`) must be greater than `newn`. Since `newn` is less than or equal to 0, `newnewk` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state so that `newk` (and consequently `newnewk`) is greater than 0.

State: **`st` is 0, `i` is at least 1 and less than 11, `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed, `newn` is decreased to a value less than or equal to 0, for the loop to execute the first time `newnewk` is greater than 0**
