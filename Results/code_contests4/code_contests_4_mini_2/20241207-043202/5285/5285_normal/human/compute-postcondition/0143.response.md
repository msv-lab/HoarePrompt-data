The variable `newizv` is updated to the value of `newizv * 2 + 1`. The previous value of `newizv` is unknown, but it is affected by this operation. The other variables `newn`, `newk`, `st`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`; `st` is greater than 1; `i` is 2; `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2 + 1`.

Output State: **`newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`; `st` is greater than 1; `i` is 2; `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2 + 1.**
