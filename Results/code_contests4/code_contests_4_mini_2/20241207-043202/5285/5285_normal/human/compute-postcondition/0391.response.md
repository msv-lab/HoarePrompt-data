The expression `newn = newn - newk ** st` calculates the new value for `newn`. Given the initial state, we know:

- `newnewk` is 1,
- `st` is 0,
- `newk` is assumed to be 1 from the context (since `newnewk` is 1),
- `newn` is greater than 0 but less than or equal to its previous value minus 1.

The operation `newk ** st` evaluates to `1 ** 0`, which is 1. Therefore, the operation simplifies to:

```
newn = newn - 1
```

Since `newn` is now greater than 0 but less than or equal to its previous value minus 1, we know that subtracting 1 from `newn` will still keep it non-negative, thus making `newn` decrease by 1.

The other variables (`st`, `i`, `newizv`, `izv`) are not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is 1, `st` is 0, `i` is 3, `newizv` remains unchanged, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, and `newn` is now less than or equal to its previous value minus 1.

Output State: **`newnewk` is 1, `st` is 0, `i` is 3, `newizv` remains unchanged, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, and `newn` is now less than or equal to its previous value minus 1.**
