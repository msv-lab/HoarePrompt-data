The variable `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newnewk` multiplied by `newk`. Since `newnewk` was previously assigned the value of `k` and `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, the multiplication results in `newnewk` now being equal to `k * k` (or \( k^2 \)). The values of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`b` is a prime number greater than 2, `d_osn` contains at least one key, `cur` remains at least the square root of the original value of `b`, `s` remains 0, `res` is -1, `izv` is 0, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `i` is increased by 1, `st` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is now \( k^2 \)**.
