The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is not provided. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by the number of iterations executed, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` must be less than 10; `st` is initialized to 0; `i` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by the number of iterations executed, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` must be less than 10; `st` is initialized to 0; `i` is increased by 1.**
