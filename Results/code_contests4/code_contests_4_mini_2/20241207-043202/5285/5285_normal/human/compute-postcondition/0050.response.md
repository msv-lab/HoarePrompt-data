According to the code, the `while` loop is structured with a condition of `True` and also checks if `i` is less than 10. Since the first part of the condition is always `True`, the execution of the loop depends solely on the second part, which requires that `i` is less than 10. Right before the loop, `i` is 0, which satisfies this condition since 0 is indeed less than 10. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one time.

State: **`b` is a prime number greater than 2, `d_osn` contains at least one key, `cur` remains at least the square root of the original value of `b`, `s` remains 0, `res` is -1, `izv` is 0, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, and `i` is 0**
