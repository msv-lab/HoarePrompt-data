`izv` is incremented by `newizv`. The specific values of `izv` and `newizv` are not provided, but we know that `newn` is less than its previous value and still greater than `newk`. The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state only reflects the change in `izv`.

Output State: **`newn` is less than its previous value but still greater than `newk`; `izv` is increased by `newizv`.**
