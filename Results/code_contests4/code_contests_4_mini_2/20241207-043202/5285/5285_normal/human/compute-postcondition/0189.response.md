According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `st`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `st` is 1 or greater. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 1, and for the loop to execute a second time, `st` must be greater than 1.

State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 1 or greater, `newn` is equal to `n`, `res` equals -1 or not equal to -1, `izv` is 0, `i` is 1, `b` is a prime number greater than 2, `d_osn` contains at least one key, `cur` remains at least the square root of the original value of `b`, `s` remains 0, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `mlt` is assigned the value of `izv // d_osn[newk]`, and `newizv` is now 1, for the loop to execute a second time `st` must be greater than 1.**
