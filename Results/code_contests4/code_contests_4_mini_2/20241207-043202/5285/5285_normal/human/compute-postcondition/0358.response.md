According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the condition `i < 10` is true, since the `while` condition is `True` and `i < 10`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, which is less than 10. Therefore, the loop can execute again without needing to adjust any states.

State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 1, `i` is 2, `izv` is increased by `newizv` for each iteration, and `newn` is decreased by `newk` multiplied by the number of iterations executed, until `newn` is no longer greater than `newk`**
