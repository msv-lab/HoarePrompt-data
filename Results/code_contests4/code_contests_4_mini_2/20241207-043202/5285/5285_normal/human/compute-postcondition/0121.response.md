The code initializes `st` to 0. The previous values of `newn` and `newk` are not affected, and their relationship remains that `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`; `st` is 0.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`; `st` is 0**
