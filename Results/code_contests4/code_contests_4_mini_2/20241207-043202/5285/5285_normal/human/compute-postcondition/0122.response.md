The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown. The other variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`; `st` is 0; variable `i` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`; `st` is 0; variable `i` is increased by 1**
