According to the code, the loop will certainly execute again since it is a `while True` loop. Therefore, there are no adjustments needed to the program state for it to execute one more time. 

State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `izv` is increased by `newizv` for each iteration executed, `b` is a prime number greater than 2, `d_osn` contains at least one key, `cur` remains at least the square root of the original value of `b`, `s` remains 0, `res` is -1, and `newk` is assigned the value of `k`.**
