The variable `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`. The value of `newk` is preserved, and no other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is equal to `n`, `res` equals -1 or not equal to -1, `izv` is 0, `i` is 1, `b` is a prime number greater than 2, `d_osn` contains at least one key, `cur` remains at least the square root of the original value of `b`, `s` remains 0, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `mlt` is assigned the value of `izv // d_osn[newk]`, `st` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is equal to `newk`.

Output State: **`newn` is equal to `n`, `res` equals -1 or not equal to -1, `izv` is 0, `i` is 1, `b` is a prime number greater than 2, `d_osn` contains at least one key, `cur` remains at least the square root of the original value of `b`, `s` remains 0, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `mlt` is assigned the value of `izv // d_osn[newk]`, `st` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is equal to `newk`.**
