The value of `newn` is decreased by `newk` raised to the power of `st`. Since `newn` is initially greater than `newk`, the result of `newk ** st` will be a positive value, and thus `newn` will be reduced by this positive amount. The variable `izv` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is reduced by `newk ** st`, and `izv` remains increased by `newizv`.

Output State: **`newn` is reduced by `newk ** st`, `izv` is increased by `newizv`**
