The value of `st` is incremented by 1, and since the previous value of `st` is 1, after execution, `st` becomes 2. The states of the other variables (`newn`, `newk`, `i`, `newizv`, and `newnewk`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` must be greater than `newk`, `i` is incremented by 1, `st` is 2, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is `newk` multiplied by `newk`.

Output State: **`newn` must be greater than `newk`, `i` is incremented by 1, `st` is 2, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is `newk` multiplied by `newk`**
