According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. The loop will continue executing as long as `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`. At the end of the last iteration, we have `newnewk` equal to `newk * newk`, and we know that for the loop to execute again, `newn` must be greater than `newnewk`. 

Since `newnewk` is currently `newk * newk`, in order for the loop to run again, `newn` must be adjusted to be greater than this value. Therefore, `newn` should be set to at least `newnewk + 1` to ensure that the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`newnewk` is `newk * newk`, `st` is increased by 1, and for the loop to execute again `newn` must be greater than `newnewk` (specifically, `newn` must be at least `newnewk + 1`).**
