According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `b` is within the range of 2 to 10^12, which means it is greater than 1. Therefore, the loop can indeed execute one more time without any adjustments needed to the state variables.

State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `b` is a positive integer within the range 2 ≤ b ≤ 10^12**
