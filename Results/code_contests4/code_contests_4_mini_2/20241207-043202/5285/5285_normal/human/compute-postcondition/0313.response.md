To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop: `newn > newk ** st`.

1. The variable `newn` is stated to be less than or equal to 0 right before the loop. This means that `newn` is not greater than any positive value of `newk ** st`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `newn` is greater than `newk ** st`.

2. The variable `st` is a non-negative integer. If `st` is 0, then `newk ** st` evaluates to 1 (assuming `newk` is not 0). If `st` is greater than 0, then `newk ** st` will be greater than or equal to 0 depending on the value of `newk`. 

3. Therefore, we need `newn` to be greater than `newk ** st`. Since `newn` is currently less than or equal to 0, to ensure the loop executes at least once, we can adjust `newn` to be greater than `newk ** st`. This means we need to adjust `newn` to be greater than 0 if `newk ** st` evaluates to 0 or lower.

4. Additionally, since `i` is defined as `st - 1` when `st` is greater than 0, we should ensure that `st` is at least 1 (to make `i` defined and non-negative).

Based on this analysis, the modifications would be as follows:

State: **`newn` is greater than `newk ** st`, `st` is at least 1**
