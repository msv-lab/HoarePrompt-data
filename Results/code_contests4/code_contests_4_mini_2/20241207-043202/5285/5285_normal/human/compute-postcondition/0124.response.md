The variable `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`. The initial state indicates that `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, but it does not specify the value of `newk`. The other variables `st`, `i`, and `newizv` remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State reflects the values of the unaffected variables and the assignment made.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`; `st` is 0; variable `i` is increased by 1; `newizv` is 0; `newnewk` is `newk`.**
