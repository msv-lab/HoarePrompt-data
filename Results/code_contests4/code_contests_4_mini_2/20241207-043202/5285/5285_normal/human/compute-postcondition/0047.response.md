The assignment `newk = k` indicates that the variable `newk` is being set to the value of `k`. However, the initial state does not provide any information about the value of `k`. Since the values of `b`, `d_osn`, `cur`, `s`, `res`, and `izv` are not affected by this operation, they remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `b` is a prime number greater than 2, `d_osn` contains at least one key, `cur` remains at least the square root of the original value of `b`, `s` remains 0, `res` is -1, `izv` is 0, and `newk` is assigned the value of `k`.

Output State: **`b` is a prime number greater than 2, `d_osn` contains at least one key, `cur` remains at least the square root of the original value of `b`, `s` remains 0, `res` is -1, `izv` is 0, and `newk` is assigned the value of `k`.**
