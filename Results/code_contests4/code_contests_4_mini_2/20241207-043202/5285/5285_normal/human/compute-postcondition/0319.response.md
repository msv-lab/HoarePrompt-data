According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. The loop will execute again as long as `newn` is greater than `newk * st`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `newn` has been reduced by `newk`. For the loop to execute one more time, `newn` needs to be greater than `newk * st`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `newn` is greater than `newk * st` after the last iteration.

If `newn` has been reduced by `newk`, then we need to ensure that `newn` is still greater than `newk * st`. Specifically, we can infer that `newn` must have been greater than `newk * st + newk` before the reduction. 

State: **`newn` is reduced by `newk` and for the loop to execute again `newn` must be greater than `newk * st`**
