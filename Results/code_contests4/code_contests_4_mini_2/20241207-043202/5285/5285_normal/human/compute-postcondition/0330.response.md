The value of `st` is incremented by 1, and since the initial value of `st` is 0, after execution, `st` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` is incremented by 1, `st` is 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is `newk`.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` is incremented by 1, `st` is 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is `newk`**
