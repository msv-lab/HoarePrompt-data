The expression `newn = newn - newk ** st` will affect the variable `newn`. The value of `newk` is unchanged, and `st` is equal to 0. Therefore, `newk ** st` equals `1` (any number raised to the power of 0 is 1). As a result, `newn` will be updated to `newn - 1`. 

Since `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, this means that after the update, `newn` will still be less than `newnewk`. The variable `izv` is updated to `izv + newizv`, which is not directly affected by the current operation. 

The output state reflects the updated value of `newn` and the unchanged values of `newnewk`, `st`, `izv`, `newk`, and `newizv`. 

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `newn` is updated to `newn - 1`, `st` is equal to 0, `izv` is updated to `izv + newizv`, `newk` is unchanged, `newizv` remains unchanged, and for the loop to execute again `newn` must be greater than 0**.
