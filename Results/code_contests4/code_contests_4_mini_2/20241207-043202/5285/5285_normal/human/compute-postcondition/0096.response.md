According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `st` has increased by 1, but the state of `newnewk` is not specified. Therefore, in order for the loop to execute one more time, `newnewk` must currently be less than or equal to `newn`. 

To ensure this condition holds, we need to state that `newnewk` should be less than or equal to `newn`. 

State: **`st` is increased by 1, `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`**
