`d_osn[cur]` is incremented by 1. The value of `cur` is 2, and since `d_osn` is a defaultdict of int initialized, it will create an entry for `cur` if it doesn't exist and set its value to 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `b` is an integer within the range 2 ≤ b ≤ 10^12; `s` is 0; `d_osn` has `d_osn[2]` incremented by 1; `cur` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `b` is an integer within the range 2 ≤ b ≤ 10^12; `s` is 0; `d_osn` has `d_osn[2]` incremented by 1; `cur` is 2**
