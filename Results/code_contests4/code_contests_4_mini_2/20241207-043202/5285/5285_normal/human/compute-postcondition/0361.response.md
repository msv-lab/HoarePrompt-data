The variable `newizv` is initialized to 0, but there is no mention of how it affects the state since it hasn't been modified or used in any calculation. The other variables remain unchanged as well. Therefore, the output state is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 0, `i` is 3, `izv` is increased by `newizv` for each iteration, and `newn` is decreased by `newk` multiplied by the number of iterations executed until `newn` is no longer greater than `newk`.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 0, `i` is 3, `izv` is increased by `newizv` for each iteration, and `newn` is decreased by `newk` multiplied by the number of iterations executed until `newn` is no longer greater than `newk`.**
