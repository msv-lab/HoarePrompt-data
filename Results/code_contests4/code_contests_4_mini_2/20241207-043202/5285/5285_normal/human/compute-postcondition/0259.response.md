According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the variable `st`. If `st` is greater than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 1 and less than 11, and `st` is greater than 0. Since `i` starts at 1 and increments with each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1.

Given that `st` remains greater than `i`, after this iteration, `i` will be 2, and for the loop to execute a second time, `st` must be greater than 2.

State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `izv` remains unchanged, `newn` is less than or equal to 0, `newk` is unchanged, `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2 + 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `st` must be greater than 2**
