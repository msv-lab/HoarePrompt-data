The variable `mlt` is assigned the value of `izv` divided by `d_osn[k]`. The values of `izv` and `d_osn[k]` are not provided, but we know that `izv` is influenced by `newizv` multiplied by the total number of times the inner loop executed. The variable `d_osn[k]` is dependent on `k`, but since `k` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of `d_osn[k]`. Therefore, we cannot compute the specific value of `mlt`. 

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to 0, `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by the total number of times the inner loop executed, `i` is less than or equal to 10, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `newk` remains unchanged, `st` is 0, `newizv` remains unchanged, and `mlt` is assigned the value of `izv // d_osn[k]`.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to 0, `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by the total number of times the inner loop executed, `i` is less than or equal to 10, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `newk` remains unchanged, `st` is 0, `newizv` remains unchanged, and `mlt` is assigned the value of `izv // d_osn[k]`.**
