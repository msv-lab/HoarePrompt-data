`newizv` is assigned the value of `newizv * 2 + 1`. The previous value of `newizv` is 3, so the calculation will be `3 * 2 + 1`, which equals 7. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newizv` is now 7, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`newizv` is now 7, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 2, `newn` is equal to `n`, `res` equals -1 or not equal to -1, `izv` is 0, `i` is 2, `b` is a prime number greater than 2, `d_osn` contains at least one key, `cur` remains at least the square root of the original value of `b`, `s` remains 0, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `mlt` is assigned the value of `izv // d_osn[newk]`.**
