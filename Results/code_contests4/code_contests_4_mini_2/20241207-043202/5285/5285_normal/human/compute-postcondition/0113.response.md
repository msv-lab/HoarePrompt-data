According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn` and `newk`. If `newn` is greater than `newk`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newn` has been updated to `newn - newk`. For the loop to execute one more time, `newn` needs to be greater than `newk`. 

Since `newn` is now `newn - newk`, it must satisfy the condition `newn - newk > newk`, which simplifies to `newn > 2 * newk`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, the initial value of `newn` must have been greater than `2 * newk` before the last update.

State: **`izv` is increased by `newizv`, `newn` is updated to `newn - newk` and for the loop to execute again `newn` must be greater than `2 * newk`**
