The variable `newizv` is assigned the value `0`. The other variables, `newn`, `newk`, and `i`, remain unaffected in terms of their values, but their state remains the same as described in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` is incremented by 1, `st` is 0, and `newizv` is 0.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` is incremented by 1, `st` is 0, `newizv` is 0**
