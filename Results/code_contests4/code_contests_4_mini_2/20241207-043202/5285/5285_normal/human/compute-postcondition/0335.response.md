The value of `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`. Since `newn` is greater than `newk`, we know that `newk` is a positive value. The specific previous value of `newnewk` is unknown, but it will be updated to `newnewk * newk`. The conditions regarding `newn` and `newk` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is greater than `newk`, `newnewk` is updated to `newnewk * newk`, and for the loop to execute again `newn` must be greater than or equal to `newk^2`.

Output State: **`newn` is greater than `newk`; `newnewk` is updated to `newnewk * newk`; for the loop to execute again `newn` must be greater than or equal to `newk^2`.**
