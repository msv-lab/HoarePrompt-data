The value of `cur` is incremented by 2. The previous value of `cur` is unknown, but it must still satisfy the condition that it is less than the square root of `b` for the loop to continue executing. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `cur` is increased by 2 and must remain less than the square root of `b`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `cur` is increased by 2 and must remain less than the square root of `b`.**
