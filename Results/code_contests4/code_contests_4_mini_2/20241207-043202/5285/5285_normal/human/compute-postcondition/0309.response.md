The variable `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2 + 1`. Since we do not have the specific value of `newizv`, we cannot determine its updated value exactly. However, the previous states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to 0, `st` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute a second time, `i` is 1, and `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2 + 1`.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to 0, `st` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute a second time, `i` is 1, and `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2 + 1.**
