According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `st` is greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `st` must be greater than 1, and `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2.

State: **`newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`; `st` is greater than 1; `i` is 2; `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2 + 1.**
