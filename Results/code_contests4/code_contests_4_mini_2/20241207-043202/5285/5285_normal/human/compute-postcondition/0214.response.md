The value of `st` is incremented by 1, which affects its previous value. The other variables, `newnewk` and `newn`, are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is `newk * newk`, `st` is increased by 1, and for the loop to execute again, `newn` must be greater than `newnewk`.

Output State: **`newnewk` is `newk * newk`, `st` is increased by 1, and for the loop to execute again, `newn` must be greater than `newnewk`.**
