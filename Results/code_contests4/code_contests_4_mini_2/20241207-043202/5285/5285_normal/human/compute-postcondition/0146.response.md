`izv` is incremented by the value of `newizv`, which is equal to `2^st - 1`. Since the values of `newn`, `newk`, and `st` are not directly affected apart from the calculation of `newizv`, the output state will reflect the update to `izv`. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is `st - 1`, `newizv` is equal to `2^st - 1`, and `izv` is increased by `newizv`.

Output State: **`newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is `st - 1`, `newizv` is equal to `2^st - 1`, and `izv` is increased by `newizv`.**
