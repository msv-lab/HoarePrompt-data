According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `st`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `st`. At the end of the last iteration, `st` is 1 and `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2, which means it will no longer be less than `st` since `st` is 1. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `st` would need to be greater than 2.

State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 1, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `st` must be greater than 2**
