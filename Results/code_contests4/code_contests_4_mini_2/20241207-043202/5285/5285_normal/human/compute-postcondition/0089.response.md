The variable `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`. Since there are no changes to other variables, the output state reflects the unchanged state of the other variables along with the assignment of `newnewk`. 

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st` (which is 0); `izv` is increased by `newizv` for each iteration executed; `b` is a prime number greater than 2; `d_osn` contains at least one key; `cur` remains at least the square root of the original value of `b`; `s` remains 0; `res` is -1; `newk` is assigned the value of `k`; `st` is now 0; `i` is increased by 1; `newizv` is 0; `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`.**
