According to the code, the loop will always execute because it is a `while True` loop. Therefore, no adjustments to the state are necessary for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`newnewk` is 1, `st` is 0, `i` is less than 10; `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed, `newn` is decreased to a value less than or equal to 0**
