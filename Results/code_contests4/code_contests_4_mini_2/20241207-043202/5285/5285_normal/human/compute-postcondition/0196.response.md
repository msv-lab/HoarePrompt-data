The value of `newn` is updated by subtracting `newk ** st` from it. Given that `newnewk` is greater than `newn` and `st` is adjusted to ensure `newn > newk`, we can infer that `newk ** st` will be a significant value. Therefore, `newn` will be decreased by that value. The states of other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is adjusted to ensure `newn > newk`, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, and `newn` is updated to `newn - newk ** st`.**
