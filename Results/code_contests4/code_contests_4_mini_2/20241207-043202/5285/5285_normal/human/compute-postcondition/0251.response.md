The value of `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`. The previous value of `newnewk` is greater than 0, and since `newk` is not specified, it can hold any value. Therefore, the new value of `newnewk` will depend on the current value of `newk`. The values of `st`, `i`, `izv`, and `newn` are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`st` is 2, `i` is at least 1 and less than 11, `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed, `newn` is adjusted to be greater than `newnewk`, `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`.**
