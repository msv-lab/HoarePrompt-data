The line `izv += newizv` updates the value of `izv` by adding `newizv` to it. Since `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2^st + (2^st - 1)` if the loop executes, we need to consider that `st` is equal to 0, which means `newizv` remains unchanged. Therefore, `izv` will be incremented by the unchanged value of `newizv`. The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is equal to 0, `izv` is updated to `izv + newizv`, `newk` is unchanged, `newizv` remains unchanged.**
