Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to 0, `izv` is the total sum of all increments based on `newizv` multiplied by the number of iterations of the inner loop, `i` is 10, `newk` is equal to the last value of `k`, `mlt` is equal to `izv // d_osn[k]`, `res` is the minimum value between the computed `mlt` and any previous values of `res`, which could be -1 if the loop did not execute, `b` is a prime number greater than 2, `d_osn` contains at least one key, `cur` remains at least the square root of the original value of `b`, and `s` remains 0; the value of `res` is printed.**
