The variable `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`. Since `newnewk` is now equal to `newk`, it does not change any of the other variables' values or states. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of `newnewk` and `newk`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk`; `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by the number of iterations executed; `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`; `i` is less than 10; `st` is initialized to 0; `i` is increased by 1; `newizv` is 0.**
