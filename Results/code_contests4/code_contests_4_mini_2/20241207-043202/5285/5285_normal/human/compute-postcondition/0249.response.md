`st` is incremented by 1, so its new value is 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is 2, `i` is at least 1 and less than 11, `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed, `newn` is adjusted to be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again, `newnewk` is greater than 0, and `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`.
