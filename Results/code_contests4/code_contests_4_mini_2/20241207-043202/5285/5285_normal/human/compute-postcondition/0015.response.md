Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; if `b` is divisible by `cur`, then `b` is halved, `s` remains 0, `d_osn[2]` is incremented by 1, and `cur` is still 2. If `b` is not divisible by `cur`, `cur` is updated to 3 if it was 2, or to 4 if it was not, while `b` remains unchanged and continues to be a positive integer within the range 2 ≤ b ≤ 10^12.***
