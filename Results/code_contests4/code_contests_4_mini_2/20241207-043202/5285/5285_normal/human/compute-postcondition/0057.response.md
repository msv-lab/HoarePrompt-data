The value of `st` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `st` is 0, so after execution, `st` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `b` is a prime number greater than 2, `d_osn` contains at least one key, `cur` remains at least the square root of the original value of `b`, `s` remains 0, `res` is -1, `izv` is 0, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `i` is increased by 1, `st` is 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is now \( k^2 \).
