The value of `cur` is assigned the value `3`. The previous value of `cur` was `2`, but it is now changed to `3`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `b`, `s`, `d_osn`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `b` is an integer within the range 2 ≤ b ≤ 10^12; `s` is 0; `d_osn` is a defaultdict of int initialized; `cur` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `b` is an integer within the range 2 ≤ b ≤ 10^12; `s` is 0; `d_osn` is a defaultdict of int initialized; `cur` is 3.**
