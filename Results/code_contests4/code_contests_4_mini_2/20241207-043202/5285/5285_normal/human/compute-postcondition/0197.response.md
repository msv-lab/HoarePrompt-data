According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. The condition for the loop to execute is that `newn` must be greater than `newk` multiplied by `st`. 

At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, and `st` is adjusted to ensure `newn > newk`. This means that although `newk` has been adjusted with respect to `st`, `newn` is still not guaranteed to be greater than `newk * st`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `newn` remains greater than `newk * st`. Since `newn` has been updated to `newn - newk`, and `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, we need to adjust `newn` to be greater than `newk * st`. 

Therefore, we need to ensure that after the last update, `newk * st` must be less than `newn`. This means that `newn` needs to be adjusted to be greater than `newk * st`.

State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is adjusted to ensure `newn > newk`, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, and for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than `newk * st`**
