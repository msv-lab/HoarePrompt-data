According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the condition `newnewk <= newn`. Right before the loop, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`, which is currently equal to `k`. Since `newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st` (which is 0), we can infer that `newn` is less than or equal to 1 (assuming `k` is a prime number greater than 2, then `k^0` equals 1). 

To enable the loop to execute for the first time, we need the condition `newnewk <= newn` to hold true. Therefore, `newn` must be adjusted to be greater than `newnewk` (which is `k`). 

Hence, for the loop to execute the first time, `newn` must be greater than `k`. 

State: **`newn` must be greater than `k` for the loop to execute the first time.**
