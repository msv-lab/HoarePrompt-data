`st` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The values of `newnewk`, `newk`, `i`, and `newn` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is updated to be `newnewk` multiplied by `newk`, `st` is 3, `i` is 3, and the loop continues if `newn` is greater than or equal to the new value of `newnewk`.

Output State: **`newnewk` is updated to be `newnewk` multiplied by `newk`, `st` is 3, `i` is 3, and the loop continues if `newn` is greater than or equal to the new value of `newnewk`.**
