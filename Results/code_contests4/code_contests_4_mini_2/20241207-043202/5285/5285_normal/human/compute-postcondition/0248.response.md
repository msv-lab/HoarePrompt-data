The value of `newnewk` is updated by multiplying it by `newk`. The values of `newnewk` and `newk` are not specified, but `newnewk` is greater than 0, indicating it will remain greater than 0 after the operation. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is 1, `i` is at least 1 and less than 11, `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed, `newn` is adjusted to be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again, `newnewk` is greater than 0, and `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`.
