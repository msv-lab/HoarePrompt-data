According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `st`. For the loop to execute at least once, `st` needs to be greater than 0. The current state indicates that `st` is the number of times the loop executed, and if `st` equals 0, it means the loop has not executed yet, which prevents the loop from running.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `st` must be increased to at least 1. The variable `i` will start from 0, as it typically does in Python's `range`.

State: **`b` is a prime number greater than 2, `d_osn` contains at least one key, `cur` remains at least the square root of the original value of `b`, `s` remains 0, `res` is -1, `izv` is 0, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is at least \( k^m \), `i` is 0, `st` is at least 1**
