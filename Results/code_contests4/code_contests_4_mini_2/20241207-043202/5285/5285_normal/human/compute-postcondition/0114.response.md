The value of `izv` is incremented by `newizv`. The previous value of `izv` is not specified, so it is unclear what the new value will be. The other variables (`newn` and `newk`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `izv` is increased by `newizv`.

Output State: **`izv` is increased by `newizv`**
