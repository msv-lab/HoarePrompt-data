The variable `newnewk` is updated by multiplying it with `newk`. The previous value of `newnewk` is \( k^2 \) and the value of `newk` is \( k \). Therefore, after execution, `newnewk` becomes \( k^2 \times k = k^3 \). The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`b` is a prime number greater than 2, `d_osn` contains at least one key, `cur` remains at least the square root of the original value of `b`, `s` remains 0, `res` is -1, `izv` is 0, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `i` is increased by 1, `st` is 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is now \( k^3 \) and for the loop to execute again `newn` is at least \( k^2 \)**.
