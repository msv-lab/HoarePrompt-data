The value of `st` is incremented by 1, and its previous value is 2. Therefore, after execution, `st` becomes 3. Other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`b` is a prime number greater than 2, `d_osn` contains at least one key, `cur` remains at least the square root of the original value of `b`, `s` remains 0, `res` is -1, `izv` is 0, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is at least \( k^3 \), `i` is increased by 1, `st` is 3, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is \( k^4 \)**.
