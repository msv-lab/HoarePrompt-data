The loop iterates `st` times, updating `newizv` during each iteration. Since `st` is initially 0, the loop does not execute, and `newizv` retains its initial value. 

Given that `newnewk` is `newk` raised to the power of `st`, if `st` is 0, then `newnewk` will equal 1 (since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1). 

After all iterations (which are zero in this case), the following conditions hold true:
- `newnewk` is 1.
- `st` is equal to 0.
- `i` remains less than 10.
- `newizv` retains its initial value.

Thus, the output state after the loop completes is:

Output State: **`newnewk` is 1, `st` is 0, `i` is less than 10, and `newizv` is unchanged from its initial value.**
