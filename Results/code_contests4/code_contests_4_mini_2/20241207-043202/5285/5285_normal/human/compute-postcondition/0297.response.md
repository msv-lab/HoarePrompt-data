The value of `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, but since the initial state indicates that `newnewk` must be less than or equal to 0, we cannot determine the exact new value of `newnewk` without knowing the value of `newk`. However, since `newnewk` is being updated, the output state reflects that change. The other variable states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to 0; `newnewk` is updated by multiplying it with `newk`, and for the loop to execute again, `newnewk` must be less than or equal to 0.**
