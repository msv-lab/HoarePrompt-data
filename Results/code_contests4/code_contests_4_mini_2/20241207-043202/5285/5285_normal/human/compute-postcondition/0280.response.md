The variable `res` is assigned the value of `mlt`. The conditions state that `mlt` is less than `res`, so the assignment changes the value of `res` to that of `mlt`. Other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to 0, `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by the total number of times the inner loop executed, `i` is less than or equal to 10, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `newk` remains unchanged, `st` is 0, `newizv` remains unchanged, `mlt` is assigned the value of `izv // d_osn[k]`, `res` is now equal to `mlt`.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to 0, `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by the total number of times the inner loop executed, `i` is less than or equal to 10, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `newk` remains unchanged, `st` is 0, `newizv` remains unchanged, `mlt` is assigned the value of `izv // d_osn[k]`, `res` is now equal to `mlt`.**
