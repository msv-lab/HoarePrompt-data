The variable `newizv` is assigned the value `newizv * 2 + 1`. However, the initial value of `newizv` is not provided, so we cannot determine its exact value after the operation. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `b` is a prime number greater than 2, `d_osn` contains at least one key, `cur` remains at least the square root of the original value of `b`, `s` remains 0, `res` is -1, `izv` is 0, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is at least \( k^m \), `i` is 1, `st` is at least 1, and `newizv` is updated based on its previous value.
