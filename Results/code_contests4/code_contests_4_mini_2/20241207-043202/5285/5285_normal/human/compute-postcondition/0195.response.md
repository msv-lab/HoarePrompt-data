The code `izv += newizv` increments the value of `izv` by the value of `newizv`. The previous values of `izv` and `newizv` are not specified, but `izv` is affected by this operation. The other variables (`newnewk`, `newn`, and `st`) are not impacted by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is adjusted to ensure `newn > newk`, and `izv` is increased by `newizv`.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is adjusted to ensure `newn > newk`, and `izv` is increased by `newizv`.**
