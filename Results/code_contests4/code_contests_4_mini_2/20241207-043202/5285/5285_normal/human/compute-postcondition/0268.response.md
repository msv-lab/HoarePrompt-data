The variable `izv` is updated by adding `newizv` to its previous value. The values of `newnewk`, `newn`, `st`, and `newk` remain unchanged, while `izv` changes based on its prior value. Since no specific values are given for `izv` and `newizv`, we know that `izv` is now greater than its previous value, but we cannot determine the exact new value. The loop can still execute again if `newn` is greater than 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is equal to 0, `izv` is updated to `izv + newizv`, `newk` is unchanged, `newizv` remains unchanged, and for the loop to execute again, `newn` needs to be greater than 1.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is equal to 0, `izv` is updated to `izv + newizv`, `newk` is unchanged, `newizv` remains unchanged, and for the loop to execute again, `newn` needs to be greater than 1.**
