Initial State: `newnewk` is equal to `newk`; `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by the number of iterations executed; `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`; `i` is less than 10; `st` is initialized to 0; `i` is increased by 1; `newizv` is 0
```
newnewk *= newk
```
Now, please think step by step: The value of `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`. The previous value of `newnewk` is equal to `newk`, so `newnewk` becomes `newk * newk`, which is `newk**2`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is `newk**2`, `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by the number of iterations executed, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` is less than 10, `st` is initialized to 0, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0.
Output State: **`newnewk` is `newk**2`, `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by the number of iterations executed, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` is less than 10, `st` is initialized to 0, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0**
