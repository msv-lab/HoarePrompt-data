The value of `st` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `st` is 2, after execution, `st` becomes 3. The states of the other variables (`i`, `izv`, `newn`, `newnewk`, `newk`) are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is 3, `i` is at least 1 and less than 11, `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed, `newn` is adjusted to be greater than `newnewk`, `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`.
