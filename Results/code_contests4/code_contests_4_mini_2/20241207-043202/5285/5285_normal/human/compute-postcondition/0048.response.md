`newn` is assigned the value of `n`, but since the value of `n` is not provided in the initial state, its impact cannot be determined. The other variables remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `b` is a prime number greater than 2, `d_osn` contains at least one key, `cur` remains at least the square root of the original value of `b`, `s` remains 0, `res` is -1, `izv` is 0, and `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, and `newn` is assigned the value of `n` which is unknown.
