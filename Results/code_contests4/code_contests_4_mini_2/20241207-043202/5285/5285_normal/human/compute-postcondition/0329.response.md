The value of `newnewk` is assigned the result of `newnewk *= newk`, which means `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`. Since `newnewk` was previously assigned the value of `newk`, we can denote it as `newnewk = newk`. Therefore, after the operation, `newnewk` becomes `newk * newk`, resulting in `newnewk` being equal to `newk ** 2`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` is incremented by 1, `st` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is `newk ** 2`.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` is incremented by 1, `st` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is `newk ** 2`**
