According to the code, the loop will execute again if the variable `i` is less than `st`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `st` is at least 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1. Additionally, `st` must remain at least 1 in order for the loop to execute again.

State: **`b` is a prime number greater than 2, `d_osn` contains at least one key, `cur` remains at least the square root of the original value of `b`, `s` remains 0, `res` is -1, `izv` is 0, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is at least \( k^m \), `i` is 1, `st` is at least 1**
