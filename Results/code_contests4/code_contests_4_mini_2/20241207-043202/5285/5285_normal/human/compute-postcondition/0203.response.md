Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by the number of iterations executed, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk ** st`, `st` remains adjusted to ensure `newn` is no longer greater than `newk`, `newn` is less than `newk`, and the loop has completed executing.**
