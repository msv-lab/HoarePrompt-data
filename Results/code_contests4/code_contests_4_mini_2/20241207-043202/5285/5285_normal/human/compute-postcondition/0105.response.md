According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the variable `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `st` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be increased by 1, making it 1, and `st` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, for the loop to execute a second time `st` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2 + 1`.**
