The variable `newizv` is assigned the value `0`. This assignment does not affect the other variables: `newnewk`, `st`, `i`, and `izv`. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is 1, `st` is 0, `i` is at least 1 and less than 11; `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed, `newn` is decreased to a value less than or equal to 0, and `newizv` is 0.
