The value of `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`. However, the initial state does not provide a specific value for `newk`, so we cannot determine the exact value of `newnewk`. The other variables remain unchanged as only `newnewk` is affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is equal to `newk`, `st` is 0, `i` is at least 1 and less than 11, `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed, `newn` is decreased to a value less than or equal to 0, and `newizv` is 0.

Output State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk`, `st` is 0, `i` is at least 1 and less than 11, `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed, `newn` is decreased to a value less than or equal to 0, and `newizv` is 0**
