The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `st` is equal to 0, `i` is 3, `newn` is decreased by `newk` multiplied by `st` if `newn` was greater than `newk` after all iterations.
