According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `st` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `st` must be greater than 2.

State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2 + 1`**
