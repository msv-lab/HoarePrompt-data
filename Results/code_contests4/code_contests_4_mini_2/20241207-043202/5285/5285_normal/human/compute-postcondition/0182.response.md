The value of `st` is incremented by 1, while `newnewk` and `newn` remain unchanged. The loop will still execute again based on the condition that `newnewk` must be less than or equal to `newn`. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is updated to be `newnewk * newk`, `st` is increased by 1, and for the loop to execute again `newnewk` must be less than or equal to `newn`.
Output State: **`newnewk` is updated to be `newnewk * newk`, `st` is increased by 1, and for the loop to execute again `newnewk` must be less than or equal to `newn`.**
