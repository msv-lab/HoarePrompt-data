The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 0, `i` is at least 1 and less than 11, `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by 0, `newn` is less than or equal to 0, and `newk` is unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop.
