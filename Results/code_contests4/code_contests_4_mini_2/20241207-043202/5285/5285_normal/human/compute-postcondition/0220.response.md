The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `st` is equal to 0, `newn` must be greater than `newnewk` for the loop to execute, `newnewk` is greater than `newn` after the loop terminates, `i` is less than 10, and we break out of the most internal loop.
