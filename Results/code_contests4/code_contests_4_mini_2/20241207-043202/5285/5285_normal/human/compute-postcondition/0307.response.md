The variable `newizv` is assigned the value `newizv * 2 + 1`. However, the initial values of `newizv` are not provided, so we cannot determine its specific value after the operation. The other variables, `newn`, `st`, and `i`, remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the unknown state of `newizv` and the unchanged states of the other variables.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to 0, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2 + 1` (value unknown).**
