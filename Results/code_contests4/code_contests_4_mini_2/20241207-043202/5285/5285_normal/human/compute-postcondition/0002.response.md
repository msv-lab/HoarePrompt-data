The code initializes `d_osn` as a `defaultdict` of type `int`, which will automatically create default integer values (0) for any key that does not exist. The existing values of `n`, `b`, and `s` remain unchanged, as the code only affects the initialization of `d_osn`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n`, `b`, and `s`, along with the new `d_osn` variable.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `b` is an integer within the range 2 ≤ b ≤ 10^12; `s` is 0; `d_osn` is a defaultdict of int initialized.**
