According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `st` is greater than 1, which means that `st` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be 2.

State: **`newnewk` is `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `st` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute a third time, `i` is 2, and `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2 + 1**
