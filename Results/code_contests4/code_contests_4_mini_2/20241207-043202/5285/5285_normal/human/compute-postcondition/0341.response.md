According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `st`. For the loop to execute, `st` must be greater than 0. Given that `st` is currently 0, it needs to be adjusted to at least 1. Additionally, since `i` has been incremented the same number of times as `st`, and `st` is 0, `i` should also be adjusted to 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 1, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `st` must be greater than 0**
