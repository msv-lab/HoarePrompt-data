To determine if the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition in the loop: `newnewk <= newn`.

Given the current state:
- `newn` is less than or equal to `newk` (which is `newnewk` squared).
- This means `newnewk` squared is currently less than or equal to `newn`.

For the loop to execute again, we need `newnewk` (which is `newk` squared) to be less than or equal to `newn` after this iteration. Since `newnewk` is already defined as `newk` squared, we require that `newn` is also less than or equal to `newnewk`.

Thus, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the condition to reflect that `newn` should be greater than `newnewk` (which is `newk` squared). Since `newnewk` is equal to `newk` squared, we need to ensure the condition holds for the next iteration.

No other states need to be adjusted as they do not influence the loop's execution.

State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, for the loop to execute again `newn` must be greater than `newk` squared**
