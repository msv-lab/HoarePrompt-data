Postcondition: ***`newnewk` is greater than `newn`. If `st` is equal to 0, `st` is increased to the number of iterations the loop executed, and `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of the final value of `st`. If `st` was 0 at the beginning, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
