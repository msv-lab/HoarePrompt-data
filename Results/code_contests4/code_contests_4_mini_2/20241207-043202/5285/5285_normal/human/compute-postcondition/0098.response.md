The value of `st` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `st` is unknown. The variable `newnewk` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `st` is increased by 1, `newnewk` remains as `newnewk * newk`.

Output State: **`st` is increased by 1, `newnewk` remains as `newnewk * newk`**
