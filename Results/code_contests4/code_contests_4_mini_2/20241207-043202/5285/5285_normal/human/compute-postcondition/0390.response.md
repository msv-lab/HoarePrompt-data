The code snippet `izv += newizv` increments the value of `izv` by the value of `newizv`. Since `newizv` remains unchanged, its value is not specified in the initial state. The initial state indicates that `izv` is increased by `newizv`, but since we do not know the specific value of `newizv`, we can only state that `izv` will be increased by an unknown amount. 

The values of the other variables (`newnewk`, `st`, `i`, and `newn`) are not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is 1, `st` is 0, `i` is 3, `newizv` remains unchanged, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, `newn` is now greater than 0 but less than or equal to its previous value minus 1.

Output State: **`newnewk` is 1, `st` is 0, `i` is 3, `newizv` remains unchanged, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, `newn` is now greater than 0 but less than or equal to its previous value minus 1.**
