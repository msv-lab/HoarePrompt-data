To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we analyze the condition of the `while` loop:

```
while newnewk <= newn:
```

For the loop to execute again, the condition `newnewk <= newn` must still hold true. 

Given the current state:
- `newnewk` is greater than 0 (as stated).
- `newn` is adjusted to be greater than 0.

However, we do not have explicit values for `newnewk` and `newn`, only their relationships. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the following must be true:
1. `newnewk` must be less than or equal to `newn`.

Since `newnewk` is mentioned to be greater than 0 and we know that `newn` is greater than 0, we need to ensure that `newnewk` is less than or equal to the current value of `newn` for the loop to proceed. 

If `newnewk` was already equal to `newn`, then the loop could not execute again without adjusting `newn` to be greater than `newnewk`. 

Thus, to ensure that the loop can execute again, we need to adjust `newn` to be greater than `newnewk`.

State: **`st` is 2, `i` is at least 1 and less than 11, `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed, `newn` is adjusted to be greater than `newnewk`, `newnewk` is greater than 0, and `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`.**
