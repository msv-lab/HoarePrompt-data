The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables directly. It simply skips the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `d_osn[cur]` is increased by 1; the value of `b` is divided by `cur`, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.**
