The operation `b /= cur` means that the value of `b` is divided by `cur`. The variable `cur` is not defined in the initial state, but since `b` is a positive integer within the range 2 ≤ b ≤ 10^12, the division operation will yield a new value for `b`. The variable `d_osn[cur]` was already increased by 1, but that doesn't affect the division operation. 

Assuming `cur` is a positive integer and taking into account the range of `b`, the new value of `b` will be `b / cur`, which will still be a positive integer as long as `cur` is not greater than `b`. 

Since `cur` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact new value of `b`. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `b` has been modified through the division operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `b` is now `b / cur`; `d_osn[cur]` is increased by 1.**
