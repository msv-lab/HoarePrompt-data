To determine if the `while` loop can execute, we need to analyze the condition `newnewk <= newn`. 

The state right before the loop indicates:
- `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`.
- `i` is incremented by 1 (though it does not affect the `while` condition).
- `st` is 0.
- `newizv` is 0.
- `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`.

For the loop to execute at least one time, `newnewk` (which is equal to `newk`) must be less than or equal to `newn`. Since `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, we can see that `newnewk` is equal to `newk`, which means the loop will execute as long as `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`.

Thus, the condition for the loop to execute at least once is already satisfied, since `newnewk` is equal to `newn` or `newn` is less than `newk`.

No adjustments are necessary to the states for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` is incremented by 1, `st` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`**
