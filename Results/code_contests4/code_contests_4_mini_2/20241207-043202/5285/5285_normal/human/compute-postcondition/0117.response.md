The value of `izv` is incremented by `newizv`. The values of `newn` and `newk` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `izv` is increased by `newizv`; `newn` is decremented by `newk` and for the loop to execute again `newn` must be greater than `newk`.

Output State: **`izv` is increased by `newizv`; `newn` is decremented by `newk` and for the loop to execute again `newn` must be greater than `newk`.**
