Given the provided initial state and the loop code, we can deduce the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed.

The loop iterates `st` times, and during each iteration, `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2 + 1`. 

From the output states after the first few iterations, we see that:
- `newnewk` remains greater than `newn` throughout all iterations.
- `st` is consistently 1, indicating that the loop executes only once.
- `i` is incremented from 0 to 2, indicating the completion of the loop iterations.
- `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2 + 1` with each iteration.

Since the loop executes based on the value of `st`, which remains 1, the final state after the loop completes executing will reflect one iteration of the update to `newizv`.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is as follows:

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 1, `i` is 2, and `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2 + 1` after one iteration.**
