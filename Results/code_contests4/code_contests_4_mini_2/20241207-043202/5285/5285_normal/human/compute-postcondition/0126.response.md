The value of `newnewk` is assigned the result of `newnewk` multiplied by `newk`. Since `newnewk` is equal to `newk`, the operation results in `newnewk` being squared. The values of `newn`, `st`, `i`, and `newizv` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `st` is 0, variable `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is `newk` squared.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `st` is 0, variable `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is `newk` squared.**
