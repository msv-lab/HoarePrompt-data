According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. The loop can execute again if `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`. At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that `newn` is greater than or equal to `newk`, and `newnewk` is equal to `newk`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `newn` must be adjusted to be greater than `newnewk`. Since `newnewk` is equal to `newk`, `newn` must be greater than `newk`.

State: **`newn` must be greater than `newk`, `i` is incremented by 1, `st` is 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is `newk`**
