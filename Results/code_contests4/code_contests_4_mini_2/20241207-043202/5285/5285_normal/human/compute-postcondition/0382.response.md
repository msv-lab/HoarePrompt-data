The loop iterates `st` times, which is initially 0. Since the range of the loop is determined by `st`, the loop will not execute at all. Consequently, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial state after all iterations have finished.

Output State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of 0, `st` is 0, `i` is 3, `newizv` remains unchanged.**
