The value of `newn` is decreased by the result of `newk` raised to the power of `st`. Since `newn` is less than its previous value but still greater than `newk`, we know that after this operation, `newn` will remain less than its previous value and its new value will also still be greater than `newk`. The variable `izv` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than its previous value but still greater than `newk`; `izv` is increased by `newizv`.

Output State: **`newn` is less than its previous value but still greater than `newk`; `izv` is increased by `newizv`.**
