The loop continues to execute as long as `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`. During each iteration, `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, and `st` is incremented by 1. 

Since the initial state indicates that `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, the loop will execute at least once, and `newnewk` will be equal to `newk` after the first iteration. 

After executing multiple times, the loop will stop when `newnewk` exceeds `newn`. This means the number of times the loop runs (`st`) is directly related to how many times `newk` can be multiplied while remaining less than or equal to `newn`.

Given that `newnewk` starts at `newk`, the loop will continue multiplying `newnewk` by `newk` until it exceeds `newn`. 

At the end of the loop:
- `st` will count how many times the multiplication occurred.
- `newnewk` will be greater than `newn`.
- `newizv` remains unchanged at 0.
- `i` will have been incremented for each iteration of the loop.

Thus, the output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is the number of times `newk` has been multiplied (until `newnewk` exceeds `newn`), `i` has been incremented by the same number of times, `newizv` is 0.**
