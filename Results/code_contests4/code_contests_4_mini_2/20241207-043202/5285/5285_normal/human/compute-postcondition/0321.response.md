The value of `newn` is decremented by `newk ** st`, which is the result of raising `newk` to the power of `st`. The previous values of `newn`, `newk`, and `st` are not provided, but the operation will affect `newn`. The values of `izv` and `newizv` remain unchanged, but the output state will reflect the new value of `newn`. 

Output State: **`izv` is increased by `newizv`, `newn` is decreased by `newk ** st`**
