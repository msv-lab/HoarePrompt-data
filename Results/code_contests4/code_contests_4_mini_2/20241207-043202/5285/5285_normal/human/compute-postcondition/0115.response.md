The value of `newn` is decremented by `newk` raised to the power of `st`. The previous values of `newn`, `newk`, and `st` are not provided, so we cannot calculate a specific numeric value for `newn`. However, we know that `newn` will change as it is affected by the operation. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `izv` is increased by `newizv`; `newn` is decremented by `newk ** st`.

Output State: **`izv` is increased by `newizv`; `newn` is decremented by `newk ** st`.**
