The value of `newn` is decremented by `newk ** st`. The previous value of `newn` is unknown, but it must be adjusted to be greater than `newk`. The variables `newk`, `st`, and `izv` remain unchanged, as they are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `b` is a prime number greater than 2, `d_osn` contains at least one key, `cur` remains at least the square root of the original value of `b`, `s` remains 0, `res` is -1, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is adjusted to be greater than `newk`, and `izv` is increased by `newizv`. 

Output State: **`b` is a prime number greater than 2, `d_osn` contains at least one key, `cur` remains at least the square root of the original value of `b`, `s` remains 0, `res` is -1, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is adjusted to be greater than `newk`, and `izv` is increased by `newizv`, with `newn` now decreased by `newk ** st`.**
