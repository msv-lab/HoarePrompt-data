The value of `newnewk` is updated by multiplying it with the value of `newk`. Since `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the result of this multiplication will depend on the current value of `newk`. The value of `st` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `st` is increased by 1, `newnewk` is now `newnewk * newk`.

Output State: **`st` is increased by 1, `newnewk` is now `newnewk * newk`**
