The value of `izv` is incremented by `newizv`. The previous values of `izv` and `newizv` are not specified, but `izv` is increased by `newizv`. Since `newn` is greater than `newk`, the output state does not change the conditions of the variables involved. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is greater than `newk`, and `izv` is increased by `newizv`.

Output State: **`newn` is greater than `newk`, and `izv` is increased by `newizv`**
