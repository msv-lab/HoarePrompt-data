The value of `izv` is incremented by `newizv`. Since `izv` is increased, but no specific previous values are provided for `izv` or `newizv`, we only know that `izv` is now greater than its previous value. The other variables `newnewk`, `newn`, `st`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 1, `i` is 2, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, `newn` is decreased by `newk`, and for the loop to execute again `newn` must be greater than `newk`.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 1, `i` is 2, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, `newn` is decreased by `newk`, and for the loop to execute again `newn` must be greater than `newk`.**
