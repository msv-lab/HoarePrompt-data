The value of `b` is divided by `cur`, which is 2. Since `b` is within the range 2 ≤ b ≤ 10^12, the result will be `b / 2`. Other variables `n`, `s`, `d_osn`, and `cur` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `b` is now `b / 2`; `s` is 0; `d_osn` has `d_osn[2]` incremented by 1; `cur` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `b` is now `b / 2`; `s` is 0; `d_osn` has `d_osn[2]` incremented by 1; `cur` is 2**
