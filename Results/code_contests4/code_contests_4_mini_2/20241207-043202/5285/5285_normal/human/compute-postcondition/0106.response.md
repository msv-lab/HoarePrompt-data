The variable `newizv` is updated to the value of `newizv * 2 + 1`. The previous value of `newizv` is not specified, but it will be doubled and incremented by 1. Other variables such as `newnewk`, `newn`, `st`, and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the update to `newizv`.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2 + 1**
