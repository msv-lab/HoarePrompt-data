The variable `newn` is updated by subtracting `newk ** st` from its previous value. Since `st` is equal to 0, `newk ** st` equals `newk ** 0`, which is 1 (as any number raised to the power of 0 is 1). Therefore, `newn` is decreased by 1. The values of `newnewk`, `izv`, `newk`, and `newizv` remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is equal to 0, `izv` is updated to `izv + newizv`, `newk` is unchanged, `newizv` remains unchanged, `newn` is decreased by 1.**
