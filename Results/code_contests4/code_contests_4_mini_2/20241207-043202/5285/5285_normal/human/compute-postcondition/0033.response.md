The value of `cur` is assigned the value 3. The previous state of the affected variable `cur` is not defined, but it is now set to 3. The values of `n` and any other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `cur` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `cur` is 3**
