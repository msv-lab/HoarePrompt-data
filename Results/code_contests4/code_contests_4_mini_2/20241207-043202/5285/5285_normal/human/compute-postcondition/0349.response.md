The value of `izv` is incremented by `newizv`. The previous state indicates that `newizv` has been updated to `newizv * 2 + 1`, but no specific value for `newizv` is provided, so we cannot determine the precise change to `izv`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `izv` has been increased by an updated `newizv`, but we do not know the exact values. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 1, `i` is 2, `izv` is increased by `newizv`.**
