The value of `st` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `st` is unknown, so the output state reflects that `st` has been increased by 1 while the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, resulting in a new value for `newnewk` while `newk` remains unchanged; `st` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, resulting in a new value for `newnewk` while `newk` remains unchanged; `st` is increased by 1.**
