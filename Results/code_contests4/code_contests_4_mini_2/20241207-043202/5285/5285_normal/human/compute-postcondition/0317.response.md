`izv` is incremented by `newizv`. The previous values of `izv` are unknown, but it is updated based on the addition of `newizv`. The states of the other variables, including `newn`, `newk`, and `st`, are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is reduced by `newk` and for the loop to execute again `newn` must be greater than `newk * st`; `izv` is increased by `newizv`.

Output State: **`newn` is reduced by `newk` and for the loop to execute again `newn` must be greater than `newk * st`; `izv` is increased by `newizv`.**
