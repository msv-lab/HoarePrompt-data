Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `b` is an integer within the range 2 ≤ b ≤ 10^12; `s` is 0; `d_osn` is a defaultdict of int initialized; if `cur` equals 2, then `cur` is updated to 3. Otherwise, `cur` is updated to 4, and `b` is not divisible by `cur` (i.e., b % cur ≠ 0).***
