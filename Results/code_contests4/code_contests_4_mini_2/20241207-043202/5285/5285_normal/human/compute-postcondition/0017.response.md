The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `b` is a positive integer within the range 2 ≤ b ≤ 10^12; `cur` is at least the square root of `b`; `s` remains 0; `d_osn[2]` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
