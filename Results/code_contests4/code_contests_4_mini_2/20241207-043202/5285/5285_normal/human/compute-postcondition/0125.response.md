According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. The loop can execute if `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`. Right before the loop, `newnewk` is equal to `newk`, and `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `newnewk` must be less than or equal to `newn`, which is already satisfied since `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`.

No other states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `st` is 0, variable `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is `newk`**
