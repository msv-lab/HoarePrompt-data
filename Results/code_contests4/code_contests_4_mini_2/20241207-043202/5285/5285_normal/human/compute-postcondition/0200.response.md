According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. The loop can execute again if `newn` is greater than `newk * st`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `newk` is greater than `newn`, and `st` has been adjusted to ensure that `newn > newk`. However, since `newn` is not currently greater than `newk * st`, we need to adjust the states to ensure that `newn` is indeed greater than `newk * st`.

To execute the loop again, we could state that `newn` must be updated to a value that is greater than `newk * st`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we can say that `newn` needs to be set to a value greater than `newk * st`.

State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is adjusted to ensure `newn > newk`, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, and for the loop to execute again, `newn` must be greater than `newk * st`**
