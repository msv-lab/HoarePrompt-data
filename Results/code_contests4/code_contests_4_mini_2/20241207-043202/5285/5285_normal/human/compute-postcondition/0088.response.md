The variable `newizv` is assigned the value `0`. Since `newizv` was not previously defined, the assignment introduces it into the state. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the introduction of `newizv` with its value.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st` (which is 0); `izv` is increased by `newizv` for each iteration executed; `b` is a prime number greater than 2; `d_osn` contains at least one key; `cur` remains at least the square root of the original value of `b`; `s` remains 0; `res` is -1; `newk` is assigned the value of `k`; `st` is now 0; `i` is increased by 1; `newizv` is 0.**
