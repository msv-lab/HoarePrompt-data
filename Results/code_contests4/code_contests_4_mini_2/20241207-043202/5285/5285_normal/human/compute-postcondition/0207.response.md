The variable `newizv` is assigned the value `0`. The other variables (`newnewk`, `newn`, `izv`, `i`, `st`) remain unchanged since they are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by the number of iterations executed, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` must be less than 10; `st` is initialized to 0; `i` is increased by 1; `newizv` is 0.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by the number of iterations executed, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` must be less than 10; `st` is initialized to 0; `i` is increased by 1; `newizv` is 0.**
