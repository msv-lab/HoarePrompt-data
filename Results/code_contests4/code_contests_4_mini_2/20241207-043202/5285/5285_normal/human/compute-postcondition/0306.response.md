According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `st`. The loop will only execute if `st` is greater than 0. Since `newn` is less than or equal to 0 and `st` is equal to 0, the loop cannot execute as is. For the loop to be executed, the state must be adjusted so that `st` is greater than 0, resulting in an initial value of `i` set to 0.

State: **`newn` is less than or equal to 0, for the loop to execute the first time `st` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0**
