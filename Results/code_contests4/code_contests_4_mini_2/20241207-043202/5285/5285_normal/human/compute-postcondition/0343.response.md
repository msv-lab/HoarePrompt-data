According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the variable `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `st` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `st` must be greater than 1.

State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 1, `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute a second time `st` must be greater than 1**
