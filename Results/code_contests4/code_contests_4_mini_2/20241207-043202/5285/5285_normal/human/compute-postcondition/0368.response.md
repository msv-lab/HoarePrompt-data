`st` is incremented by 1, and its previous value was 1, so after execution, `st` becomes 2. The values of `newnewk` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is updated to be `newk` squared, `st` is 2, `i` is 3.

Output State: **`newnewk` is updated to be `newk` squared, `st` is 2, `i` is 3**
