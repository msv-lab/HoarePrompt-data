To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition `newn > newk ** st`. 

1. We know that `newn` must be greater than `newk ** st` for the loop to run again.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `newn` is decreased by `newk`, which means `newn` is now equal to its previous value minus the value of `newk`.
3. The state provided indicates that `newn` is at least \( k^m \) and must be greater than `newk`, so we can infer that `newn` is at least larger than `newk` but has been reduced.

For the loop to execute again:
- The current value of `newn` (after being decreased) must still be greater than `newk ** st`.
- We need to ensure that after the decrement of `newk`, `newn` remains greater than `newk ** st`.

To satisfy this condition, we can infer:
- Since `newn` was originally at least \( k^m \) and greater than `newk`, we can adjust `newn` to ensure it is greater than `newk ** st` after the decrement.

Thus, we need to ensure that `newn` is sufficiently large compared to `newk ** st`. 

State: **`b` is a prime number greater than 2, `d_osn` contains at least one key, `cur` remains at least the square root of the original value of `b`, `s` remains 0, `res` is -1, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` must be adjusted to be greater than `newk ** st` after being decreased by `newk`**
