The value of `st` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `st` is not specified. The values of `newnewk` and `newn` remain unchanged, and since there is no other impact on them, the output state reflects the change in `st`. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is now `newk^3`, `st` is increased by 1, and `newn` must be at least `newk^3 + 1` for the loop to continue.

Output State: **`newnewk` is now `newk^3`, `st` is increased by 1, and `newn` must be at least `newk^3 + 1` for the loop to continue.**
