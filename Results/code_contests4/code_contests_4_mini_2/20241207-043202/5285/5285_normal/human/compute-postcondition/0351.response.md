According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. The loop will execute again if `newn` is greater than `newk * st`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, which means `newk` is less than `newn`. Since `newn` is updated to `newn - newk`, we need to ensure that the new value of `newn` remains greater than `newk * st` for the loop to execute again.

Given that `st` is 1, the condition for the loop to execute again simplifies to `newn > newk`. 

Since `newn` was updated to `newn - newk`, for the loop to execute one more time, `newn - newk` must still be greater than `newk`, which implies `newn` needs to be greater than `2 * newk`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state accordingly: the condition `newn` must be greater than `2 * newk`.

State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 1, `i` is 2, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, and for the loop to execute again `newn` must be greater than `2 * newk`**
