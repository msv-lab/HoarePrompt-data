The variable `izv` is assigned the value 0. The previous values of the other variables (`b`, `d_osn`, `cur`, `s`, `res`) remain unchanged as the assignment does not affect them. Therefore, the Output State is: `b` is a prime number greater than 2, `d_osn` contains at least one key, `cur` remains at least the square root of the original value of `b`, `s` remains 0, `res` is -1, and `izv` is 0.

Output State: **`b` is a prime number greater than 2, `d_osn` contains at least one key, `cur` remains at least the square root of the original value of `b`, `s` remains 0, `res` is -1, `izv` is 0**
