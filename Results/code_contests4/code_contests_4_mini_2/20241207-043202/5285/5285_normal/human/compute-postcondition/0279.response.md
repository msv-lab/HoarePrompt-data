Postcondition: ***`newn` is less than or equal to 0, `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by the total number of times the inner loop executed, `i` is less than or equal to 10, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `newk` remains unchanged, `st` is 0, `newizv` remains unchanged, `mlt` is assigned the value of `izv // d_osn[k]`, `res` is not equal to -1, and `mlt` is less than `res`.***
