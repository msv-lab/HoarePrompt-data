The variable `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, which means `newnewk` is updated to be `newnewk * newk`. The previous value of `newnewk` is unknown, and the value of `newk` is also unknown, but the operation will result in a new value for `newnewk`. The other variables `st` and `newn` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is updated to be `newnewk * newk`, `st` is increased by 1, and the loop conditions remain intact.

Output State: **`newnewk` is updated to be `newnewk * newk`, `st` is increased by 1, and for the loop to execute again `newnewk` must be less than or equal to `newn`.**
