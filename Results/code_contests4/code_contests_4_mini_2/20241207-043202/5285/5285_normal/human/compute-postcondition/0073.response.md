The variable `newizv` is updated by the expression `newizv * 2 + 1`. The previous value of `newizv` is taken into account for this calculation, but we do not have its specific value provided. Therefore, `newizv` will become `2 * previous_value_of_newizv + 1`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected since only `newizv` is being modified.

Output State: **`b` is a prime number greater than 2, `d_osn` contains at least one key, `cur` remains at least the square root of the original value of `b`, `s` remains 0, `res` is -1, `izv` is 0, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is at least \( k^m \), `i` is 2, `st` is at least 2, and `newizv` is updated to `2 * previous_value_of_newizv + 1`.**
