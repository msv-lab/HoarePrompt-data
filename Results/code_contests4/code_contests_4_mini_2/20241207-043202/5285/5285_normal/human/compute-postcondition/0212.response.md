According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newnewk` is `newk`, and the variable `st` has been increased by 1, which does not directly affect the loop condition. 

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `newnewk` must currently be less than or equal to `newn`. If `newnewk` is equal to `newn`, it may not be sufficient for another iteration since the loop will terminate if `newnewk` exceeds `newn`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `newn` must be adjusted to be greater than `newnewk`.

State: **`newnewk` is `newk`, variable `st` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute again `newn` must be greater than `newnewk`**.
