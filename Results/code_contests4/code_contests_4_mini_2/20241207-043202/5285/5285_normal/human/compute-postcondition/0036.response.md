Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18. If `b % cur == 0`, then `d_osn[cur]` is increased by 1, and the value of `b` is divided by `cur`, skipping the current iteration of the loop. If `b % cur` is not equal to 0 and `cur` is equal to 2, then `cur` is set to 3. Otherwise, `cur` is increased by 2, and `cur` must remain less than the square root of `b`.***
