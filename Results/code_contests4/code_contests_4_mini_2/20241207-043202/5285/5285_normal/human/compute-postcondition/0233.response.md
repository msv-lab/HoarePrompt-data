The variable `izv` is incremented by the value of `newizv`, but the previous value of `izv` and the current value of `newizv` are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state focuses on the fact that `izv` is updated but does not specify the exact result due to missing information.

Output State: **`newnewk` is 1, `st` is 0, `i` is less than 10, `newizv` is added to `izv`**
