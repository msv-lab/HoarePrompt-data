The variable `st` is assigned the value `0`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is equal to `n`, `res` equals -1 or not equal to -1, `izv` is 0, `i` is 0, `b` is a prime number greater than 2, `d_osn` contains at least one key, `cur` remains at least the square root of the original value of `b`, `s` remains 0, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `mlt` is assigned the value of `izv // d_osn[newk]`, and `st` is 0.
