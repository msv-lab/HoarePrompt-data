The value of `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, but the previous values of `newnewk` and `newk` are not provided. Therefore, the output state reflects that `newnewk` has been updated by multiplying it with `newk`. The states of other variables such as `st` and `newn` are not affected. 

Output State: **`st` is increased by 1, `newnewk` is updated by multiplying it with `newk`**
