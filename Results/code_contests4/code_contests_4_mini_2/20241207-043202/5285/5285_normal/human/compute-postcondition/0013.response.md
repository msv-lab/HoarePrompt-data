The value of `cur` is incremented by 2. The previous value of `cur` is 2, so after execution, `cur` becomes 4. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `b` is an integer within the range 2 ≤ b ≤ 10^12; `s` is 0; `d_osn` is a defaultdict of int initialized; `cur` is 4; `b` is not divisible by `cur` (i.e., b % cur ≠ 0); `cur` is not equal to 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `b` is an integer within the range 2 ≤ b ≤ 10^12; `s` is 0; `d_osn` is a defaultdict of int initialized; `cur` is 4; `b` is not divisible by `cur` (i.e., b % cur ≠ 0); `cur` is not equal to 2.**
