The value of `izv` is increased by `newizv`. The previous value of `izv` is unknown, but it is incremented by the value of `newizv`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `b` is a prime number greater than 2, `d_osn` contains at least one key, `cur` remains at least the square root of the original value of `b`, `s` remains 0, `res` is -1, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` must be adjusted to be greater than `newk`, and `izv` is increased by `newizv`.
