To determine whether the `while` loop can execute, we need to analyze the condition in the loop, which is `newn > newk ** st`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `newnewk` is greater than `newn`
- `st` is equal to 0
- `izv` remains unchanged
- `newn` is less than or equal to 0
- `newk` is unchanged
- `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2^st + (2^st - 1)` if the loop executes or remains unchanged if `st` is 0.

Now, let's break down the condition `newn > newk ** st`:
1. Since `st` is equal to 0, `newk ** st` evaluates to `1` (as any number raised to the power of 0 equals 1).
2. Therefore, the condition simplifies to `newn > 1`.

Given that `newn` is less than or equal to 0, it is not possible for `newn` to be greater than `1`. 

To allow the loop to execute at least once, we need to adjust `newn` so that it is greater than 1. Since we also know `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, we must ensure that `newnewk` is greater than `1` as well. This means we can set `newn` to be greater than `1`.

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:
- `newn` needs to be adjusted to be greater than `1`.

Other states do not need to be modified since they do not affect the loop's ability to execute.

Final answer:
State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is equal to 0, `izv` remains unchanged, for the loop to execute the first time `newn` must be greater than 1, `newk` is unchanged, `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2^st + (2^st - 1)` if the loop executes or remains unchanged if `st` is 0.**
