The variable `newizv` is updated to the value `newizv * 2 + 1`. The previous value of `newizv` is unknown, so we can't determine the exact new value after the execution. However, the initial state indicates that `newn` is less than or equal to 0, `st` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute a second time, and `i` is 2. Since the specific value of `newizv` is not provided, we can only state that it has been updated based on the operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to 0, `st` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2 + 1`.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to 0, `st` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2 + 1**
