According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. The loop will execute as long as `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`. Right before the loop, we have:

- `newn` is greater than `newk ** st`, so this condition is already satisfied for the loop to execute.
- `st` is greater than 0, which is also necessary for the exponentiation to be valid.
- `i` is `st - 1`, which doesn't directly affect the execution of the loop.
- `newizv` being equal to `2^st - 1` does not impact the loop condition either.

Since the condition for the loop to execute is already satisfied with `newn` being greater than `newk ** st`, there are no states that need to be adjusted.

State: **`newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is `st - 1`, `newizv` is equal to `2^st - 1`**
