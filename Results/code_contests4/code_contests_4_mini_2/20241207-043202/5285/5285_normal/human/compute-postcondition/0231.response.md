The code assigns `newn` the value of `newn - newk ** st`. Given that `st` is 0, the expression `newk ** st` evaluates to `newk ** 0`, which is 1 (any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 is 1). Thus, `newn` becomes `newn - 1`. However, the value of `newn` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot specify its final value. The state of the other variables remains the same.

Output State: **`newnewk` is 1, `st` is 0, `i` is less than 10; `izv` is increased by `newizv`; `newn` is decreased by 1.**
