According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. The condition for the loop to execute is that `newn` must be greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`. Currently, `st` is 0, which means `newk ** st` is equal to 1 (since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1). 

For the loop to execute, `newn` must be greater than 1. However, we do not have the value of `newn`, so we cannot determine its exact state. Therefore, we need to ensure that `newn` is set to a value greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of 0, `st` is 0, `i` is 3, `newizv` remains unchanged, for the loop to execute the first time then `newn` must be greater than 1**
