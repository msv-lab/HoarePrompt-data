The value of `izv` is incremented by `newizv`, but the value of `newizv` is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the new value of `izv`, but we know it will increase. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`b` is a prime number greater than 2, `d_osn` contains at least one key, `cur` remains at least the square root of the original value of `b`, `s` remains 0, `res` is -1, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is at least \( k^m \) and must be greater than `newk`.**
