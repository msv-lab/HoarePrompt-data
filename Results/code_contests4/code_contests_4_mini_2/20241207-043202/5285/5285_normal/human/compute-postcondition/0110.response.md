To determine if the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to analyze the condition `newn > newk ** st`. 

1. We are given that `newnewk` is greater than `newn`. This means that `newk` must also be less than `newn` for the condition to hold true. 
2. The variable `st`, which is the number of iterations executed, influences the condition through the exponent. If `st` is 0 or negative, `newk ** st` will either be 1 (if `st` is 0) or a fraction (if `st` is negative), which may still allow the condition to be true if `newn` is sufficiently larger than `newk`.
3. The current state indicates that `i` is equal to `st - 1`, meaning `st` must be at least 1 for `i` to be 0 or greater.
4. Therefore, we need to ensure that `newn` is greater than `newk ** st` when `st` is incremented to ensure at least one iteration of the loop.

Since `newnewk` being greater than `newn` suggests that `newk` could be adjusted to ensure that the condition holds true. 

To allow the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `newn` is greater than `newk ** st` where `st` should be at least 1.

State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is the number of iterations executed, for the loop to execute the first time `newn` must be greater than `newk ** st` with `st` being at least 1.**
