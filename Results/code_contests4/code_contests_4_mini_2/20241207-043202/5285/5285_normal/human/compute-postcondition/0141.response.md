The value of `newizv` is updated according to the expression `newizv * 2 + 1`. The previous value of `newizv` is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `newizv`. However, the conditions state that `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, and `st` is greater than 0. The variable `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute a second time, `st` must be greater than 1. 

Since there are no other impacts on the variables, the output state reflects the update to `newizv`. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`; `st` is greater than 0; `i` is 1; `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2 + 1`.

Output State: **`newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`; `st` is greater than 0; `i` is 1; `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2 + 1.**
