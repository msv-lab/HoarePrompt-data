The value of `newn` is decreased by `newk ** st`. The variable `newk` holds the value of `k`, and `st` is an exponent. The specific values of `newk` and `st` are not provided, but since `newn` is adjusted to be greater than `newk`, it will be reduced by a certain power of `newk`. The other variables (`b`, `d_osn`, `cur`, `s`, `res`, and `izv`) are not directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **`b` is a prime number greater than 2, `d_osn` contains at least one key, `cur` remains at least the square root of the original value of `b`, `s` remains 0, `res` is -1, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is adjusted to be greater than `newk`, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, and `newn` is decreased by `newk ** st`.**
