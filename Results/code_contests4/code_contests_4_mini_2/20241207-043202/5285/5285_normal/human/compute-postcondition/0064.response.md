Output State: **`b` is a prime number greater than 2, `d_osn` contains at least one key, `cur` remains at least the square root of the original value of `b`, `s` remains 0, `res` is -1, `izv` is 0, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is at least \( k^m \) (where \( m \) is the number of times the loop executed), `i` is increased by 1, `st` is the number of times the loop executed, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is \( k^{m+1} \)** where \( m \) is the maximum number of iterations before `newnewk` exceeds `newn`.
