The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st` (which is 0), `izv` is increased by `newizv` for each iteration executed, `b` is a prime number greater than 2, `d_osn` contains at least one key, `cur` remains at least the square root of the original value of `b`, `s` remains 0, `res` is -1, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `st` is now 0, and `i` is increased by 1.
