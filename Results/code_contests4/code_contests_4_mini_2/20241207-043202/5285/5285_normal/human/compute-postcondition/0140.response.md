According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `st`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `st`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `st` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` will increment by 1, making `i` equal to 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `st` must be greater than 1.

State: **`newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is 1; `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2 + 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `st` must be greater than 1**
