`cur` is assigned the value 3, and the previous values of the affected variables are not changed. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is a positive integer within the range 2 ≤ `b` ≤ 10^12; `cur` is 3.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is a positive integer within the range 2 ≤ `b` ≤ 10^12; `cur` is 3**
