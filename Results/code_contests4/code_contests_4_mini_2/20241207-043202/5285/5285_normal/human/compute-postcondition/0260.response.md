The variable `newizv` is updated by the expression `newizv * 2 + 1`. The previous value of `newizv` is unchanged, but it is now multiplied by 2 and then incremented by 1. The other variables (`newnewk`, `newn`, `st`, `i`, `izv`, and `newk`) remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `izv` remains unchanged, `newn` is less than or equal to 0, `newk` is unchanged, `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2 + 1`.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `izv` remains unchanged, `newn` is less than or equal to 0, `newk` is unchanged, `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2 + 1`**.
