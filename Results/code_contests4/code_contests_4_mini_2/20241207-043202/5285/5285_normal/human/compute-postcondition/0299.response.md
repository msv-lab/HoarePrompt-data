According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. For the loop to execute again, `newnewk` must be less than or equal to `newn`. At the end of the last iteration, `newn` is less than or equal to 0. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `newnewk` must be adjusted to be less than or equal to 0 as well, since `newn` cannot be greater than 0.

State: **`newn` is less than or equal to 0; `newnewk` is updated by multiplying it with `newk`; `st` is increased by 1 and for the loop to execute again `newnewk` must be less than or equal to 0**
