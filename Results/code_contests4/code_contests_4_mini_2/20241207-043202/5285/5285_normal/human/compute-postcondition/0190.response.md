The value of `newizv` is updated according to the expression `newizv = newizv * 2 + 1`. The previous value of `newizv` is 1, so after execution, `newizv` becomes `1 * 2 + 1`, which equals 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 1 or greater, `newn` is equal to `n`, `res` equals -1 or not equal to -1, `izv` is 0, `i` is 1, `b` is a prime number greater than 2, `d_osn` contains at least one key, `cur` remains at least the square root of the original value of `b`, `s` remains 0, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `mlt` is assigned the value of `izv // d_osn[newk]`, and `newizv` is now 3.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 1 or greater, `newn` is equal to `n`, `res` equals -1 or not equal to -1, `izv` is 0, `i` is 1, `b` is a prime number greater than 2, `d_osn` contains at least one key, `cur` remains at least the square root of the original value of `b`, `s` remains 0, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `mlt` is assigned the value of `izv // d_osn[newk]`, and `newizv` is now 3.**
