According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `st` is 1. Since `i` is not less than `st`, the loop will not execute again. 

However, if we consider the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. For the loop to execute again, `st` must be greater than 2. 

State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of 1, `st` is 1, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `st` must be greater than 2**
