According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `st` is at least 2 (since `st` is greater than or equal to 1). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `st` must be greater than 2.

State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 2, `newn` is equal to `n`, `res` equals -1 or not equal to -1, `izv` is 0, `i` is 2, `b` is a prime number greater than 2, `d_osn` contains at least one key, `cur` remains at least the square root of the original value of `b`, `s` remains 0, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `mlt` is assigned the value of `izv // d_osn[newk]`, and `newizv` is now 3.**
