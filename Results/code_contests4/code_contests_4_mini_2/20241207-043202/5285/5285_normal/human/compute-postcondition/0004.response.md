According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is greater than 1, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `b` is an integer within the range 2 ≤ b ≤ 10^12, which guarantees that `b` is at least 2. Therefore, `b` is already greater than 1, and no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `b` is an integer within the range 2 ≤ b ≤ 10^12; `s` is 0; `d_osn` is a defaultdict of int initialized; `cur` is 2**
