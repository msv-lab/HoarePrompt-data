The code assigns a new value to `newizv`, which is calculated as `newizv * 2 + 1`. However, the initial value of `newizv` is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `newizv` after execution.

The other variables `b`, `d_osn`, `cur`, `s`, `res`, `izv`, `newk`, `newn`, `i`, and `st` are not affected by this operation. Thus, we can only note that the state of `newizv` is updated based on its previous value.

Output State: **`b` is a prime number greater than 2, `d_osn` contains at least one key, `cur` remains at least the square root of the original value of `b`, `s` remains 0, `res` is -1, `izv` is 0, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is at least \( k^m \), `i` is 0, `st` is at least 1; `newizv` is updated as `newizv * 2 + 1`.**
