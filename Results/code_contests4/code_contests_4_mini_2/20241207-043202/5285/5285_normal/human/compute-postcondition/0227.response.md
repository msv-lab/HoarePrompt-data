The variable `newizv` is updated according to the expression `newizv = newizv * 2 + 1`. The previous value of `newizv` is multiplied by 2 and then incremented by 1. The other variables (`newnewk`, `st`, and `i`) remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this line of code. 

Since the exact value of `newizv` is not provided, we can only indicate that its value will be dynamically calculated based on its previous state.

Output State: **`newnewk` is `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `st` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute a third time, `i` is 2, and `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2 + 1**.
