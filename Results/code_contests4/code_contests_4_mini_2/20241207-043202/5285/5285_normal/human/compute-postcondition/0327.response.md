The variable `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`. Since the previous value of `newk` is unknown, we cannot determine the specific value of `newnewk`. The other variables (`newn`, `i`, `st`, and `newizv`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` is incremented by 1, `st` is 0, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` is incremented by 1, `st` is 0, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`.**
