The value of `newn` is decremented by `newk` raised to the power of `st`. Given that `newn` is greater than `newk ** st`, the result of the operation will still leave `newn` as a positive value. The values of the other variables (`newk`, `st`, `i`, `newizv`, and `izv`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than its previous value but still greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is `st - 1`, `newizv` is equal to `2^st - 1`, and `izv` is increased by `newizv`.
