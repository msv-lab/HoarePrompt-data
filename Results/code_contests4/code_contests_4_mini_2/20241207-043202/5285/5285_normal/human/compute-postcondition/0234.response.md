The variable `newn` is assigned the value of `newn - newk ** st`. We know that `newk` is 1 and `st` is 0. The expression `newk ** st` calculates to `1 ** 0`, which equals 1. Therefore, the equation simplifies to `newn = newn - 1`. 

Since we do not have the specific previous value of `newn`, we cannot determine its exact value after the operation. However, we can confirm that `newn` is decreased by 1. The values of `newk`, `st`, `i`, and `newizv` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`newnewk` is 1, `st` is 0, `i` is less than 10, `newizv` is added to `izv`, `newn` is decreased by 1**.
