The variable `cur` is initialized with the value 2. This does not affect the other variables `n`, `b`, `s`, or `d_osn`, as they remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `b` is an integer within the range 2 ≤ b ≤ 10^12; `s` is 0; `d_osn` is a defaultdict of int initialized; `cur` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `b` is an integer within the range 2 ≤ b ≤ 10^12; `s` is 0; `d_osn` is a defaultdict of int initialized; `cur` is 2**
