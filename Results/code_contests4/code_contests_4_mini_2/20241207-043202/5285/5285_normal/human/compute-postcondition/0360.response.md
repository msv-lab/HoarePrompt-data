The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing it from 2 to 3. The values of other variables (`newnewk`, `st`, `izv`, `newn`, `newk`) remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 0, `i` is 3, `izv` is increased by `newizv` for each iteration, and `newn` is decreased by `newk` multiplied by the number of iterations executed until `newn` is no longer greater than `newk`.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 0, `i` is 3, `izv` is increased by `newizv` for each iteration, and `newn` is decreased by `newk` multiplied by the number of iterations executed until `newn` is no longer greater than `newk`.**
