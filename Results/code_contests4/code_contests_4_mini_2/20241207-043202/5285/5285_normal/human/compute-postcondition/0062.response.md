The code `newnewk *= newk` multiplies the current value of `newnewk` by the value of `newk`. 

- The initial value of `newnewk` is \( k^3 \).
- The initial value of `newk` is \( k \).
- Therefore, after executing the multiplication, `newnewk` will be equal to \( k^3 \times k \), which simplifies to \( k^4 \).

The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `b` is a prime number greater than 2, `d_osn` contains at least one key, `cur` remains at least the square root of the original value of `b`, `s` remains 0, `res` is -1, `izv` is 0, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is at least \( k^3 \), `i` is increased by 1, `st` is 2, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is \( k^4 \).
