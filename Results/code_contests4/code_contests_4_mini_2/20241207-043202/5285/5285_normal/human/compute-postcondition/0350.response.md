The value of `newn` is updated by subtracting `newk ** st` from its current value. Given that `st` is 1, the expression simplifies to `newk ** 1`, which is just `newk`. Therefore, `newn` will decrease by `newk`. The other variables (`newnewk`, `i`, and `izv`) remain unaffected in this operation.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 1, `i` is 2, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, and `newn` is updated to `newn - newk`.**
