The value of `newn` is assigned the result of `newn - newk ** st`. Given that `st` is 1, the calculation simplifies to `newn - newk`. The previous value of `newn` is greater than `newk`, so after this operation, `newn` will still be greater than `newk`, allowing the loop to execute again.

The output state reflects the updated value of `newn` after the operation, while other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 1, `i` is 2, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, `newn` is updated, and for the loop to execute again `newn` must be greater than `newk`.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 1, `i` is 2, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, `newn` is updated, and for the loop to execute again `newn` must be greater than `newk`.**
