The code assigns `newn` the value of `newn - newk ** st`. The variable `newn` is affected by subtracting `newk` raised to the power of `st` from it. The values of `izv` and `newizv` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `izv` is increased by `newizv`, and `newn` is updated based on its previous value and the result of `newk ** st`.

Output State: **`izv` is increased by `newizv`; `newn` is updated to `newn - newk ** st`.**
