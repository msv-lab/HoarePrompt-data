According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `st`. The loop will execute if `st` is at least 1. Since the state indicates that `i` is increased by 0, it means that `i` starts at 0, which is valid for the loop index. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed the first time, `st` must be greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` will be equal to `st`. 

State: **`newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
