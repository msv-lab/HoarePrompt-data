According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. The loop condition is `newn > newk ** st`. 

Currently, we have the following state:
- `newk` is less than `newn` because `newnewk` is greater than `newn`.
- `st` is 1.
- `newk` raised to the power of `st` (which is `newk ** 1` or simply `newk`) must be less than `newn` for the loop to execute.

Since `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, this suggests that `newk` must also be adjusted. To ensure the loop executes, `newk` needs to be less than `newn`. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, we need to ensure that `newn` is greater than `newk`.

State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 1, `i` is 2, `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2 + 1`, for the loop to execute the first time `newk` must be less than `newn`**
