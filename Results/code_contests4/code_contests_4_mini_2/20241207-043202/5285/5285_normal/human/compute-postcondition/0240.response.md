The code `st = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `st`. The previous value of `st` was 0, and this assignment does not change its state. The other variables `newnewk`, `i`, `izv`, and `newn` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is 1, `st` is 0, `i` is less than 10; `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed, `newn` is decreased to a value less than or equal to 0.

Output State: **`newnewk` is 1, `st` is 0, `i` is less than 10; `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed, `newn` is decreased to a value less than or equal to 0.**
