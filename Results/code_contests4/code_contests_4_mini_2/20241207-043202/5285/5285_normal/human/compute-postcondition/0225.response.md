The variable `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2 + 1`. The previous value of `newizv` is not specified, but we know it will be modified by this expression. The values of the other variables (`newnewk`, `st`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the change in `newizv`.

Output State: **`newnewk` is `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `st` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute a second time, `i` is 1, and `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2 + 1**.
