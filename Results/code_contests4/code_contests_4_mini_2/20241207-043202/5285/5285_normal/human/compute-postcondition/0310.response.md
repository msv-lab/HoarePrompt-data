According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `st` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute a second time. Since `st` must be greater than 1, it implies that for the loop to execute one more time, `st` must be at least 2. After the current iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2.

State: **`newn` is less than or equal to 0, for the loop to execute a second time `st` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2 + 1**
