The value of `newn` is updated by subtracting `newk ** st` from its previous value. Since `st` is equal to 0, `newk ** st` evaluates to 1 (as any number raised to the power of 0 is 1). Therefore, `newn` is decreased by 1. 

Given that `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, it indicates that the new value of `newn` will still be less than `newnewk`. The previous values of other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is equal to 0, `izv` is updated to `izv + newizv`, `newk` is unchanged, `newizv` remains unchanged, and `newn` is now decreased by 1.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is equal to 0, `izv` is updated to `izv + newizv`, `newk` is unchanged, `newizv` remains unchanged, and `newn` is now decreased by 1.**
