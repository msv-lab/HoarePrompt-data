The value of `cur` is incremented by 2, but the previous value of `cur` is unknown. The values of `n` and `b` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `b` is a positive integer within the range 2 ≤ b ≤ 10^12; `cur` is increased by 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `b` is a positive integer within the range 2 ≤ b ≤ 10^12; `cur` is increased by 2**
