According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `st`. If `st` is greater than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is initialized to 0, and `st` is greater than 0, indicating that the loop has executed at least once. After this iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 for the next loop iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `st` must be greater than the new value of `i`, which will be 1.

State: **`newnewk` is `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `st` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute a second time, `i` is 1, and `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2 + 1`.**
