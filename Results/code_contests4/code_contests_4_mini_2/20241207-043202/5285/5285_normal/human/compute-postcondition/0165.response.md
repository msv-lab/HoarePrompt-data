`izv` is assigned the value `0`. The previous state of `izv` was increased by `newizv` for each iteration executed, but since no iterations are mentioned in this code snippet, the value remains `0`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `res` equals -1 or not equal to -1, `izv` is 0, `i` is 10, `b` is a prime number greater than 2, `d_osn` contains at least one key, `cur` remains at least the square root of the original value of `b`, `s` remains 0, `newk` is the next key in `d_osn`, `mlt` is assigned the value of `izv // d_osn[newk]`.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `res` equals -1 or not equal to -1, `izv` is 0, `i` is 10, `b` is a prime number greater than 2, `d_osn` contains at least one key, `cur` remains at least the square root of the original value of `b`, `s` remains 0, `newk` is the next key in `d_osn`, `mlt` is assigned the value of `izv // d_osn[newk]`.**
