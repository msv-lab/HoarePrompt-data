According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. The loop will continue as long as `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`. At the end of the last iteration, `newn` is less than its previous value but still greater than `newk ** st`, which means that for the loop to execute one more time, `newn` must remain greater than `newk ** st`.

Since `newn` is currently less than its previous value but still greater than `newk ** st`, it indicates that it could potentially reach a point where it is no longer greater than `newk ** st` in subsequent iterations. Therefore, we need to ensure that `newn` is adjusted to maintain the condition for the loop to execute again. 

The only state that needs to be adjusted is `newn`, which must be kept greater than `newk ** st`.

State: **`newn` is less than its previous value but still greater than `newk ** st`, and for the loop to execute again, `newn` needs to remain greater than `newk ** st`.**
