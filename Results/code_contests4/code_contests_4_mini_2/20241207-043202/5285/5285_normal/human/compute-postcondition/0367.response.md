To determine the output state, we start with the initial values of the variables. The variable `newnewk` is equal to `newk`, but we do not have the specific value of `newk`. The variable `st` is 1, and `i` is 3.

The line of code `newnewk *= newk` means that `newnewk` will be multiplied by `newk`. Since `newnewk` is currently equal to `newk`, this operation is effectively squaring `newk`. However, without knowing the value of `newk`, we cannot specify the new value of `newnewk`.

Thus, the output state reflects the fact that `newnewk` is updated to be `newk` squared, but we cannot provide an exact numeric value.

Output State: **`newnewk` is updated to be `newk` squared; `st` is 1, `i` is 3**
