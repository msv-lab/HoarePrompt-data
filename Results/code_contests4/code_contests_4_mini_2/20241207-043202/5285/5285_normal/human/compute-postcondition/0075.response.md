To determine what states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute at least one time, we will analyze the condition of the loop:

The loop condition is `newn > newk ** st`. For the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `newn` is greater than `newk ** st`.

1. **Identifying the Variables**:
   - `newk` is assigned the value of `k` (not specified in the provided state).
   - `newn` is at least \( k^m \).
   - `st` is at least 0.

2. **Understanding the Condition**:
   - Let's analyze the condition `newn > newk ** st`:
     - If `st` is 0, then `newk ** st` equals `1` (since any number to the power of 0 is 1).
     - Since `newn` is at least \( k^m \), we need to ensure that \( k^m > 1 \) for the loop to execute when `st` is 0.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - If `k` is greater than 1 and `m` is at least 1, then \( k^m \) will be greater than 1.
   - If `k` is equal to 1, then \( k^m \) will equal 1 regardless of `m`. Thus, we would need to ensure that `newn` is greater than 1.
   - If `k` is less than 1, it is not a prime number, which contradicts the initial state where `b` is a prime number greater than 2.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The critical adjustment is to ensure that `newn` (which is at least \( k^m \)) is greater than 1 when `st` is 0.
   - If `k` is greater than 1 and `m` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Otherwise, adjustments need to be made to ensure these conditions are met.

State: **`b` is a prime number greater than 2, `d_osn` contains at least one key, `cur` remains at least the square root of the original value of `b`, `s` remains 0, `res` is -1, `izv` is 0, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is at least \( k^m \) and must be greater than `newk ** st` for the loop to execute, `i` is `st`, `st` is at least 0, and `newizv` is updated as `2^{st} - 1`.**
