Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `b` is a positive integer within the range 2 ≤ b ≤ 10^12; `cur` is at least the square root of `b`; if `b` is divisible by `cur`, then `b` is halved, `s` remains 0, `d_osn[2]` is incremented by 1, and `cur` is still 2; if `b` is not divisible by `cur`, then `cur` is updated to either 3 or 4 depending on its previous value.***
