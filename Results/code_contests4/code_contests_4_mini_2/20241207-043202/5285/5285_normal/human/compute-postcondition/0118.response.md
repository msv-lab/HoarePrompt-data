The value of `newn` is decremented by `newk ** st`. The previous value of `newn` is not specified, and `st` is a power that affects how much `newk` is raised. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `newn` is decreased, but without specific values, we cannot specify the exact result. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`izv` is increased by `newizv`; `newn` is decremented by `newk ** st` and for the loop to execute again `newn` must be greater than `newk`.**
