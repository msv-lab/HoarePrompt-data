The variable `newn` is assigned the value of `newn - newk ** st`. Since `st` is 1, `newk ** st` simplifies to `newk`. Therefore, the expression can be rewritten as `newn = newn - newk`. The value of `newn` will be decreased by the value of `newk`. The variable `izv` is not affected by this operation. The initial state mentions that `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, but the exact values are not specified, so we can only describe the relationship.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 1, `i` is 2, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, `newn` is decreased by `newk`.**
