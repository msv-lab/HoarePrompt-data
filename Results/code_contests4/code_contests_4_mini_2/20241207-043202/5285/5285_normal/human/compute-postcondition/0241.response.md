The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is less than 10, so after execution, `i` will be at least 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is 1, `st` is 0, `i` is at least 1 and less than 11; `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed, `newn` is decreased to a value less than or equal to 0.
