According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `st` is at least 1 (indicating it is greater than or equal to 1). For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` being 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `st` must be at least 2.

State: **`b` is a prime number greater than 2, `d_osn` contains at least one key, `cur` remains at least the square root of the original value of `b`, `s` remains 0, `res` is -1, `izv` is 0, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is at least \( k^m \), `i` is 2, `st` is at least 2, and `newizv` is updated based on its previous value.**
