Correctness: **False**.

The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect in terms of the problem description. 

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()`, which is not available in Python 3. It should use `input()` instead. This could lead to a `NameError` in a Python 3 environment.

2. **Factorial Calculation**: The program does not explicitly compute the factorial of `n`. The problem requires calculating the number of trailing zeros in the base `b` representation of `n!`. The current implementation seems to only factor the base `b` but does not leverage the factorial itself to determine trailing zeros.

3. **Trailing Zeros Calculation**: The logic for calculating trailing zeros in the base representation is not correctly implemented. For example, it uses a while loop that may not correctly compute the highest powers of the prime factors of `b` within `n!`.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not consider edge cases such as when `n = 1` or when `b` is a prime number greater than `n`, which could lead to incorrect results. 

Due to these flaws, the program does not satisfy the requirements of the problem statement.
