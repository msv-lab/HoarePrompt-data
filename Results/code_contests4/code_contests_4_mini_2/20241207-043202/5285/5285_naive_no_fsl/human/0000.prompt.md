You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The number "zero" is called "love" (or "l'oeuf" to be precise, literally means "egg" in French), for example when denoting the zero score in a game of tennis. 

Aki is fond of numbers, especially those with trailing zeros. For example, the number 9200 has two trailing zeros. Aki thinks the more trailing zero digits a number has, the prettier it is.

However, Aki believes, that the number of trailing zeros of a number is not static, but depends on the base (radix) it is represented in. Thus, he considers a few scenarios with some numbers and bases. And now, since the numbers he used become quite bizarre, he asks you to help him to calculate the beauty of these numbers.

Given two integers n and b (in decimal notation), your task is to calculate the number of trailing zero digits in the b-ary (in the base/radix of b) representation of n ! ([factorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial) of n). 

Input

The only line of the input contains two integers n and b (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^{18}, 2 ≤ b ≤ 10^{12}).

Output

Print an only integer — the number of trailing zero digits in the b-ary representation of n!

Note

In the first example, 6!_{(10)} = 720_{(10)} = 880_{(9)}.

In the third and fourth example, 5!_{(10)} = 120_{(10)} = 1111000_{(2)}.

The representation of the number x in the b-ary base is d_1, d_2, …, d_k if x = d_1 b^{k - 1} + d_2 b^{k - 2} + … + d_k b^0, where d_i are integers and 0 ≤ d_i ≤ b - 1. For example, the number 720 from the first example is represented as 880_{(9)} since 720 = 8 ⋅ 9^2 + 8 ⋅ 9 + 0 ⋅ 1.

You can read more about bases [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix).
Program:
```
(n, b) = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
s = 0
d_osn = defaultdict(int)
cur = 2
while b > 1:
    if b % cur == 0:
        d_osn[cur] += 1
        b /= cur
        continue
    elif cur == 2:
        cur = 3
    else:
        cur += 2
    if cur >= b ** 0.5:
        break
if b > 2:
    d_osn[b] += 1
izv = defaultdict(int)
res = -1
for k in d_osn:
    izv = 0
    newk = k
    newn = n
    i = 0
    while True and i < 10:
        st = 0
        i += 1
        newizv = 0
        newnewk = newk
        while newnewk <= newn:
            newnewk *= newk
            st += 1
        if st == 0:
            break
        for i in range(st):
            newizv = newizv * 2 + 1
        while newn > newk ** st:
            izv += newizv
            newn = newn - newk ** st
    mlt = izv // d_osn[k]
    if res == -1:
        res = mlt
    elif mlt < res:
        res = mlt
print(res)
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
