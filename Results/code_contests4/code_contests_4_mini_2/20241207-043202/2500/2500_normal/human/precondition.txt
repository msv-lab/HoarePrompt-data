N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 60, K is an integer such that 1 <= K <= N, and each piece of meat is represented by coordinates (x_i, y_i) where -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000 and hardness c_i is an integer such that 1 <= c_i <= 100. The coordinates of each piece of meat (x_i, y_i) are unique for all i.
