Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer indices `i` and `j`, and returns the Euclidean distance between two pieces of meat located at coordinates (X[i], Y[i]) and (X[j], Y[j]). It is assumed that `i` and `j` refer to distinct pieces of meat, as the function is designed to calculate the distance between them. **
