The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `i` and `j`. Both `i` and `j` are integers that refer to indices of distinct pieces of meat represented by their coordinates. The function calculates and returns the Euclidean distance between the two pieces of meat located at coordinates (X[i], Y[i]) and (X[j], Y[j]). Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two integer indices and return the Euclidean distance between the pieces of meat at those indices. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two integer parameters i and j, and returns the Euclidean distance between the pieces of meat located at coordinates (X[i], Y[i]) and (X[j], Y[j]).**
