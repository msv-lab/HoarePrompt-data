Correctness: **False**

The provided program only calculates the Euclidean distance between two pieces of meat, which is a part of the overall problem but does not fulfill the complete requirements of the problem description. The problem is to determine the minimum time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready for grilling based on their coordinates and hardness, which involves more than just calculating the distances.

To solve the problem, one would need to implement an algorithm that finds the optimal location for the heat source that minimizes the maximum time taken for K pieces of meat to be ready. The program provided does not address this requirement and lacks the overall logic needed to solve the problem as specified. 

In summary, the program is incorrect because it only computes distances and does not attempt to find the optimal heat source location or the minimum time required for K pieces of meat, which is essential to meet the problem description.
