Correctness: **False**

The provided program only defines a single function `func_1` that calculates the Euclidean distance between two pieces of meat given their indices. However, the problem description requires a complete solution that not only calculates distances but also determines the optimal placement of a heat source to minimize the time required to grill at least K pieces of meat. 

The requirements in the problem description are not addressed by the program, as it lacks:

1. A mechanism to evaluate all possible locations for the heat source.
2. A method to compute the time required for each piece of meat to be ready based on the chosen heat source position.
3. Logic to select the optimal heat source location that minimizes the time for at least K pieces of meat to be ready.

Since the function does not fulfill the complete problem requirements, it does not meet the problem description's specifications.
