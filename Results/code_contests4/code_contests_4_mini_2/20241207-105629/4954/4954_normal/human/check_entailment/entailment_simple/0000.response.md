Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains a few issues that prevent it from correctly adhering to the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` to read input, which is not valid in Python 3. It should use `input()` instead. This would cause a runtime error when executing the program, as `raw_input()` does not exist in Python 3.

2. **Mapping of Input**: The use of `map(int, raw_input().split())` directly assigns the result to `B` without converting it into a list. This would result in `B` being a `map` object instead of a list, which would cause issues when later trying to access its elements. The correct approach would be to wrap it in `list()`.

3. **Handling of A**: Similar to `B`, `A` is read in a loop but is not converted into a list. This would lead to similar issues when trying to perform operations on `A`.

4. **Lack of Output Formatting**: The output is printed directly without any formatting. While this might not contradict the problem description directly, it is generally a good practice to ensure that outputs are formatted as expected.

5. **No Edge Cases Consideration**: The program does not handle potential edge cases, such as when the input values are at their limits, which could lead to unexpected behaviors or errors if the calculations were to exceed typical integer bounds.

To summarize, due to these issues, the program will not work correctly for all potential inputs as described in the problem statement.
