According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `N` is a positive integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 1, and for the loop to execute again, `N` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1**
