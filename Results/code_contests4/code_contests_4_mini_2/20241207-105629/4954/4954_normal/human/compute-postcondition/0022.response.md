Functionality: ** The function accepts user input for a positive integer `N` (the number of code pieces), a positive integer `M` (the number of characteristics per code), an integer `C`, a list `B` of `M` integers, and a 2D list `A` of integers. It counts how many times the sum of the products of corresponding elements from `A` and `B`, plus `C`, is greater than 0. The result is printed as the output, which represents the count of such cases. **
