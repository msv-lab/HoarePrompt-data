The line of code `A = map(int, raw_input().split())` assigns the values of `A` by taking input from the user, splitting it into individual components, and converting each component to an integer. The values of `N`, `i`, `tmp`, and `ans` are not directly affected by this operation, but `A` is now defined as a collection of integers based on the input.

The state of `A` will depend on the specific input provided. Since the initial state does not specify the content of `A`, we can only conclude that `A` will be a list of integers.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `tmp` is a list of products of `A[m]` and `B[m]` for `m` in range `M`, `ans` is increased by 1 if the sum of `tmp` plus `C` is greater than 0; `A` is a list of integers based on user input.**
