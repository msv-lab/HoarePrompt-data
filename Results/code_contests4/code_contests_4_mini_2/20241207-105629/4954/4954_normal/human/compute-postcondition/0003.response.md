According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `N`. Since `N` is a positive integer representing the number of code pieces, it must be at least 1 for the loop to execute. The variable `i` will start at 0 for the first iteration. The states that need to be adjusted are therefore related to ensuring that both `N` is greater than 0 and that `i` is initialized correctly.

State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time**
