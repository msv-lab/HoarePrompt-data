N is a positive integer representing the number of code pieces (1 <= N <= 20), M is a positive integer representing the number of characteristics per code (1 <= M <= 20), C is an integer (-100 <= C <= 100), B is a list of M integers where each B_i is in the range (-100 <= B_i <= 100), and A is a list of N lists where each A_ij is an integer in the range (-100 <= A_ij <= 100).
