N is a positive integer representing the number of code pieces (1 ≤ N ≤ 20), M is a positive integer representing the number of characteristics per code (1 ≤ M ≤ 20), C is an integer (-100 ≤ C ≤ 100), B is a list of M integers where each B_i is in the range of -100 to 100, and A is a 2D list of integers where each A_{ij} is in the range of -100 to 100.
