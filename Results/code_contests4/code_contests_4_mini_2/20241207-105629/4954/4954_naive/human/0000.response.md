To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

### Problem Description:
The program is supposed to evaluate a condition for several pieces of source code characterized by M integers. For each piece of code, it multiplies the corresponding characteristics (A) by given weights (B) and adds a constant (C). It counts how many pieces of code satisfy the condition that the sum is greater than zero.

### Program:
```python
(N, M, C) = map(int, raw_input().split())
B = map(int, raw_input().split())
ans = 0
for i in range(0, N):
    A = map(int, raw_input().split())
    tmp = [A[m] * B[m] for m in range(M)]
    if sum(tmp) + C > 0:
        ans += 1
print(ans)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the initial values N, M, and C, and then reads the weights B and each piece of code's characteristics A.

2. **Computation**:
   - For each piece of code, it computes the product of A and B element-wise using a list comprehension.
   - It then sums these products and adds C to check if the result is greater than zero.

3. **Counting Valid Codes**: It maintains a count (`ans`) of how many pieces of code meet the condition.

### Testing Edge Cases:
Let's consider edge cases that could potentially break the program:
- **All zeros**: If `A` and `B` are both lists of zeros, the sum will be zero, and thus it should not count that piece of code unless C is positive.
- **Negative C**: If C is a large negative number, it could cause valid pieces of code (where the sum of products is positive) to be counted incorrectly, especially if the products are small.
- **Mixed signs**: The code should correctly handle cases where some `A` values are positive and others are negative, affecting the overall sum.

### Example Case:
Consider the following input:
```
1 1 -100
1
100
```
Here, the calculation would be:
- A = [100], B = [1], C = -100
- tmp = [100 * 1] = [100]
- sum(tmp) + C = 100 - 100 = 0

According to the condition, this should not count as valid since 0 is not greater than 0.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to handle the main requirements effectively, but the example case above demonstrates that it can potentially miscount when the sum exactly equals zero. Since the problem description requires the sum to be strictly greater than zero, the program does not handle this case correctly.

Thus, the correctness of the program is:
Correctness: **False**.
