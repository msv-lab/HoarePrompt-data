Correctness: **False**.

The given program uses a static list to return predefined outputs based on the input minus 10. However, it does not correctly handle all potential cases. For example:

- If the input is `9`, the expected output should be `0` since there are no cards that can be drawn to make the total `9` (as the first card is a queen worth `10` points). However, the program will return `4` since `9 - 10` equals `-1`, which refers to the first element of the list `[0, 4, 4, 4, ...]`.

This demonstrates that the program does not correctly evaluate all inputs and is therefore incorrect according to the problem description.
