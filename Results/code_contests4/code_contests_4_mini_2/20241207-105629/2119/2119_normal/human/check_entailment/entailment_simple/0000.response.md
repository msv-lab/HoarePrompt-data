Correctness: **False**

The annotated program has several issues that prevent it from correctly implementing the logic described in the problem statement.

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `input()` directly within the index of the list without converting it to an integer. This could lead to a type error because `input()` returns a string.

2. **Indexing Logic**: The program accesses a pre-defined list `[0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 15, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` with the expression `input() - 10`. This means that the valid input must be between 10 and 25 (inclusive) to avoid an index error. However, the program does not handle inputs below 10, which would lead to incorrect indexing.

3. **Incorrect Output Values**: The values in the list do not correctly represent the number of valid second cards for each possible input value of `n`. For example:
   - If `n = 10`, the expected output is `0`, which is correctly represented, but the other outputs must correspond exactly to the number of valid cards that add up to `n` when combined with the queen (which is worth 10 points). The provided values do not match the correct counts as per the problem description.

Given these issues, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description accurately. It fails to correctly compute the number of valid second cards and does not handle inputs properly. Thus, the program is incorrect.
