The given program is designed to determine the number of ways to get a second card such that the total points equal a specified number `n`, given that the first card is the queen of spades, which is worth 10 points.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The program takes an integer input `n` that represents the required sum of points. It correctly constrains `n` to be between 1 and 25.

2. **Value Mapping**: The program uses a predefined list to map the possible outcomes based on the value of `n`. The list is:
   ```
   [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 15, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   ```
   This list corresponds to the number of cards that can make up the required sum when the first card is a queen (10 points).

3. **Index Adjustment**: The input value `n` is adjusted by subtracting 10 (`input() - 10`), which reflects the points contributed by the queen. The adjusted index is then used to access the predefined list.

4. **Output**: The program prints the value found at the adjusted index. If the input `n` is:
   - Less than 10, the index will be negative, leading to an IndexError.
   - Between 10 and 25, it will retrieve the corresponding number of ways to achieve the sum.

### Evaluation Against the Problem Description:
- The problem description specifies that there are specific ways to get the second card based on the value of `n`. The predefined list does provide the correct number of combinations for values of `n` from 10 to 25.
- However, if `n` is less than 10 (specifically from 1 to 9), the program will attempt to access a negative index in the list, which is not handled and will result in an IndexError. This is a fault because it does not account for valid inputs as specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases for the input `n`, particularly when `n` is less than 10. This results in a failure to meet the problem requirements for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **False**
