The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates based on an internal logic and is constrained to work within the range of integers for `n`, which is defined as 1 ≤ n ≤ 25. After executing the function body, it will return a value based on this internal logic which is not specified in the provided output information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to execute its internal logic and return a result based on that logic, adhering to the constraint of 1 ≤ n ≤ 25. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters but executes internal logic and returns a result based on the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 25.**
