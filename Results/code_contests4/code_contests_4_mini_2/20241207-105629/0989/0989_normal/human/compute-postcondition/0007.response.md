To determine the output state, let's analyze the provided code snippet step by step.

1. We have two variables, `ans1` and `ans2`. 
   - `ans1` is a string of '9's, and its length is equal to `len(s)`.
   - `ans2` is a string that consists of '1' followed by `n` zeros.

2. The code compares `ans1` with `s`. 
   - If `ans1` (a string of '9's) is greater than `s`, then `print(ans1)` will execute.
   - If `ans1` is not greater than `s`, then `print(ans2 * (len(s) // n))` will execute.

3. The result of the print statement will depend on the comparison between `ans1` and `s`:
   - If `ans1` (which is a string of '9's) is greater than `s`, the output will be `ans1`.
   - If it is not greater, the output will be the string `ans2` repeated `(len(s) // n)` times.

Since the values for `s` and `n` are not given, we can't determine exactly which branch will execute or what the resulting output will be. However, we can summarize the potential outcomes based on the comparison.

Output State: **`ans1` is a string of '9's with length equal to len(s); `ans2` is '1' followed by `n` zeros; output is either `ans1` (if `ans1` > `s`) or `ans2` repeated (len(s) // n) times (if `ans1` <= `s`).**
