Postcondition: ***`L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 100000, `A` is a positive integer represented as a string with a length between 1 and 100000 characters, `n` is an input integer, and `s` is an input string. If the length of `s` is not divisible by `n`, the output is `tem` (which is '1' followed by (n - 1) zeros) repeated (len(s) // n + 1) times. Otherwise, if the length of `s` is divisible by `n` and the first `n` characters of `s` are all '9's, the output is '9's with length equal to `len(s)` if it is greater than `s`, otherwise it's '1' followed by `n` zeros repeated `len(s) // n` times. If the first `n` characters of `s` are not all '9's, the output is formed by repeating the concatenated string of `tem` (which is '1' followed by (n - 1) zeros) for `len(s) // n` times, yielding `ans2`, with the output being `ans1` if it exceeds `s`, otherwise it will be `ans2`.***
