To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we analyze the effect of the code based on the initial state.

1. `tem` is defined as '1' followed by (n - 1) zeros. This means `tem` will be a string composed of '1' followed by a number of zeros equal to `n - 1`.
2. The expression `len(s) // n` calculates the integer division of the length of the string `s` by the input integer `n`.
3. The value `len(s) // n + 1` will determine how many times the string `tem` should be repeated.
4. The final output of the print statement is the string `tem` repeated `len(s) // n + 1` times.

Assuming the specific values of `L`, `A`, `n`, and `s` are provided, we can calculate the output. However, since we do not have specific values for `L`, `A`, `n`, and `s`, we express the output in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`tem` is '1' followed by (n - 1) zeros; the output is `tem` repeated (len(s) // n + 1) times.**
