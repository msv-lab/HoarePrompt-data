The variable `tem` is assigned the value of the string `'1'` concatenated with `'0' * (n - 1)`. This means that `tem` will consist of the character `'1'` followed by `n - 1` zeros. The other variables (`L`, `A`, `n`, `s`) are not impacted by this line of code.

Since `n` is an input integer, let's denote the resulting length of `tem` as `len(tem)`, which will be `1 + (n - 1) = n`. Therefore, `tem` will be a string that starts with '1' followed by `n - 1` zeros.

Output State: **`L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 100000; `A` is a positive integer represented as a string with a length between 1 and 100000 characters; `n` is an input integer; `s` is an input string; `tem` is '1' followed by (n - 1) zeros.**
