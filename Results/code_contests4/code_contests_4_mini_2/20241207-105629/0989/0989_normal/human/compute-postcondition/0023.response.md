The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 100000; `A` is a positive integer represented as a string with a length between 1 and 100000 characters; `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute a second time; `i` is -1; cannot determine the final state of `tem` due to lack of information, and we break out of the most internal loop.
