Output State: **`L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 100000; `A` is a positive integer represented as a string with a length between 1 and 100000 characters; `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute a second time; `i` is -1; `tem[i]` is '0' and we break out of the most internal loop.**
