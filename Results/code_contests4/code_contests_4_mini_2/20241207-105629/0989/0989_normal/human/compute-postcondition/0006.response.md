In the given code snippet, the variables `ans1` and `ans2` are being assigned values based on the length of the string `s` and the integer `n`. 

1. `ans1` is assigned the value `'9' * len(s)`. Since `s` is a string whose length is divisible by `n`, we know that `len(s)` is some positive integer value. Therefore, `ans1` will be a string consisting solely of the character '9', repeated for the entire length of `s`.

2. `ans2` is assigned the value `'1' + '0' * n`. Here, '0' is repeated `n` times, so `ans2` will be a string starting with '1' followed by `n` zeros.

Since the values of `L`, `A`, and the specifics of `s` are not explicitly defined beyond the constraints, we can summarize the output state based on the assignments made to `ans1` and `ans2`.

Output State: **`ans1` is a string of '9's with length equal to len(s); `ans2` is '1' followed by `n` zeros.**
