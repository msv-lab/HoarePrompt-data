Postcondition: ***`L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 100000; `A` is a positive integer represented as a string with a length between 1 and 100000 characters; `n` is an input integer; `s` is an input string. The length of `s` is divisible by `n` (i.e., len(s) % n == 0), and the first `n` characters of `s` are not all '9's.***
