The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop that we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 100000, `A` is a positive integer represented as a string with a length between 1 and 100000 characters, `n` is at least 1, `tem[i]` is '1', `i` must be -1 for the loop to execute a second time, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
