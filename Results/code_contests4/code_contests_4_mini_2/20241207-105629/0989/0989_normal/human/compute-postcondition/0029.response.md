Postcondition: ***`L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 100000; `A` is a positive integer represented as a string with a length between 1 and 100000 characters; `n` is an input integer; `s` is an input string whose length is divisible by `n`. If the first `n` characters of `s` are all '9's, then `ans1`, a string of '9's with length equal to `len(s)`, is compared to `s`. If `ans1` is greater than `s`, the output is `ans1`; otherwise, the output is '1' followed by `n` zeros repeated `len(s) // n` times. In the else case, `ans2` is formed by repeating the concatenated string of `tem`, `len(s) // n` times, and the output will be `ans1` if it is greater than `s`, otherwise it will be `ans2`.***
