The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 100000, `A` is a positive integer represented as a string with a length between 1 and 100000 characters, `n` is at least 1, `i` is `n - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
