Postcondition: ***`L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 100000; `A` is a positive integer represented as a string with a length between 1 and 100000 characters; `n` is an input integer; `s` is an input string whose length is divisible by `n` (i.e., len(s) % n == 0); the first n characters of `s` are all '9' (i.e., s[:n] == '9' * n).***
