You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarpus has postcards and photos hung in a row on the wall. He decided to put them away to the closet and hang on the wall a famous painter's picture. Polycarpus does it like that: he goes from the left to the right and removes the objects consecutively. As Polycarpus doesn't want any mix-ups to happen, he will not carry in his hands objects of two different types. In other words, Polycarpus can't carry both postcards and photos simultaneously. Sometimes he goes to the closet and puts the objects there, thus leaving his hands free. Polycarpus must put all the postcards and photos to the closet. He cannot skip objects. What minimum number of times he should visit the closet if he cannot carry more than 5 items?

Input

The only line of the input data contains a non-empty string consisting of letters "С" and "P" whose length does not exceed 100 characters. If the i-th character in the string is the letter "С", that means that the i-th object (the numbering goes from the left to the right) on Polycarpus' wall is a postcard. And if the i-th character is the letter "P", than the i-th object on the wall is a photo.

Output

Print the only number — the minimum number of times Polycarpus has to visit the closet.

Note

In the first sample Polycarpus needs to take one item to the closet 7 times.

In the second sample Polycarpus can first take 3 postcards to the closet; then 3 more. He can take the 6 photos that are left in the similar way, going to the closet twice.

In the third sample Polycarpus can visit the closet twice, both times carrying 3 postcards. Then he can take there 2 photos at once, then one postcard and finally, he can carry the last 10 photos if he visits the closet twice.

In the fourth sample Polycarpus can visit the closet twice and take there all 10 postcards (5 items during each go).
Program:
```
str = raw_input()
n = len(str)
count = 0
hand = []
for i in range(0, n):
    if hand.__len__() == 0:
        hand.append(str[i])
    elif str[i] == hand[-1] and hand.__len__() < 5:
        hand.append(str[i])
    else:
        count = count + 1
        hand = [str[i]]
print(count + (hand.__len__() != 0))
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
