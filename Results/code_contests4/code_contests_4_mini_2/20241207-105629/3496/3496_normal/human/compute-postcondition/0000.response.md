The value of `str` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which accepts input from the user as a non-empty string consisting of the letters "C" and "P". Other variables are not affected, so the output state reflects the assignment made to `str`.

Output State: **`str` is a non-empty string consisting of letters "C" and "P"**
