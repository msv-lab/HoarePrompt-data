Postcondition: ***`count` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 1, and if `str[i]` is equal to the last character of `hand` and the length of `hand` is less than 5, we attempt to append the character at index 1 of `str` to `hand`. Otherwise, if `count` is 1, `hand` is set to the second character of `str`, `i` remains 1, and `n` remains unchanged.***
