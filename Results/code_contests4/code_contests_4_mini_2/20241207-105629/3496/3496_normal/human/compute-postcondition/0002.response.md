The variable `count` is initialized to 0. The values of the other variables, `str` and `n`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `str` is a non-empty string consisting of letters "C" and "P"; `n` is the length of that string (greater than 0); `count` is 0.

Output State: **`str` is a non-empty string consisting of letters "C" and "P"; `n` is the length of that string (greater than 0); `count` is 0**
