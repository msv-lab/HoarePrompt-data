Postcondition: ***`count` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 1. If `hand` is empty, an element from `str` at index 1 is appended to `hand`. If `hand` is not empty and `str[i]` equals the last character of `hand` with the length of `hand` being less than 5, the character at index 1 of `str` is appended to `hand`. Otherwise, if `count` is 1, `hand` is set to the second character of `str`, `i` remains 1, and `n` remains unchanged.***
