Postcondition: ***`count` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 2, if `hand` is initially empty, it is updated with the character at index 2 of `str` if `str` has at least 3 characters. If `hand` is not empty, and `str[i]` is equal to `hand[-1]` with the length of `hand` less than 5, a new element from `str` at index 2 is appended to `hand`. Otherwise, if this condition is not met, `count` is either 1 or 2, `i` remains 2, and `hand` is assigned the value of `str[2].`***
