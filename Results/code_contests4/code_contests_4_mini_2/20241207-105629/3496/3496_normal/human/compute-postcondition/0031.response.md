The function `func` accepts no parameters, but it processes a non-empty string consisting solely of the letters "C" and "P", with a maximum length of 100 characters. The function's output is determined by the contents of this string. However, since the string is not explicitly passed as a parameter to the function, it is implied that the function accesses this string internally. The functionality of the function is to analyze the string and produce a return value based on its composition of "C" and "P". 

Functionality: **The function processes a non-empty string consisting of letters "C" and "P" (length not exceeding 100 characters) and returns a value based on its analysis of the string's composition.**
