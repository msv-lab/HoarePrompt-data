`count` is incremented by 1. Since `count` can either be 0 or 1, after execution, `count` will be either 1 or 2. The values of `i` and `n` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is either 1 or 2; `i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute a second time.

Output State: **`count` is either 1 or 2; `i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute a second time**.
