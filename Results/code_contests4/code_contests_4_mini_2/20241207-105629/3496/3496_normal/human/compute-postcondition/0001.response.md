`n` is assigned the value `len(str)`, which calculates the length of the non-empty string `str` consisting of letters "C" and "P". The value of `n` will be greater than 0 since `str` is non-empty. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `str` is a non-empty string consisting of letters "C" and "P"; `n` is the length of that string (greater than 0).

Output State: **`str` is a non-empty string consisting of letters "C" and "P"; `n` is the length of that string (greater than 0)**
