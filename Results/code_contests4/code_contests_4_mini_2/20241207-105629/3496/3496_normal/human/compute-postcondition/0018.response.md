The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` can be either 0 or 1, so after execution, `count` will be either 1 or 2. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, but there is no indication of whether the loop continues. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is either 0 or 1; `count` is either 1 or 2; `i` is 1; `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`count` is either 0 or 1; `count` is either 1 or 2; `i` is 1; `n` remains unchanged.**
