`hand` is assigned an empty list. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed, and since `hand` is a new variable, it does not influence the existing state of `str`, `n`, or `count`. Therefore, the Output State is: `str` is a non-empty string consisting of letters "C" and "P"; `n` is the length of that string (greater than 0); `count` is 0; `hand` is an empty list.

Output State: **`str` is a non-empty string consisting of letters "C" and "P"; `n` is the length of that string (greater than 0); `count` is 0; `hand` is an empty list.**
