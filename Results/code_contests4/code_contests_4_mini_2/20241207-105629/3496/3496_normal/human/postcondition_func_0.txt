The function accepts a non-empty string consisting of characters "C" and "P" with a maximum length of 100 characters. It counts the number of times a new character is appended to a list called `hand`, which maintains a sequence of the same character (either "C" or "P") but is limited to a length of 5. Whenever the current character does not match the last character in `hand` or exceeds the limit, it increments the count. The function then prints the total count, adjusted by adding 1 if there are remaining characters in `hand`. The final output reflects the number of character sequences encountered in the string.
