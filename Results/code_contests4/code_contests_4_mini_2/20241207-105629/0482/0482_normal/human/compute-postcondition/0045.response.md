Postcondition: ***`debug` is either True or False, `n` is greater than `i + 2`, `count` is either 1 or 2. If `val` is in `d`, `d` contains the key `val` with updated value (either [0, i] or [i, i]), and if the length of `dval` is less than `k`, `dval` remains unchanged. If the length of `dval` is greater than or equal to `k`, and if `dval[-k]` is greater than `leftmost`, then `leftmost` is updated to the value of `dval[-k]`. Otherwise, if `val` is not in `d`, `d` has `val` with the value `[i]`, and `i` is the current index + 2.***
