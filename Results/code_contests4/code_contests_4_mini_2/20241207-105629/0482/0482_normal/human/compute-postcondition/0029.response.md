`dvalk` is assigned the value of `dval[-k]`. The value of `dval` can either be `d[0]` or `d[i]` depending on the value of `val`, which can be either `0` or `i`. The specific output state for `dvalk` depends on the current contents of the list `d` and the value of `k`. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `dval` is either `d[0]` or `d[i]`, and `dvalk` will be the element in `dval` indexed by `-k`. 

Output State: **`dval` is either `d[0]` or `d[i]`; `dvalk` is the element at index -k of `dval`.**
