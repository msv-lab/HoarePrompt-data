Postcondition: ***`debug` is either True or False, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `count` is either 0 or 1, `d` contains the key `val` with value `[0]` or `[i]`, `i` is the current index + 1, and `val` is the next value in the `vals` list. If `val` is in `d`, `dval` is either `d[0]` or `d[i]`. If the length of `dval` is less than `k`, `dval` remains unchanged; otherwise, if `dval[k]` is greater than `leftmost`, then `leftmost` is updated to the element at index -k of `dval`. If `val` is not in `d`, the value associated with the key `val` in dictionary `d` is updated to the list containing `i`.***
