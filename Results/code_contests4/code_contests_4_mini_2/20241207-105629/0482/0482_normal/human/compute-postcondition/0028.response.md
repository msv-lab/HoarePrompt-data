The `pass` statement does not affect any variables or state. It is a no-operation statement that is used as a placeholder. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The output state reflects that no changes have occurred.

Output State: **`dval` is either `d[0]` or `d[i]` depending on the value of `val`, where `val` can be either `0` or `i`**
