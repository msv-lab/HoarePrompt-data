The code `d[val] += [i]` appends the value of `i` to the list stored in the dictionary `d` under the key `val`. The previous state of the affected variables indicates that `d` contains the key `val` with the current value being `[0]`. Thus, after executing this line of code, the value associated with the key `val` will be updated to include `i`.

Given that `i` is the current index + 1, it is not specified what the exact value of `i` is, but it will be a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 (since `n` is greater than `i + 1`).

The output state reflects that the list under the key `val` in `d` has been modified. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` contains the key `val` with value either `[0, i]` (where `i` is the current index + 1) or a similar state depending on the previous value of `d[val]` before this operation.

Output State: **`d` contains the key `val` with value either `[0, i]` (where `i` is the current index + 1)**
