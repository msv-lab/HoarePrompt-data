Postcondition: ***`debug` is either True or False, `n` is greater than `i + 2`, `count` is either 1 or 2, and `d` contains the key `val` with updated value (either [0, i] or [i, i]). If the length of `dval` is less than `k`, then `dval` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if the length of `dval` is greater than or equal to `k`, and if `dval[-k]` is greater than `leftmost`, then `leftmost` is updated to the value of `dval[-k]`.**
