Postcondition: ***`debug` is either True or False, `n` is greater than 0, `count` is 0, `d` has `val` as a key with value `[0]`, `i` is 0, and `dval` is [0]. If the length of `dval` is less than `k`, no changes are made. If the length of `dval` is greater than or equal to `k`, `leftmost` is updated to 0 if `dvalk` is greater than `leftmost`, while `leftmost` remains 0 if this condition is not met.***
