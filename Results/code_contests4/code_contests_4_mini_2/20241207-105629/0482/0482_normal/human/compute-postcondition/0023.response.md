Postcondition: ***`debug` is either True or False, `n` is greater than 0, `count` is 0, `d` contains the key `val` with value `[0]`. If `val` was already a key in `d` with value `dval`, then `leftmost` is updated to 0 if `dval[k]` is greater than `leftmost`; otherwise, `leftmost` remains unchanged. If `val` was not a key in `d` before the operation, `leftmost` remains -1.***
