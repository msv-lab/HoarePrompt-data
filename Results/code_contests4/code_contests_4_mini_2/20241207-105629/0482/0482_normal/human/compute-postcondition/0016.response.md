The variable `dvalk` is assigned the value of `dval[-k]`, which means it takes the k-th element from the end of the list `dval`. Since `dval` has a length greater than or equal to `k`, the assignment is valid. The previous values of the affected variables are `dval`, which has `dval` as `[0]`, and since it is mentioned that the length of `dval` is greater than or equal to `k`, we can infer that `k` is less than or equal to the length of `dval`. 

Given that `dval` contains only one element, which is `0`, the value assigned to `dvalk` will be `0`. Other variables are not affected by this assignment.

Therefore, the Output State is: `debug` is either True or False, `n` is greater than 0, `count` is 0, `d` has `val` as a key with value `[0]`, `leftmost` is -1, `i` is 0, `dval` is [0], `length of dval` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dvalk` is 0.

Output State: **`debug` is either True or False, `n` is greater than 0, `count` is 0, `d` has `val` as a key with value `[0]`, `leftmost` is -1, `i` is 0, `dval` is [0], length of `dval` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dvalk` is 0.**
