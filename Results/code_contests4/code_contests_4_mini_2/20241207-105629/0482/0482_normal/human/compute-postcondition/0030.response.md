`leftmost` is assigned the value of `dvalk`, where `dval` can be either `d[0]` or `d[i]`. The value of `dvalk` depends on the specific value of `k`, which affects the index from which the element is taken in `dval`. Therefore, the output state reflects the potential values of `dval` and `leftmost`.

Output State: **`dval` is either `d[0]` or `d[i]`; `leftmost` is the element at index -k of `dval`**
