Postcondition: ***`debug` is either True or False, `n` is greater than `i + 2`, `count` is either 1 or 2, `d` contains the key `val` with updated value (either [0, i] or [i, i]), `i` is the current index + 2, `val` is the next value in the `vals` list, and if `dvalk`, which is the last element of `dval` based on index `-k`, is greater than `leftmost`, then `leftmost` is assigned the value of `dvalk`. There is no else part in the code.***
