The variable `leftmost` is assigned the value `-1`. This assignment does not affect any of the other variables, as their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `debug` is either True or False; `n` is an input integer; `vals` is an iterator of integers from standard input, limited to `n` values; `k` is not equal to 1; `count` is 0; `d` is an empty dictionary; `leftmost` is -1.
