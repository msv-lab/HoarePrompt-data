Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`, and an array of `n` positive integers. It calculates the total count based on the occurrences of values in the array. If `k` equals 1, it computes the count as the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. If `k` is greater than 1, it counts the total number of valid indices based on the `k`-th most recent occurrences of each value in the array, returning the accumulated count. The computed count is printed as the output. Note that if there are fewer than `k` occurrences of a value, it will not contribute to the count, and if `k` is greater than `n`, the function will not process that value correctly.**
