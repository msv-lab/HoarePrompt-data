Postcondition: ***`dval` is either `d[0]` or `d[i]` depending on the value of `val`. If the length of `dval` is less than `k`, then the function does not alter `dval`. Otherwise, if `dval` is either `d[0]` or `d[i]` and `dval[k]` is greater than `leftmost`, then `leftmost` becomes the element at index -k of `dval.***
