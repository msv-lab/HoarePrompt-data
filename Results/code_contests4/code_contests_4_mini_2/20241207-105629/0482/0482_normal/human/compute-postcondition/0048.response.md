Postcondition: ***`debug` is either True or False; `n` is an input integer. If `k` is equal to 1, then `count` is calculated as `n * (n + 1) / 2`. Otherwise, `n` is a positive integer, `count` is the accumulated total based on leftmost occurrences, `d` is a dictionary containing indices of each value in `vals`, and `leftmost` is the index of the leftmost occurrence of the `k`-th most recent value or -1 if no such occurrence exists.***
