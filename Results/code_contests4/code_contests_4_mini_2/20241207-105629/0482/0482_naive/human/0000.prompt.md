You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Berland starts to seize the initiative on the war with Flatland. To drive the enemy from their native land, the berlanders need to know exactly how many more flatland soldiers are left in the enemy's reserve. Fortunately, the scouts captured an enemy in the morning, who had a secret encrypted message with the information the berlanders needed so much.

The captured enemy had an array of positive integers. Berland intelligence have long been aware of the flatland code: to convey the message, which contained a number m, the enemies use an array of integers a. The number of its subarrays, in which there are at least k equal numbers, equals m. The number k has long been known in the Berland army so General Touristov has once again asked Corporal Vasya to perform a simple task: to decipher the flatlanders' message.

Help Vasya, given an array of integers a and number k, find the number of subarrays of the array of numbers a, which has at least k equal numbers.

Subarray a[i... j] (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n) of array a = (a1, a2, ..., an) is an array, made from its consecutive elements, starting from the i-th one and ending with the j-th one: a[i... j] = (ai, ai + 1, ..., aj).

Input

The first line contains two space-separated integers n, k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 4·105), showing how many numbers an array has and how many equal numbers the subarrays are required to have, correspondingly. 

The second line contains n space-separated integers ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109) — elements of the array.

Output

Print the single number — the number of such subarrays of array a, that they have at least k equal integers.

Please do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. In is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.

Examples

Input

4 2
1 2 1 2

Input

5 3
1 2 1 1 3


Output

Input

3 1
1 1 1


Output

6

Note

In the first sample are three subarrays, containing at least two equal numbers: (1,2,1), (2,1,2) and (1,2,1,2).

In the second sample are two subarrays, containing three equal numbers: (1,2,1,1,3) and (1,2,1,1).

In the third sample any subarray contains at least one 1 number. Overall they are 6: (1), (1), (1), (1,1), (1,1) and (1,1,1).
Program:
```
debug = 'DEBUG' in os.environ
(n, k) = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()[:2])
vals = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip('\n\r ').split()[:n])
if k == 1:
    count = n * (n + 1) / 2
else:
    count = 0
    d = {}
    leftmost = -1
    for (i, val) in enumerate(vals):
        if val in d:
            d[val] += [i]
            dval = d[val]
            if len(dval) < k:
                pass
            else:
                dvalk = dval[-k]
                if dvalk > leftmost:
                    leftmost = dvalk
        else:
            d[val] = [i]
        count += leftmost + 1
print(count)
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
