To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we will analyze its logic and identify any potential issues or edge cases.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to find the number of subarrays that contain at least `k` equal numbers. The program should handle all possible cases, including edge cases where:
1. The array has the minimum size (1).
2. All elements in the array are the same.
3. The value of `k` is equal to `n` (the number of elements in the array).
4. The array contains all unique values.

### Code Analysis
1. **Input Handling**: The first line reads `n` (size of the array) and `k` (minimum occurrences of any number in the subarrays). The second line reads the array elements.
2. **Handling the Case When k == 1**: The program correctly calculates the number of subarrays for the case where `k` is 1 using the formula `n * (n + 1) / 2`, which is correct since every single element and every combination of elements will include at least one occurrence of itself.
3. **Main Logic for k > 1**:
   - It initializes a dictionary `d` to track indices of occurrences for each number.
   - It uses a variable `leftmost` to keep track of the leftmost index where a valid subarray can start.
   - The program iterates over the elements of the array and updates the dictionary and `leftmost` index accordingly.
   - For each element, it adds `leftmost + 1` to the count, which is intended to count how many valid subarrays can be formed ending at the current index.

### Potential Issues
1. **Incorrect Counting Logic**: The logic used to update `count` with `leftmost + 1` may not accurately reflect the number of valid subarrays. Specifically, if `k` is greater than 1 and there are not enough occurrences of the current number, `leftmost` might not be updated correctly, leading to incorrect counting.
2. **Edge Cases**: The program may fail in certain edge cases, such as:
   - An array full of unique elements with `k` greater than 1, where it should return 0 but might not due to improper handling of the `leftmost` index.
   - Cases where the last few elements of the array do not form valid subarrays but are incorrectly counted due to the logic used.

### Example of Failure
Consider the input:
```
5 2
1 2 3 4 5
```
With this input, there are no subarrays that can have at least 2 equal numbers, so the expected output should be `0`. However, the program may miscalculate this since `leftmost` might remain at `-1`, leading to an incorrect addition to the count.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly account for all potential cases, particularly when `k > 1` and the elements in the array do not meet the requirement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
