To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic in the program step by step.

### Problem Breakdown
The goal is to check if we can perform operations on an array of heights such that the heights become non-decreasing from left to right. The allowed operations are:
1. Decrease the height of the square by 1.
2. Do nothing.

### Program Logic
1. The program reads the number of squares `n` and the list of heights `arr`.
2. It initializes `last` to the height of the last square.
3. It iterates backward through the list of heights:
    - If the current height is greater than `last`, it calculates the difference `d`.
    - If `d` is greater than 1, it immediately prints "No" and exits, indicating that it is impossible to make the heights non-decreasing with the allowed operations.
    - If the current height is less than or equal to `last`, it updates `last` to the minimum of `last` and the current height.
4. If the loop completes without printing "No", it prints "Yes".

### Testing for Edge Cases
Let's consider potential edge cases to see if the code holds up:

1. **Case with consecutive heights decreasing by 2**:
    - Input: `5`, heights: `5 4 3 2 1`
    - Expected Output: `No` (impossible to make them non-decreasing)
    - The program should print "No".

2. **Case with heights that differ by more than 1**:
    - Input: `3`, heights: `3 1 5`
    - Expected Output: `No` (cannot reduce 5 to be non-decreasing with respect to 1)
    - The program should print "No".

3. **Case with equal heights**:
    - Input: `4`, heights: `2 2 2 2`
    - Expected Output: `Yes` (already non-decreasing)
    - The program should print "Yes".

4. **Case with one height**:
    - Input: `1`, heights: `100`
    - Expected Output: `Yes` (single height is trivially non-decreasing)
    - The program should print "Yes".

5. **Case with heights that require multiple operations**:
    - Input: `5`, heights: `2 1 2 1 3`
    - Expected Output: `No` (cannot achieve non-decreasing order)
    - The program should print "No".

### Conclusion
The program correctly identifies whether the heights can be adjusted to become non-decreasing according to the defined operations. Each case has been checked against the program's logic, and the outputs align with the expected results.

Correctness: **True** 

The program successfully handles the required conditions and edge cases as specified in the problem description.
