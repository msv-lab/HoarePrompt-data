The `exit(0)` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change, and the execution of any subsequent code is halted. Therefore, the output state is: `d` is arr[i] - last; output is 'No' and the program has exited.

Output State: **`d` is arr[i] - last; output is 'No' and the program has exited.**
