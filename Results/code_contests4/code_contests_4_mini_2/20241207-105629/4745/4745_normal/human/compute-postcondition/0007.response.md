The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'No'. The values of the existing variables `N`, `H`, `n`, `i`, `last`, and `d` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that the program outputs 'No'.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 10^5, `H` is a list of `N` integers, `n` is at least 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `H[i]` is greater than `last`, `d` is a positive integer calculated as `H[i] - last`, and `d` is greater than 1; output is 'No'**.
