After analyzing the loop and its conditions, we can infer the following about the output state after all iterations have completed.

The loop iterates from `n-1` down to `0`, checking each element of `arr` against the `last` variable. If any element is greater than `last` by more than `1`, it prints 'No' and exits. If not, `last` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the current element of `arr`.

If the loop executes completely without hitting the exit condition, `last` will contain the minimum value from the entire `arr` list.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 10^5, `H` is a list of `N` integers, `n` is at least 1, `last` is the minimum value in `arr`, and `arr` remains unchanged.**
