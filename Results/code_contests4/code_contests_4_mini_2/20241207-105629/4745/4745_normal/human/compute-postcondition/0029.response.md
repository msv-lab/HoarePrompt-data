Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `N` and a list of `N` integers. It checks if the integers can be arranged in a non-increasing order such that no two consecutive elements differ by more than 1. If any element is greater than the previous one by more than 1, it outputs 'No' and exits; otherwise, it outputs 'Yes' after checking all elements. **
