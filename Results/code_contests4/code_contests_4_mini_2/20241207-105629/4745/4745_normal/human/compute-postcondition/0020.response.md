The variable `d` is assigned the value of `arr[i] - last`. The initial values of `last` and `arr[i]` are not explicitly provided, but `last` is updated to the minimum between its current value and `arr[i]`. Therefore, `d` represents the difference between `arr[i]` and the minimum value of `last`. The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation, so we cannot determine specific values for `d` without knowing `arr[i]` or `last`. 

Output State: **`d` is arr[i] - last**
