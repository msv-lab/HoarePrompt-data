Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 10^5, `H` is a list of `N` integers, `n` is at least 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `last` remains the minimum between its current value and `H[i]`, and `d` is calculated as `H[i] - last`. If `d` > 1, 'No' has been printed and the program exits with status 0.***
