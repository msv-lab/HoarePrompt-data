The `exit(0)` statement causes the program to terminate immediately without any further execution. Since this does not alter the values of any variables and instead simply ends the program, the output state reflects that the program has exited.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 10^5, `H` is a list of `N` integers, `n` is at least 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `H[i]` is greater than `last`, `d` is a positive integer calculated as `H[i] - last`, and `d` is greater than 1; output is 'No' and the program has exited.**
