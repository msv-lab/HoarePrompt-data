According to the code, the loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0`, meaning it will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1`, and since `i` decreases by 1 with each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `n - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be at least `0`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` should be `n - 2`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 10^5, `H` is a list of `N` integers, `n` is at least 1, `i` is `n - 2`, and `last` remains the minimum between its current value and `H[i]` for the loop to execute a second time.**
