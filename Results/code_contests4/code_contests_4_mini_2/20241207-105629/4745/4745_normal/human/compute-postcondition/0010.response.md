Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 10^5, `H` is a list of `N` integers, `n` is at least 1, and `i` is `n - 1`. If `H[i]` is greater than `last`, then `d` is calculated as `H[i] - last`. If `d` is greater than 1, the output is 'No' and the program exits; otherwise, the program continues executing without any specified output.***
