According to the code, the loop iterates backward through the range from `n - 1` down to `0`. The variable `i` is initialized to `n - 1` in the first iteration and decremented by 1 in each subsequent iteration until it reaches `0`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `last` has been updated to the minimum between its current value and `arr[i]`, and `i` is at a value that is still within the range for the loop to execute again. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented to the next lower index.

If `i` is currently `0`, it cannot execute again since the loop will terminate. However, if `i` is greater than `0`, then `i` will be decreased by 1 for the next iteration.

Thus, for the loop to execute again:

- If `i` is still greater than `0`, `i` will become `i - 1`.
- The state of `last` doesn't change in this iteration.

State: **`last` is updated to the minimum between its current value and `arr[i]`, `i` is now `i - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than `0`.**
