Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 10^5, `H` is a list of `N` integers, `n` is at least 1, `i` is `n - 2`, and `last` remains the minimum between its current value and `H[i]`. If `arr[i]` is greater than `last`, then `d` is calculated as `H[i] - last`, and if `d` > 1, 'No' is printed and the program exits with status 0. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next steps.***
