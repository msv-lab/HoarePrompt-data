The variable `d` is assigned the value of `arr[i] - last`. Given that `i` is `n - 1`, it means we are accessing the last element of the list `H` (assuming `arr` refers to `H`). The specific values of `arr[i]` and `last` are not given explicitly, but we know `arr[i]` is greater than `last` based on the conditions provided. 

Therefore, `d` will be a positive integer since it's the result of subtracting a smaller value (`last`) from a larger value (`arr[i]`). 

The output state will reflect this relationship and the assignment of `d`. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 10^5, `H` is a list of `N` integers, `n` is at least 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `H[i]` is greater than `last`, and `d` is a positive integer calculated as `H[i] - last`.**
