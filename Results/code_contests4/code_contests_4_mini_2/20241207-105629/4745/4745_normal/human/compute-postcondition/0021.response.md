The `print('No')` statement outputs the string 'No' to the console. The variable `d` retains its value, which is the result of the expression `arr[i] - last`. Since no changes are made to `d` or any other variables in this statement, the output state reflects the existing values. 

Output State: **`d` is arr[i] - last; output is 'No'**
