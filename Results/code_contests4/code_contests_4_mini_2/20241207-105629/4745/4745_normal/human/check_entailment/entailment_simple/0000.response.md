To determine if the annotated program correctly fulfills the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the `func()` function against the requirements set forth in the problem.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. We are given N squares with heights \( H_i \).
2. We can either decrease the height of each square by 1 or leave it as is.
3. The goal is to determine if we can make the heights non-decreasing from left to right.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of squares \( N \) and their respective heights into a list `arr`.
  
2. **Logic**:
   - The program starts checking from the last square moving towards the first.
   - It maintains a variable `last` which starts as the height of the last square.
   - For each square (from last to first), it checks the following:
     - If the current square's height \( arr[i] \) is greater than `last`, it calculates the difference \( d \).
     - If \( d \) is greater than 1, it prints "No" and exits. This is because if the height difference is greater than 1, we cannot make the heights non-decreasing since we can only reduce the height by at most 1.
   - If \( arr[i] \) is less than or equal to `last`, it updates `last` to be the minimum of `last` and \( arr[i] \).

3. **Final Output**: If all checks pass without printing "No", the function prints "Yes".

### Correctness Check:
- The program correctly implements the logic needed to determine if heights can be made non-decreasing:
  - If at any point a height is more than the `last` height (the height to the right), and it cannot be reduced to be less than or equal to `last` (i.e., the difference is more than 1), it correctly determines that it's impossible and outputs "No".
  - Otherwise, it updates `last` to ensure that subsequent heights do not exceed the adjusted heights.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly adheres to the problem description because it successfully checks each height and determines whether it is possible to make the heights non-decreasing based on the allowed operations.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is as follows:

Correctness: **True**
