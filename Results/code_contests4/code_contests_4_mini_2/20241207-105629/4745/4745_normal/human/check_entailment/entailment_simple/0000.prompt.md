You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: There are N squares arranged in a row from left to right. The height of the i-th square from the left is H_i.

For each square, you will perform either of the following operations once:

* Decrease the height of the square by 1.
* Do nothing.



Determine if it is possible to perform the operations so that the heights of the squares are non-decreasing from left to right.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 1 \leq N \leq 10^5
* 1 \leq H_i \leq 10^9

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
H_1 H_2 ... H_N


Output

If it is possible to perform the operations so that the heights of the squares are non-decreasing from left to right, print `Yes`; otherwise, print `No`.

Examples

5
1 2 1 1 3


Output

Yes


Input

4
1 3 2 1


Output

No


Input

1 2 3 4 5


Output

Yes


Input

1
1000000000


Output

Yes
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^5, and H is a list of N integers where each integer H_i satisfies 1 <= H_i <= 10^9.
def func():
    n = int(stdin.readline())
    arr = list(map(int, stdin.readline().split()))
    last = arr[n - 1]
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if arr[i] > last:
            d = arr[i] - last
            if d > 1:
                print('No')
                exit(0)
        
        last = min(last, arr[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 10^5, `H` is a list of `N` integers, `n` is at least 1, `last` is the minimum value in `arr`, and `arr` remains unchanged.
    print('Yes')

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
