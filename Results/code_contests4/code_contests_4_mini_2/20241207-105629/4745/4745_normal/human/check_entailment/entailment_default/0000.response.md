To assess the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description and output hints, let's analyze both the program and the provided hints step-by-step.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to determine if it is possible to perform certain operations on the heights of squares so that the heights are non-decreasing from left to right. We can either decrease the height of a square by 1 or do nothing.

### Program Analysis:
```python
from sys import *

n = int(stdin.readline())
arr = list(map(int, stdin.readline().split()))
last = arr[n - 1]
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    if arr[i] > last:
        d = arr[i] - last
        if d > 1:
            print('No')
            exit(0)
    last = min(last, arr[i])
print('Yes')
```

1. The program reads `N` and then a list of heights `arr`.
2. It initializes `last` to the height of the last square.
3. It iterates through the heights from the last to the first:
   - If the current height `arr[i]` is greater than `last`, it checks the difference `d`.
   - If `d` is greater than 1, it outputs 'No', which means we cannot make the heights non-decreasing.
   - If `d` is not greater than 1, it updates `last` to the minimum of `last` and `arr[i]`.
4. If no issues are found, it prints 'Yes'.

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints state that the function checks if the integers can be arranged in a non-increasing order such that no two consecutive elements differ by more than 1. This suggests that if any height exceeds the previous one by more than 1, it outputs 'No'.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Case where two heights differ by exactly 1**:
   - For example, heights like `[2, 3]` should yield 'No' because we can't decrease the first to make it non-decreasing.

2. **Case with identical heights**:
   - For example, heights like `[1, 1, 1]` should yield 'Yes'.

3. **Single height**:
   - For example, heights like `[1000000000]` should yield 'Yes' since there's nothing to compare against.

### Checking Agreement with Output Hints:
Upon reviewing both the code and the output hints:
- The hints indicate that the program checks for differences of more than 1. This aligns with the logic in the program.
- However, the output hints incorrectly describe the operation as non-increasing instead of non-decreasing. The goal is to check if we can make the heights non-decreasing.

### Conclusion:
Given that the code checks if any height exceeds the next height by more than 1 (which it should not if we want a non-decreasing order), the logic fails for cases where two consecutive heights differ by exactly 1, as it allows for a decrease operation, but it does not handle the non-decreasing requirement correctly.

Thus, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program would fail on cases where a height is exactly one greater than the following height, as it will output 'No' inappropriately.
