Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. The task is to determine if it is possible to perform operations on the heights of the squares such that they can be made non-decreasing from left to right. The operations allowed are either to decrease the height of a square by 1 or to do nothing.

### Explanation of the Issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic**: The current implementation checks if the heights can be arranged in a non-increasing order with a restriction that no two consecutive elements can differ by more than 1. This is not the same as checking whether the heights can be made non-decreasing after performing the allowed operations.

2. **Example Case**: Consider the input:
   ```
   5
   1 2 3 2 1
   ```
   The expected output is "Yes" because we can decrease heights as follows:
   - Decrease the last square (1) to 0 (do nothing for 1, 2, and 3)
   - The resulting heights will be 1, 2, 3, 2, 0, which can be made non-decreasing by lowering the 2 to 1, and keeping the lowest as is.
   However, the program would output "No" because it incorrectly checks for non-increasing conditions instead of non-decreasing.

3. **Output Logic**: The program prints "No" if any height is greater than the last observed height by more than 1, which does not account for the possibility of decreasing heights to achieve a non-decreasing order.

Thus, the program fails to fulfill the requirements specified in the problem description for all potential cases, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
