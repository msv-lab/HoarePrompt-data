To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

### Problem Breakdown:
- We need to check if we can make the heights of the squares non-decreasing from left to right by either reducing the height by 1 or doing nothing.
- If at any point a square's height is more than the next square's height by more than 1, then it cannot be made non-decreasing with the allowed operations.

### Given Program:
```python
n = int(stdin.readline())
arr = list(map(int, stdin.readline().split()))
last = arr[n - 1]
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    if arr[i] > last:
        d = arr[i] - last
        if d > 1:
            print('No')
            exit(0)
    last = min(last, arr[i])
print('Yes')
```

### Code Analysis:
1. The program reads an integer `n` and a list `arr` of heights.
2. It initializes `last` to the last element of `arr`.
3. It iterates backwards through `arr`:
   - If the current height `arr[i]` is greater than `last`, it checks the difference `d`.
   - If `d` is greater than 1, it prints 'No' and exits, indicating that it cannot be adjusted to be non-decreasing.
   - It updates `last` to be the minimum of `last` and `arr[i]`.

### Testing Edge Cases:
- **Case 1:** With heights `1, 2, 1, 1, 3`, the program should return 'Yes'.
- **Case 2:** With heights `1, 3, 2, 1`, the program should return 'No'.
- **Case 3:** With heights `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`, it should return 'Yes'.
- **Case 4:** With a single height `1000000000`, it should return 'Yes'.

### Potential Issue:
Let's consider a case that is not explicitly covered by the existing examples:
- **Example:** `1, 2, 3, 2, 1`
  - The heights are non-decreasing from left to right as `1` to `2` to `3`, but then from `3` to `2`, we need to reduce the height of `3`. The next height is `1`, which means `3` can only be reduced by 1. This should return 'No', as we cannot make `3` become `2` in a single operation.

However, let's analyze the code's flow:
- It will check `arr[3]` (which is `2`) against `last` (which is `1` after processing `arr[4]`).
- The logic would fail to capture the need for `3` to match `2` as the code checks from the end towards the start, potentially allowing a valid height to be ignored.

### Conclusion:
Given the identified potential case where the program fails to return the expected output, the program does not correctly implement the logic to handle all scenarios as described in the problem.

Thus, the final conclusion is:
Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not correctly handle the case where a height must be reduced more than once to maintain the non-decreasing order.
