To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the function `func_1` and see if it accurately decides whether the child "it" can catch the other child within the given time `T`.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Inputs**:
   - `A`: Initial position of the child "it".
   - `B`: Initial position of the other child.
   - `V`: Speed of the child "it".
   - `W`: Speed of the other child.
   - `T`: Time within which "it" can try to catch the other child.

2. **Logic**:
   - The program calculates the final positions of both children after `T` seconds:
     - `la = A + V * T`: Final position of child "it".
     - `lb = B + W * T`: Final position of the other child.
   - The program then checks if the child "it" can catch the other child by comparing their final positions depending on the initial positions.

3. **Conditions**:
   - If `A < B`, it checks if `la >= lb` (i.e., whether the final position of "it" is greater than or equal to the final position of the other child).
   - If `A > B`, it checks if `lb >= la` (i.e., whether the final position of the other child is greater than or equal to the final position of "it").

### Potential Issue:
The program makes the following assumptions:
- It considers only the final positions of both children without accounting for the distance between them or their relative speeds. This could lead to incorrect conclusions.
- Specifically, it does not handle cases where the speeds relative to each other might affect their ability to meet.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following case:
- Input:
  ```
  0 1
  10 2
  5
  ```
- Here, `A = 0`, `V = 1`, `B = 10`, `W = 2`, and `T = 5`.
- After 5 seconds:
  - `la = 0 + 1 * 5 = 5`
  - `lb = 10 + 2 * 5 = 20`
- The program checks:
  - Since `A < B` (`0 < 10`), it evaluates `5 >= 20`, which is `False`. Thus, it will print `NO`.
- However, if we analyze the speeds, child "it" moves at 1 unit per second, while the other child moves at 2 units per second. In this scenario, "it" is not catching up to the other child, and indeed, cannot catch the other child within the specified time. The program would give `NO` correctly in this case, but it doesn't capture the essence of the rules of the game because it uses an incorrect condition.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly determine if "it" can catch the other child because it fails to account for relative speeds properly. Therefore, there are cases when it will return incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**.
