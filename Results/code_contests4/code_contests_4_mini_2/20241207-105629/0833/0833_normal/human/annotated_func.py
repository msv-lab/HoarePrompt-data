#State of the program right berfore the function call: A and B are integers representing coordinates on a number line, V and W are positive integers representing the speeds of the children, and T is a positive integer representing the time in seconds. It is guaranteed that A is not equal to B.
def func_1(A, B, V, W, T):
    la = A + V * T
    lb = B + W * T
    if (A < B) :
        return la >= lb
        #The program returns a boolean indicating whether A + V * T is greater than or equal to B + W * T, where A is less than B.
    else :
        return lb >= la
        #The program returns a boolean indicating whether lb is greater than or equal to la, where lb is calculated as B + W * T and la is calculated as A + V * T, with the condition that A is greater than or equal to B.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer coordinates A and B, two positive integers V and W representing speeds, and a positive integer T representing time. It returns a boolean indicating whether the position of A after T seconds (A + V * T) is greater than or equal to the position of B after T seconds (B + W * T), regardless of whether A is initially less than or greater than B.
