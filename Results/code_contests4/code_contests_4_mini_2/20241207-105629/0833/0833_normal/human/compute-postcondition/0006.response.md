The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `A`, `B`, `V`, `W`, and `T`. Here, `A` and `B` are integers representing coordinates on a number line, and it is guaranteed that `A` is not equal to `B`. The parameters `V` and `W` are positive integers representing the speeds of the children, and `T` is a positive integer representing the time in seconds.

After executing the function body:

- In Case 1, if `A` is less than `B`, the function returns a boolean indicating whether `A + V * T` is greater than or equal to `B + W * T`.
- In Case 2, if `A` is greater than or equal to `B`, the function returns a boolean indicating whether `B + W * T` is greater than or equal to `A + V * T`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to compare the positions of two children after a specified time based on their speeds, returning a boolean result depending on their initial positions and speeds.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters A and B (integers), V and W (positive integers), and T (positive integer) and returns a boolean based on the comparison of their positions after time T, depending on whether A is less than or greater than B.**
