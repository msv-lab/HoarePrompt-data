`lb` is assigned the value of `B + W * T`. The previous values of `B`, `W`, and `T` are known as integers and positive integers respectively. Therefore, `lb` is calculated based on these values, while the values of `A` and `la` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`A` is an integer, `B` is an integer, `V` is a positive integer, `W` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive integer; `la` is calculated as `A + V * T`, and `lb` is calculated as `B + W * T`.**
