In this case, `la` is assigned the value of `A + V * T`. The variables `A`, `V`, and `T` are integers and positive integers, respectively, affecting the calculation of `la`. The values of `B` and the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, we can state the output based on the updated value of `la`.

Output State: **`A` is an integer, `B` is an integer, `V` is a positive integer, `W` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive integer; `la` is calculated as `A + V * T`.**
