The function accepts two integer coordinates A and B, two positive integers V and W representing speeds, and a positive integer T representing time. It returns a boolean indicating whether the position of A after T seconds (A + V * T) is greater than or equal to the position of B after T seconds (B + W * T), regardless of whether A is initially less than or greater than B.
