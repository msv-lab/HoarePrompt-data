Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 4, `x` is the third smallest number in the list `a`, if the value of the element at index `i` in the list `a` is equal to `x`, then `ans` is set to 2. Otherwise, if the value at index `i` of the list `a` is not equal to `x`, `ans` remains 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
