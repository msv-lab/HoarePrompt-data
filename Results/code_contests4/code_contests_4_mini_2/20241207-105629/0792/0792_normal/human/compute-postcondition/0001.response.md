The code `a = map(int, raw_input().split())` takes user input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and then maps those integers to the variable `a`. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer satisfying `3 ≤ n ≤ 105`, and `a` is a list of `n` positive integers.

Since `n` is updated by user input, the variable `a` will now contain the integers input by the user, which must match the new value of `n`.

The output state will reflect that `a` contains a new list of integers based on user input, but does not change the value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 105; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers based on user input.**
