The value of `ans` is incremented by 1, and its previous value is 1. After the execution, `ans` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 4, `x` is the third smallest number in the list `a`, `ans` is 2, `i` is 3, and the value of the element at index `i` in the list `a` is equal to `x`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `x` is the third smallest number in the list `a`, `ans` is 2, `i` is 3, and the value of the element at index `i` in the list `a` is equal to `x`.**
