`x` is assigned the value of the element at index 2 of the list `a`. Since `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers where `n` is a positive integer between 3 and 105, `a[2]` corresponds to the third smallest number in the list. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 105; `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers; `x` is the third smallest number in the list `a`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 105; `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers; `x` is the third smallest number in the list `a`.**
