`ans` is assigned the value `1`. The values of the other variables `n`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 105; `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers; `x` is the third smallest number in the list `a`; `ans` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 105; `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers; `x` is the third smallest number in the list `a`; `ans` is 1.**
