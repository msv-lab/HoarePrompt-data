The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 4, `x` is the third smallest number in the list `a`, `ans` is 1, `i` is 3, and the value at index `i` of the list `a` is not equal to `x`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
