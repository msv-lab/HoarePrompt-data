The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. The value of `n` is a positive integer within the range of 3 to 105, and `a` contains `n` positive integers based on user input. The sorting operation does not change the value of `n`. Therefore, the Output State reflects that `a` is now a sorted list of positive integers.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 105; `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers based on user input.**
