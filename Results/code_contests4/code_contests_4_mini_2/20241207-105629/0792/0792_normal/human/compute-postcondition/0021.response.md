The function `func` does not take any parameters directly as per the provided definition. However, it operates on the constraints that `n` is a positive integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\), and `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\). Based on the output specification, the function will likely perform operations using these inputs and return a result based on those operations. 

Since the function definition does not include parameters explicitly, it suggests that the values of `n` and `a` might be defined or provided elsewhere in the program context.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 105) and a list a of n positive integers (where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9) and performs operations based on these inputs.**
