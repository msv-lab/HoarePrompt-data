The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` positive integers. It sorts the list and identifies the third smallest number, `x`. It then counts how many times `x` appears in the list starting from the fourth position (index 3), returning this count. If `x` does not appear in the list after the third position, it returns 1. However, the function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 3 or if the input is invalid. Additionally, the function does not return any value but instead prints the count.
