To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let's analyze the provided code and its functionality:

### Problem Description Summary:
The task is to find the number of distinct triples of indices (i, j, k) such that the product of the corresponding elements in the array is minimized. The indices must satisfy i < j < k.

### Provided Program Analysis:
```python
n = int(raw_input())
a = map(int, raw_input().split())
a = sorted(a)
x = a[2]
ans = 1
for i in xrange(3, len(a)):
    if a[i] == x:
        ans += 1
    else:
        break
print(ans)
```

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Finding Minimum Product Triples**: The logic in the program only counts occurrences of the third smallest element in the sorted array starting from index 2, which is incorrect. The program does not consider the scenario where the minimum product could involve other combinations or the first two smallest elements.
   
2. **Counting Combinations**: The program does not calculate distinct combinations of indices (i, j, k) for the identified minimum product. It only counts how many times the third smallest number occurs, which is insufficient.

### Test Case to Demonstrate Incorrectness:
Consider the following input:
```
n = 5
a = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3]
```
- The minimum product occurs with the combination (1, 2, 2) with indices (0, 1, 2) or (0, 1, 3) or (0, 2, 3). 
- However, the given program does not account for these combinations and would return `1` for `ans`, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program does not follow the problem description correctly for every potential case, and thus it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
