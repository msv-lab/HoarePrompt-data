Output State: **`count` is either 0 or 1; if `a` is '/', then `flag` is set to 1 if it was 0, otherwise it remains the same. If `a` is a newline character, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a` is not a newline, then `count` is either 1 or 2, `flag` is 0, and the value of `a` written to stdout remains unchanged. `a` is assigned the value read from standard input.**
