Output State: **`count` is either 0 or 1; `flag` may remain the same if it was 0 or remains 1 if it was already set; if `a` is a newline character, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; if `a` is not a newline, then `count` is either 1 or 2, `flag` is 0, and the value of `a` written to stdout remains unchanged.**
