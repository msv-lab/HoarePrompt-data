The value of `count` is incremented by 1. Since `count` can either be 0 or 1, after this operation, `count` can be either 1 or 2. The variable `flag` remains unchanged, so the output state is: `count` is either 1 or 2; `flag` is 1 if `a` is '/' and 0 if `a` is not '/'.

Output State: **`count` is either 1 or 2; `flag` is 1 if `a` is '/' and 0 if `a` is not '/'**
