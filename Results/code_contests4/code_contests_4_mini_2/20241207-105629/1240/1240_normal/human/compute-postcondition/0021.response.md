Postcondition: ***`count` is either 0 or 1, and `flag` is either 1 (if `a` is '/') or 0 (if `a` is not '/'). If `a` is '/', then `flag` is set to 1, otherwise, if `a` is not equal to '/' or '\n', it is written to standard output. If `a` is '\n', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
