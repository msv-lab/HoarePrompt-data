The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 0, `flag` is 0; `a` is a single character input from standard input that is not equal to '/'; `a` is equal to '\n' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
