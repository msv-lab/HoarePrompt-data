The value of `flag` is assigned the value `1`. Since previously `flag` could have been either `1` (if `a` is '/') or `0` (if `a` is not '/'), now it is explicitly set to `1`. The other variable `count` remains unaffected and retains its previous state of either `0` or `1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is either 0 or 1; `flag` is 1.

Output State: **`count` is either 0 or 1; `flag` is 1**
