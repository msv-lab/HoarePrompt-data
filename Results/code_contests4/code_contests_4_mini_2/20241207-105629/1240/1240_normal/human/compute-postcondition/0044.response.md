The code `sys.stdout.write(a)` writes the value of `a` to standard output. However, since `a` is not defined in the initial state and there is no mention of its value, we cannot determine the impact on the variables. The values of `flag` and `count` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `flag` is 1, `count` is either 1 or 2, and `a` is undefined.

Output State: **`flag` is 1, `count` is either 1 or 2, and `a` is undefined**.
