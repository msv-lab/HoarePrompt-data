Postcondition: ***`count` is either 0 or 1; `flag` is either 1 (if `a` is '/') or 0 (if `a` is not '/'). If `a` is a newline character, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a` is not a newline, then `count` is either 1 or 2; `flag` is 0, and the value of `a` written to stdout remains unchanged.***
