Postcondition: ***`count` is either 0 or 1; if `flag` is 0, then `count` remains unchanged and `flag` is set to 1, while `a` is unchanged. If `flag` is not 0, it may remain the same or stay 1 if it was already set; if `a` is a newline character, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, `count` is either 1 or 2, `flag` is set to 0, and the value of `a` written to stdout remains unchanged.***
