The value of `flag` is assigned 0, changing its previous value from 1 to 0. The variables `count` and `a` remain unaffected, with `count` either being 1 or 2, and `a` still undefined. Therefore, the Output State is: `flag` is 0, `count` is either 1 or 2, and `a` is undefined.

Output State: **`flag` is 0, `count` is either 1 or 2, and `a` is undefined**
