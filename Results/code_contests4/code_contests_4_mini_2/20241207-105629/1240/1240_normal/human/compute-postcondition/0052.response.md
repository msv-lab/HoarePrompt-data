The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `path`. `path` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the character '/', with at least one leading '/' and a maximum length of 100 characters. The function processes this `path` and returns a result based on its content and structure. However, no specific output or cases were provided in the output section. Therefore, I cannot specify the return values or conditions under which they would occur.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `path`, which is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the character '/' with specific constraints, but no return values or conditions are specified.**
