`count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` can be either 0 or 1, so after execution, `count` will be either 1 or 2. The values of `flag` and the character written to stdout remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `flag` is 1, `count` is either 1 or 2.

Output State: **`flag` is 1, `count` is either 1 or 2**
