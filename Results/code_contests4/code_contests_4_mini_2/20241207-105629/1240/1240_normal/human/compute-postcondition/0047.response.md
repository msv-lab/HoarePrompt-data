Postcondition: ***`count` is either 0 or 1. If `a` is '/', then if `flag` is 0, `count` remains unchanged and `flag` is set to 1, while `a` is unchanged. If `flag` is not 0, it may remain the same or stay 1 if it was already set. If `a` is a newline character, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a` is not a newline, then `count` is either 1 or 2, `flag` is set to 0, and the value of `a` written to stdout remains unchanged. In the else case, if `a` is a newline character, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a` is '/', then `flag` is set to 1 if it was 0, otherwise it remains the same. If `a` is not a newline, then `count` is either 1 or 2, and `flag` is set to 0, while the value of `a` written to stdout remains unchanged. In the else part, `flag` is 0, `count` is either 1 or 2, and `a` is undefined.***
