The function reads characters from standard input until a newline is encountered. It writes each character to standard output while counting the total number of non-newline characters read. If it encounters a '/' character, it checks a flag to determine if it should write a '/' or not, effectively skipping consecutive slashes. If no non-newline characters are read, it outputs a single '/'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
