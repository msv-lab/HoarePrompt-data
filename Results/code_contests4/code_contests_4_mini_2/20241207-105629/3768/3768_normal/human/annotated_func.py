#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts six positive integer parameters that represent the dimensions of three logos. It returns True if certain configurations of these dimensions match specific conditions, such as the relationships between the widths and heights of the logos. If none of the conditions are met, it returns False. Specifically, it checks for cases where the heights and widths of the logos align in specific ways, and prints the height or width of the logos along with their representations. If none of the conditions are satisfied, it defaults to returning False.
