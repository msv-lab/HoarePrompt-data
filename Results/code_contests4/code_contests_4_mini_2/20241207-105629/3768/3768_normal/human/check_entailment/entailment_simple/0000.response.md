Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Missing Cases**: The program only checks a few specific arrangements of the logos, rather than considering all possible orientations and placements of the rectangles on the square billboard. The problem description allows for any arrangement that fills the square billboard without any empty space.

2. **Logic Errors**: The conditions and arrangements checked in the program (like `ya < yb`, `ya == yb`, etc.) do not cover all possible configurations of the logos. For example, it does not account for the case where the logos might fit in a different orientation or arrangement that still fulfills the requirement of not overlapping and completely filling the square.

3. **Output Formatting**: The output format in the program does not match the requirements in the problem description. It needs to print the square size followed by a specific arrangement of the letters "A", "B", and "C" that represent the logos. The program has some incorrect print statements and the logic for printing the letters does not ensure that all logos are placed correctly without overlapping.

4. **Return Value**: The program returns `True` upon successfully printing an arrangement, but it does not guarantee that the arrangement is valid according to all possible configurations. The return value may misleadingly imply that the solution is correct when it might not be.

Overall, the program fails to comprehensively handle the requirements of the problem statement, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect. A correct implementation would need to systematically explore all potential arrangements and orientations of the logos to determine if they can fill a square billboard without any overlapping or empty space.
