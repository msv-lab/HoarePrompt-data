To assess the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description and output hints, let's break down the process step by step.

### Problem Description Breakdown
The goal is to determine if three logos (rectangles) can fit perfectly on a square billboard without any overlap or empty space. The input consists of the dimensions of the three logos. The output should indicate whether it is possible to fit all three logos on a square billboard and, if so, print the dimensions of the billboard and how the logos would be arranged.

### Program Analysis
1. The program reads the dimensions of the logos and checks various configurations using the function `func_1`.
2. The function `func_1` checks different conditions based on the dimensions to determine if the logos can fit into a square billboard.
3. The function prints the dimensions of the square and the arrangement of the logos if a valid configuration is found.

### Edge Case Consideration
1. **Single Dimension Logos**: If one logo has a dimension of 1, it could lead to configurations that are not properly checked.
2. **Rotations**: The program attempts to check different configurations through permutations of the logo dimensions, but it is essential to ensure that each configuration is exhaustively checked.
3. **Inability to Form a Square**: The code checks for specific relationships between dimensions, but it may miss cases where the dimensions could fit together in a way that does not follow the code's logic.

### Output Hints Analysis
The output hints suggest that the function returns True if specific configurations are met and prints the dimensions and arrangements accordingly. However, they also indicate that if no conditions are met, it will print -1.

### Agreement Check
The output hints suggest that the function could potentially miss configurations where logos fit together but do not meet the specific height and width relationships checked. For instance, if two logos can stack vertically but the third cannot fit horizontally, the current checks may not cover this scenario.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the program does not seem to correctly handle all edge cases and configurations as specified in the problem description. Specifically, it might fail in cases where logos can indeed fit together but do not meet the specific dimension checks implemented in `func_1`. 

Correctness: **False**. 

The program may produce incorrect results for cases where logos can fit together in a non-standard arrangement or when configurations are valid but not covered by the current checks. For example, if logos with dimensions (1, 5), (5, 1), and (5, 1) are provided, it might not return a valid configuration despite being able to fit together on a square billboard.
