You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Three companies decided to order a billboard with pictures of their logos. A billboard is a big square board. A logo of each company is a rectangle of a non-zero area. 

Advertisers will put up the ad only if it is possible to place all three logos on the billboard so that they do not overlap and the billboard has no empty space left. When you put a logo on the billboard, you should rotate it so that the sides were parallel to the sides of the billboard.

Your task is to determine if it is possible to put the logos of all the three companies on some square billboard without breaking any of the described rules.

Input

The first line of the input contains six positive integers x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3 (1 ≤ x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3 ≤ 100), where xi and yi determine the length and width of the logo of the i-th company respectively.

Output

If it is impossible to place all the three logos on a square shield, print a single integer "-1" (without the quotes).

If it is possible, print in the first line the length of a side of square n, where you can place all the three logos. Each of the next n lines should contain n uppercase English letters "A", "B" or "C". The sets of the same letters should form solid rectangles, provided that:

  * the sizes of the rectangle composed from letters "A" should be equal to the sizes of the logo of the first company, 
  * the sizes of the rectangle composed from letters "B" should be equal to the sizes of the logo of the second company, 
  * the sizes of the rectangle composed from letters "C" should be equal to the sizes of the logo of the third company, 



Note that the logos of the companies can be rotated for printing on the billboard. The billboard mustn't have any empty space. If a square billboard can be filled with the logos in multiple ways, you are allowed to print any of them.

See the samples to better understand the statement.

    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts six positive integer parameters that represent the dimensions of three logos. It returns True if certain configurations of these dimensions match specific conditions, such as the relationships between the widths and heights of the logos. If none of the conditions are met, it returns False. Specifically, it checks for cases where the heights and widths of the logos align in specific ways, and prints the height or width of the logos along with their representations. If none of the conditions are satisfied, it defaults to returning False.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
