You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: Three companies decided to order a billboard with pictures of their logos. A billboard is a big square board. A logo of each company is a rectangle of a non-zero area. 

Advertisers will put up the ad only if it is possible to place all three logos on the billboard so that they do not overlap and the billboard has no empty space left. When you put a logo on the billboard, you should rotate it so that the sides were parallel to the sides of the billboard.

Your task is to determine if it is possible to put the logos of all the three companies on some square billboard without breaking any of the described rules.

Input

The first line of the input contains six positive integers x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3 (1 ≤ x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3 ≤ 100), where xi and yi determine the length and width of the logo of the i-th company respectively.

Output

If it is impossible to place all the three logos on a square shield, print a single integer "-1" (without the quotes).

If it is possible, print in the first line the length of a side of square n, where you can place all the three logos. Each of the next n lines should contain n uppercase English letters "A", "B" or "C". The sets of the same letters should form solid rectangles, provided that:

  * the sizes of the rectangle composed from letters "A" should be equal to the sizes of the logo of the first company, 
  * the sizes of the rectangle composed from letters "B" should be equal to the sizes of the logo of the second company, 
  * the sizes of the rectangle composed from letters "C" should be equal to the sizes of the logo of the third company, 



Note that the logos of the companies can be rotated for printing on the billboard. The billboard mustn't have any empty space. If a square billboard can be filled with the logos in multiple ways, you are allowed to print any of them.
