Postcondition: ***`xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`, `xc`, and `yc` are positive integers representing the dimensions of three logos with non-zero area. `ya` is less than `yb`, and it is not the case that `xa` equals `xc` and `ya` plus `yc` equals `yb`. `ya` is equal to `yb`. It is false that `xa + xb` equals `xc` and `ya + yc` equals `xc`. Additionally, `ya` is equal to `yc` and the sum of `xa`, `xb`, and `xc` equals `yc`.***
