The code `print(yc)` outputs the value of `yc`. Given the initial state includes that `ya` is equal to `yc`, and since `ya` is also equal to `yb`, we can deduce that `yc` is equal to `ya`, which is a positive integer. The conditions state that `ya` is a positive integer and less than `yb`, which indicates that `yc` must also be a positive integer.

Therefore, the Output State is: `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`, `xc`, and `yc` are positive integers; `ya` is equal to `yc` and is a positive integer. The value of `yc` is printed.

Output State: **`xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`, `xc`, and `yc` are positive integers; `ya` is equal to `yc` and is a positive integer; `yc` is printed.**
