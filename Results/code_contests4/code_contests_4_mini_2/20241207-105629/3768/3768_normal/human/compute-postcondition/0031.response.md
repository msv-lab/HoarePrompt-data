Postcondition: ***`xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`, `xc`, and `yc` are positive integers representing the dimensions of three logos with non-zero area. `ya` is greater than `yb`, `ya` is not equal to `yc`, `xa + xb + xc` is not equal to `yc`, `xa` is not equal to `xc`, `ya + yc` is not equal to `yb`, `xa + xb` is not equal to `xc`, and `xa` is equal to `xb`. Additionally, either `xb` is not equal to `xc`, or `yb + yc` is not equal to `ya`. Furthermore, it is the case that either `xc` is not equal to `xa` or `ya + yb + yc` is not equal to `xa`.***
