Output State: **`xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`, `xc`, and `yc` are positive integers representing the dimensions of three logos with non-zero area. `ya` is less than `yb`, and it is not the case that `xa` equals `xc` and `ya` plus `yc` equals `yb`. Additionally, `ya` is equal to `yb`. The sum of `xa` and `xb` equals `xc`, and the sum of `ya` and `yc` equals `xc` and the value of `xc` is printed.**
