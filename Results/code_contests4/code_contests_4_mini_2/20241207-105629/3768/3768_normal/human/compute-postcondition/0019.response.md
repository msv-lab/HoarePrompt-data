Postcondition: ***`xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`, `xc`, and `yc` are positive integers representing the dimensions of three logos with non-zero area. `ya` is greater than `yb`, `ya` is not equal to `yc`, `xa + xb + xc` is not equal to `yc`, `xa` is not equal to `xc`, `ya + yc` is not equal to `yb`, and `xa + xb` is not equal to `xc`.***
