Postcondition: ***`xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`, `xc`, and `yc` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`, `xc`, `yc` ≤ 100, representing the dimensions of three logos with non-zero area. Additionally, `ya` is less than `yb`. Furthermore, `xa` is equal to `xc`, and the sum of `ya` and `yc` is equal to `yb`.***
