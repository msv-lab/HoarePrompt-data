Postcondition: ***`xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`, `xc`, and `yc` are positive integers representing the dimensions of three logos with non-zero area. If `ya` is less than `yb`, then `ya` is less than `yb`, and if `ya` is equal to `yb`, then `ya` is equal to `yb`, `ya` is not equal to `yc`, and it is not the case that `xa + xb + xc` equals `yc`. Additionally, it is false that `xa` equals `xc` and `ya` plus `yc` equals `yb`, and it is also false that `xa + xb` equals `xc` and `ya + yc` equals `xc`.***
