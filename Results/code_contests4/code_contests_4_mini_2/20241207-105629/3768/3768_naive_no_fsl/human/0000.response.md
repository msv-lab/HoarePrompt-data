To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the code and evaluate its ability to handle various potential cases.

The goal of the program is to check if three logos can be placed on a square billboard without overlapping and without leaving any empty space. The program takes the dimensions of the logos as input and attempts to arrange them in a square configuration.

### Analysis of the Code:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads six integers representing the dimensions of three logos.

2. **Function `func_1` Logic**:
   - The function attempts to validate placement of the logos based on various conditions:
     - It checks if the logos can be arranged in specific configurations based on their dimensions.
     - It accounts for rotations of the logos by checking different combinations of width and height.
     - It outputs the size of the square if a valid arrangement is found.

3. **Multiple Checks**: The program calls `func_1` multiple times with different combinations of logo dimensions to find a valid arrangement.

4. **Output Logic**: If a valid arrangement is found, the side length of the square and the arrangement of logos is printed; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

### Potential Issues:
- The conditions checked within `func_1` do not cover all possible valid placements of the logos on the billboard.
- The algorithm may fail for cases where the logos can fit together but do not meet the current conditions specified in the function.
  
### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
2 3 3 2 3 3
```
In this case:
- Logo A is `2x3`
- Logo B is `3x2`
- Logo C is `3x3`

The valid arrangement should be:
```
CCCCC
CCCCC
AAA
AAA
BB
BB
```
The current implementation does not provide a valid output for this configuration, as it does not consider all combinations correctly, particularly when the total area and arrangement can fit but are not evaluated by the current checks.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and can fail for certain valid configurations of logos, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
