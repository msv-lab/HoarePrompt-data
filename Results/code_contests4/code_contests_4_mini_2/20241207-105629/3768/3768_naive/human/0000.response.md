To determine the correctness of the provided program, we will analyze the logic and consider edge cases based on the problem description.

The task requires us to check if three logos can fit perfectly on a square billboard without overlapping and without leaving any empty space. The logos can be rotated, and the output should include the size of the square and a representation of the logos.

Let's break down the provided program:

1. The program reads six integers representing the dimensions of three logos.
2. The function `func_1` checks various configurations of the logos to see if they can fit on a square billboard without gaps or overlaps.
3. The function considers different orientations and combinations of the logos, but it does not appear to cover all possible cases adequately.

### Potential Issues to Consider:
- **Incorrect Case Handling**: The function checks specific cases of logo arrangements but misses other configurations. For instance, it does not account for all possible orientations of the logos or combinations beyond the hardcoded conditions.
- **Edge Cases**: The program may fail when the logos are of different dimensions or cannot fit in the configurations checked. For example:
  - If we have logos with the dimensions `1, 5`, `2, 5`, and `5, 1`, the program may not find a valid configuration even though it is possible (i.e., the total area can be arranged differently).
  
Given that the logic seems limited and does not thoroughly explore all configurations, there is a likelihood that some combinations of logo dimensions will not be handled correctly.

### Example of a Failing Case:
For input dimensions `1, 5`, `2, 5`, and `5, 1`, the program may not yield a valid configuration, even though it should be able to fit these logos into a square of size `5`. 

### Conclusion:
The program does not cover all possible arrangements and configurations of the logos, leading to the conclusion that it is not correct. 

Correctness: **False**.
