Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the distance from Harry's position to the place of the second meeting of the spell impulses as described in the problem statement. 

For example, if the input is:
```
100
50
50
```
The expected output should be `50`, as both impulses meet exactly in the middle of the corridor. However, the given program will output `2500.0`, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases, making the correctness **False**.
