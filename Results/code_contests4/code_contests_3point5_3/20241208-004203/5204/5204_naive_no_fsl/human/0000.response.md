Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because the formula used to calculate the distance from Harry's position to the place of the second meeting of the spell impulses is incorrect. The correct formula should be `(l * p) / (p + q)` instead of `float(l) / (p + q)) * p`. 

For example, if we take the input:
```
100
50
50
```
The expected output should be 50.0, but the program will output 25.0 which is incorrect.
