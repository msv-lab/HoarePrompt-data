Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The formula used in the program is incorrect. The correct formula to calculate the distance from Harry's position to the place of the second meeting of the spell impulses is `(l * p) / (p + q)`. The program should be corrected to use this formula in order to be in line with the problem description.
