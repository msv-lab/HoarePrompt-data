Correctness: **False**

The given Python program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code calculates the distance from Harry's position to the place of the second meeting of the spell impulses by dividing the length of the corridor by the sum of the speeds of the magical impulses and then multiplying the result by Harry's speed. However, the correct formula to calculate the distance to the second meeting point should be `l * p / (p + q)`. The current code does not use the correct formula as per the problem description, so it is incorrect.
