Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. It does not calculate the distance from Harry's position to the place of the second meeting of the spell impulses as required by the problem description. Instead, it performs a different calculation that does not match the problem requirements. Additionally, the program does not handle the constraints and potential input errors mentioned in the problem description, such as ensuring that `l`, `p`, and `q` are positive integers within specific ranges and avoiding division by zero.
