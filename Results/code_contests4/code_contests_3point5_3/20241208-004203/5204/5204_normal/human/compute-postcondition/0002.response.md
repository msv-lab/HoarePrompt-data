Example Answer:
`q` is assigned the value `input()`, where `input` accepts an input. The value of `q` is now the input value provided by the user. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is an input value, `p` is the input value, and `q` is the user-provided input value.
Output State: **`l` is an input value, `p` is the input value, `q` is the user-provided input value**
