Example Answer:
`l` is assigned the value of `input()`, where `input` accepts an input. The previous values of `p` and `q` are unknown and not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is an input value, `p` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 <= p, q <= 500.
Output State: **`l` is an input value, `p` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 <= p, q <= 500.**
