Example Answer:
The code snippet calculates the result of dividing the float value of `l` by the sum of `p` and `q`, then multiplying the result by `p`. The output state depends on the input values of `l`, `p`, and `q`. 
Output State: **`l` is an input value, `p` is the input value, `q` is the user-provided input value, and the result of the expression is returned.**
