Example Answer:
`p` is assigned the value of the input. The value of `l` is not changed. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is an input value, `p` is the input value, `q` is a positive integer such that 1 <= q <= 500.
Output State: **`l` is an input value, `p` is the input value, `q` is a positive integer such that 1 <= q <= 500**
