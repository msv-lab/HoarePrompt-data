Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly reads the input, builds the graph, and then finds a spanning tree that satisfies the given condition. It handles the case where there is no spanning tree satisfying the condition by printing "NO". The implementation ensures that the degree of the first vertex is equal to D in the output spanning tree. The program covers all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement.
