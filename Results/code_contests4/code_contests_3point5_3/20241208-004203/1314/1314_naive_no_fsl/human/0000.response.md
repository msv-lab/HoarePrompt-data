Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for the number of vertices, number of edges, and the required degree of the first vertex.
2. It then processes the input edges, creating sets to store the edges connected to vertex 1 and all edges.
3. It checks if the number of edges incident to vertex 1 is less than the required degree, and if so, prints "NO" and exits.
4. It then proceeds to construct a spanning tree by assigning each vertex a component number using breadth-first search.
5. It ensures that the degree of vertex 1 matches the required degree by removing edges incident to vertex 1 that connect vertices from the same component.
6. Finally, it outputs the edges of the spanning tree in the correct format.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and correctly outputs either "NO" or a valid spanning tree with the required degree of the first vertex.
