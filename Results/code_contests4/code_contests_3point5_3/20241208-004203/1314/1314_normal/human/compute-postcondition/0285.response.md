Example Answer:
`el` is added to the `sv` set. Since `el` is already in `vis`, it is not possible for `el` to be in `sv`. The initial state mentions that `el` is not in `vis`, so this operation contradicts that. The output state is dependent on the initial state, but based on the contradiction, it seems that the program cannot proceed as expected. 
Output State: **Contradiction in initial state, program cannot proceed as expected**
