Example Answer:
If `arr[el]` was originally 0, it is now updated to `cur`. The set `tov` may have been updated with the addition of `el`. The loop will execute one more time if there are elements left in the set `ds[nxt]` to iterate over. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr[el]` is updated to `cur`, `tov` may have been updated, and the loop will execute one more time if there are elements left in `ds[nxt]`.
Output State: **`arr[el]` is updated to `cur`, `tov` may have been updated, and the loop will execute one more time if there are elements left in `ds[nxt]`.**
