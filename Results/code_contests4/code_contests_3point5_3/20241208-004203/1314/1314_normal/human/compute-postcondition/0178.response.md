Output State: **All variables `n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `arr`, `i`, `cur`, `tov`, `nxt`, `el` are increased by 6, `tov` contains the incremented value of `i` and `el` added to the set. `arr[i]` holds the value of `cur`, `nxt` is the next value popped from `tov` set, `ds` dictionary has the key `nxt`, `nxt` is a valid key in `ds`, `arr[el]` is equal to `cur`, `tov` set is updated by adding the element `el`, `tov` is not empty, `nxt` is assigned the value popped from `tov`, `ds[nxt]` has at least 1 element if `arr[el]` is equal to 0. Next iteration `el` is increased by 3 and added to the set for the loop to execute again.**
