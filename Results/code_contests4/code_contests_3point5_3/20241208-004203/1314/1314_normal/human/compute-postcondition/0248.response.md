Example Answer:
The element `el` is added to the set `vis`. Since `el` is already in `sv`, the set `vis` will now contain the element `el` as well. All other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `tov` contains at least one element, `cur` is 0, `D` is adjusted accordingly, `sviaz` is initialized with at least one element, all elements in `ite` have been iterated over, all conditions in the loop have been processed, a new empty set `sv` is initialized, `sv` contains the element `el`, `sv` is not empty, `vis` contains the elements `el`.**
