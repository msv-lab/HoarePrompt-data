Example Answer:
The value of `nxt` is converted to a string and concatenated with the value of `el`, separated by a space, and appended to the list `res`. Since the initial state mentions that `vis` contains the element `el`, and `el` is used in the code but not modified, the output state includes the updated `res` list with the new concatenated string.
Output State: **`vis` contains the element `el`, `res` contains the new concatenated string**
