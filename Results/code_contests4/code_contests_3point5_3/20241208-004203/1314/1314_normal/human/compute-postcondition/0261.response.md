Example Answer:
The element `nxt` is removed from the corresponding elements in `dmain` for the key `el`. The states of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements in `dmain` have been processed, `sv` has at least 1 element remaining, `vis` contains all visited elements plus `el`, `res` is updated with concatenated strings of `nxt` and `el` for the current iteration, `dmain` is updated with `nxt` removed from corresponding elements if `el` is not in `vis`.
Output State: **All elements in `dmain` have been processed, `sv` has at least 1 element remaining, `vis` contains all visited elements plus `el`, `res` is updated with concatenated strings of `nxt` and `el` for the current iteration, `dmain` is updated with `nxt` removed from corresponding elements if `el` is not in `vis`**
