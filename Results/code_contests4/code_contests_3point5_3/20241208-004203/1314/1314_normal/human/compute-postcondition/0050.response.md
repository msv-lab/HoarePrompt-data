Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `arr[i]`, `i`, `cur`, `tov` contains the set with the values `i`, `nxt`, and `el`, for the loop to execute one more time `el` should be present in `ds[nxt]`. If `arr[el]` is 0, then `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `tov` contains the value of `el`.***
