Example Answer:
The code appends the string representation of `nxt` concatenated with a space and `el` to the `res` list. The `nxt` and `el` values are not provided in the initial state, so the output state will reflect the addition of the new concatenated string to `res`.
Output State: **All elements in `dmain` have been processed, `sv` has at least 1 element remaining with `el` added to it, `vis` contains all visited elements plus `el`, `res` is updated with concatenated strings of `nxt` and `el` for the current iteration, `dmain` is updated with `nxt` removed from corresponding elements if `el` is not in `vis`, `el` is the next element in `dmain[nxt]` if `nxt` exists in `dmain`, `vis` is updated with `el`, and `res` contains the appended string for the next iteration.**
