For the loop to execute one more time, the key points to consider are the elements related to the loop condition and iteration. 

At the end of the previous iteration, all variables `n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `arr`, `i`, `cur`, `tov`, `nxt`, `el` were increased by 3. Therefore, for the next iteration:
1. `el` needs to be increased by 3 to move on to the next element in the `ds[nxt]` list.
2. `el` needs to be added to the set. 
3. The condition `el in ds[nxt]` needs to be satisfied for the loop to execute.

State: **All variables `n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `arr`, `i`, `cur`, `tov`, `nxt`, `el` are increased by 6, `tov` contains the incremented value of `i` and `el` added to the set. `arr[i]` holds the value of `cur`, `nxt` is the next value popped from `tov` set, `ds` dictionary has the key `nxt`, `nxt` is a valid key in `ds`, `arr[el]` is equal to `cur`, `tov` set is updated by adding the element `el`, `tov` is not empty, `nxt` is assigned the value popped from `tov`, and `ds[nxt]` has at least 1 element if `arr[el]` is equal to 0. Next iteration `el` is increased by 3 and added to the set for the loop to execute again.**
