Example Answer:
`el` is added to the set `vis`. Since `sv` contains the element `el` and `sv` is not empty, after execution, the set `vis` now contains the element `el`. Therefore, the Output State is: `sv` contains the element `el`, `sv` is not empty, `vis` contains the element `el`.
Output State: **`sv` contains the element `el`, `sv` is not empty, `vis` contains the element `el`**
