Example Answer:
The `print('\n'.join(res))` statement will concatenate all the strings in the list `res` with a newline character in between each string and then print the result. Since the loop will not execute again, `res` contains all the processed elements in the order they were appended. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: sv is empty, vis contains all visited elements, `res` contains concatenated strings of all processed elements in the order they were appended, dmain is fully updated with corresponding elements removed.
Output State: **sv is empty, vis contains all visited elements, `res` contains concatenated strings of all processed elements in the order they were appended, dmain is fully updated with corresponding elements removed**
