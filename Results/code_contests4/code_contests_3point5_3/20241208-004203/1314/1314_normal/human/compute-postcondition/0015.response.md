Example Answer:
The value of `f` is added to the set corresponding to key `s` in the defaultdict `ds`. The previous values of variables are `n`, `m`, `D` are assigned integer values, `ds` is a defaultdict with an empty set as its default value, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time, `m` is greater than 1; `s` and `f` are assigned integer values extracted from the input split by space. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `D` are assigned integer values, `ds` is a defaultdict with an empty set as its default value, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time, `m` is greater than 1; `s` and `f` are assigned integer values extracted from the input split by space and `f` is added to the set corresponding to key `s` in `ds`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `D` are assigned integer values, `ds` is a defaultdict with an empty set as its default value, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time, `m` is greater than 1; `s` and `f` are assigned integer values extracted from the input split by space and `f` is added to the set corresponding to key `s` in `ds`**
