Example Answer:
`el` is added to the set `tov`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `arr[i]`, `i`, `cur` contains the set with the values `i`, `nxt`, and `el` added to it, for the loop to execute one more time `el` should be present in `ds[nxt]`, `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`, `tov` contains the value of `el`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `arr[i]`, `i`, `cur` contains the set with the values `i`, `nxt`, and `el` added to it, for the loop to execute one more time `el` should be present in `ds[nxt]`, `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`, `tov` contains the value of `el`**
