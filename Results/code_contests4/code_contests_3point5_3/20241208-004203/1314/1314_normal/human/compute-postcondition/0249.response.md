The code snippet appends the string concatenation of `nxt` and `el` to the list `res`. The variables `nxt` and `el` are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine their values. However, `res` will have the new string appended to it.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `tov` contains at least one element, `cur` is 0, `D` is adjusted accordingly, `sviaz` is initialized with at least one element, all elements in `ite` have been iterated over, all conditions in the loop have been processed, a new empty set `sv` is initialized, `sv` contains the element `el`, `sv` is not empty, `vis` contains the elements `el`, `res` contains the new string concatenation of `nxt` and `el`.**
