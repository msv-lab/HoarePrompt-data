Example Answer:
The element at index `el` of array `arr` is added to the set `sviaz`. As the element at index `el` of array `arr` is not in `sviaz`, the set `sviaz` will now have an additional element. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `tov` contains at least one element, `cur` is initialized to 0, `D` is adjusted accordingly, `sviaz` is initialized with at least one element, for the loop to execute the first time `ite` has at least 1 element and the element at index `el` of array `arr` is added to `sviaz`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `tov` contains at least one element, `cur` is initialized to 0, `D` is adjusted accordingly, `sviaz` is initialized with at least one element, for the loop to execute the first time `ite` has at least 1 element and the element at index `el` of array `arr` is added to `sviaz`**
