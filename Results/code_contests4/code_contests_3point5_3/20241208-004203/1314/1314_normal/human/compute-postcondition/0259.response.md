Example Answer:
`res` is updated by appending the string concatenation of `str(nxt)` and `str(el)`. The values of `nxt` and `el` are not given, so the output state is: All elements in `dmain` have been processed, `sv` has at least 1 element remaining, `vis` contains all visited elements plus `el`, `res` is updated with concatenated strings of `nxt` and `el` for the current iteration, `dmain` is updated with `nxt` removed from corresponding elements.
Output State: **All elements in `dmain` have been processed, `sv` has at least 1 element remaining, `vis` contains all visited elements plus `el`, `res` is updated with concatenated strings of `nxt` and `el` for the current iteration, `dmain` is updated with `nxt` removed from corresponding elements**
