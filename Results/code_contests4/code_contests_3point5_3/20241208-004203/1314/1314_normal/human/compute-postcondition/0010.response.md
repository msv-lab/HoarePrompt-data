Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `D` are assigned integer values, `ds` is a defaultdict with an empty set as its default value. For the loop to execute the first time, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` and `f` are assigned values based on the input using list comprehension. If `s` and `f` are not equal to 1, `ds[s]` is updated by adding `f` to the set, `ds[f]` is updated by adding `s` to the set.***
