Example Answer:
`arr[el]` is updated to `cur`, where `arr[el] == 0`. Additionally, after entering the if condition, `arr[el]` equals 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr[el]` is updated to `cur` where `arr[el] == 0` and `arr[el]` equals 0.
Output State: **`arr[el]` is updated to `cur` where `arr[el] == 0` and `arr[el]` equals 0**
