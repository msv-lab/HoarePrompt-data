Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `arr[i]`, `i`, `cur` remain the same. `tov` contains the set with the values `i` and `nxt`, `nxt` is the popped value from `tov`, the loop is executing for the first time with `ds` containing a key corresponding to the value of `nxt`, `el` is the first element in the list `ds[nxt]`. Additionally, `arr[el]` is equal to 0***
