According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the length of `sv` is greater than 0. Right before the loop, `sv` contains the element 1, so it has a length of 1, which is greater than 0. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `tov` contains at least one element, `cur` is 0, `D` is adjusted accordingly, `sviaz` is initialized with at least one element, all elements in `ite` have been iterated over, all conditions in the loop have been processed, a new empty set `sv` is initialized, `sv` contains the element 1, `vis` contains the element 1, `res` contains the list `['YES']`**
