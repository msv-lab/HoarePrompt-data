Example Answer:
`x` and `y` are assigned the respective integer values extracted from the input split by space. The previous values of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `D` are assigned integer values, `ds` is a defaultdict with an empty set as its default value, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time, `m` is greater than 1; `s` and `f` are assigned integer values extracted from the input split by space.
