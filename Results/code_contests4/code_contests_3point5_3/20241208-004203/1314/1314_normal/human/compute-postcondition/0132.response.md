Example Answer:
The element at index `el` in the array `arr` is equal to `cur`. The `tov.add(el)` statement adds the value of `el` to the `tov` set. Therefore, after execution, the `el` value is added to the `tov` set.
Output State: **The element at index `el` in the array `arr` is equal to `cur`, `el` value is added to the `tov` set**
