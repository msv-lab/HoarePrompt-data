According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `el`, `ds`, `nxt`, and `arr`. If `el` is present in `ds[nxt]`, and `arr[el]` is 0, then the loop can execute one more time. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `arr[i]`, `i`, `cur`, `tov` contains the set with the values `i`, `nxt`, and `el`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `el` should be present in `ds[nxt]`.
- If `arr[el]` is 0, then `arr[el]` should be assigned the value of `cur`.
- `tov` should contain the value of `el`.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `arr[i]`, `i`, `cur`, `tov` contains the set with the values `i`, `nxt`, and `el`, for the loop to execute one more time `el` should be present in `ds[nxt]`, if `arr[el]` is 0, then `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `tov` contains the value of `el`**
