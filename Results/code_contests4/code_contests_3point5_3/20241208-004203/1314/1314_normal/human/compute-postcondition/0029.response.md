Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `D` are assigned integer values. `ds` is a defaultdict with sets containing pairs of integers. Each pair `(s, f)` is added to `ds` and both `(s, f)` and `(f, s)` are added to `dmain` for all iterations of the loop. The length of `dmain[1]` is less than `D`. The program prints 'NO'.**
