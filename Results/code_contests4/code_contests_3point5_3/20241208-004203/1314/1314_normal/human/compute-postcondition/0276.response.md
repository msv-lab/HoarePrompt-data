Example Answer:
`nxt` is assigned the last element popped from `sv`. Since `sv` has at least 1 element remaining, after popping `nxt`, `sv` will have one less element. The other variables `vis`, `res`, and `dmain` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements in `dmain` have been processed, `sv` has one less element, `vis` contains all visited elements, `res` contains concatenated strings of all processed elements, `dmain` is fully updated with corresponding elements removed, for the loop to execute again `sv` must have at least 1 element remaining.
Output State: **All elements in `dmain` have been processed, `sv` has one less element, `vis` contains all visited elements, `res` contains concatenated strings of all processed elements, `dmain` is fully updated with corresponding elements removed, for the loop to execute again `sv` must have at least 1 element remaining**
