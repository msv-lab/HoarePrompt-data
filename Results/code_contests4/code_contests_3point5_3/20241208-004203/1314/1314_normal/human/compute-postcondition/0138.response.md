According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the array `arr` and the set `tov`. If the element at index `el` in the array `arr` is equal to 0, then the value of `el` is added to the set `tov`, and the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is an array, `el`, `cur`, `tov` are integers. If the element at index `el` in the array `arr` is equal to 0, then the value of `el` is added to the set `tov`. 

So for the loop to be executed one more time, the element at index `el` in the array `arr` must be equal to 0 and the value of `el` should be added to the set `tov`.

State: **`arr` is an array, `el`, `cur`, `tov` are integers. If the element at index `el` in the array `arr` is equal to 0 and `el` is added to the set `tov`, the loop can execute another time**.
