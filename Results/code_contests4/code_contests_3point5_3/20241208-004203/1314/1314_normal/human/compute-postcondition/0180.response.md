Postcondition: ***All variables `n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `arr`, `i`, `cur`, `tov`, `nxt` are increased by 6, `tov` contains the incremented value of `i` and `el` added to the set, `arr[el]` is equal to 0, `tov` set is updated by adding the element `el`, `tov` is not empty, `nxt` is assigned the value popped from `tov`, `ds[nxt]` has at least 1 element if `arr[el]` is equal to 0, `el` is increased by 3 and added to the set for the loop to execute again.***
