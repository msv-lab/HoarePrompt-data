Example Answer:
The element `el` is added to the set `tov`. Since all elements that satisfy the condition `arr[el] == 0` have been updated to `cur` in the `arr` array, the value of `el` may be `cur`. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements `el` that satisfy the condition `arr[el] == 0` have been updated to `cur` in the `arr` array; `el` may have been added to the set `tov`.
Output State: **All elements `el` that satisfy the condition `arr[el] == 0` have been updated to `cur` in the `arr` array; `el` may have been added to the set `tov`**
