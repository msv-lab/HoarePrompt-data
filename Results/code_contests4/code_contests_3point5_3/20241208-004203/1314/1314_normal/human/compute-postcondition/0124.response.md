Example Answer:
The element `el` is added to the stack `tov`. The `el` was obtained from the list `ds[nxt]`, and `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`. Therefore, the Output State is: `nxt` holds the value popped from the top of the stack `tov`, for the loop to execute one more time `ds[nxt]` is a list with at least 2 elements, `el` is the next element after the current `el` in the list `ds[nxt]`, if `arr[el]` is equal to 0, then `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `el` is added to the `tov` stack, `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`, `tov` contains `el`.
Output State: **`nxt` holds the value popped from the top of the stack `tov`, for the loop to execute one more time `ds[nxt]` is a list with at least 2 elements, `el` is the next element after the current `el` in the list `ds[nxt]`, if `arr[el]` is equal to 0, then `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `el` is added to the `tov` stack, `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`, `tov` contains `el`**
