According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `el` and the list `ds[nxt]`. If `ds[nxt]` still has elements left to iterate over, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ds[nxt]` has at least 1 element, `el` is the first element in `ds[nxt]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `ds[nxt]` must still have elements left and the next element in the list should be assigned to `el`.
State: **`n` is greater than 3, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `arr`, `cur`, `tov` is increased by 1, `arr[i]` is assigned the value of `cur`, `len(tov)` is greater than 0, `nxt` contains the updated value of `i`, `ds[nxt]` has at least 1 element, `el` is the next element in `ds[nxt]`, `arr[el]` is equal to `cur`, `tov` contains the element `el`**
