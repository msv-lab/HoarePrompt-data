Example Answer:
The element at index `el` of array `arr` is added to the set `sviaz`. The initial state of `sviaz` was initialized with at least one element, and now after adding a new element, `sviaz` will have one more element. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `tov` contains at least one element, `cur` is initialized to 0, `D` is adjusted accordingly, `sviaz` is initialized with at least one element and now has one more element, `ite` has at least 2 elements.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `tov` contains at least one element, `cur` is initialized to 0, `D` is adjusted accordingly, `sviaz` is initialized with at least one element and now has one more element, `ite` has at least 2 elements**
