Postcondition: ***`nxt` holds the value popped from the top of the stack `tov`, for the loop to execute the first time `ds[nxt]` is a list with at least 1 element, `el` is the first element in the list `ds[nxt]`. If `arr[el] == 0`, `el` in the array `arr` is equal to `cur`, and `el` is added to the stack `tov`. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables.***
