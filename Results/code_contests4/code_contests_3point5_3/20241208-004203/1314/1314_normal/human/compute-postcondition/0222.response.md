Example Answer:
The code removes the element 1 from the list `dmain[el]`. The previous values of the variables are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `tov` contains at least one element, `cur` is initialized to 0, `D` is adjusted accordingly, `sviaz` is initialized with at least one element, `arr[el]` is either added to `sviaz` or 1 is removed from `dmain[el]`, `ite` has at least 3 elements and 1 is removed from `dmain[el]`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `tov` contains at least one element, `cur` is initialized to 0, `D` is adjusted accordingly, `sviaz` is initialized with at least one element, `arr[el]` is either added to `sviaz` or 1 is removed from `dmain[el]`, `ite` has at least 3 elements and 1 is removed from `dmain[el]`**
