Example Answer:
The element `el` is added to the set `tov`. The set `tov` may have been updated with the addition of `el`, and the loop can execute one more time if elements are left in `ds[nxt]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr[el]` is updated to `cur` if `arr[el] == 0`, `tov` may have been updated with the addition of `el`, loop can execute one more time if elements are left in `ds[nxt]`.
Output State: **`arr[el]` is updated to `cur` if `arr[el] == 0`, `tov` may have been updated with the addition of `el`, loop can execute one more time if elements are left in `ds[nxt]`**
