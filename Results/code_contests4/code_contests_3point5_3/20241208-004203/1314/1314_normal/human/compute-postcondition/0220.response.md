According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `ite` and `arr`. If `el` is less than the length of `ite`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `tov` contains at least one element, `cur` is 0, `D` is adjusted, `sviaz` contains at least one element, `arr[el]` may or may not be in `sviaz`, and `ite` has at least 2 elements. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- If `arr[el]` is not in `sviaz`, `sviaz` must contain one more element.
- If `arr[el]` is in `sviaz`, `dmain[el]` should have 1 removed from it.
- The index `el` should be incremented by 1 in `ite`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `tov` contains at least one element, `cur` is initialized to 0, `D` is adjusted accordingly, `sviaz` is initialized with at least one element, `arr[el]` is either added to `sviaz` or 1 is removed from `dmain[el]`, `ite` has at least 3 elements**.
