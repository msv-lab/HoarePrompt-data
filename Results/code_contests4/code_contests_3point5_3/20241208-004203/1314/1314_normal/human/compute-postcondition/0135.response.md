Example Answer:
The element at index `el` in the array `arr` is updated to the value of `cur`. If the updated value at index `el` is equal to `cur`, then `el` is added to the set `tov` for the loop to execute another time. The states of the other variables remain the same.
Output State: **`arr` is an array, `el`, `cur`, `tov` are integers**
