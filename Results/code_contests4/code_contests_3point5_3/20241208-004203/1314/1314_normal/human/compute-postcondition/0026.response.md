Output State: **`n`, `m`, `D` are assigned integer values, `ds` is a defaultdict with an empty set as its default value, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 1, `s` and `f` are assigned integer values extracted from the input split by space. If `s` is not equal to 1 and `f` is not equal to 1, then `f` is added to the set corresponding to key `s` in `ds`.**
