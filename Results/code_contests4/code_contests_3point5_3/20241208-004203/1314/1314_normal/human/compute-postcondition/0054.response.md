Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `arr[i]`, `i`, `cur`, `tov` contains the set with the values `i`, `nxt`, and `el`. For the loop to execute one more time, `el` should be present in `ds[nxt]`. If `arr[el]` is 0, then `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `tov` contains the value of `el`. After the if-else block, if `arr[el]` was 0, it is updated to the value of `cur` and `tov` is updated to include the value of `el`.***
