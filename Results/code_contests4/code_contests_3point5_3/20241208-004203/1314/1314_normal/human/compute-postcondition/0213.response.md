Example Answer:
The element 1 is removed from `dmain[el]`, where `el` is the element at index `el` in `arr`. Since `el` is present in `sviaz`, the removal operation is successful. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `tov` contains at least one element, `cur` is initialized to 0, `D` is adjusted accordingly, element 1 is removed from `dmain[el]`, `sviaz` is initialized with at least one element, for the loop to execute the first time `ite` has at least 1 element.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `tov` contains at least one element, `cur` is initialized to 0, `D` is adjusted accordingly, element 1 is removed from `dmain[el]`, `sviaz` is initialized with at least one element, for the loop to execute the first time `ite` has at least 1 element**
