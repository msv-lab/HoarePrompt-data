Output State: **All variables `n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `arr`, `cur`, `tov` are increased by the number of elements in `ds[nxt]`. `arr[i]` is assigned the value of `cur`. `len(tov)` is greater than 0. `nxt` contains the updated value of `i`. `ds[nxt]` has at least 1 element. `el` is the last element in `ds[nxt]`. `arr[el]` is equal to `cur`. `tov` contains all elements in `ds[nxt]` for which `arr[el]` was 0.**
