Example Answer:
`arr[el]` is updated to `cur` where `arr[el] == 0`, meaning that `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`. The conditions for the loop to execute one more time are based on the value of `ds[nxt]` where `arr[el]` is 0, but the initial state of `ds[nxt]` and other variables is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `arr[el]` is updated to `cur`.
Output State: **`arr[el]` is updated to `cur`**
