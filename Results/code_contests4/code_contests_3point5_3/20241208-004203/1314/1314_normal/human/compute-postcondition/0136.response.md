Example Answer:
The value of `el` is added to `tov`. The previous values of `arr`, `el`, `cur` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is an array, `el`, `cur`, `tov` are integers with `el` added to `tov`.
Output State: **`arr` is an array, `el`, `cur`, `tov` are integers with `el` added to `tov`**
