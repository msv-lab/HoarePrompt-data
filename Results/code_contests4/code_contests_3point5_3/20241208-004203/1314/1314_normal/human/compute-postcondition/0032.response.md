Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `D` are assigned integer values. `ds` is a defaultdict with sets containing pairs of integers. Each pair `(s, f)` is added to `ds` and both `(s, f)` and `(f, s)` are added to `dmain` for all iterations of the loop. If the length of `dmain[1]` is less than `D`, then the program prints 'NO'. `arr` is a list of size `(n + 1)` filled with zeros.**
