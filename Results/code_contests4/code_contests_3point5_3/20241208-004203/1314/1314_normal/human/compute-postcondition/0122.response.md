According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the list `ds[nxt]` and the conditions related to the elements. 

At the end of the last iteration, `nxt` holds the value popped from the top of the stack `tov`, `ds[nxt]` is a list with at least 2 elements, `el` is the next element after the current `el` in the list `ds[nxt]`, and if `arr[el]` is equal to 0, then `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `el` is added to the `tov` stack.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next element `el` in the list `ds[nxt]` must satisfy the conditions. So, the next element `el` should be considered for the next iteration.

State: **`nxt` holds the value popped from the top of the stack `tov`, for the loop to execute one more time `ds[nxt]` is a list with at least 2 elements, `el` is the next element after the current `el` in the list `ds[nxt]`, if `arr[el]` is equal to 0, then `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `el` is added to the `tov` stack**.
