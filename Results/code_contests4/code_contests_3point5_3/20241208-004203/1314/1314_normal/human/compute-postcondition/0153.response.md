Postcondition: ***All variables `n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `arr`, `i` are increased by 3, `cur` is increased by 1, `tov` is assigned the set containing the incremented value of `i`, `arr[i]` is assigned the value of `cur`, `nxt` is assigned the value popped from `tov` set, for the loop to execute the first time `ds` is a dictionary with the key `nxt`, `nxt` is a valid key in `ds`. Additionally, `arr[el]` is equal to 0.***
