Example Answer:
The element `el` is added to the stack `tov`. The stack `tov` now contains the element `el` in addition to its previous elements. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nxt` holds the value popped from the top of the stack `tov`, for the loop to execute the first time `ds[nxt]` is a list with at least 1 element, `el` is the first element in the list `ds[nxt]`, the element `el` in the array `arr` is equal to `cur`, and `el` is added to the stack `tov`.
Output State: **`nxt` holds the value popped from the top of the stack `tov`, for the loop to execute the first time `ds[nxt]` is a list with at least 1 element, `el` is the first element in the list `ds[nxt]`, the element `el` in the array `arr` is equal to `cur`, and `el` is added to the stack `tov`**
