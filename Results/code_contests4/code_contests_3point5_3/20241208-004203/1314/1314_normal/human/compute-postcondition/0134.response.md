According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the array `arr`, the value of `el`, and the set `tov`. If the condition specified is met, the loop will execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is an array, `el`, `cur`, `tov` are integers. If the element at index `el` in the array `arr` is equal to `cur`, then the value of `el` is added to the set `tov`. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time, the next element in the `ds` list must satisfy the condition mentioned above.
State: **`arr` is an array, `el`, `cur`, `tov` are integers. If the element at index `el` in the array `arr` is equal to `cur`, then the value of `el` is added to the set `tov` for the loop to execute another time.**
