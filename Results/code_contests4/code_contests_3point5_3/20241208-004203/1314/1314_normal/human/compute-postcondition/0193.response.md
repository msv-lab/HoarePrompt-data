According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `el`, `ds`, `nxt`, and `arr`. If `el` is within the keys of `ds[nxt]` and `arr[el]` is equal to 0, the loop can execute another time. At the end of the last iteration, all variables `n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `arr`, `i`, `cur`, `tov`, `el` are increased by 3, `tov` contains the incremented value of `i` and `el`, all `el` values are added to the set, `arr[i]` holds the value of `cur`, `ds` dictionary has the key `nxt`, `nxt` is a valid key in `ds`, `arr[el]` is equal to `cur`, `tov` is not empty, and `arr[el]` is equal to 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the `el` must be within the keys of `ds[nxt]` and `arr[el]` must be equal to 0.
State: **All variables `n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `arr`, `i`, `cur`, `tov`, `el` are increased by 3, `tov` contains the incremented value of `i` and `el`, all `el` values are added to the set, `arr[i]` holds the value of `cur`, `ds` dictionary has the key `nxt`, `nxt` is a valid key in `ds`, `arr[el]` is equal to `cur`, `tov` is not empty, and `arr[el]` is equal to 0 for the loop to execute another time.**
