Example Answer: 
`arr[el]` is updated to `cur` if `arr[el] == 0`. Since `arr[el]` equals 0 after entering the if condition, `arr[el]` is updated to `cur`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr[el]` is updated to `cur`, `tov` is non-empty, for the loop to execute the first time `ds[nxt]` is a list with at least 1 element where `arr[el] == 0` is true, and `cur` is updated to `arr[el]`. Additionally, after entering the if condition `arr[el]` equals 0.
