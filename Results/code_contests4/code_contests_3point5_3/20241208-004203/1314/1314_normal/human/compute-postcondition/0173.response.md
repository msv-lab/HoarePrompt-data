According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the dictionary `ds` corresponding to the key `nxt`. If there are more elements in the dictionary `ds` corresponding to `nxt`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, all variables `n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `arr`, `i`, `cur` are increased by 3, `tov` contains the incremented value of `i`, `arr[i]` holds the value of `cur`, `nxt` is the next value popped from `tov` set, `ds` dictionary has the key `nxt`, `nxt` is a valid key in `ds`, `arr[el]` is equal to `cur`, `tov` set is updated by adding the element `el`, `tov` is not empty, `nxt` is assigned the value popped from `tov`, and `ds[nxt]` has at least 1 element. Additionally, if `arr[el] == 0`, then `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `el` is added to the `tov` set.

So for the loop to be executed one more time, the dictionary `ds` corresponding to the key `nxt` must have more elements, and `el` should point to the next element in `ds[nxt]`.
