According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, all variables `n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `arr`, `cur`, `tov` remain the same except `i` is increased by 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` needs to be increased by 3.
