Example Answer:
The code appends the string concatenation of `nxt`, a variable not present in the initial state, and `el` to the list `res`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `nxt`, the output state will include the updated list `res` with the new string appended to it.
Output State: **`sv` contains the element `el`, `sv` is not empty, `vis` contains the element `el`, `res` contains the new string concatenation**
