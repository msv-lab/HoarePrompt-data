Example Answer:
The code appends the concatenated strings of `nxt` and `el` with a space in between to the `res` list. The variables `nxt` and `el` are converted to strings before concatenation. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements in `dmain` have been processed, `sv` has at least 1 element remaining with `el` added to it, `vis` contains all visited elements plus `el`, `res` is updated with concatenated strings of `nxt` and `el` for the current iteration, `dmain` is updated with `nxt` removed from corresponding elements if `el` is not in `vis`, `el` is the next element in `dmain[nxt]` if `nxt` exists in `dmain`, `vis` is updated with `el`, and `res` contains the appended string.
Output State: **All elements in `dmain` have been processed, `sv` has at least 1 element remaining with `el` added to it, `vis` contains all visited elements plus `el`, `res` is updated with concatenated strings of `nxt` and `el` for the current iteration, `dmain` is updated with `nxt` removed from corresponding elements if `el` is not in `vis`, `el` is the next element in `dmain[nxt]` if `nxt` exists in `dmain`, `vis` is updated with `el`, and `res` contains the appended string.**
