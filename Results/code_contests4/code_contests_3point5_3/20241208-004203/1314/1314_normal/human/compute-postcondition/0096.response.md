Example Answer:
The variable `nxt` is assigned the value popped from the set `tov`. Since `tov` initially contains the value of `i`, and `i` is increased by 1, `nxt` will contain the updated value of `i`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 3, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `arr`, `cur`, `tov` is increased by 1, `arr[i]` is assigned the value of `cur`, for the loop to execute the first time `len(tov)` is greater than 0, and `nxt` contains the updated value of `i`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `arr`, `cur`, `tov` is increased by 1, `arr[i]` is assigned the value of `cur`, for the loop to execute the first time `len(tov)` is greater than 0, `nxt` contains the updated value of `i`**
