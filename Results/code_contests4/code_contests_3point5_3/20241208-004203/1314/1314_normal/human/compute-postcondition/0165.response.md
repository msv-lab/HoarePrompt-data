Output State: **All variables `n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `arr`, `i` are increased by 3, `cur` is increased by 2, `tov` contains the incremented value of `i`, `arr[i]` holds the value of `cur`, `nxt` is the next value popped from `tov` set, `ds` is a dictionary with the key `nxt`, `nxt` is a valid key in `ds`, `arr[el]` is equal to `cur`, `tov` set is updated by adding the element `el`. The loop will continue to execute until all elements in `ds[nxt]` have been processed. If any element `el` in `ds[nxt]` has `arr[el]` equal to 0, then it will be assigned the value of `cur` and added to `tov`. Overall, after all iterations, the variables will have the updated values based on the loop logic.**
