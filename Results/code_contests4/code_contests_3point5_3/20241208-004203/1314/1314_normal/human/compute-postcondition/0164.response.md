Postcondition: ***All variables `n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `arr`, `i` are increased by 3, `cur` is increased by 2, `tov` contains the incremented value of `i`, `arr[i]` holds the value of `cur`, `nxt` is the next value popped from `tov` set, `ds` is a dictionary with the key `nxt`, `nxt` is a valid key in `ds`, `arr[el]` is equal to `cur`, `tov` set is updated by adding the element `el`. For the loop to execute one more time, the element `el` must exist in the list of values corresponding to the key `nxt` in the dictionary `ds. If `arr[el]` is equal to 0, then the overall state of the program remains the same.***
