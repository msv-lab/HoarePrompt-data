Example Answer:
The element `nxt` is removed from the list stored at `dmain[el]`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements in `dmain` have been processed, `sv` has one more element which is `el`, `vis` contains all visited elements including `el`, `res` contains concatenated strings of all processed elements and the newly appended string, `dmain` is fully updated with corresponding elements removed, for the loop to execute again `sv` must have at least 1 element remaining, `dmain[nxt]` has at least 1 element, and `el` is not in `vis`.
Output State: **All elements in `dmain` have been processed, `sv` has one more element which is `el`, `vis` contains all visited elements including `el`, `res` contains concatenated strings of all processed elements and the newly appended string, `dmain` is fully updated with corresponding elements removed, for the loop to execute again `sv` must have at least 1 element remaining, `dmain[nxt]` has at least 1 element, and `el` is not in `vis**.
