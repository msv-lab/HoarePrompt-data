Example Answer:
The next element is popped from the `sv` list and assigned to `nxt`. The `sv` list now has one less element, `nxt` contains the popped element. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements in `dmain` have been processed, `sv` has one less element, `vis` contains all visited elements, `res` contains concatenated strings of `nxt` and `el` for all processed elements, `dmain` is updated with `nxt` removed from corresponding elements in each iteration, for the loop to execute again `sv` needs to have elements remaining.
Output State: **All elements in `dmain` have been processed, `sv` has one less element, `vis` contains all visited elements, `res` contains concatenated strings of `nxt` and `el` for all processed elements, `dmain` is updated with `nxt` removed from corresponding elements in each iteration, for the loop to execute again `sv` needs to have elements remaining**
