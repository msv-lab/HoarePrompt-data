Example Answer:
The set `tov` has the value of `el` added to it. Since all variables are increased by 3, the set `tov` now contains the incremented value of `el`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables `n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `arr`, `i`, `cur`, `tov`, `el` are increased by 3, `tov` contains the incremented value of `i` and `el`, all `el` values are added to the set, `arr[i]` holds the value of `cur`, `ds` dictionary has the key `nxt`, `nxt` is a valid key in `ds`, `arr[el]` is equal to `cur`, `tov` is not empty, and `arr[el]` is equal to 0 for the loop to execute another time.
Output State: **All variables `n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `arr`, `i`, `cur`, `tov`, `el` are increased by 3, `tov` contains the incremented value of `i` and `el`, all `el` values are added to the set, `arr[i]` holds the value of `cur`, `ds` dictionary has the key `nxt`, `nxt` is a valid key in `ds`, `arr[el]` is equal to `cur`, `tov` is not empty, and `arr[el]` is equal to 0 for the loop to execute another time.**
