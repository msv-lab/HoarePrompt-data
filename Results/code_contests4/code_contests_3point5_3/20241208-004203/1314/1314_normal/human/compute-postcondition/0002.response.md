Example Answer:
`n`, `m`, and `D` are assigned values based on the input after splitting the input by spaces and converting each part to an integer. The specific values of `n`, `m`, and `D` are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `D` are assigned integer values based on the input.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `D` are assigned integer values based on the input**
