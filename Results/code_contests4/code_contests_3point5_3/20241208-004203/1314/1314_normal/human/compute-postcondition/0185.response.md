Postcondition: ***All variables `n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `arr`, `i`, `cur`, `tov`, `el` are increased by 3, `tov` contains the incremented value of `i`, all `el` values added to the set, `arr[i]` holds the value of `cur`, `ds` dictionary has the key `nxt`, `nxt` is a valid key in `ds`, `arr[el]` is equal to `cur`, `tov` is not empty for the loop to execute again. Additionally, `arr[el]` is equal to 0 after entering the if statement.***
