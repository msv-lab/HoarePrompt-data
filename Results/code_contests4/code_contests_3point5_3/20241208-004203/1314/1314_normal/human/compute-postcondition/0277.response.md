According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `dmain[nxt]`. If there is at least 1 element in `dmain[nxt]`, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, all elements in `dmain` have been processed, `sv` has one less element, `vis` contains all visited elements, `res` contains concatenated strings of all processed elements, `dmain` is fully updated with corresponding elements removed, so for the loop to execute again `sv` must have at least 1 element remaining. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: `dmain[nxt]` has at least 1 element, `sv` has at least 1 element remaining.
State: **All elements in `dmain` have been processed, `sv` has one less element, `vis` contains all visited elements, `res` contains concatenated strings of all processed elements, `dmain` is fully updated with corresponding elements removed, for the loop to execute again `sv` must have at least 1 element remaining, `dmain[nxt]` has at least 1 element**
