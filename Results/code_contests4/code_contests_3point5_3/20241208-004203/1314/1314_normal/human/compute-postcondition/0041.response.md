Example Answer:
The value of `nxt` is assigned the value popped from the set `tov`. The set `tov` should have at least one element for the loop to execute the first time. The values of `n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `arr`, `i`, `cur` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `arr[i]` is equal to the updated value of `cur`, `i`, `cur` remain the same, `tov` is assigned a set containing the value `i` and `nxt` is assigned the popped value from `tov`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `arr[i]` is equal to the updated value of `cur`, `i`, `cur` remain the same, `tov` is assigned a set containing the value `i` and `nxt` is assigned the popped value from `tov`**
