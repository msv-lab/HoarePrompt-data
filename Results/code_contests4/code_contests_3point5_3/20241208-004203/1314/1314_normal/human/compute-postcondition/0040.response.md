According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the length of the set `tov` is not zero. Right before the loop, `n` is greater than 2, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `arr` is modified such that `arr[i]` is equal to the updated value of `cur`, `i`, `cur` remain the same, and `tov` is assigned a set containing the value `i`. 

To make sure the loop executes one more time, the set `tov` should have at least one element. Therefore, to adjust the states:
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `arr` is modified such that `arr[i]` is equal to the updated value of `cur`, `i`, `cur` remain the same, `tov` is assigned a set containing the value `i`, for the loop to execute the first time, `tov` should have at least one element**
