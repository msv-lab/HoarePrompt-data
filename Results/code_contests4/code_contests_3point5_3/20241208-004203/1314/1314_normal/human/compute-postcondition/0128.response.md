Example Answer:
The value of `nxt` is popped from the top of the stack `tov`. All the elements in the list `ds[nxt]` have been iterated over, and for each element `el`, if `arr[el]` was initially 0, it is now assigned the value of `cur`, and all those elements are added to the `tov` stack. For the loop to execute again, the length of `tov` should be greater than 0. 
Output State: **All the above operations have been performed as described.**
