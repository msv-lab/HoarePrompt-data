Example Answer:
`el` is removed from the list `dmain[nxt]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements in `dmain` have been processed. `sv` has at least 1 element remaining with `el` added to it. `vis` contains all visited elements plus `el`. `res` is updated with concatenated strings of `nxt` and `el` for the current iteration. `dmain` is updated with `nxt` removed from corresponding elements if `el` is not in `vis`. `el` is the next element in `dmain[nxt]` if `nxt` exists in `dmain`. `vis` is updated with `el`, and `res` contains the appended string for the next iteration.
Output State: **All elements in `dmain` have been processed. `sv` has at least 1 element remaining with `el` added to it. `vis` contains all visited elements plus `el`. `res` is updated with concatenated strings of `nxt` and `el` for the current iteration. `dmain` is updated with `nxt` removed from corresponding elements if `el` is not in `vis`. `el` is the next element in `dmain[nxt]` if `nxt` exists in `dmain`. `vis` is updated with `el`, and `res` contains the appended string for the next iteration.**
