According to the code, the loop can execute again if the variable `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2 and the value of `i` has been increased by 1. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the updated values should be `n` is greater than 3 and `i` is increased by 1.
State: **Output State: `n` is greater than 3, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `arr`, `cur`, and `tov` remain the same. The value of `i` is increased by 2**
