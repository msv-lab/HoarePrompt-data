According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `nxt`, `tov`, `ds`, `arr`, `cur`, and `el`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `nxt` holds the value popped from the top of the stack `tov`, `ds[nxt]` is a list with at least 1 element, and `el` is the first element in the list `ds[nxt]`. If `arr[el] == 0`, `el` in the array `arr` is equal to `cur`, and `el` is added to the stack `tov`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the list `ds[nxt]` must have at least 2 elements. The next element after `el` in `ds[nxt]` will be the new `el`.

State: **`nxt` holds the value popped from the top of the stack `tov`, for the loop to execute one more time `ds[nxt]` is a list with at least 2 elements, `el` is the next element after the current `el` in the list `ds[nxt]`**
