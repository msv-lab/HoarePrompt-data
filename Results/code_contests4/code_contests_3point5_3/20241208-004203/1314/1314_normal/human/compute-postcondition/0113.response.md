According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `nxt` and the existence of elements in the list `ds[nxt]`. If the list `ds[nxt]` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `nxt` holds the value popped from the top of the stack `tov`. To ensure the loop executes, `ds[nxt]` must have at least 1 element, and `el` in the loop must be the first element in the list `ds[nxt]`.
State: **`nxt` holds the value popped from the top of the stack `tov`, for the loop to execute the first time `ds[nxt]` is a list with at least 1 element, `el` is the first element in the list `ds[nxt]`**
