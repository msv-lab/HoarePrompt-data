The value of `nxt` is assigned the value popped from set `sv`, where `sv` contains the element 1. After execution, `sv` will be empty as an element is popped, and `nxt` will contain the popped value. All other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `tov` contains at least one element, `cur` is 0, `D` is adjusted accordingly, `sviaz` is initialized with at least one element, all elements in `ite` have been iterated over, all conditions in the loop have been processed, a new empty set `sv` is initialized, `sv` is empty, `vis` contains the element 1, `res` contains the list `['YES']`, `nxt` contains the popped value from set `sv`**
