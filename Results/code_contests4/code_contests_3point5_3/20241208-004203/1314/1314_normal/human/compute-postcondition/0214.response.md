Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `tov` contains at least one element, `cur` is initialized to 0, `D` is adjusted accordingly, `sviaz` is initialized with at least one element, for the loop to execute the first time `ite` has at least 1 element. If `arr[el]` is not in `sviaz`, the element at index `el` of array `arr` is added to `sviaz`. If `arr[el]` is in `sviaz`, element 1 is removed from `dmain[el]`.***
