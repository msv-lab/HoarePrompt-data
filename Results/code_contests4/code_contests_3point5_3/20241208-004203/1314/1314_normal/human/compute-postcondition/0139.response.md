Example Answer:
The value at index `el` in the array `arr` is updated to `cur`. The states of `el`, `cur`, and `tov` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is an array, `el`, `cur`, `tov` are integers.
Output State: **`arr` is an array, `el`, `cur`, `tov` are integers**
