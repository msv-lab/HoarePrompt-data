Example Answer:
The code snippet appends the string representation of `nxt` followed by a space and the string representation of `el` to the list `res`. However, since the initial state contains a contradiction that prevents the program from proceeding as expected, the output state cannot be determined accurately.
Output State: **Cannot proceed due to a contradiction in the initial state**
