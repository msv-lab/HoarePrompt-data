Example Answer:
The value of `el` is added to the set `tov` if `arr[el]` is updated to `cur` and `arr[el] == 0`. Since `arr[el]` equals 0 and is updated to `cur`, `el` is added to the set `tov`. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr[el]` is updated to `cur` where `arr[el] == 0`, `arr[el]` equals 0; `tov` contains the value of `el`.
Output State: **`arr[el]` is updated to `cur` where `arr[el] == 0`, `arr[el]` equals 0; `tov` contains the value of `el`**
