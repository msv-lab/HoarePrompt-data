According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the length of `tov` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, all variables `n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `arr`, `i`, `cur`, `tov`, `nxt`, `el` are increased by 3, so there is no need to adjust these variables. The `tov` set is updated by adding all elements `el` and then emptied. For the loop to execute one more time, `tov` needs to be filled with elements, so it should be updated to contain at least one element.
State: **All variables `n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `arr`, `i`, `cur`, `tov`, `nxt`, `el` are increased by 3, `tov` contains the incremented value of `i` and all `el` values added to the set, `arr[i]` holds the value of `cur`, `nxt` is the next value popped from `tov` set, `ds` dictionary has the key `nxt`, `nxt` is a valid key in `ds`, `arr[el]` is equal to `cur`, `tov` set is updated by adding all elements `el`, and `tov` is not empty for the loop to execute again**.
