Example Answer:
The element `el` is added to the set `tov`. The value of `arr[el]` is updated to `cur`, and the loop will execute one more time if there are elements left in `ds[nxt]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr[el]` is updated to `cur`, `tov` contains the element `el`, and the loop will execute one more time if there are elements left in `ds[nxt]`.
Output State: **`arr[el]` is updated to `cur`, `tov` contains the element `el`, and the loop will execute one more time if there are elements left in `ds[nxt]`**
