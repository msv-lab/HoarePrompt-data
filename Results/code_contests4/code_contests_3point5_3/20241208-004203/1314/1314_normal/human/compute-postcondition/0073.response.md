Example Answer:
The value at the top of the `tov` stack is removed and assigned to `nxt`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr[el]` is updated to `cur` if `arr[el] == 0`, `tov` is non-empty for the loop to execute again.
Output State: **`arr[el]` is updated to `cur` if `arr[el] == 0`, `tov` is non-empty for the loop to execute again**
