According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the list `ds[nxt]`. If there are more elements in the list where `arr[el] == 0`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `arr[el]` is updated to `cur` if `arr[el] == 0`, and `tov` is non-empty and includes `el`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `ds[nxt]` must still be a list with at least 1 element where `arr[el] == 0` is true, and `cur` should be updated to `arr[el]`. Additionally, after entering the if condition, `arr[el]` should equal 0 again.
