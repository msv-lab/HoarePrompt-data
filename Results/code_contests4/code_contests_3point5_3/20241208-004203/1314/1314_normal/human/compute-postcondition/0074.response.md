According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `ds[nxt]` list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `arr[el]` being updated to `cur` if `arr[el] == 0` means that for the loop to execute the first time, there must be an element in `ds[nxt]` such that `arr[el] == 0` is true, and `cur` should be updated to `arr[el]`. Additionally, `tov` being non-empty ensures that the loop can execute again, so `tov` needs to be non-empty as well.
State: **`arr[el]` is updated to `cur` if `arr[el] == 0`, `tov` is non-empty, for the loop to execute the first time `ds[nxt]` is a list with at least 1 element where `arr[el] == 0` is true, and `cur` is updated to `arr[el]`**
