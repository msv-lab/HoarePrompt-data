Example Answer:
The code snippet attempts to append the string representation of `nxt` concatenated with a space and the string representation of `el` to a list `res`. However, since there is a contradiction in the initial state and the values of `nxt` and `el` are unknown, the program cannot proceed as expected.
Output State: **Contradiction in initial state, program cannot proceed as expected**
