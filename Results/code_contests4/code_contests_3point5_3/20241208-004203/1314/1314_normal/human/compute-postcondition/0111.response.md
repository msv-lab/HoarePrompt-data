According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the length of `tov` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, all variables `n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `arr`, `cur`, `tov` have been increased by the number of elements in `ds[nxt]`, and `len(tov)` is greater than 0. `nxt` contains the updated value of `i`, `ds[nxt]` has at least 1 element, `el` is the last element in `ds[nxt]`, and `arr[el]` is equal to `cur`. Additionally, `tov` contains all elements in `ds[nxt]` for which `arr[el]` was 0. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **All variables remain the same for the loop to execute again**
