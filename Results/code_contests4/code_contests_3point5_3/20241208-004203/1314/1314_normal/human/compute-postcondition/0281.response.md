Example Answer: 
The code appends the string representation of `nxt` followed by a space and `el` to the list `res`. Since all elements in `dmain` have been processed, `sv` has one more element which is `el`, `vis` contains all visited elements including `el`, and `dmain` is fully updated, the only variable that changes is `res`, which now contains the concatenated strings of all processed elements plus the newly appended string. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements in `dmain` have been processed, `sv` has one more element which is `el`, `vis` contains all visited elements including `el`, `res` contains concatenated strings of all processed elements and the newly appended string, `dmain` is fully updated with corresponding elements removed, for the loop to execute again `sv` must have at least 1 element remaining, `dmain[nxt]` has at least 1 element, and `el` is not in `vis`.
Output State: **All elements in `dmain` have been processed, `sv` has one more element which is `el`, `vis` contains all visited elements including `el`, `res` contains concatenated strings of all processed elements and the newly appended string, `dmain` is fully updated with corresponding elements removed, for the loop to execute again `sv` must have at least 1 element remaining, `dmain[nxt]` has at least 1 element, and `el` is not in `vis`**
