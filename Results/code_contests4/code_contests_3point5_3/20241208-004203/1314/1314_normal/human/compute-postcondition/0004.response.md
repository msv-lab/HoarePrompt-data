Example Answer:
`dmain` is assigned a `defaultdict` with an empty set as its default value. The initial state includes `n`, `m`, and `D` which are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `D` are assigned integer values based on the input; `ds` is a defaultdict with an empty set as its default value.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `D` are assigned integer values based on the input; `ds` is a defaultdict with an empty set as its default value**
