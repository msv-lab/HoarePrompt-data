Postcondition: ***n is greater than 2, m, D, ds, dmain, arr[i], i, cur, tov contain the set with the values i, nxt, and all elements el that satisfy the condition arr[el] == 0 have been updated to cur in the arr array, for the loop to execute again the length of tov is non-zero, nxt is the value popped from tov set, ds[nxt] has at least one element, el is the first element in ds[nxt], el satisfies the condition arr[el] == 0, and arr[el] is equal to 0***
