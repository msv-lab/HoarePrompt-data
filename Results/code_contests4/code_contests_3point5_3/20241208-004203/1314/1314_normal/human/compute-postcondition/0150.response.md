According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the set `tov`. If the length of `tov` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. 

Right before the loop, `tov` is assigned the set containing the incremented value of `i`, so `tov` needs to have a length greater than 0 for the loop to execute. All other variables remain the same.

State: **All variables `n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `arr`, `i` is increased by 3, `cur` is increased by 1, `tov` is assigned the set containing the incremented value of `i`, `arr[i]` is assigned the value of `cur`, for the loop to execute the first time `tov` needs to have a length greater than 0**
