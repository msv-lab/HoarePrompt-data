According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `el`, `ds`, and `nxt`. `ds` should have a key `nxt` and `nxt` should be a valid key in `ds`. The set `tov` should not be empty for the loop to execute again. 

Before the loop starts, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `n` is increased by 3.
- `m` is increased by 3.
- `D` is increased by 3.
- `ds` dictionary has the key `nxt`.
- `dmain` is increased by 3.
- `arr` is increased by 3.
- `i` is increased by 3.
- `cur` is increased by 3.
- `tov` is increased by 3 and contains the incremented value of `i`.
- All `el` values are added to the set.
- `arr[i]` holds the value of `cur`.
- `arr[el]` is equal to `cur`.

State: **All variables `n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `arr`, `i`, `cur`, `tov`, `el` are increased by 3, `tov` contains the incremented value of `i`, all `el` values added to the set, `arr[i]` holds the value of `cur`, `ds` dictionary has the key `nxt`, `nxt` is a valid key in `ds`, `arr[el]` is equal to `cur`, `tov` is not empty for the loop to execute again.**
