Example Answer:
The program cannot proceed as expected due to a contradiction in the initial state. The `sv` variable is expected to be a set, but there is no information about the current state of the `sv` variable. Therefore, the program execution cannot be simulated accurately.
Output State: **Contradiction in initial state, the program cannot proceed as expected**
