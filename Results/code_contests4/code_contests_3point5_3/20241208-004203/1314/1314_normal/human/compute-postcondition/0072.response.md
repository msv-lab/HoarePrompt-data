According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the set `tov`. If `tov` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, all variables remain unchanged except for `arr[el]`, which is updated to `cur` if `arr[el] == 0`. The set `tov` may have been updated with the addition of `el` if the condition is satisfied. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `tov` needs to remain non-empty. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **All variables remain unchanged except for `arr[el]`, which is updated to `cur` if `arr[el] == 0`, `tov` is non-empty for the loop to execute again**
