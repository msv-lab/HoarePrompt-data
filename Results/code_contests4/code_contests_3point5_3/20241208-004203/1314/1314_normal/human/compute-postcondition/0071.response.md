Output State: **All variables remain unchanged except for `arr[el]`, which is updated to `cur` if `arr[el] == 0`. The set `tov` may have been updated with the addition of `el` if the condition is satisfied. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements left in the set `ds[nxt]` to iterate over.**
