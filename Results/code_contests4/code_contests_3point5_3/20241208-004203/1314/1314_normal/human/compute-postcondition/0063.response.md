According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the set `ds[nxt]`. If there are still elements left in the set to iterate over, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, all variables are unchanged except for `arr[el]`, which is updated to `cur` if `arr[el] == 0`. The set `tov` may have been updated with the addition of `el` if the condition is satisfied. So for the loop to execute one more time, the set `ds[nxt]` must still have elements left to iterate over.
