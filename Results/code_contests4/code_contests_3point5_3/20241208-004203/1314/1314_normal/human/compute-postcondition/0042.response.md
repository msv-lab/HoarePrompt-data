According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `ds` and `nxt`. If `ds` contains a key corresponding to the value of `nxt`, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute are that `ds` must contain a key corresponding to the value of `nxt`, and `el` is the first element in the list `ds[nxt]`.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `arr[i]` is equal to the updated value of `cur`, `i`, `cur` remain the same, `tov` is assigned a set containing the value `i` and `nxt` is assigned the popped value from `tov`, for the loop to execute the first time `ds` contains a key corresponding to the value of `nxt`, `el` is the first element in the list `ds[nxt]`**
