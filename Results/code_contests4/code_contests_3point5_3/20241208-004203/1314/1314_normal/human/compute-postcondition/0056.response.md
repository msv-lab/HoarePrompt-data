According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the set `tov`. If the length of `tov` is non-zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
1. `n` is greater than 2.
2. The set `tov` contains the set with the values `i`, `nxt`, and all elements `el` that satisfy the condition `arr[el] == 0` have been updated to `cur` in the `arr` array.
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `arr[i]`, `i`, `cur`, `tov` contains the set with the values `i`, `nxt`, and all elements `el` that satisfy the condition `arr[el] == 0` have been updated to `cur` in the `arr` array, for the loop to execute again the length of `tov` is non-zero**
