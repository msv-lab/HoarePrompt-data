According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the length of the `tov` stack. If the length of `tov` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nxt` holds the value popped from the top of the stack `tov`, all elements in the list `ds[nxt]` have been iterated over, and for each element `el`, if `arr[el]` was initially 0, it is now assigned the value of `cur`, and all those elements are added to the `tov` stack. So, to execute the loop one more time, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the length of the `tov` stack should be greater than 0.
State: **`nxt` holds the value popped from the top of the stack `tov`, all elements in the list `ds[nxt]` have been iterated over, and for each element `el`, if `arr[el]` was initially 0, it is now assigned the value of `cur`, and all those elements are added to the `tov` stack, for the loop to execute again the length of `tov` should be greater than 0**
