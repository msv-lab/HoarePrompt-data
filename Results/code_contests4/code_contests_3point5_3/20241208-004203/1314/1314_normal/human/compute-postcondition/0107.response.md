Output State: All variables `n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `arr`, `cur`, `tov` are increased by 1. `arr[i+1]` is assigned the value of `cur`. `len(tov)` is greater than 0. `nxt` contains the updated value of `i+1`. `ds[nxt]` has at least 1 element. `el` is the next element in `ds[nxt]`. `arr[el]` is equal to `cur`. `tov` contains the element `el`. If `arr[el]` is 0, all the mentioned variables are incremented by 1.
