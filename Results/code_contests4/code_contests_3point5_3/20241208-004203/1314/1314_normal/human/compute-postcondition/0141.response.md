Postcondition: ***`arr` is an array, `el`, `cur`, `tov` are integers. If the element at index `el` in the array `arr` is equal to 0 and `el` is added to the set `tov`, the loop can execute another time. If there is an error of 'int' object has no attribute 'add', the program does not proceed further.***
