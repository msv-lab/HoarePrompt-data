According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the list `ds[nxt]` and the values in the array `arr`. If `arr[el]` is 0, the loop can execute for that particular element. At the end of the last iteration, `arr[el]` is updated to `cur` where `arr[el] == 0`, `tov` includes the value of `el`, and `arr[el]` equals 0 after executing the if else block. So for the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in `ds[nxt]` where `arr[el]` is 0.
State: **`arr[el]` is updated to `cur` where `arr[el] == 0`, `tov` includes the value of `el`, and `arr[el]` equals 0 after executing the if else block for the loop to execute one more time there must be another element in `ds[nxt]` where `arr[el]` is 0.**
