According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the dictionary `ds` at key `nxt`. If there are more elements in the list for the next iteration, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration:
- All variables `n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `arr`, `i` are increased by 3
- `cur` is increased by 1
- `tov` contains the incremented value of `i`
- `arr[i]` is assigned the value of `cur`
- `nxt` is assigned the value popped from `tov` set
- `ds` is a dictionary with the key `nxt`
- `nxt` is a valid key in `ds`
- `arr[el]` is equal to `cur`
- `tov` set is updated by adding the element `el`

For the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- `cur` should be increased by 1
- `nxt` should be updated to the next element in the list
- `ds[nxt]` should contain more elements for the next iteration

State: **All variables `n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `arr`, `i` are increased by 3, `cur` is increased by 2, `tov` is assigned the set containing the incremented value of `i`, `arr[i]` is assigned the value of `cur`, `nxt` is assigned the next value popped from `tov` set, `ds` is a dictionary with the key `nxt`, `nxt` is a valid key in `ds`, `arr[el]` is equal to `cur`, `tov` set is updated by adding the element `el`.**
