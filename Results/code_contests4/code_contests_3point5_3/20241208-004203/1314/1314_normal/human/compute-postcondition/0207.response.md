Example Answer:
`ite` is assigned a copy of the second element of `dmain`. The previous values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is equal to the final value of `i`, all elements in `arr` have been updated, `cur` contains the final value of the loop counter, `tov` is empty, `sviaz` is an empty set. If `cur` is greater than `D`, the program prints 'NO'.
