According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the set `ds[nxt]`. If there are elements left in the set to iterate over, the loop can execute one more time. 

At the end of the last iteration, all variables remain unchanged except for `arr[el]`, which is updated to `cur` if `arr[el] == 0`, and the set `tov` may have been updated with the addition of `el` if the condition is satisfied. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time, there must be elements left in the set `ds[nxt]` to iterate over.
