Example Answer:
`ds[f].add(s)` updates the set associated with key `f` in the defaultdict `ds` by adding the value `s` to it. The states of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `D` are assigned integer values, `ds` is a defaultdict with an empty set as its default value. For the loop to execute the first time, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` and `f` are assigned values based on the input using list comprehension. `s` and `f` are not equal to 1. `ds[s]` is updated by adding `f` to the set, `ds[f]` is updated by adding `s` to the set.
