Postcondition: ***All variables `n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `arr`, `cur`, `tov` remain the same except `i` is increased by 2. After the loop has executed, all elements in the array `arr` have been updated based on the conditions in the loop. All variables `n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `arr`, `cur` have been modified according to the number of elements in `ds[nxt]`. The loop control variable `tov` is empty, indicating the loop has finished executing.***
