Example Answer:  
`arr[el]` is updated to `cur` if `arr[el] == 0`. The set `tov` may have been updated with the addition of `el` if the condition is satisfied. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be elements left in the set `ds[nxt]` to iterate over.  
Output State: **`arr[el]` is updated to `cur` if `arr[el] == 0`, `tov` may have been updated with the addition of `el`, loop can execute one more time if elements are left in `ds[nxt]`**
