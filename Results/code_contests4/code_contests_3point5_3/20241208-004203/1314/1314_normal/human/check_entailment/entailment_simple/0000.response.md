Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to find any spanning tree of the given graph such that the degree of the first vertex is equal to D. It first checks if there is a spanning tree satisfying the condition and prints "NO" if there isn't. Then it constructs the spanning tree by traversing the graph and adding edges accordingly.

The program ensures that the output satisfies the requirements mentioned in the problem description, which includes printing "YES" followed by the edges of the spanning tree or "NO" if no such spanning tree exists. The algorithm used in the program guarantees that the output will always meet the specified conditions for any valid input.

Therefore, the program is correct and follows the problem description accurately.
