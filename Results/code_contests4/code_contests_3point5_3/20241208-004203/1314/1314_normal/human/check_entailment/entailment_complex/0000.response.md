Correctness: **True**

The program reads the input values n, m, and D, processes the edge connections between vertices, and then checks if there exists a spanning tree such that the degree of the first vertex is equal to D. It handles cases where such a spanning tree does not exist and prints "NO" in such cases. 

If a valid spanning tree exists, it constructs the spanning tree and prints "YES" followed by the edges of the spanning tree. The program ensures that the output edges form a subset of the input edges and that the degree of the first vertex is equal to D.

The program follows the problem description by correctly determining the existence of a spanning tree meeting the specified conditions and providing the correct output accordingly.
