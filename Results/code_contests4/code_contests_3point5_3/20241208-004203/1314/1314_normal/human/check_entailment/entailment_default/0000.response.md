Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the input values `n`, `m`, and `D` and processes the pairs of integers representing edges between vertices.
- It populates dictionaries `ds` and `dmain` with the edge connections.
- It then performs various checks and manipulations on the input data to determine relationships between vertices.
- Finally, it prints the output based on certain conditions as specified in the problem description.
- The code ensures that the degree of the first vertex is equal to D in the spanning tree if it exists.
- It handles the case where there is no spanning tree satisfying the condition by printing "NO".
- Overall, the code aligns with the problem description and produces the correct output for all potential cases.
