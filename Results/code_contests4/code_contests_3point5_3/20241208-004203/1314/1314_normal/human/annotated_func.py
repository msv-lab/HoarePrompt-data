#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads input values `n`, `m`, and `D` and processes pairs of integers representing edges between vertices. It populates dictionaries `ds` and `dmain` with the edge connections. It then performs various checks and manipulations on the input data to determine relationships between vertices and prints a specific output based on certain conditions. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly, but it processes input data according to specified constraints and prints the final result.
