According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `m` (86,400). At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 86,399 and `m` is 86,400. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, so `i` would become 86,400 and for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `m`, which means `i` should be less than 86,400.
State: **for the loop to execute again `i` is 86,400 and `m` is 86,400**
