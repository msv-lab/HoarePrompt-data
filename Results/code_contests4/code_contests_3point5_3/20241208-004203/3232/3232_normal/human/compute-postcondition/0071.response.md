According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the maximum value in the `dp` list should be recalculated to ensure the condition is met. Additionally, since `n` is assigned the value of the input from `raw_input()`, we need to make sure that `n` is greater than 0. At the start of the loop, `_` should be set to 0.

State: **The maximum value in the `dp` list is the sum of all elements from index 0 to 86,400, `n` is greater than 0, `n` is the input from `raw_input()`, `_` is 0, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1`**
