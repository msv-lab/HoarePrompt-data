Functionality: **The function processes the timetable information of n trains, where the departure and arrival times are provided in the format hh:mm:ss. It populates a list `dp` with the count of trains at each second of the day based on the input timetable information. After processing all trains, it calculates the maximum number of trains present at any given second and prints that value. The function repeats this process until n is input as 0. Edge cases and missing functionality: The function assumes valid input format for time values and does not handle cases where the input format is incorrect. Additionally, it does not consider overlapping train schedules.**
