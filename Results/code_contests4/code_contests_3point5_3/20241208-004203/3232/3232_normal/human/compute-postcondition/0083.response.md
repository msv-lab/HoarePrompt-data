According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `_` and `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the maximum value in the `dp` list is the sum of all elements from index 0 to 86,400, `n` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `m` is the length of `dp`, `a`, `b`, `c` are the first three integer values obtained from splitting the input, `d`, `e`, `f` are the last three integer values obtained from splitting the input, `dp[a * 3600 + b * 60 + c]` is incremented by 1, `dp[d * 3600 + e * 60 + f]` is decremented by 2. So for the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **The maximum value in the `dp` list is the sum of all elements from index 0 to 86,400, `n` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `m` is the length of `dp`, `a`, `b`, `c` are the first three integer values obtained from splitting the input, `d`, `e`, `f` are the last three integer values obtained from splitting the input, `dp[a * 3600 + b * 60 + c]` is incremented by 1, `dp[d * 3600 + e * 60 + f]` is decremented by 2**.
