Output State: **Each element in the `dp` list is initialized to 0 with a length of 86,401, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is 86,400, `a` is assigned a string value, `b` and `c` are initialized to 0, `d` contains the integer values obtained by splitting the input string at colons, `e` and `f` are assigned the first and second integer values obtained from the split operation, and the element in the `dp` list at index `a * 3600 + b * 60 + c` is now decremented by 1.**
