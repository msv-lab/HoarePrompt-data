Example Answer:
The list `dp` is created with a length of `m + 1`, where `m` is 86,400 seconds. Therefore, the length of the list `dp` is 86,401 elements. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer indicating the number of trains included in the timetable, `m` is 86,400 seconds, `dp` is a list of 86,401 elements all initialized to 0**
