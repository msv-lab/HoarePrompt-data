Since the `while` loop is `while True`, it will always execute and iterate indefinitely. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states for the loop to execute one more time. The state remains as it is.
State: **Each element in the `dp` list will be the sum of all elements preceding it. `n` will remain a positive integer, `m` will be 86,400, and `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, and `f` will retain their assigned values based on the input.**
