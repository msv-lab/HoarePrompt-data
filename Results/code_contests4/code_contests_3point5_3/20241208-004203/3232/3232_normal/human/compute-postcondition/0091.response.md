Output State: **The maximum value in the `dp` list is the sum of all elements from index 0 to 86,400, `n` is greater than 0, `dp` is a list with updated values based on the calculation `dp[i + 1] += dp[i]`, `_` is equal to `n`, `a`, `b`, `c` are the last set of integer values obtained from splitting the input, `d`, `e`, `f` are the last set of integer values obtained from splitting the input, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
