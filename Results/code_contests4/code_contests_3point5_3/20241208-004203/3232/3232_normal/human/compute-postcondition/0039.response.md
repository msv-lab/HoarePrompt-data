According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer, so no adjustment is needed for `n`. However, we need to modify the state to ensure the loop can execute the first time.

State: **Each element in the `dp` list is initialized to 0 with a length of 86,401, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is 86,400, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, and `f` retain their assigned values, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0**
