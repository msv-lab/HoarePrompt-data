Example Answer:
`a.split(':')` splits the string `a` using ':' as the delimiter and returns a list of substrings. `map(int, ...)` applies the `int` function to each element of the list. Therefore, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the integer values obtained from splitting the string `a`. Other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **Each element in the `dp` list is initialized to 0 with a length of 86,401, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is 86,400, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned integer values from the input, `d` remains unchanged**.
