Example Answer: 
The code snippet prints the maximum value in the `dp` list. Since each element in the `dp` list contains the sum of all elements up to that index, the maximum value in the `dp` list will be the sum of all elements in the list. Therefore, the maximum value in the `dp` list will be the sum of all elements from index 0 to 86,400. 
Output State: **The maximum value in the `dp` list is the sum of all elements from index 0 to 86,400**
