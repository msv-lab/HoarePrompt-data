According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` being a non-negative integer is enough to ensure the loop will execute. However, for the loop to execute the first time, `_` will be 0.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `m` is 86,400 seconds, `dp` is a list of 86,401 elements all initialized to 0, for the loop to execute the first time `_` is 0**
