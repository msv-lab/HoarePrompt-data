Example Answer:
The variable `m` is assigned the value of 24 hours converted to seconds (24 * 60 * 60 = 86,400 seconds). The other variables (n, departure times, arrival times) are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer indicating the number of trains included in the timetable. The departure and arrival times of each train are given in the format hh:mm:ss, where hh is the hour, mm is the minute, and ss is the second. The departure time is always before the arrival time. m is 86,400 seconds.**
