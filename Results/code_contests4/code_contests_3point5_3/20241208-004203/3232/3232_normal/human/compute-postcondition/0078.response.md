Output State: **The maximum value in the `dp` list is the sum of all elements from index 0 to 86,400, `n` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1`, `a` is assigned the first integer value after splitting the input obtained from `raw_input()`, `b` is assigned the second integer value after splitting the input obtained from `raw_input()`, `c` is assigned the third integer value after splitting the input obtained from `raw_input()`, `d`, `e`, `f` are assigned the integer values obtained from splitting `d` using ':', `dp[a * 3600 + b * 60 + c]` is incremented by 1, `dp[d * 3600 + e * 60 + f]` is decremented by 1, `a, d = raw_input().split()`**
