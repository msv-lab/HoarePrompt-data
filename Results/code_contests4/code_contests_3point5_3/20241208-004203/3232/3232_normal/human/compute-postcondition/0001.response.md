Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **n is a non-negative integer indicating the number of trains included in the timetable. The departure and arrival times of each train are given in the format hh:mm:ss, where hh is the hour, mm is the minute, and ss is the second.
