Example Answer:
The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned by unpacking the result of `map(int, a.split(':'))`. The variable `a` is the first element of the input, which is converted to an integer. The variables `b` and `c` are obtained by splitting `a` using ':' as the delimiter and then converting the resulting substrings to integers. Since the initial state does not provide the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, the output state is as follows:
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `m` is 86,400 seconds, `dp` is a list of 86,401 elements all initialized to 0, `_` is 0, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are assigned values based on the input**
