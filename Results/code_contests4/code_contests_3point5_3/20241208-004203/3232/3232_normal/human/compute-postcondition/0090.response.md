According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If m is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the maximum value in the `dp` list being the sum of all elements from index 0 to 86,400 ensures that the loop will execute at least once. So, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **The maximum value in the `dp` list is the sum of all elements from index 0 to 86,400, `n` is greater than 0, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1`, all elements in `dp` list have been modified based on the calculations in the loop, `_` is equal to `n`, `a`, `b`, `c` are the last set of integer values obtained from splitting the input, `d`, `e`, `f` are the last set of integer values obtained from splitting the input, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
