According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the maximum value in the `dp` list is the sum of all elements from index 0 to 86,400, `n` is greater than 0, `dp` is a list with updated values, `_` is equal to `n`, `a`, `b`, `c` are the last set of integer values obtained from splitting the input, `d`, `e`, `f` are the last set of integer values obtained from splitting the input, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` should be increased by 1.
State: **The maximum value in the `dp` list is the sum of all elements from index 0 to 86,400, `n` is greater than 0, `dp` is a list with updated values, `_` is equal to `n`, `a`, `b`, `c` are the last set of integer values obtained from splitting the input, `d`, `e`, `f` are the last set of integer values obtained from splitting the input, for the loop to execute the second time `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1**
