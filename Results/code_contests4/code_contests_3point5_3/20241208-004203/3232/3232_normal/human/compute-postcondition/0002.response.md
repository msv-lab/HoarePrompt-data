Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variable `m` with a value of 86,400 seconds is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer indicating the number of trains included in the timetable, `m` is 86,400 seconds.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer indicating the number of trains included in the timetable, `m` is 86,400 seconds**
