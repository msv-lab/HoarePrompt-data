Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
1. The code does not handle cases where the input format for time values is incorrect. It assumes valid input format for time values (hh:mm:ss).
2. The code does not consider overlapping train schedules. If two trains have overlapping schedules, the current implementation does not account for this scenario.
3. The output hints mention that the code calculates the maximum number of trains present at any given second, but there is no direct logic in the code to handle this calculation accurately.
