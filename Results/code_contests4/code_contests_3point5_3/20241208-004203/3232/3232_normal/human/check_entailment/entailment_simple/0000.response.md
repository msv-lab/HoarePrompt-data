Correctness: **True**

The program reads the number of trains, departure, and arrival times for each train. It then calculates the number of trains at each time interval by incrementing and decrementing the count in the `dp` array based on the departure and arrival times. Finally, it finds the maximum value in the `dp` array, which represents the minimum number of vehicles required to operate the Yamanote Line.

The program follows the problem description accurately and provides the correct output based on the given input.
