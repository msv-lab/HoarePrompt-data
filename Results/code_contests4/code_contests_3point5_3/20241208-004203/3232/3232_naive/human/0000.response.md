Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly reads the input values, processes the train departure and arrival times, and calculates the minimum number of vehicles required to operate the Yamanote Line based on the given timetable. The implementation uses a dynamic programming approach to keep track of the number of trains at each time interval and then finds the maximum number of trains running simultaneously. The logic is sound and follows the problem description accurately. There are no apparent edge cases or scenarios where the program would fail to produce the correct output.
