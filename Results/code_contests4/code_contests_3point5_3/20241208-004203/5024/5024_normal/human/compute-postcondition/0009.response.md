Example Answer:
The key `val` is added to the dictionary `start_m` with the corresponding value `index`. The previous values of variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `start` still has elements to iterate over, `end` is a list containing integers, `start_m` has updated key-value pairs.
Output State: **`n` is an integer, `start` still has elements to iterate over, `end` is a list containing integers, `start_m` has updated key-value pairs**
