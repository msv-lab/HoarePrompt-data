Example Answer:
`end_m[val]` is assigned the value `index`. The value of `val` is the next element in the `end` list, and the value of `index` is the index of the next element in the `end` list. Therefore, after execution, the `end_m` dictionary will be updated with the key-value pair where the key is the value of `val` and the value is the value of `index`.
Output State: **`end_m` dictionary is updated with the new key-value pair where the key is the value of `val` and the value is the value of `index`**
