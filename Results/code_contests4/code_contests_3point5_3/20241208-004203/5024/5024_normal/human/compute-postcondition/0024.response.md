Output State: **`n` is an integer, `start` is a list containing integers, `end` is a list containing integers, `start_m` has at least one key-value pair, `end_m` is a dictionary with key-value pairs, `res` is initialized to 0, for the loop to execute the first time `v1` is the key, `i1` is the value of the first key-value pair in `start_m`, `i2` is the value corresponding to key `v1` in `end_m`, `n_moves` is the result of `i2 - i1`, and `n_moves` is less than 0, `n_moves` is assigned the value of `n - i1`.**
