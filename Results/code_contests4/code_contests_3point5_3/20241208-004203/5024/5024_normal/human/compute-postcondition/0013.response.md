Example Answer:
The value at position `val` is assigned `index` in the `end_m` dictionary. The value of `val` is the first element of the `end` list, and `index` is 0. Therefore, after execution, the `end_m` dictionary will have the key-value pair where the key is the first element of the `end` list and the value is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an integer, `start` is a list containing integers, `end` is a list containing integers with at least 1 element, `start_m` is a dictionary with key-value pairs, `end_m` is a dictionary with the first element of `end` list mapped to 0, `index` is 0, `val` is the first element of `end` list**
