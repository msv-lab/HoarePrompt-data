Example Answer:
`i2` is assigned the value of `end_m[v1]`, where `v1` is a key in the dictionary `end_m`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `start` is a list of integers, `end` is a list of integers, `start_m` has at least three key-value pairs, `end_m` is a dictionary with key-value pairs, if `n_moves` is less than 0, `res` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `n_moves` for the next iteration, and `i2` is assigned the value of `end_m[v1]`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer, `start` is a list of integers, `end` is a list of integers, `start_m` has at least three key-value pairs, `end_m` is a dictionary with key-value pairs, if `n_moves` is less than 0, `res` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `n_moves` for the next iteration, `i2` is assigned the value of `end_m[v1]`**
