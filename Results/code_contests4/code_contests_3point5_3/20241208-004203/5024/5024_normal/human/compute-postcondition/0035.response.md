Example Answer:
`n_moves` is assigned the value of `i2 - i1`, where `i2` is assigned the value of `end_m[v1]`. The value of `n_moves` is dependent on the values of `i2` and `i1`, which are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `start` is a list of integers, `end` is a list of integers, `start_m` has at least three key-value pairs, `end_m` is a dictionary with key-value pairs, if `n_moves` is less than 0, `res` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `n_moves` for the next iteration, `i2` is assigned the value of `end_m[v1`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer, `start` is a list of integers, `end` is a list of integers, `start_m` has at least three key-value pairs, `end_m` is a dictionary with key-value pairs, if `n_moves` is less than 0, `res` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `n_moves` for the next iteration, `i2` is assigned the value of `end_m[v1]`**
