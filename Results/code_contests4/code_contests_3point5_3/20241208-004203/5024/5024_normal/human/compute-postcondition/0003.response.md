Example Answer:
`start_m` is initialized as an empty dictionary. No other variables are affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5, `start` is a list containing integers parsed from the input read from stdin, `end` is a list containing integers parsed from the input read from stdin, `start_m` is an empty dictionary.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5, `start` is a list containing integers parsed from the input read from stdin, `end` is a list containing integers parsed from the input read from stdin, `start_m` is an empty dictionary**
