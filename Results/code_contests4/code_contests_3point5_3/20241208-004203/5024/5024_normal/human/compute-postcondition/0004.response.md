According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are elements in the `start` list. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the `start` list must not be empty. Additionally, the loop will start with the first element in the list.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5, `start` is a list containing integers parsed from the input read from stdin and is not empty, `end` is a list containing integers parsed from the input read from stdin, `start_m` is an empty dictionary, for the loop to execute the first time `index` is 0 and `val` is the first element in the `start` list**.
