According to the code, the loop can execute if the `end` list has at least 1 element. Before the loop starts, `end` is a list containing integers, so the loop can execute. For the loop to execute, the `index` needs to be 0 and `val` should be the first element in the `end` list.
State: **`n` is an integer, `start` is a list containing integers, `end` is a list containing integers with at least 1 element, `start_m` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are elements from the `start` list and the values are their corresponding indices, `end_m` is an empty dictionary, for the loop to execute the first time `index` is 0 and `val` is the first element in the `end` list**
