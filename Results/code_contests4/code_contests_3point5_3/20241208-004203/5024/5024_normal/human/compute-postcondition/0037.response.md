Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `start` is a list of integers, `end` is a list of integers, `start_m` has at least three key-value pairs, `end_m` is a dictionary with key-value pairs. If `n_moves` is less than 0, `res` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `n_moves` for the next iteration. `i2` is assigned the value of `end_m[v1]` and `n_moves` is the result of `n - i1`.***
