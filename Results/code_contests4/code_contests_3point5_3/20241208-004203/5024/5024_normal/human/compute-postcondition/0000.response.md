Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of an integer read from the standard input using `sys.stdin.readline()`. The value of `n` can vary between 1 and 2*10^5. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5**
