Example Answer:
A new key-value pair is added to the `end_m` dictionary where the key is the value of `val` and the value is the value of `index`. The loop will execute one more time as `end` dictionary should have at least one more key-value pair. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `end_m` dictionary is updated with the new key-value pair where the key is the value of `val` and the value is the value of `index`, and `end` dictionary has at least one more key-value pair.
Output State: **`end_m` dictionary is updated with the new key-value pair where the key is the value of `val` and the value is the value of `index`, and `end` dictionary has at least one more key-value pair**
