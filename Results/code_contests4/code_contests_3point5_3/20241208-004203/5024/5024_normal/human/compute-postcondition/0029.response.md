Output State: **`n` is an integer, `start` is a list containing integers, `end` is a list containing integers, `start_m` has at least two key-value pairs, `end_m` is a dictionary with key-value pairs, `res` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `n_moves`, for the loop to execute the next time `v1` is the next key, `i1` is the value of the next key-value pair in `start_m`, `i2` is the value corresponding to key `v2` in `end_m`, `n_moves` is the result of `i2 - i1`, `i2` is assigned the value corresponding to key `v1` in `end_m**
