Example Answer:
`res` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `n_moves`. The value of `res` and `n_moves` are not provided, so the output state is: `n` is an integer, `start` is a list of integers, `end` is a list of integers, `start_m` has at least two key-value pairs, `end_m` is a dictionary with key-value pairs. If `n_moves` is less than 0, `res` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `n_moves` for the next iteration.
Output State: **`n` is an integer, `start` is a list of integers, `end` is a list of integers, `start_m` has at least two key-value pairs, `end_m` is a dictionary with key-value pairs. If `n_moves` is less than 0, `res` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `n_moves` for the next iteration.**
