Example Answer:
The code snippet `print(res)` will output the value of the variable `res`, which is the maximum difference between corresponding values from `start_m` and `end_m`. The variables `n`, `start`, `end`, `start_m`, and `end_m` are not directly affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `start` is a list of integers, `end` is a list of integers, `start_m` has key-value pairs, `end_m` is a dictionary with key-value pairs, `res` is the maximum difference between corresponding values from `start_m` and `end_m`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer, `start` is a list of integers, `end` is a list of integers, `start_m` has key-value pairs, `end_m` is a dictionary with key-value pairs, `res` is the maximum difference between corresponding values from `start_m` and `end_m`**
