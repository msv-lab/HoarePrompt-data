The function `func` reads an integer `n` from standard input, followed by two lists of integers `start` and `end`. It then creates dictionaries `start_m` and `end_m` with key-value pairs of elements and their corresponding indices from the lists. The function calculates the maximum difference between the indices of corresponding elements in the two dictionaries and prints this maximum difference. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
