Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the algorithm described in the problem description. It reads the input, creates dictionaries with key-value pairs of elements and their corresponding indices, calculates the maximum difference between the indices of corresponding elements in the two dictionaries, and prints this maximum difference. This aligns with the requirements of the problem description, and the program is correct.
