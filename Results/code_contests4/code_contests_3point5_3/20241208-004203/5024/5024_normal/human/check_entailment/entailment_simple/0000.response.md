Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It calculates the minimum number of moves required to convert the first permutation to the second by iterating through the elements of the first permutation and checking the corresponding indices in the second permutation. It then computes the number of moves needed to place the element in the correct position and keeps track of the maximum number of moves needed. Finally, it prints the maximum number of moves which is the minimum number of moves required to convert the first permutation to the second. This logic is consistent with the problem description for all potential cases.
