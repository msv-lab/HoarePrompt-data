Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes in the input as described in the problem statement.
- It then creates dictionaries `start_m` and `end_m` with key-value pairs of elements and their corresponding indices from the lists.
- The code then iterates through the elements in `start_m` and calculates the number of moves required to convert the first permutation to the second permutation based on the indices in the dictionaries.
- It keeps track of the maximum number of moves required and prints this maximum difference as the output.
- The code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement for all potential cases.
- The output hints also agree with the code's functionality, confirming that the code is correct for all cases described in the problem statement.
