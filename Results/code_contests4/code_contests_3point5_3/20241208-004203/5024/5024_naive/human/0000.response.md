Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program correctly reads the input values of n, start permutation, and end permutation.
- It creates dictionaries to map values to their indexes in the start and end permutations.
- It iterates through the values in the start permutation and calculates the number of moves required to move the value to its correct position in the end permutation.
- The program then finds the maximum number of moves needed for any value to be moved to its correct position.
- Finally, it prints the maximum number of moves required, which is the minimum number of moves to convert the first permutation to the second.
- The logic of the program matches the problem description and the provided examples, making it correct.
