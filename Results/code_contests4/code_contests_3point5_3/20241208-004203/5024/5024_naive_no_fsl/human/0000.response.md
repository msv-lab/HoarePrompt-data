Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The given Python program correctly calculates the minimum number of moves required to convert the first permutation to the second as described in the problem statement. It uses dictionaries to store the positions of the numbers in the two permutations and then calculates the number of moves needed to convert the first permutation to the second. The program handles cases where the number needs to be moved to the beginning or inserted between two numbers correctly. The logic seems sound and covers all potential cases, so the program is correct.
