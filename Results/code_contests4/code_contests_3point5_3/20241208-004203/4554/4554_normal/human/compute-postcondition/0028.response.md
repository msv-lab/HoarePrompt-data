Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list containing `n` input integers, `i` is 0, `b` is a list containing even integers from `a` or the element at index `i` in `a`, `count` is the number of even integers in `a` plus 1 or the count is odd, the loop has executed at least once, and if the element at index `i` in `a` is an even number, then `b` contains the result of dividing that even number at index `i` in `a` by 2. After the if else block, if `a[i]` is not divisible by 2, `b` contains the element at index `i` in `a` and the count is odd. If `a[i]` is divisible by 2, `b` contains the result of dividing `a[i]` by 2 plus 1, and the count is even.***
