Example Answer:
The list `b` is initialized as an empty list. The values of `n`, `a`, and `i` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list containing `n` input integers, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `b` is an empty list.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list containing `n` input integers, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `b` is an empty list**
