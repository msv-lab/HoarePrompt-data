Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list containing `n` input integers, `i` is 1, `b` contains even integers from `a` or the element at index `i` in `a`, `count` is the number of even integers in `a` plus 2 or the count is even after the execution of the if statement. If count % 2 == 0, `b` is appended with the element at index `i` in `a`. If count % 2 == 1, the value at index `i` in list `a` is halved.***
