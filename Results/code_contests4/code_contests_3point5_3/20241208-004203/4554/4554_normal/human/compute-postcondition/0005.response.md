According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `a` contains the input integer `x`, `i` is 0. So for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must remain greater than 0, `a` must still contain the input integer `x`, and `i` must be increased by 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` contains the input integer `x`, `i` is 1**
