According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `a` contains the input integer `x`, `i` is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1 and `n` should remain greater than the new value of `i`.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` contains the input integer `x`, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
