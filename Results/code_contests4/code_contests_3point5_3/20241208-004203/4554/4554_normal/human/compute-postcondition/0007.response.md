Example Answer: 
The integer `x` is appended to the list `a`, so after execution, `a` will contain the input integer `x`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `a` contains the input integer `x`, `i` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` contains the input integer `x`, `i` is 1**
