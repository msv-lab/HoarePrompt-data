Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list containing `n` input integers with the value at index 2 halved, `i` is 2, `b` contains even integers from `a` or the element at index `i` in `a` divided by 2, and the count is the number of even integers in `a` plus 3 if the value at index 2 is even. If count % 2 == 1, the count is incremented by 1.***
