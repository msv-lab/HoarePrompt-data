Example Answer:
The value of `x` is appended to the list `a`. The value of `x` is obtained from the input, so it can be any integer. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `a` contains the input integer `x`, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2, `x` is assigned the value of `int(input())`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` contains the input integer `x`, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2, `x` is assigned the value of `int(input())`**
