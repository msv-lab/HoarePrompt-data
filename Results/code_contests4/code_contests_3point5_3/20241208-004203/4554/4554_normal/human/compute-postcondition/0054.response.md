Functionality: **The function takes user input for the number of elements, then prompts the user to input integers which are stored in a list. It iterates over the list elements, performs specific operations based on whether the element is divisible by 2 or not, and modifies the elements accordingly. The final list `b` contains elements that meet the specified conditions. Finally, it prints list `b`. The function does not accept any parameters and performs input/output operations based on the user's inputs.**
