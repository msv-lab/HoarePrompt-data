Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list containing `n` input integers with the value at index 2 halved and modified by adding 1, `i` is 2, `b` contains even integers from `a` or the element at index `i` in `a` divided by 2, `count` is the number of even integers in `a` plus 3 if the value at index 2 is even and incremented by 1 if count % 2 == 1, `b` appends the element at index 2 of list `a`**
