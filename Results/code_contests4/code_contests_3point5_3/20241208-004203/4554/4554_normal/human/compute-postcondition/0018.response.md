Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list containing `n` input integers, `i` is 0, `b` is a list containing even integers from `a`, `count` is the number of even integers in `a`, the loop has executed at least once, and if the element at index `i` in `a` is an even number, then `b` contains the result of dividing that even number at index `i` in `a` by 2. The element at index `i` in `a` is not an even number***
