Example Answer: 
`count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is the number of even integers in `a` plus 1 or the count is odd after the execution of the if statement. Therefore, after execution, the count will be increased by 1. 
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list containing `n` input integers, `i` is 1, `b` contains even integers from `a` or the element at index `i` in `a`, `count` is the number of even integers in `a` plus 2 or the count is even after the execution of the if statement.**
