According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `a` is an empty list does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is an empty list, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
