Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous value of `x` is unknown, so after execution, `x` contains the input integer. The values of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `a` contains the input integer `x`, `i` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` contains the input integer `x`, `i` is 1**
