Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code divides the input rating changes by 2, but it does not ensure that the modified ratings are as close to half of the original ratings as possible. In the case where the original rating change is odd, the code alternates between rounding down and rounding up without ensuring that the sum of modified ratings is zero.

For example, if the input is:
```
3
10
-5
-5
```
The expected output should be:
```
5
-2
-3
```
But the code may output different values that do not satisfy the conditions.
