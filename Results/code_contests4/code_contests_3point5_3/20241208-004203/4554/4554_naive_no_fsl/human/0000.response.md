Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the program does not handle the case when the rating change `a[i]` is odd properly. The program tries to balance the sum by adding 1 to the division result when `a[i]` is odd, but this may not always result in a balanced sum of modified rating changes. 

For example, consider the input:
```
3
1
-1
0
```
The expected output should be:
```
1
-1
0
```
However, the program may output:
```
1.0
0.0
0
```
In this case, the sum of modified rating changes is not balanced.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle odd rating changes properly.
