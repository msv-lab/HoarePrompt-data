Postcondition: ***`s` is a raw input, `first` is calculated based on the first character of `s`, `last` is assigned the ASCII value of the last character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', for the loop to execute `j` is in the range 0 to 25. If `dyn[j][first]` is greater than 0, then `dyn[j][last]` is updated.***
