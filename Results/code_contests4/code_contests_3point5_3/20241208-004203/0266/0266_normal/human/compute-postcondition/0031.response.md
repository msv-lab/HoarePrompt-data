Output State: **`s` is a raw input, `first` is calculated based on the first character of `s`, `last` is calculated based on the last character of `s`, `dyn[j][first]` is greater than 0, `dyn[j][last]` is greater than 0, `j` is incremented by 1, `dyn[j][last]` is now equal to `dyn[j][first] + len(s)`**
