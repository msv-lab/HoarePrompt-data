Example Answer:
`dyn[j][last]` is assigned the value of `dyn[j][first] + len(s)`, where `first` and `last` are calculated based on the first and last characters of `s` respectively. It is given that the value of `dyn[j][first]` is greater than 0. Therefore, after execution, the value of `dyn[j][last]` will be greater than 0 as well.
Output State: **The value of `dyn[j][last]` is greater than 0**
