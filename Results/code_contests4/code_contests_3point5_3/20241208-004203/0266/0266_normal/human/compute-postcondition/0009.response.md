The value at `dyn[j][last]` is updated to be the sum of the previous value at `dyn[j][first]` and the length of string `s`. The previous values of the affected variables are: `Author` is 'Rikishi', `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `dyn` is a 26x26 matrix initialized to 0, `i` is 1, `s` is assigned the value of the raw input, `first` is assigned the difference between the ASCII value of the first character of `s` and the ASCII value of 'a', `last` is assigned the difference between the ASCII value of the last character of `s` and the ASCII value of 'a', for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 0, and the value at `dyn[j][first]` is greater than 0.

Output State: **`Author` is 'Rikishi', `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `dyn` is a 26x26 matrix initialized to 0, `i` is 1, `s` is assigned the value of the raw input, `first` is assigned the difference between the ASCII value of the first character of `s` and the ASCII value of 'a', `last` is assigned the difference between the ASCII value of the last character of `s` and the ASCII value of 'a', for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 0, and the value at `dyn[j][last]` is now updated to `dyn[j][first] + len(s)`**
