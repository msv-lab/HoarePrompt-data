According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` goes from 0 to 25 (inclusive). Before the loop starts, the variables that need to be adjusted are `j` to be 0.
State: **Author of the code is set to 'Rikishi', `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `dyn` is a 26x26 matrix initialized to 0, `i` is 1, `s` is assigned the value of the raw input, `first` is assigned the difference between the ASCII value of the first character of `s` and the ASCII value of 'a', `last` is assigned the difference between the ASCII value of the last character of `s` and the ASCII value of 'a', for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 0**
