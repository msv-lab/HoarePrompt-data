Example Answer:
`last` is assigned the value of the ASCII value of the last character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. The value of `s` is a raw input, and `first` is calculated based on the first character of `s`, which is not explicitly provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a raw input, `first` is calculated based on the first character of `s`, `last` is calculated based on the last character of `s`.
Output State: **`s` is a raw input, `first` is calculated based on the first character of `s`, `last` is calculated based on the last character of `s`**
