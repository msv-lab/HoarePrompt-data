Postcondition: ***The author of the code is 'Rikishi', `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `dyn` is a 26x26 matrix initialized to 0, `i` is 1, `s` is assigned the value of the raw input, `first` is assigned the difference between the ASCII value of the first character of `s` and the ASCII value of 'a', `last` is assigned the difference between the ASCII value of the last character of `s` and the ASCII value of 'a', for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 0. If `dyn[j][first]` is greater than 0, then the value at `dyn[j][last]` is updated to `dyn[j][first] + len(s)`***
