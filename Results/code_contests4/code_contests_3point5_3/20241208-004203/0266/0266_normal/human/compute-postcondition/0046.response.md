According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than 26, the loop can execute one more time. So at the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`s` is a raw input, `first` is calculated based on the first character of `s`, `last` is assigned the ASCII value of the last character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', `j` is 2**
