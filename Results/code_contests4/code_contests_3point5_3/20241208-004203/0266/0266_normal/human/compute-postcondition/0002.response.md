Example Answer:
A 26x26 matrix `dyn` is created where each element is initialized to 0. The previous values of the variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: Author of the code is set to 'Rikishi', `n` is an input integer, `dyn` is a 26x26 matrix initialized to 0.
Output State: **Author of the code is set to 'Rikishi', `n` is an input integer, `dyn` is a 26x26 matrix initialized to 0**
