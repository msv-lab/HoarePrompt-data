According to the code, the loop will execute for all values of `j` from 0 to 25. For the loop to execute, the only requirement is that `j` is within the range 0 to 25. 

State: **`s` is a raw input, `first` is calculated based on the first character of `s`, `last` is assigned the ASCII value of the last character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', for the loop to execute `j` is in the range 0 to 25**
