According to the code, the loop can execute another time based on the variable `j` ranging from 0 to 25. At the end of the previous iteration, the values are based on the input `s`, `first`, and `last`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`s` is a raw input, `first` is calculated based on the first character of `s`, `last` is calculated based on the last character of `s`, if `dyn[j][first]` is greater than 0, then the value of `dyn[j][last]` is also greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be incremented by 1**
