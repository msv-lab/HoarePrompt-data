According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and the values in `dyn[j][first]`. If `j` is less than 25 and `dyn[j][first]` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a raw input, `first` is calculated based on the first character of `s`, `last` is assigned the ASCII value of the last character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', `j` is in the range 0 to 25. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 and `dyn[j][first]` needs to be greater than 0.
State: **`s` is a raw input, `first` is calculated based on the first character of `s`, `last` is assigned the ASCII value of the last character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', `j` is 1, if `dyn[1][first]` is greater than 0, then `dyn[1][last]` is updated**
