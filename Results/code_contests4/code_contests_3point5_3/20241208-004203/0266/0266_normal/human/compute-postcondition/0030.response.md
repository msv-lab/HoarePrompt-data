According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `first`, `last`, and the condition `dyn[j][first] > 0`. If the condition is satisfied, `j` is incremented by 1.
At the end of the last iteration, `s`, `first`, `last`, and `dyn[j][first]`, `dyn[j][last]` satisfy the mentioned conditions. 
So for the loop to be executed one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`s` is a raw input, `first` is calculated based on the first character of `s`, `last` is calculated based on the last character of `s`, `dyn[j][first]` is greater than 0, then `dyn[j][last]` is also greater than 0, `j` is incremented by 1**
