Example Answer:
The value of `dyn[first][last]` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and the length of string `s`. If `dyn[j][first]` is greater than 0 for any `j` in the range 0 to 25, then `dyn[j][last]` is updated to `dyn[j][first]` plus the length of `s`. The initial states of `s`, `first`, `last`, and the elements of `dyn` are not specified, so the output state will be the updated values of `dyn[first][last]` based on the conditions mentioned.
Output State: **Updated values of `dyn[first][last]` based on the conditions mentioned**
