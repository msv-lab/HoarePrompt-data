Postcondition: ***`s` is a raw input, `first` is calculated based on the first character of `s`, `last` is assigned the ASCII value of the last character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', `j` is 1. If `dyn[1][first]` is greater than 0, then `dyn[1][last]` is updated according to a specific formula based on the values of `s`, `first`, `last`, and `j`.***
