Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The Author of the code is set to 'Rikishi'. Therefore, the Output State is: Author of the code is set to 'Rikishi', `n` is an input integer.
Output State: **Author of the code is set to 'Rikishi', `n` is an input integer**
