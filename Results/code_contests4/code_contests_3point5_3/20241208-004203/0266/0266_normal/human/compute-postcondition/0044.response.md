Example Answer:
The value of `dyn[j][last]` is updated to be the value of `dyn[j][first]` plus the length of the string `s`. The value of `j` is 1, `first` is calculated based on the first character of `s`, `last` is assigned the ASCII value of the last character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. If `dyn[1][first]` is greater than 0, then the value of `dyn[1][last]` is updated according to the mentioned formula. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a raw input, `first` is calculated based on the first character of `s`, `last` is assigned the ASCII value of the last character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', `j` is 1, if `dyn[1][first]` is greater than 0, then `dyn[1][last]` is updated according to the formula mentioned.
Output State: **`s` is a raw input, `first` is calculated based on the first character of `s`, `last` is assigned the ASCII value of the last character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', `j` is 1, if `dyn[1][first]` is greater than 0, then `dyn[1][last]` is updated according to the formula mentioned**
