Example Answer:
`dyn[j][last]` is assigned the value of `dyn[j][first] + len(s)`. The value of `dyn[j][first]` is greater than 0 and `len(s)` is the length of the string `s`. Therefore, `dyn[j][last]` will be updated based on these values. Other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`s` is a raw input, `first` is calculated based on the first character of `s`, `last` is assigned the ASCII value of the last character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', for the loop to execute `j` is in the range 0 to 25, and `dyn[j][last]` is updated**
