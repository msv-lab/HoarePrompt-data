Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the value stored in the variable `ans`, which holds the maximum value from the diagonal elements of the `dyn` matrix. The values of other variables are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` holds the maximum value from the diagonal elements of the `dyn` matrix.
Output State: **`ans` holds the maximum value from the diagonal elements of the `dyn` matrix**
