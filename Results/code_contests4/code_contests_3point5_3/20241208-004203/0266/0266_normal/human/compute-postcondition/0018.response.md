Example Answer:
The value of `dyn[first][last]` is updated to the maximum value between the current `dyn[first][last]` and the length of string `s`. The values of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: After all iterations of the loop have finished, if `dyn[j][first]` is greater than 0 for any `j`, then `dyn[j][last]` will be updated to `dyn[j][first] + len(s)` for each of those `j`.
Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, if `dyn[j][first]` is greater than 0 for any `j`, then `dyn[j][last]` will be updated to `dyn[j][first] + len(s)` for each of those `j`.**
