According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, if `dyn[j][first]` is greater than 0 for any `j`, then `dyn[j][last]` will be updated to `dyn[j][first] + len(s)` for each of those `j`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, you need to check if `dyn[j][first]` is greater than 0 for any `j` and update `dyn[j][last]` accordingly.
State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, if `dyn[j][first]` is greater than 0 for any `j`, then `dyn[j][last]` will be updated to `dyn[j][first] + len(s)` for each of those `j`.**
