Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the number of ways to place the benches in the city park based on the given problem description. It calculates the result using the formula n * (n - 4) * (n - 3) * (n - 2) * (n - 1) * func_1(n, 5), where func_1 calculates the factorial of the input number 'n'. The program iterates through the range of 'a' (which is 5 in this case) and computes the result using the given formula. The program covers all potential cases and provides the correct output for the given input.
