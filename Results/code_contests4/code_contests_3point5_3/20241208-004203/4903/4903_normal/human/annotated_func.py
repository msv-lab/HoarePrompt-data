#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 5 <= n <= 100.**
def func_1(n, a):
    r = 1
    s = 1
    p = n
    g = 1
    for i in range(a):
        r = r * p
        
        p -= 1
        
        s = s * g
        
        g += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 5 <= n <= 100; `r` is the product of all integers from `n` to 1; `s` is equal to 2^n; `p` is 1; `g` is n+1
    return r / s
    #The program returns the result of the division of the product of all integers from n to 1 by 2^n.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts two parameters, n and a. It calculates the division of the product of integers from n to 1 by 2^n and returns the result. The function initializes variables r, s, p, and g, then iterates a times to update the values of r, p, s, and g accordingly. After the loop, the function returns the division result of r by s. Overall, the function computes a specific mathematical operation based on the input parameters n and a.
