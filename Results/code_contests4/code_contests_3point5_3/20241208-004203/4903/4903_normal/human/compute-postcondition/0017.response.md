Example Answer: 
`s` is multiplied by `g`, so `s` becomes 64. The values of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 5 <= n <= 100, `r` is the updated product after multiplying by `n*(n-1)`, `s` is 64, `p` is 4, `g` is 3, `a` is equal to `n+2` for the loop to execute.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 5 <= n <= 100, `r` is the updated product after multiplying by `n*(n-1)`, `s` is 64, `p` is 4, `g` is 3, `a` is equal to `n+2` for the loop to execute**
