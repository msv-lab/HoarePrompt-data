According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If `i` is less than `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is equal to `n`, which means the loop executed at least once. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` needs to be greater than `i` after increasing `i` by 1.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 5 <= n <= 100; `r` is the product of `r` and `n`; `s` is 2; `p` is equal to `n-1`; `g` is 2; `a` is equal to `n+1` for the loop to execute; `s` is multiplied by `g`**
