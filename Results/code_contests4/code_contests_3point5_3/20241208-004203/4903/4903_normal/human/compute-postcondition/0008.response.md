Example Answer:
`g` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `g` is 1, so after execution, `g` becomes 2. The value of `s` is multiplied by `g`, where `s` is 1 and `g` is 2, so `s` becomes 2. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 5 <= n <= 100; `r` is the product of `r` and `n`; `s` is 2; `p` is equal to `n-1`; `g` is 2; `a` is equal to `n` for the loop to execute; `s` is multiplied by `g`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 5 <= n <= 100; `r` is the product of `r` and `n`; `s` is 2; `p` is equal to `n-1`; `g` is 2; `a` is equal to `n` for the loop to execute; `s` is multiplied by `g`**
