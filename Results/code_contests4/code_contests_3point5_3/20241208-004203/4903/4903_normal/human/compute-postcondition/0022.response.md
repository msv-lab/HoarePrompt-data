Functionality: **The function func_1 accepts two parameters, n and a. It calculates the division of the product of integers from n to 1 by 2^n and returns the result. The function initializes variables r, s, p, and g, then iterates a times to update the values of r, p, s, and g accordingly. After the loop, the function returns the division result of r by s. Overall, the function computes a specific mathematical operation based on the input parameters n and a.**
