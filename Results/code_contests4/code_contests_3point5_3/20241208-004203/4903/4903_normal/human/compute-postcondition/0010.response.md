Example Answer:
`r` is assigned the value of `r` multiplied by `p`, where `p` is equal to `n-1`. Given that `n` is between 5 and 100, the value of `r` is updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 5 <= n <= 100; `r` is the updated product after multiplying by `n-1`; `s` is 2; `p` is equal to `n-1`; `g` is 2; `a` is equal to `n+1` for the loop to execute; `s` is multiplied by `g`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 5 <= n <= 100; `r` is the updated product after multiplying by `n-1`; `s` is 2; `p` is equal to `n-1`; `g` is 2; `a` is equal to `n+1` for the loop to execute; `s` is multiplied by `g`**
