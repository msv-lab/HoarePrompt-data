Example Answer:
`p` is assigned the value of `n`, and `n` is between 5 and 100. Therefore, after execution, `p` will have the same value as `n`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 5 <= n <= 100; `r` is 1; `s` is 1; `p` is equal to `n`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 5 <= n <= 100; `r` is 1; `s` is 1; `p` is equal to `n`**
