Example Answer:
The value of `r` is multiplied by the value of `p`, which is `n-2`. The initial value of `r` is the updated product after multiplying by `n-1`, and the initial value of `p` is `n-2`. Therefore, after execution, the new value of `r` will be the updated product after multiplying by `n-1` multiplied by `n-2`. The values of `s`, `g`, and `a` remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 5 <= n <= 100, `r` is the updated product after multiplying by `n*(n-1)`, `s` is 8, `p` is equal to `n-2`, `g` is 3, `a` is equal to `n+2` for the loop to execute**
