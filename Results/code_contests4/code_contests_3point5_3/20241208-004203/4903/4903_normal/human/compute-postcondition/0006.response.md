Example Answer:
`p` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `p` is equal to `n`, so after execution, `p` will be `n-1`. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 5 <= n <= 100; `r` is the product of `r` and `n`; `s` is 1; `p` is equal to `n-1`; `g` is 1; `a` is equal to `n` for the loop to execute.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 5 <= n <= 100; `r` is the product of `r` and `n`; `s` is 1; `p` is equal to `n-1`; `g` is 1; `a` is equal to `n` for the loop to execute**
