According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If `i` is less than `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 5 <= n <= 100, `r` is the updated product after multiplying by `n-1`, `s` is 8, `p` is equal to `n-2`, `g` is 3, `a` is equal to `n+1` for the loop to execute, and `s` is multiplied by `g`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to determine the new values for the variables. Since `a` is equal to `n+1`, to execute the loop one more time, `a` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `a` should be `n+2`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 5 <= n <= 100, `r` is the updated product after multiplying by `n-1`, `s` is 8, `p` is equal to `n-2`, `g` is 3, `a` is equal to `n+2` for the loop to execute**
