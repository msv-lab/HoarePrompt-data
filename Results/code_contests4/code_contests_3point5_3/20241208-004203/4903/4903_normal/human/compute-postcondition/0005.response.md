Example Answer:
`r` is assigned the value of `r` multiplied by `p`, where `p` is equal to `n` which is between 5 and 100. Therefore, after execution, `r` will be equal to the product of `r` and `n`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 5 <= n <= 100; `r` is the product of `r` and `n`; `s` is 1; `p` is equal to `n`; `g` is 1; `a` is equal to `n` for the loop to execute**
