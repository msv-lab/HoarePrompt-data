The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `a`. Parameter `n` is an integer such that 5 <= n <= 100. The function calculates the result of the division of the product of all integers from `n` to 1 by 2 raised to the power of `n`. The result is then returned by the function. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` within the specified range and another integer `a`, calculate the division of the product of integers from `n` to 1 by 2^n, and return the result. 
Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters n and a. It calculates the division of the product of integers from n to 1 by 2^n and returns the result.**
