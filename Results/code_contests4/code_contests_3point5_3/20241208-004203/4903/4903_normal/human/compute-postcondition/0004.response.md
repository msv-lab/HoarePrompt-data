According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. In this case, `a` is not explicitly defined in the provided state before the loop starts. Therefore, in order for the loop to execute, `a` must be a valid value that satisfies the range condition for the `range()` function. Since `a` is not provided in the initial state, we need to define it based on the existing variables.

To ensure the loop can execute, we can set `a` to be equal to `n` since `p` is already equal to `n`. Therefore, to adjust the state for the loop to execute, we need to specify that `a` is equal to `n`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 5 <= n <= 100; `r` is 1; `s` is 1; `p` is equal to `n`; `g` is 1; `a` is equal to `n` for the loop to execute**
