Example Answer:
The value of `p` is decremented by 1. If `n` was 5, then `p` becomes 4. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 5 <= n <= 100, `r` is the updated product after multiplying by `n*(n-1)`, `s` is 8, `p` is 4, `g` is 3, `a` is equal to `n+2` for the loop to execute.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 5 <= n <= 100, `r` is the updated product after multiplying by `n*(n-1)`, `s` is 8, `p` is 4, `g` is 3, `a` is equal to `n+2` for the loop to execute**
