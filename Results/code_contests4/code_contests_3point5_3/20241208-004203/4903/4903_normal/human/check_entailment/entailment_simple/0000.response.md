Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the number of ways to place the benches in the city park as described in the problem description. It computes the product of all integers from n to 1 and then divides it by 2^n, which corresponds to the number of ways to place the benches. Therefore, the program follows the problem description and is correct for all potential cases.
