Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` is called before it is defined, which will result in a NameError. This means that the code will not run as intended and will not provide the correct output. The output hints do not mention this issue, but it is a critical flaw in the code that prevents it from working correctly.
