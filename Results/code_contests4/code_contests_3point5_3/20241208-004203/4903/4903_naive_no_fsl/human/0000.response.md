Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the number of ways to place the benches in the city park based on the given problem description. It follows the logic of calculating the permutation of paths and multiplying it by the result of the `func_1` function, which computes the factorial division. The program handles the input within the specified range and provides the expected output for all possible cases within the constraints. Hence, the program is correct.
