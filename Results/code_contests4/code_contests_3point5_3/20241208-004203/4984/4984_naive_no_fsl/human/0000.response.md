Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem description. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the case when the "very beautiful number" does not exist. 

In the case where the input is `1 2`, the output should be "Impossible" according to the problem description. However, the program does not output "Impossible" for this input, instead, it tries to find a number which violates the requirements. This means the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, making it incorrect.
