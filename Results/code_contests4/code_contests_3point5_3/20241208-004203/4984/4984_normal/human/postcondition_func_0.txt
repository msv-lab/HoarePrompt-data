The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `p` and `x`, iterates over a range, calculates remainders, and updates a list of remainders 'r'. It then sorts the list and returns the first non-zero element in 'r'. The code does not implement cases mentioned in the annotations such as returning the list of remainders 'r', returning the updated list of remainders `r` after iterations, or returning the updated list of remainders 'r' after all iterations.
