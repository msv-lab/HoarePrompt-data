According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `p`. If `j` is less than `p`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `p`, `x`, `c`, `a` remain the same, `s` and `b` are updated based on the formula, `j` is increased by 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`p`, `x`, `c`, `a` remain the same, `s` and `b` are updated based on the formula, `j` is increased by 2 for the loop to execute the next time**
