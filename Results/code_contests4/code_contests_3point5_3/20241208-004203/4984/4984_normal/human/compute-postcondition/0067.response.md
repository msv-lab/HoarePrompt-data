Output State: **`p`, `x` are positive integers between 1 and 9, `c` is a non-empty list of remainders joined as a string sorted in ascending order, `s` is the final result of the division after all iterations, `a` is a list of remainders in reversed order, `b` is equal to `i`, and the loop returns the first non-zero element in the updated list of remainders 'r' after all iterations.**
