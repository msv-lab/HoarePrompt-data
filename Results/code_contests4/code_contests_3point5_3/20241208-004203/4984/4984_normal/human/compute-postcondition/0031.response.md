The variables `s` and `b` are updated based on the formula `s, b = divmod(b * x + s, 10)`. The value of `b` is multiplied by `x`, added to `s`, and then divided by 10 to get the quotient as `s` and remainder as `b`. Since `p` was not mentioned to be updated, it remains the same. The states of `p`, `x`, `c`, `a`, and `j` are not affected. 

Output State: **`p`, `x` are positive integers between 1 and 9, `c` contains the remainders calculated in each iteration of the loop joined as a string, `s` and `b` are updated, `a` contains the previous value of `b` and the appended value of `b`, `j` is 2**.
