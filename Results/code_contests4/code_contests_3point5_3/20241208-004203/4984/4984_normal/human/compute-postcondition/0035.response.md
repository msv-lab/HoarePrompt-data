Example Answer:
The list `c` is appended with a string obtained by joining the elements of list `a` after converting them to strings. Since `a` is reversed, the string will contain the elements of `a` in reverse order. The other variables remain the same.
Output State: **`p`, `x`, `c`, `s`, `a`, `b`, `j` remain the same, `a` is reversed, and `c` contains the reversed elements of `a` joined into a string.**
