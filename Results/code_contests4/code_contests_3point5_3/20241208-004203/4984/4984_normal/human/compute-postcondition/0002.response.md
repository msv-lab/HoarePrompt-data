Example Answer:
`func_1(42, 5)` returns a value, which is then multiplied by `p / 42`. As `p` is divisible by 42, the result of the division is an integer. Therefore, the output state is: `p` and `x` are positive integers such that 1 <= p <= 10^6 and 1 <= x <= 9. Additionally, x is 5 and p is divisible by 42, and a value is returned after the calculation.
Output State: **`p` and `x` are positive integers such that 1 <= p <= 10^6 and 1 <= x <= 9. Additionally, x is 5 and p is divisible by 42, and a value is returned after the calculation**
