The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `p` and `x`, which are positive integers such that 1 ≤ p ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ x ≤ 9. The function has multiple return cases based on different scenarios:

Case_1: The program returns the list of remainders 'r' after some iterations.

Case_2: The program returns the updated list of remainders `r` after the iterations based on the current state of `r`.

Case_3: The program returns the updated list of remainders 'r' after the iterations.

Case_4: The program returns the first non-zero element in the updated list of remainders 'r' after all iterations.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `p` and `x`, perform iterations to update a list of remainders 'r', and return different results based on the specified cases.
