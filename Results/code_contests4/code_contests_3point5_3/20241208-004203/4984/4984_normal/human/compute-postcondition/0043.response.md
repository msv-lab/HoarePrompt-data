Example Answer:
`s` and `b` are updated based on the formula `s, b = divmod(b * x + s, 10)`. The new value of `s` is calculated by multiplying the previous value of `b` with `x`, adding it to the previous value of `s`, and then dividing the result by 10. The new value of `b` is the remainder of this division. Therefore, the Output State is: `p`, `x`, `c`, `s`, `b`, `j` remain the same, `a` contains the value of `b`, `s` and `b` are updated based on the formula.
Output State: **`p`, `x`, `c`, `s`, `b`, `j` remain the same, `a` contains the value of `b`, `s` and `b` are updated based on the formula**
