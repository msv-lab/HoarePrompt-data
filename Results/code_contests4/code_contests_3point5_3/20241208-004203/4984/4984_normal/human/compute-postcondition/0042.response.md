Example Answer:
`b` is appended to the list `a`, which is initially empty. So after execution, `a` will contain the value of `b`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `p`, `x`, `c`, `s`, `b`, `j` remain the same, `a` contains the value of `b`.
Output State: **`p`, `x`, `c`, `s`, `b`, `j` remain the same, `a` contains the value of `b`**
