Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads two positive integers `p` and `x` as input. If `x` is equal to 5 and `p` is divisible by 42, it calls another function `func_1` and calculates a value based on the result. If these conditions are not met, it iterates through a loop and calculates a value based on the return value of `func_1` for different inputs. If the division of `p` by the length of the returned value is not zero, it prints the calculated value. Otherwise, it prints 'Impossible'. Therefore, the functionality involves conditionally calculating values based on input integers `p` and `x`, and printing the results or 'Impossible' accordingly. **
