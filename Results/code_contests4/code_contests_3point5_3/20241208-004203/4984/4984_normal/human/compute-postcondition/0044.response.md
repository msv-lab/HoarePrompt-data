According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `p`. If `j` is less than `p`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `p`, `x`, `c`, `s`, `b`, `j` remain the same, `a` contains the value of `b`, `s` and `b` are updated based on the formula. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1.
