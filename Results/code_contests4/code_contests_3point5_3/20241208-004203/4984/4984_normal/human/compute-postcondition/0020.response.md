Example Answer:
The function `func_1` is called with arguments `i` and `x`, and the return value is stored in variable `s`. The values of `i` and `x` are unknown, so the result of the function call cannot be determined. The program will print something if the variable `p` divided by `l` does not have a remainder of 0. Therefore, the Output State is: The program will print something if the variable `p` divided by `l` does not have a remainder of 0.
Output State: **The program will print something if the variable `p` divided by `l` does not have a remainder of 0**
