Example Answer:
`p` and `x` are assigned values using `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which takes an input and splits it by spaces, then converts each part to an integer. Since the input is not given, we cannot determine the specific values of `p` and `x`. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` and `x` are positive integers such that 1 <= p <= 10^6 and 1 <= x <= 9.
Output State: **`p` and `x` are positive integers such that 1 <= p <= 10^6 and 1 <= x <= 9**
