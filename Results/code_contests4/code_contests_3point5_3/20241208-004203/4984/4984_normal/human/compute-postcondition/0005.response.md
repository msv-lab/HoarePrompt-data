According to the code, the loop will always execute as the range is specified from 1 to 999, which is always true. Therefore, there is no need to adjust the state before the loop starts.
State: **`p` and `x` are positive integers such that 1 <= p <= 10^6 and 1 <= x <= 9. Either x is not equal to 5 or p is not divisible by 42**
