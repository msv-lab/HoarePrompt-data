Example Answer:
The list `a` is reversed, meaning the order of its elements is flipped. The variables `p`, `x`, `c`, `s`, `b`, and `j` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: p, x, c, a remain the same, s contains the final value after all iterations of the loop, b contains the final value after all iterations of the loop, j is equal to p after all iterations. Additionally, b is equal to i and s is equal to 0.
Output State: **p, x, c, a remain the same, s contains the final value after all iterations of the loop, b contains the final value after all iterations of the loop, j is equal to p after all iterations. Additionally, b is equal to i and s is equal to 0**
