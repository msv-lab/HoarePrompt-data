Example Answer:
The value of `s` is assigned the return value of `func_1(i, x)`. The states of other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: The program does not print anything if the variable `p` divided by `l` has a remainder of 0.
Output State: **The program does not print anything if the variable `p` divided by `l` has a remainder of 0**
