According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `c`, which is a list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Additionally, the conditions `b` is equal to `i` and `s` is equal to 0 need to be satisfied for the program to update the values of `c`, `s`, and `a`. 

Therefore, before the loop starts, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`p` is a positive integer between 1 and 9, `x` is a positive integer between 1 and 9, `c` is a non-empty list of remainders joined as a string sorted in ascending order, `s` is the final result of the division after all iterations, `a` is a list of remainders in reversed order, `b` is equal to `i`, `s` is equal to 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
