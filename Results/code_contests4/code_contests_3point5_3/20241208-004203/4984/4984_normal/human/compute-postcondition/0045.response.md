Example Answer:
`b` is appended to the list `a`, and since `a` contains the value of `b`, the value of `b` is added to the list `a` again. Therefore, the list `a` will have two instances of the value of `b` after execution. The value of `j` must be increased by 1 to allow the loop to execute one more time. The states of the other variables remain the same. 
Output State: **`p`, `x`, `c`, `s`, `b`, `j` remain the same, `a` contains two instances of the value of `b`, `s` and `b` are updated based on the formula, `j` is increased by 1**
