The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It internally uses two variables `p` and `x`, where `p` is a positive integer such that 1 <= p <= 10^6 and `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= 9. 

Case_1: If `p` is a positive integer divisible by 42 and `x` is 5, the program will return a calculated value based on these conditions.

Case_2: If `p` divided by `l` (where `l` is not specified in the constraints) does not have a remainder of 0, the program will print something to the standard output. If `p` divided by `l` does have a remainder of 0, 'Impossible' will be printed to the standard output.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to internally handle the conditions specified for `p` and `x`, and based on those conditions, either return a calculated value or print a message to the standard output.
