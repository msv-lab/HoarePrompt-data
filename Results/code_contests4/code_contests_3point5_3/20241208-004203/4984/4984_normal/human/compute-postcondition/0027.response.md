Example Answer:
The value of `b` is appended to the list `a`. The state of `a` is updated to include the previous value of `b`, and the value of `b` is not changed. Therefore, the Output State is: `p`, `x` are positive integers between 1 and 9, `c` contains the remainders calculated in each iteration of the loop joined as a string, `s` is updated, `a` contains the previous value of `b`, `b` is updated, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `p` must be greater than 0.
Output State: **`p`, `x` are positive integers between 1 and 9, `c` contains the remainders calculated in each iteration of the loop joined as a string, `s` is updated, `a` contains the previous value of `b`, `b` is updated, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `p` must be greater than 0**
