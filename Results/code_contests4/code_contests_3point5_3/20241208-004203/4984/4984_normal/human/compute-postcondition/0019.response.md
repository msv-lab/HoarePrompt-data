According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `p` and `l`. If `p` divided by `l` has a remainder of 0, the loop will not execute. At the end of the last iteration, the program does not print anything if the variable `p` divided by `l` has a remainder of 0. So for the loop to execute one more time, the condition `p` divided by `l` having a remainder of 0 must be false.
State: **The program will print something if the variable `p` divided by `l` does not have a remainder of 0**
