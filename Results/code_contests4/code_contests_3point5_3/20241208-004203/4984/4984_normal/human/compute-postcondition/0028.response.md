Example Answer:
The value of `b` is multiplied by `x` and added to `s`, then the result is divided by 10, and the quotient is assigned to `s` while the remainder is assigned to `b`. The previous values of `b` and `s` are known, so we can calculate the new values. After execution, `s` is updated, and `b` is updated according to the given formula. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `p`, `x` are positive integers between 1 and 9, `c` contains the remainders calculated in each iteration of the loop joined as a string, `s` is updated, `a` contains the previous value of `b`, `b` is updated, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `p` must be greater than 0.
