Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not fully adhere to the problem description for all potential cases. The program fails to handle the case when the "very beautiful number" does not exist, and it should output "Impossible". The function `func_1` does not have a condition to handle this case, and the `func_2` function only prints 'Impossible' if the division of `p` by the length of the returned value is not zero. This means that if the very beautiful number does not exist, the program will not correctly output "Impossible" as required by the problem description.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not cover all potential cases stated in the problem description.
