Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. It calculates the "very beautiful number" by iterating through all possible remainders and finding the first one that satisfies the conditions specified. The program ensures that the number is strictly positive, does not contain leading zeroes, and has the length of exactly p decimal digits. It also checks if moving the last digit to the beginning results in the number growing exactly x times.

The program handles the case where such a number does not exist by outputting "Impossible" as required. It also considers edge cases such as when p is divisible by 42 and x equals 5.

Overall, the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and correctly outputs the "very beautiful number" or "Impossible" based on the inputs.
