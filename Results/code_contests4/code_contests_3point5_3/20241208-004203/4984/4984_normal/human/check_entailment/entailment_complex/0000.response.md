Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The code defines two functions `func_1` and `func_2` which follow the problem description by taking input integers `p` and `x`, performing calculations, and returning the expected output.
2. `func_1` iterates through a range of values, calculates remainders, updates a list of remainders, and returns the first non-zero element in the list. This aligns with the requirement to find the "very beautiful number" with specific conditions.
3. `func_2` reads input integers `p` and `x`, calls `func_1` based on certain conditions, and prints the result or 'Impossible' as specified in the problem description.

Overall, the code logic follows the problem description for every potential case, and the provided annotations also align with the code's functionality.
