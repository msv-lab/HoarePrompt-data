Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program defines two functions `func_1` and `func_2` to find the "very beautiful number" based on the input parameters p and x. The program iterates through all numbers from 1 to 9 and checks if a number satisfies the condition of being a "very beautiful number" based on the given criteria. It then sorts the valid numbers and returns the minimal one without leading zeroes.

The program handles the case where x is 5 and p is a multiple of 42 separately, as the solution for this case is known. For all other cases, it iterates through numbers from 1 to 1000 and finds the "very beautiful number" that satisfies the given criteria. It then prints the minimal number without leading zeroes.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and provides the correct output for all potential cases.
