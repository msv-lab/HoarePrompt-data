Postcondition: ***`s` is a string with a length of at least 2, `j` is 1, `i` is 1 for the loop to execute the second time. If the condition i + 4 * j < len(s) and s[i] == s[i + j] == s[i + 2 * j] == s[i + 3 * j] == s[i + 4 * j] == '*', then the function returns True. Otherwise, no changes occur in the program state.***
