Postcondition: ***`s` has a length of at least 2, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0. The condition (i + 4 * j < len(s) and s[i] == s[i + j] == s[i + 2 * j] == s[i + 3 * j] == s[i + 4 * j] == '*') is false, meaning at least one of the following is true: i + 4 * j >= len(s) or s[i] != '*' or s[i + j] != '*' or s[i + 2 * j] != '*' or s[i + 3 * j] != '*' or s[i + 4 * j] != '*'***
