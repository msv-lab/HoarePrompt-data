Postcondition: ***`s` is a string with a length of at least 5, `j` is 2, there exists at least one `i` such that the condition (i + 4 * j < len(s) and s[i] == s[i + j] == s[i + 2 * j] == s[i + 3 * j] == s[i + 4 * j] == '*') is true. The condition (i + 4 * j >= len(s) or s[i] != s[i + j] or s[i + j] != s[i + 2 * j] or s[i + 2 * j] != s[i + 3 * j] or s[i + 3 * j] != s[i + 4 * j] or s[i + 4 * j] != '*') is also true***
