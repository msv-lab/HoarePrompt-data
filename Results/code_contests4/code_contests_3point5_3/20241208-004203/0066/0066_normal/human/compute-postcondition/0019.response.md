Postcondition: ***`s` is a string with a length of at least 5, `i`, `j` are integers. If the conditions related to `i` and `j` are satisfied such that `i + 4 * j` is less than the length of `s` and `s[i] == s[i + j] == s[i + 2 * j] == s[i + 3 * j] == s[i + 4 * j] == '*'`, then the program returns True.***
