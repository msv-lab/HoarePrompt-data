According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the length of `s` is at least 1. Since `s` has a length of at least 2, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `j` is 1 indicates that the loop can execute. Therefore, the adjustment needed is for `i` to be 0 at the start of the loop.
State: **`s` has a length of at least 2, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0**
