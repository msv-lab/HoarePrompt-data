According to the code, for the loop to execute again, the conditions i + 4 * j < len(s) and s[i] == s[i + j] == s[i + 2 * j] == s[i + 3 * j] == s[i + 4 * j] == '*' must be satisfied. 
At the end of the last iteration, the loop has executed for a certain i and j such that these conditions were met. 
To execute the loop one more time, the new states should be such that these conditions are still satisfied, meaning i + 4 * j < len(s) and s[i] == s[i + j] == s[i + 2 * j] == s[i + 3 * j] == s[i + 4 * j] == '*'.

State: **For the loop to execute one more time, i and j must be such that i + 4 * j < len(s) and s[i] == s[i + j] == s[i + 2 * j] == s[i + 3 * j] == s[i + 4 * j] == '*'**
