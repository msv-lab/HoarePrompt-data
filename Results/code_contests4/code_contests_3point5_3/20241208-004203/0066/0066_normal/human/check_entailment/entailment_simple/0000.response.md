Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly check for a sequence of five platforms with equal intervals between them. The condition `if i + 4 * j < len(s) and s[i] == s[i + j] == s[i + 2 * j] == s[i + 3 * j] == s[i + 4 * j] == '*':` only checks for four platforms in a sequence with the same interval, but the problem description requires checking for five platforms. Additionally, the inner loop should start from `i+1` instead of `0` to avoid unnecessary comparisons.

Therefore, the program does not always do what the problem description asks for, as it does not correctly check for a sequence of five platforms with equal intervals between them.
