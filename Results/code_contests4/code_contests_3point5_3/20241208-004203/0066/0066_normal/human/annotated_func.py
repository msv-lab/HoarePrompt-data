#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_1(s):
    for j in xrange(1, len(s)):
        for i in xrange(len(s)):
            if i + 4 * j < len(s) and s[i] == s[i + j] == s[i + 2 * j] == s[i + 3 * j
                ] == s[i + 4 * j] == '*':
                return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If there exists a sequence in string `s` that satisfies the conditions related to `i` and `j`, the function returns True. Otherwise, the function does not return True.
    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string. It iterates through the string based on two nested loops with variables `i` and `j`. If there exists a sequence in string `s` such that `i + 4 * j < len(s)` and `s[i] == s[i + j] == s[i + 2 * j] == s[i + 3 * j] == s[i + 4 * j] == '*'`, the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False. The function does not return True for all the cases mentioned in the annotations; it only returns True if the specific sequence condition is met.
