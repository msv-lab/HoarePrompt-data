Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic to check if there exists a sequence of five platforms where the intervals between consecutive platforms are of the same length. The nested loops iterate through the string `s` and check if there is a sequence of '*' characters that satisfy the condition. If such a sequence is found, the function returns True, otherwise it returns False. The program then prints 'yes' if the function returns True, and 'no' otherwise. The program covers all potential cases and works as expected based on the problem description.
