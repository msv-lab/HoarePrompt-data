Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly handle the case when the minutes of the midpoint are less than 10, as it does not add a leading zero in such cases. For example, if the midpoint is 5 minutes past 11, the output should be "11:05" but the program will output "11:5" which is incorrect.
