Example Answer:
`c` is assigned the value of `a[0] * 60 + a[1]`. The previous values of `a[0]` and `a[1]` are unknown, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `c`. Therefore, the Output State is: `h_1`, `m_1`, `h_2`, and `m_2` are integers such that 0 ≤ `h_1`, `h_2` ≤ 23, 0 ≤ `m_1`, `m_2` ≤ 59, and `m_1 % 2 = m_2 % 2`.
Output State: **`h_1`, `m_1`, `h_2`, and `m_2` are integers such that 0 ≤ `h_1`, `h_2` ≤ 23, 0 ≤ `m_1`, `m_2` ≤ 59, and `m_1 % 2 = m_2 % 2**.
