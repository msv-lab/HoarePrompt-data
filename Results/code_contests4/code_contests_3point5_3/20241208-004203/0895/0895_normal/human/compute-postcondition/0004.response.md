Example Answer:
The value of `c` is halved by dividing it by 2. The previous value of `c` is `a[0] * 60 + a[1]`, where `a` is obtained from the input string. Therefore, after execution, `c` becomes `(a[0] * 60 + a[1]) / 2`. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`h_1`, `m_1`, `h_2`, `m_2` are integers such that 0 ≤ `h_1`, `h_2` ≤ 23, 0 ≤ `m_1`, `m_2` ≤ 59, and `m_1 % 2 = m_2 % 2; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input string separated by ':', `c` is increased by a[0] * 60 + a[1] / 2**
