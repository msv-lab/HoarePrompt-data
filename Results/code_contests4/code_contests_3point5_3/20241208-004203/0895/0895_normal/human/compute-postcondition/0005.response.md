Example Answer:
`c` is increased by `a[0] * 60 + a[1] / 2`, where `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input string separated by ':'. Therefore, the value of `c` is updated based on the input values in `a`. Then, `d` is assigned the result of applying the `map` function to convert the result of `divmod(c, 60)` to strings. The `divmod` function returns a tuple of the quotient and remainder when `c` is divided by 60. The `map` function is used to convert these values to strings. Therefore, the Output State is: `h_1`, `m_1`, `h_2`, `m_2` are integers, `m_1 % 2 = m_2 % 2; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input string separated by ':', `c` is increased by a[0] * 60 + a[1] / 2, `d` is a list of strings obtained by applying `map` to the result of `divmod(c, 60)`.
Output State: **`h_1`, `m_1`, `h_2`, `m_2` are integers, `m_1 % 2 = m_2 % 2; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input string separated by ':', `c` is increased by a[0] * 60 + a[1] / 2, `d` is a list of strings obtained by applying `map` to the result of `divmod(c, 60)`**
