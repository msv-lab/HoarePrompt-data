Example Answer:
The value of `c` is incremented by the multiplication of the first element of list `a` with 60 and adding the second element of list `a`. The previous values of variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `h_1`, `m_1`, `h_2`, `m_2` are integers such that 0 ≤ `h_1`, `h_2` ≤ 23, 0 ≤ `m_1`, `m_2` ≤ 59, and `m_1 % 2 = m_2 % 2; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input string separated by ':', `c` is increased by a[0] * 60 + a[1].
Output State: **`h_1`, `m_1`, `h_2`, `m_2` are integers such that 0 ≤ `h_1`, `h_2` ≤ 23, 0 ≤ `m_1`, `m_2` ≤ 59, and `m_1 % 2 = m_2 % 2; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input string separated by ':', `c` is increased by a[0] * 60 + a[1]**
