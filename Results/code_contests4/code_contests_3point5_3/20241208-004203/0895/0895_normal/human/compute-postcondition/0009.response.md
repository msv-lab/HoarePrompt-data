Postcondition: ***`h_1`, `m_1`, `h_2`, `m_2` are integers where `m_1 % 2 = m_2 % 2;` `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input string separated by ':', `c` is increased by a[0] * 60 + a[1] / 2, `d` is a list of strings obtained by applying `map` to the result of `divmod(c, 60)`. If the length of the first element of `d` is 1, then `d[0]` will have a leading '0'. Additionally, after entering the if condition, the length of the second element of `d` will be 1.***
