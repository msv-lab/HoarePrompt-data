Example Answer:
The `map` function converts the input string to a list of integers separated by ':'. Since the input is in the format 'hh:mm', the values are split at ':'. The values are then assigned to variable `a`. The previous values of `h_1`, `h_2`, `m_1`, and `m_2` are not directly affected by this operation.
Output State: **`h_1`, `m_1`, `h_2`, `m_2` are integers such that 0 ≤ `h_1`, `h_2` ≤ 23, 0 ≤ `m_1`, `m_2` ≤ 59, and `m_1 % 2 = m_2 % 2; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input string separated by ':'**
