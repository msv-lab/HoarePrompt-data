Example Answer:
The code snippet `a = map(int, raw_input().split(':'))` takes input in the format of `h_1:m_1:h_2:m_2` and splits it at `:`. The `map(int, ...)` function converts the string inputs into integers and assigns them to a. Since the initial state has constraints on the values of h_1, m_1, h_2, and m_2, the values inputted will also follow those constraints. Therefore, after execution, the Output State is: h_1, m_1, h_2, and m_2 are integers such that 0 ≤ h_1, h_2 ≤ 23, 0 ≤ m_1, m_2 ≤ 59, and m_1 % 2 = m_2 % 2.
Output State: **h_1, m_1, h_2, and m_2 are integers such that 0 ≤ h_1, h_2 ≤ 23, 0 ≤ m_1, m_2 ≤ 59, and m_1 % 2 = m_2 % 2.**
