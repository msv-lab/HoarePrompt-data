Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code reads two times in the format 'hh:mm' from the user input, calculates the average time between them, and ensures the resulting minutes are always represented with leading zeros. The code correctly computes the midpoint of the contest as per the problem description for all potential cases provided in the examples. The code also handles edge cases such as when the hours or minutes are single-digit numbers by adding leading zeros if necessary. The output hints also agree with the code's functionality.
