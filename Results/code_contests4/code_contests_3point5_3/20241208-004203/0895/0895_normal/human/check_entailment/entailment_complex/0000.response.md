Correctness: **True**

The program correctly reads two times in the format 'hh:mm' from the user input, calculates the average time between them, and ensures that the resulting minutes are always represented with leading zeros. It follows all the conditions specified in the problem description, such as the contest lasting an even number of minutes and being held during a single day. The program always outputs the correct midpoint time.
