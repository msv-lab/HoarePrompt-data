Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program follows the problem description accurately. It correctly processes the requests to activate or deactivate colliders, handles conflicts, and provides the appropriate responses. The program maintains a set of activated colliders for each prime factor to ensure that activated colliders are pairwise relatively prime. The logic for checking conflicts and responding accordingly is implemented correctly. The program processes the requests in the order they are received and prints the results as expected. Overall, the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description.
