Based on the problem description and the provided code, let's analyze the program for correctness.

Initial Assessment:
The program seems to follow the problem description closely. It handles requests to activate or deactivate colliders based on whether the numbers are relatively prime to each other. The program uses functions to calculate the divisors of a number and check for conflicts when activating colliders. It also keeps track of the activated colliders to prevent conflicts.

Output hints Analysis:
The output hints describe the functionality of the code, including handling conflicts, activating and deactivating colliders, and checking for relative primality. The hints seem to align with the code logic and provide insights into the expected behavior of the program.

Verdict:
Based on the initial assessment and the output hints, the program appears to be correct. The code covers all the cases described in the problem statement and provides the expected responses to each type of request. The code implements the required functionality to ensure the safety of collider activations and deactivations.

Correctness: **True**.
