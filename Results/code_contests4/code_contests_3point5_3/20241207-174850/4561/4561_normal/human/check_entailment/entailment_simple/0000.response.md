Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the functions as described in the problem description. `func_1` initializes a list `prim` where each index represents a collider number and stores the smallest prime factor of that number. This is used in `func_2` to find the prime factors of a given collider number. This ensures that the program can determine if activating colliders will cause conflicts based on whether the collider numbers are pairwise relatively prime.

The program handles both activating and deactivating colliders correctly by checking for conflicts with already activated colliders based on their prime factors. It follows the logic outlined in the problem description for each type of request.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
