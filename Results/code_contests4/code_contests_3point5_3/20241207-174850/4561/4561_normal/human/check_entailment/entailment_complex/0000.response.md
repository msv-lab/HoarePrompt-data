Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not fully adhere to the problem description. The `func_1` function seems to initialize a list `prim` with certain values, but it is not clear how this list is used in the context of the collider activation and deactivation. Additionally, the `func_2` function calculates the divisors of a given number `x`, but it is not obvious how this is relevant to the collider activation and deactivation logic.

The problem description requires handling requests to activate or deactivate colliders based on whether the numbers of the activated colliders are pairwise relatively prime to each other. However, the code does not have a clear implementation of this logic. The annotations provided do not match the requirements of the problem description, and it is not evident how the functions are related to the collider activation and deactivation process.

Therefore, without a clear implementation of the collider activation and deactivation logic based on pairwise relatively prime numbers, the code is incorrect.
