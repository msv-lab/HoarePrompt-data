Example Answer:
The list 'fac' is appended with the value of 'div'. The loop will continue to execute until 'x' is no longer divisible by 'div' and 'x' is greater than 1. The value of 'div' is assigned the value of prim[x]. Therefore, the Output State is: 'fac' contains the appended value of 'div', 'x' is updated based on the division operation until 'x' is no longer divisible by 'div', 'div' is assigned the value of prim[x].
Output State: **'fac' contains the appended value of 'div', 'x' is updated based on the division operation until 'x' is no longer divisible by 'div', 'div' is assigned the value of prim[x]**
