According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x` and `div`. If `x` is divisible by `div`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `x` is not divisible by the current `div`, so it needs to be adjusted to `x` is greater than 1. Additionally, `div` is assigned the value of `prim[x]`, so `div` needs to be updated based on the new value of `prim[x]`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`fac` contains the appended values of all divisors of the original `x`, `x` is updated based on the division operation until it is no longer divisible by any of the divisors, `div` is assigned the value of `prim[x]`, for the loop to execute again `x` is greater than 1, `div` is assigned the new value of `prim[x]`**
