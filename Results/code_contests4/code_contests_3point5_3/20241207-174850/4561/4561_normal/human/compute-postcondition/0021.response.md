According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is updated based on the division operation until it is no longer divisible by any of the divisors. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must still be greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`fac` contains the appended values of all divisors of the original `x`, `x` is updated based on the division operation until it is no longer divisible by any of the divisors, `div` is assigned the value of `prim[x]`, `x` is not divisible by the current `div`, for the loop to execute again `x` is greater than 1**
