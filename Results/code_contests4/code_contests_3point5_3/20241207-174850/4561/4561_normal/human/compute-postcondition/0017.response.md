Example Answer:
The value of `x` is updated by performing integer division with `div`. The value of `div` is assigned to `prim[x]`, which means `div` will change based on the value of `x`. For the loop to execute the next time, `x` must be divisible by the new value of `div`. 
Output State: **`fac` contains the appended value of `div`, `x` is updated based on the division operation until it is no longer divisible by `div`, `div` is assigned the value of `prim[x]`, for the loop to execute the next time `x` must be divisible by the new value of `div`**
