Example Answer:
`x` is updated by performing integer division with `div`, which results in the value of `x` changing. The previous value of `x` is not provided, so the final value of `x` after the operation is unknown. The value of `div` is then updated to `prim[x]`. For the loop to execute the first time, `x` must be divisible by `div`. 
Output State: **`fac` contains the appended value of `div`, `x` is updated based on the division operation until `x` is no longer divisible by `div`, `div` is assigned the value of `prim[x]`, for the loop to execute the first time `x` must be divisible by `div`.**
