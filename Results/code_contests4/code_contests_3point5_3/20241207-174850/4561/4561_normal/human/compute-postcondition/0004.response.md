According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x` and `div`. If `x % div == 0`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `fac` is a list containing `div`. To ensure the loop executes, `x` must be divisible by `div`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`fac` is a list containing `div`, for the loop to execute the first time `x` must be divisible by `div`**
