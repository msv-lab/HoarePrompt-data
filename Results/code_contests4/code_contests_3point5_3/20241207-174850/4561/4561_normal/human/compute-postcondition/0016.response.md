According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `x` and `div`. If `x` is divisible by `div`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is updated based on the division operation until it is no longer divisible by `div`, and `div` is assigned the value of `prim[x]`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the values need to be adjusted such that `x` is divisible by the new value of `div`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`fac` contains the appended value of `div`, `x` is updated based on the division operation until it is no longer divisible by `div`, `div` is assigned the value of `prim[x]`, for the loop to execute the next time `x` must be divisible by the new value of `div`**
