The loop continuously divides `x` by `div` until it is no longer divisible, updating the values of `x` and `div` accordingly. The loop will execute as long as `x % div == 0` and `x` is greater than 1.

Output State: **`fac` contains the appended values of all divisors of the original `x`, `x` is not divisible by `div`, `div` is assigned the value of `prim[x]`, `x` is greater than 1**
