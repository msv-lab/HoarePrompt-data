Example Answer:
`div` is appended to the list `fac`. The value of `div` is assigned the value of `prim[x]`, where `x` is not divisible by the current `div`. The loop will execute again if `x` is greater than 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `fac` contains the appended values of all divisors of the original `x`, `x` is updated based on the division operation until it is no longer divisible by any of the divisors, `div` is assigned the value of `prim[x]`, `x` is not divisible by the current `div`, for the loop to execute again `x` is greater than 1, `div` is assigned the value of `prim[x]`.
Output State: **`fac` contains the appended values of all divisors of the original `x`, `x` is updated based on the division operation until it is no longer divisible by any of the divisors, `div` is assigned the value of `prim[x]`, `x` is not divisible by the current `div`, for the loop to execute again `x` is greater than 1, `div` is assigned the value of `prim[x]`**
