Correctness: True

Explanation: 
After reviewing the program and the problem description, it seems that the program is correctly implementing the logic described in the problem. The program maintains a set of activated colliders for each prime factor of the collider number. It checks for conflicts (non-relatively prime numbers) when activating colliders and deactivates colliders accordingly. The program also handles edge cases like activating/deactivating collider 1 and correctly prints the responses as described in the problem.

Overall, the program appears to be handling all cases as per the problem description and there don't seem to be any instances where it deviates from the requirements.
