The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `line`, `end`, `pos`, and `left`. It then manipulates the list `line` based on certain conditions. If `left` is true, it checks various positions in the list and returns False if any condition is met. If `left` is false, it performs additional checks and updates the list accordingly. The function returns the updated value of `pos` or `pos + 1` depending on the conditions. The functionality includes returning False in multiple cases, updating the list `line` with specific values at certain positions, and returning the updated position value.
