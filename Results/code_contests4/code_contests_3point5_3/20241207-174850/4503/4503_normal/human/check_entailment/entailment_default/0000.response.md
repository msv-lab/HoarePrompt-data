Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads the input correctly.
- It then processes the input to determine if the hit can be reached without drawing a horizontal line, with drawing one horizontal line, or if it cannot be reached even with drawing one horizontal line.
- The functions `func_1` and `func_2` handle the logic of updating the horizontal lines and checking the conditions to reach the hit.
- The code iterates through different scenarios to find the optimal solution to reach the hit.
- The code seems to cover all possible scenarios and follows the problem description for every potential case.
- The output is generated correctly based on the input and the conditions met during the processing of the input.
