Correctness: **True**

The program consists of two functions, func_1 and func_2, that work together to determine if the hit can be reached in the Amidakuji. The func_1 function checks if a horizontal line can be added at a specific position in the Amidakuji without violating the rules. If a line can be added, it updates the Amidakuji and returns the position. If not, it returns False.

The func_2 function iterates through each row of the Amidakuji and calls func_1 to check if a horizontal line can be added at the specified position. If a line can be added, it returns the position and step number. If not, it returns False.

Overall, the program correctly follows the problem description by ensuring that only one horizontal line is added at a time, that the line does not cross vertical lines, and that the hit can be reached with the added horizontal line. The program handles all possible cases and correctly determines if the hit can be reached or not.
