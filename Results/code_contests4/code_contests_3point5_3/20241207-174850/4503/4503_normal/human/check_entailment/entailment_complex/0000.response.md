Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which work together to determine if the hit can be reached in the Amidakuji game. The functions follow the problem description by checking and updating the horizontal lines based on the specified conditions. The annotations also provide a detailed explanation of the logic behind the functions. Since there are no specific cases mentioned where the code does not work as expected, and the functions are designed to meet the requirements of the Amidakuji game, we can conclude that the code is correct.
