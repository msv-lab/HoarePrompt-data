You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are n vertical lines in the Amidakuji. This Amidakuji meets the following conditions.

* Draw a horizontal line right next to it. Do not pull diagonally.
* Horizontal lines always connect adjacent vertical lines. In other words, the horizontal line does not cross the vertical line.
* For any vertical line, horizontal lines will not appear at the same time on the left and right from the same point. That is, the horizontal line does not cross the vertical line.
* There is only one hit.



The figure below shows an example of Amidakuji when n = 5. The numbers on the top represent the vertical line numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 from the left). ☆ is a hit.

<image>


Create a program that reads the number of vertical lines n, the number m of the selected vertical line, the location of the Amidakuji hit, and the presence or absence of horizontal lines in each row, and outputs a judgment as to whether or not the hit can be reached. However, only one horizontal line can be added at any position in the given Amidakuji (it is not necessary to add it). The Amidakuji after adding one horizontal line must also meet the above conditions.



Input

Given multiple datasets. Each dataset is as follows:

The number of vertical lines n (1 <n ≤ 10) is written on the first line.
On the second line, the number m (1 ≤ m ≤ n) of the selected vertical line is written.
On the third line, the number of the hit place (☆ in the figure) is written counting from the left.
On the 4th line, the number of stages d (1 ≤ d ≤ 30) of Amidakuji is written.
From the 5th line onward, n-1 numbers are lined up in order from the top of the Amidakuji, with 1 being the horizontal line between each vertical line and 0 being the absence, as in the sequence of numbers corresponding to the figure. is.


The input ends on a line with a single 0.

Output

For each dataset, output the following values ​​depending on whether you can reach the hit from the selected vertical line number m.

* Output 0 if you can reach the hit without drawing a horizontal line.
* If you can reach the hit by drawing one horizontal line, output the position of the horizontal line closest to the starting side (upper in the figure). Please output the number of steps (see the figure) counting from the departure side and the number of vertical lines counting from the left to draw the horizontal line to the right, separated by a half-width space.
* If you cannot reach the hit even if you draw one horizontal line, output 1.

    #The program returns the value of pos increased by 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `line`, `end`, `pos`, and `left`. It then manipulates the list `line` based on certain conditions. If `left` is true, it checks various positions in the list and returns False if any condition is met. If `left` is false, it performs additional checks and updates the list accordingly. The function returns the updated value of `pos` or `pos + 1` depending on the conditions. The functionality includes returning False in multiple cases, updating the list `line` with specific values at certain positions, and returning the updated position value.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, d are positive integers such that 1 < n ≤ 10, 1 ≤ m ≤ n, 1 ≤ d ≤ 30. Each row in the input after the 4th line consists of n-1 integers where each integer is either 0 or 1.**

            pos += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: end is the length of the first row of the side list, pos is either greater than 0 with line[pos - 1] being true or pos is either increased by 1 or less than or equal to 0 with line[pos] being true, add is decreased by the number of elements in the side list, cross is the return value of func_1(line, end, pos, left) after the last iteration of the loop, step is the index of the last element in the side list, line is the last element in the side list when add is equal to step. Either pos is less than or equal to 0 or line[pos - 1] is false after the last iteration of the loop.
    return cross, pos + 1
    #The program returns the value stored in 'cross' after the last iteration of the loop, and the value of 'pos' incremented by 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes parameters `start`, `side`, `add`, and `left` where `start`, `side`, `add`, and `left` are positive integers meeting specific constraints. The function iterates over the `side` list, modifying the position `pos` based on certain conditions. If the condition `add == step` is met during the iteration, it calls `func_1` with specific parameters and assigns the result to `cross`. After the loop, it returns the final values of `cross` and `pos + 1`. The function may return various values depending on the specific conditions met during execution. The annotations mention specific cases, but the actual code may have additional cases to consider.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
