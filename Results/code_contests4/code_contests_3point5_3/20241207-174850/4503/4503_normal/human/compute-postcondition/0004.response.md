According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are elements in the `side` list. The loop will iterate through each element in the list. Before the loop starts, the `side` list must have at least one element to execute the loop. At the start of the loop, `step` will be 0 and `line` will be the first element in the `side` list. The `end` is the length of the first row of the `side` list, `pos` is still undetermined, `add` is decreased by 1, and `cross` is 0.
State: **`end` is the length of the first row of the `side` list, `pos` is undetermined, `add` is decreased by 1, `cross` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time the `side` list has at least one element, `step` is 0, `line` is the first element in the `side` list**
