The function `func_2` accepts parameters `start`, `side`, `add`, and `left`. `start`, `side`, `add`, and `left` are positive integers such that 1 < n ≤ 10, 1 ≤ m ≤ n, 1 ≤ d ≤ 30. Each row in the input after the 4th line consists of n-1 integers where each integer is either 0 or 1. After executing the function, there are multiple cases for the return value:

Case 1: The program returns False, False.
Case 2: The program returns False, False.
Case 3: The program returns False, False.
Case 4: The program returns the value stored in 'cross' after the last iteration of the loop, and the value of 'pos' incremented by 1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept positive integers `start`, `side`, `add`, and `left`, and based on the constraints and relationships provided, it returns different values based on the cases mentioned.
