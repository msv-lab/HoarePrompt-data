Example Answer: 
The value of `add` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `add` is unknown, so the output state is: `end` is the length of the first row of the `side` list, `pos` is undetermined, `add` is decreased by 1.
Output State: **`end` is the length of the first row of the `side` list, `pos` is undetermined, `add` is decreased by 1**
