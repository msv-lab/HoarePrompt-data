Postcondition: ***end is the length of the first row of the side list, pos can be either greater than 0 with line[pos - 1] being true or pos is either increased by 1 or less than or equal to 0 with line[pos] being true, add is decreased by 1, step is 2, line is the third element in the side list when add is equal to step. Either pos is less than or equal to 0 or line[pos - 1] is false, cross is true after the execution of the if else block, pos is decreased by 1, cross is assigned the return value of func_1(line, end, pos, left) if add == step. If pos > 0 and line[pos - 1], then the cross is true and pos is decreased by 1. If pos is less than or equal to 0 or line[pos - 1] is false, then cross is true and pos is decreased by 1.***
