Functionality: **The function `func_2` takes parameters `start`, `side`, `add`, and `left` where `start`, `side`, `add`, and `left` are positive integers meeting specific constraints. The function iterates over the `side` list, modifying the position `pos` based on certain conditions. If the condition `add == step` is met during the iteration, it calls `func_1` with specific parameters and assigns the result to `cross`. After the loop, it returns the final values of `cross` and `pos + 1`. The function may return various values depending on the specific conditions met during execution. The annotations mention specific cases, but the actual code may have additional cases to consider.**
