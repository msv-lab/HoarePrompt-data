Example Answer: 
`line` is copied to a new list, `line[:]`, where `line` is a reference to the third element in the side list. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: *end is the length of the first row of the side list, pos can be either greater than 0 with line[pos - 1] being true or pos is either increased by 1 or less than or equal to 0 with line[pos] being true, add is decreased by 1, step is 2, line is the third element in the side list when add is equal to step. Either pos is less than or equal to 0 or line[pos - 1] is false, cross is true after the execution of the if else block, pos is decreased by 1*
