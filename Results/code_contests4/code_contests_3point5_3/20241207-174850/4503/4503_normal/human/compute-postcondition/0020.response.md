Example Answer:
The code creates a copy of the `line` list and assigns it back to `line`. The other variables remain unchanged based on the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: end is the length of the first row of the side list, pos can be either greater than 0 with line[pos - 1] being true or pos is either increased by 1 or less than or equal to 0 with line[pos] being true, add is decreased by 1, cross is the return value of func_1(line, end, pos, left), for the loop to execute the second time the side list has at least two elements, step is 1, line is the second element in the side list when add is equal to step, cross is true. Either pos is less than or equal to 0 or line[pos - 1] is false.
Output State: **end is the length of the first row of the side list, pos can be either greater than 0 with line[pos - 1] being true or pos is either increased by 1 or less than or equal to 0 with line[pos] being true, add is decreased by 1, cross is the return value of func_1(line, end, pos, left), for the loop to execute the second time the side list has at least two elements, step is 1, line is the second element in the side list when add is equal to step, cross is true. Either pos is less than or equal to 0 or line[pos - 1] is false.**
