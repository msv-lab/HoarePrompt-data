According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `side`, `step`, `line`, `end`, `pos`, `add`, `cross`. At the end of the last iteration, the side list has at least one element, step is 0, line is the first element in the side list when add is equal to step, cross is true. So for the loop to execute one more time, the side list needs to have at least two elements, step needs to be increased by 1, line needs to be the second element in the side list, add needs to be decreased by 1, and the return value of func_1(line, end, pos, left) should be true. Additionally, pos should be less than or equal to 0, or line[pos - 1] should be false.
State: **end is the length of the first row of the side list, pos can be either greater than 0 with line[pos - 1] being true or pos is either increased by 1 or less than or equal to 0 with line[pos] being true, add is decreased by 1, cross is the return value of func_1(line, end, pos, left), for the loop to execute the second time the side list has at least two elements, step is 1, line is the second element in the side list when add is equal to step, cross is true. Either pos is less than or equal to 0 or line[pos - 1] is false.**
