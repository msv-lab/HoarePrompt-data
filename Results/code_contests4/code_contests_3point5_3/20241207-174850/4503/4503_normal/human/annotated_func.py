#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `line`, `end`, `pos`, and `left`. It then manipulates the list `line` based on certain conditions. If `left` is true, it checks various positions in the list and returns False if any condition is met. If `left` is false, it performs additional checks and updates the list accordingly. The function returns the updated value of `pos` or `pos + 1` depending on the conditions. The functionality includes returning False in multiple cases, updating the list `line` with specific values at certain positions, and returning the updated position value.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, d are positive integers such that 1 < n ≤ 10, 1 ≤ m ≤ n, 1 ≤ d ≤ 30. Each row in the input after the 4th line consists of n-1 integers where each integer is either 0 or 1.**

Either pos is less than or equal to 0 or line[pos - 1] is false after the last iteration of the loop.
    return cross, pos + 1
    #The program returns the value stored in 'cross' after the last iteration of the loop, and the value of 'pos' incremented by 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes parameters `start`, `side`, `add`, and `left` where `start`, `side`, `add`, and `left` are positive integers meeting specific constraints. The function iterates over the `side` list, modifying the position `pos` based on certain conditions. If the condition `add == step` is met during the iteration, it calls `func_1` with specific parameters and assigns the result to `cross`. After the loop, it returns the final values of `cross` and `pos + 1`. The function may return various values depending on the specific conditions met during execution. The annotations mention specific cases, but the actual code may have additional cases to consider.
