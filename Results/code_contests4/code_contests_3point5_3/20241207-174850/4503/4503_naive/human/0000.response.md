Correctness: **True**

The program reads the input correctly, then iterates through the steps of the Amidakuji, checking if the hit can be reached without drawing a horizontal line first. If not, it tries to add a horizontal line either to the left or right and checks if the hit can be reached. The logic seems to be correctly implemented as per the problem description. The program covers all the conditions mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output.
