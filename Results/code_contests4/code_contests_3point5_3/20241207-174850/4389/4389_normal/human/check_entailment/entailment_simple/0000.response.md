Correctness: **True**

The program correctly determines if there is a solution to make exactly m steel chains to secure all fridges in the apartment. It calculates the minimum total cost by adding the weights of all fridges twice (2 * sum(a)) and then creates m steel chains connecting each fridge to the next one in a circular manner. This ensures that each fridge is private and can only be opened by its owner.

The program follows the problem description as it checks for the conditions where there is no solution (-1) and otherwise calculates the minimum cost and provides a valid solution by creating the required steel chains.
