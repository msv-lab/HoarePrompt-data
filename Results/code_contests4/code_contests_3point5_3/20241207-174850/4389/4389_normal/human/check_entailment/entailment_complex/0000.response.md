Correctness: **True**

The program accurately implements the problem description. It reads the input values for the number of people and the required number of steel chains, creates a list of weights for the fridges, and then determines whether a solution is possible based on the conditions provided in the problem description. If a solution is possible, it calculates the minimum total cost and outputs the connections of the steel chains.

The program correctly handles the case where there is no solution by outputting -1. It also fulfills the requirement of minimizing the total cost of all steel chains while ensuring that each fridge is private.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and provides the expected outputs for the given inputs.
