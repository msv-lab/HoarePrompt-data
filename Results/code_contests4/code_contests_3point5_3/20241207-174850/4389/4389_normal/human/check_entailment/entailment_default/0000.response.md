Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not fully follow the problem description. The function `func_1` reads input values for `n` and `m`, creates a list `a` based on the input, and appends specific values to the list `af`. If the condition `m < n` or `n == 2` is met, it appends -1 to `af`. Otherwise, it calculates 2 times the sum of elements in list `a` and appends the string representation of numbers from 1 to `n` followed by specific calculations to `af`. 

However, the code does not ensure that the resulting fridges are private as per the problem description. The code simply creates chains between fridges in a sequential manner without considering the condition of making the fridges private. This means that the code may not produce the correct output based on the problem requirements.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
