Example Answer:
The last element of the list `le` is popped and split into individual elements which are then converted to integers and stored in list `a`. The values of `n` and `m` are based on the last element of the original list `le`, but since we don't have the specific values of `n` and `m`, we cannot determine their exact values. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are assigned values based on the last element of the list `le`, `a` is a list containing integers from the last element of `le`.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are assigned values based on the last element of the list `le`, `a` is a list containing integers from the last element of `le`**
