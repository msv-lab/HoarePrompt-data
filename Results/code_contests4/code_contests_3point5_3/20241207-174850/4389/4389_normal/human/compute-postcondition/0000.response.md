Example Answer:
`n` and `m` are assigned the values of the integers obtained from splitting the last element of the list `le` after applying the `map` function. The values of `n` and `m` depend on the content of the list `le`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are assigned values based on the last element of the list `le`.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are assigned values based on the last element of the list `le`**
