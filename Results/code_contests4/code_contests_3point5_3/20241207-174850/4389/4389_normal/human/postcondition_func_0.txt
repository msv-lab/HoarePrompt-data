The function `func_1` reads input values for `n` and `m`, creates a list `a` based on the input, and appends specific values to the list `af`. If the condition `m < n` or `n == 2` is met, it appends -1 to `af`. Otherwise, it calculates 2 times the sum of elements in list `a` and appends the string representation of numbers from 1 to `n` followed by specific calculations to `af`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
