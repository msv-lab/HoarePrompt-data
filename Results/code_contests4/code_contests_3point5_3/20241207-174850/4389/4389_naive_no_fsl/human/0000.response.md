Correctness: **False**

The given program does not handle the case where the number of steel chains required is less than the number of people living in the apartment (m < n). According to the problem description, in this case, the output should be -1. However, the program does not check for this condition and does not output -1 when m < n. This makes the program incorrect as it does not follow the problem requirements for every potential case.
