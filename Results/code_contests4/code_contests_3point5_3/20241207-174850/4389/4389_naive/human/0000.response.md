Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program correctly reads the input for the number of test cases, the number of people, the number of steel chains required, and the weights of the fridges.
- It then checks if there is no solution by comparing the number of required chains with the number of people (m < n) or if there are only 2 people living in the apartment (n == 2).
- If there is a solution, it calculates the minimum total cost by summing up twice the weights of all fridges.
- It then creates the steel chains by connecting each fridge to the next one in order to make all fridges private.
- The program outputs the correct total cost and the connections between fridges if a solution is possible.
- If there is no solution, it outputs -1 as required.

Overall, the program seems to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement for creating exactly m steel chains to make all fridges private while minimizing the total cost.
