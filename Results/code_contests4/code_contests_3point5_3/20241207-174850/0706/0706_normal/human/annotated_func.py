#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_1():
    return map(long, stdin.readline().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing the long integer values parsed from the input read from standard input
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 reads input from standard input, parses the input as long integer values, and returns a map object containing these values. The function lacks error handling for cases where the input values cannot be parsed as long integers or when the input is not in the expected format.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, xi are integers such that 2 <= xi <= 10^7, m is a positive integer, and li, ri are integers such that 2 <= li <= ri <= 2*10^9.**
def func_2(li):
    if (not li) :
        return
        #The value of li is not true
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is a positive integer, xi are integers such that 2 <= xi <= 10^7, m is a positive integer, and li, ri are integers such that 2 <= li <= ri <= 2*10^9. li is not equal to 0
    for i in xrange(len(li) - 1):
        stdout.write('%d ' % li[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: All values of li are printed
    stdout.write('%d\n' % li[-1])
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` iterates through the elements of the list `li` and prints each element followed by a space, except for the last element which is followed by a newline character. The function does not return any value based on the input parameter `li`. The annotation mentioning that the function does not return a valid value is accurate.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the length of the sequence of integers, xi are integers in the sequence, m is an integer representing the number of queries, li and ri are integers representing the query intervals such that 1 <= n <= 10^6, 2 <= xi <= 10^7, 1 <= m <= 50000, 2 <= li <= ri <= 2*10^9.**
def func_3():
    return stdin.readline().rstrip()
    #The program returns the input from standard input after removing any trailing newline characters
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from standard input and returns it after removing any trailing newline characters.
