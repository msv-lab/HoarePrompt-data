Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the value of `li` at index `i`. Initially, `i` is 1, so the code will print the value of `li` at index 1. The value of `li` at index 1 is not provided in the initial state, so the output state will include the value of `li` at index 1.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, xi are integers such that 2 <= xi <= 10^7, m is a positive integer, li has at least 2 elements, i is 1 for the loop to execute the second time, and the value of li at index 1 is printed**
