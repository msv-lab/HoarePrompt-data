According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of list `li`. If the length of list `li` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, we need to ensure that the length of list `li` is at least 2. Additionally, since `m` is a positive integer, we can assume that `m` is at least 1. For the loop to execute the first time, `i` should be 0.
State: **n is a positive integer, xi are integers such that 2 <= xi <= 10^7, m is a positive integer, li, ri are integers such that 2 <= li <= ri <= 2*10^9, li has at least 2 elements, i is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
