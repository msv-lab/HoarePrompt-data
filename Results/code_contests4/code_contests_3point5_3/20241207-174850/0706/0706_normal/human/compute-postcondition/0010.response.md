Example Answer:
The code snippet uses `stdout.write` to print the last element of the list `li` using string formatting. Since we are only printing the last element of the list, no changes are made to the list `li` itself. Therefore, the Output State is: All values of `li` are printed.
Output State: **All values of `li` are printed**
