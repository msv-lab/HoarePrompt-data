According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than the length of `li` - 1. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, xi are integers such that 2 <= xi <= 10^7, `m` is a positive integer, `li` has at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and the value of `li` at index 1 is printed. 

To execute the loop one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and since `i` is 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute the second time, `i` must be 2. Additionally, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `li` - 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **n is a positive integer, xi are integers such that 2 <= xi <= 10^7, m is a positive integer, li has at least 2 elements, i is 2 for the loop to execute the second time, and the value of li at index 1 is printed**
