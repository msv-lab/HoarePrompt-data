Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program reads the input values as required.
- The function `func_1` correctly parses the input as long integer values.
- The function `func_2` prints the elements of a list as required.
- The function `func_3` calculates the number of prime numbers in the given range [li, ri] for each query and outputs the correct sum. 
- The code seems to handle all potential cases described in the problem description.
- The output hints also align with the code and further support the correctness of the program.
