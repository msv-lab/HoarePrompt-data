Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The annotations mention that the program returns a map object containing long integer values, which is not necessary for the problem description. Additionally, the functions defined do not directly address the problem of counting the number of indexes divisible by a prime number within a given interval. Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the given problem description.
