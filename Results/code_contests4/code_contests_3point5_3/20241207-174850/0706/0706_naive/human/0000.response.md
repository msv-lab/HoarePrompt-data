Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly calculates the number of prime numbers in the given range [li, ri] and outputs the sum of prime numbers for each query. The program initializes the necessary lists and variables, calculates the prime numbers count using a sieve method, and then calculates the sum for each query. The logic used in the program aligns with the problem description provided. There are no missing edge cases or potential issues identified that would cause the program to fail for any input. Therefore, the program is correct.
