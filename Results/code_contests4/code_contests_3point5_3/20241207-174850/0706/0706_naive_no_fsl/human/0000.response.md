Correctness: **True**

The given Python program correctly calculates the number of prime numbers in a given range [li, ri] and outputs the sum of these prime numbers for each query. The program first reads the input values, calculates the number of occurrences of each number in the input list, then computes the count of prime numbers up to N (maximum number in the input list). Finally, for each query, it calculates the sum of prime numbers within the specified range [li, ri] and prints the result.

The program logic follows the problem description and handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is true.
