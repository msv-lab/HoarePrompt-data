The function `func` reads an input `N`, then reads a list of strings `S` from the input. It iterates over the elements of `S` and if it finds an element 'Y', it prints 'Four', sets `N` to -1, and breaks the loop. After the loop, if `N` is -1, it prints 'Three'. If there is no 'Y' in `S`, the program does not print anything. The function does not have any specific return value.
