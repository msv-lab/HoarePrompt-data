Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. Here are the issues:

1. The program reads the input incorrectly. The `input()` function should be used to read the integer N, and `input().split()` should be used to read the string S.
2. The loop should iterate over the range of N, not the range of the input string S.
3. The condition `if S[i] == 'Y'` is incorrect. The program should check for the presence of 'Y' only after checking for the presence of 'P', 'W', and 'G'.
4. The program incorrectly prints 'Four' when it encounters 'Y' before checking for 'P', 'W', and 'G'.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description and is incorrect.
