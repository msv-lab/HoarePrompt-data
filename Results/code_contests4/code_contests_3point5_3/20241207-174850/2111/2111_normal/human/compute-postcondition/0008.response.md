According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `N` and `S`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is greater than 0 and `S` is a non-empty list of strings. To execute the loop one more time, `N` needs to be greater than 1 and the element at index `i` in `S` should not be equal to 'Y'.
State: **`N` is greater than 1, `S` is a non-empty list of strings where the element at index `i` in `S` is not equal to 'Y' for the loop to execute another time**
