Example Answer:
`S` is assigned the value `raw_input.split()`, where `raw_input` is a function to take user input and `split()` is a method to split the input string into a list of strings. The variable `N` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an input value, S is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input.
Output State: **N is an input value, S is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input**
