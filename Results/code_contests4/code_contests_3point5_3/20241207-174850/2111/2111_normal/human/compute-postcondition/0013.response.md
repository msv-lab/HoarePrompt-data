According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `N` and `S`. If `N` is greater than 1 and the element at index `i` in `S` is not equal to 'Y', the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is greater than 1, and `S` is a non-empty list of strings where the element at index `i` is not equal to 'Y'. 

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, `N` should still be greater than 1 and the element at index `i` in `S` should still not be equal to 'Y'. Additionally, the value of `i` will be increased by 1 for the next iteration.

State: **`N` is greater than 1, `S` is a non-empty list of strings where the element at index `i+1` is not equal to 'Y' for the loop to execute another time**
