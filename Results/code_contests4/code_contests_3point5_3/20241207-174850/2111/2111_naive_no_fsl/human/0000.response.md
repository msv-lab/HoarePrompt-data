Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine whether the number of colors of the arare in the bag was three or four. It simply checks if the color yellow (`Y`) is present in the bag and then prints `Four` without properly considering the other colors. This logic does not align with the problem description, which requires checking for the presence of pink (`P`), white (`W`), and green (`G`) colors.

For example, if the input is:
```
6
G W Y P Y W
```

The program will incorrectly output `Four` instead of `Three`, as it only checks for the presence of yellow color and does not consider the other required colors.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
