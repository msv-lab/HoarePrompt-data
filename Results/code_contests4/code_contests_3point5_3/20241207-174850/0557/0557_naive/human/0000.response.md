Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes an input `n` and calculates the number of combinations of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` such that their sum equals `n`. The program iterates through all possible values of `a` from 0 to `n` or 1000 (whichever is smaller) and then iterates through all possible values of `b` in the range such that `a + b = n`. It then calculates the number of valid combinations for `c` and `d` based on the constraints provided.

The program correctly handles all possible cases where `n` is a positive integer of 4,000 or less and `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers in the range 0-1000. The logic of the program ensures that all combinations are correctly counted and the output is as expected for all datasets.
