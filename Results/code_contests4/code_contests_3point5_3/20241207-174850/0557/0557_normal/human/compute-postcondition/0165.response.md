Postcondition: ***`ans` is an array where the value stored at index `n` is printed. `n` is an integer read from the standard input. If `ans[n]` is False, the final value of `count` is assigned to `ans[n]`, where the exact values of `count`, `a`, `e1`, `n`, and `ran` depend on the specific values used in the loop.***
