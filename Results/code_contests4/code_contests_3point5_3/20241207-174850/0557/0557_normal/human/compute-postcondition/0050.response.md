Output State: **`n` is an integer assigned the value of int(line), `ans[n]` is False, `count` is incremented by the sum of all values of `ran` from all iterations, `n` is less than 1000, `a` is 2, `e1` is calculated based on the given formula, `nab` is decremented `n` times from the initial value, for the loop to execute one more time `nab` is greater than `e1`, `ran` is assigned the value of (nab if nab < 1000 else 1000) - (nab - 1001 if nab > 1000 else -1), `count` is incremented by the value of `ran`.**
