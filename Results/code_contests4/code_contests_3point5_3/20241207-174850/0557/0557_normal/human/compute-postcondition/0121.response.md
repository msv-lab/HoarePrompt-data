Postcondition: ***`count`, `a`, `e1`, `n`, `ran` are integers. If `ran` is greater than or equal to 0, then `count` is set to the value of `ran`, `a` is 0, `e1` is either a value calculated from the expression `n - a - 1001` if it's greater than or equal to 0 or -1, for the loop to execute `n - a` is greater than `e1`, `ran` is greater than or equal to 0.***
