Example Answer:
`count` is assigned the value 0. The values of a, b, c, d, and ans remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is assigned the value of int(line), where line is a string input converted to an integer. The values of a, b, c, d, and ans are not affected. ans[n] is False, count is 0.
Output State: **n is assigned the value of int(line), where line is a string input converted to an integer. The values of a, b, c, d, and ans are not affected. ans[n] is False, count is 0**
