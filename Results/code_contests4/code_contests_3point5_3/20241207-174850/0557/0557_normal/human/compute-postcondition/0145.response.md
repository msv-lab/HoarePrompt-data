Postcondition: ***`count`, `a`, `e1`, `n`, `ran` are all variables. If `ran` is greater than or equal to 0, then `count` is updated, `a` is further incremented by 2, `e1` is recalculated based on the condition, `n` retains its value, and `ran` is updated based on the condition. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of the variables.***
