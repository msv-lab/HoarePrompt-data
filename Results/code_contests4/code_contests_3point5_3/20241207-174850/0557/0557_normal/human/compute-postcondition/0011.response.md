Postcondition: ***`n` is assigned the value of int(line), `ans[n]` is False, `count` is increased by the value of `ran`, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is less than 1000, `a` is 0, `e1` is calculated based on the given formula, `nab` is initialized, `ran` is calculated based on the formula provided. If `ran` is greater than or equal to 0, the program executes the if part, otherwise, it proceeds to the else part (which is not present in this case).***
