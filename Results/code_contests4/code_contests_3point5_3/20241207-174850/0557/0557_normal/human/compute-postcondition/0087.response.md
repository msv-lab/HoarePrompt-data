According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n`, `a`, `e1`, and the condition `(n - a) < e1`. If the condition is satisfied, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is less than 1000. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` needs to be updated based on the loop iteration. Since the loop is iterating over `nab` from `n - a` to `e1` in reverse, the next value of `n` would be one less than the previous value of `nab`.

State: **`n` is one less than the previous value of `nab`, other variables remain unchanged, for the loop to execute another time `(n - a) < e1` must hold true**
