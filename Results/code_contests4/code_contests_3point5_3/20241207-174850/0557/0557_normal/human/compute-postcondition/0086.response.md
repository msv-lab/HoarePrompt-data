Postcondition: ***`n` is less than 1000. If `ran` is greater than or equal to 0, `e1` is recalculated based on the new value of `nab`, `ran` is the calculated value, `count` has been further incremented, and `nab` is updated based on the loop iteration. Otherwise, no changes occur in the program state.***
