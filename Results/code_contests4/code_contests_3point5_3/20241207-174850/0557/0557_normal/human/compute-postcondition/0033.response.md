Example Answer:
`ran` is assigned the value of `(nab if nab < 1000 else 1000) - (nab - 1001 if nab > 1000 else -1)`. The value of `nab` is decreased by 1, within the range of `(n - a, e1]`. The value of `ran` is calculated based on the provided formula. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer assigned the value of int(line), `ans[n]` is False, `count` is incremented by an unknown value, `n` is less than 1000, `a` is 1, `e1` is calculated based on the given formula, `ran` is calculated based on the provided formula, `nab` is within the range `(n - a, e1]` and decremented by 1.
Output State: **`n` is an integer assigned the value of int(line), `ans[n]` is False, `count` is incremented by an unknown value, `n` is less than 1000, `a` is 1, `e1` is calculated based on the given formula, `ran` is calculated based on the provided formula, `nab` is within the range `(n - a, e1]` and decremented by 1**
