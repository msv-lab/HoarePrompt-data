Output State: **`count` is the total sum of all valid `ran` values calculated in each iteration, `a` is incremented by a multiple of 2, `e1` is recalculated based on the condition `e1 = n - a - 1001 if n - a - 1001 >= 0 else -1`, `n` retains its value, `ran` is updated based on the condition, for the loop to execute one more time `a` must be less than or equal to the calculated value based on the condition**
