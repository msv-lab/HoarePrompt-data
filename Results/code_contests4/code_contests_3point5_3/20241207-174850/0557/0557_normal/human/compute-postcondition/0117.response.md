According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n`, `a`, `e1`, and the expression `n - a - 1001`. If the expression `n - a - 1001` is greater than or equal to 0, `e1` will be that value, otherwise `e1` will be -1. The loop will execute if `n - a` is greater than `e1`. 

Before the loop starts, the initial state is `count` is 0, `a` is 0, and `e1` is either a value calculated from the expression `n - a - 1001` if it's greater than or equal to 0 or -1. 

To adjust the state for the loop to execute:
State: **`count` is 0, `a` is 0, `e1` is either a value calculated from the expression `n - a - 1001` if it's greater than or equal to 0 or -1, for the loop to execute `n - a` is greater than `e1`**
