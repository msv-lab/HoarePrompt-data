Output State: **`count` is the total sum of all valid `ran` values calculated in each iteration, `a` is less than or equal to the calculated value based on the condition `n - a - 1001 >= 0`, `e1` is recalculated based on the condition `e1 = n - a - 1001 if n - a - 1001 >= 0 else -1`, `n` retains its value, `ran` is updated based on certain conditions. The loop will execute until `e1` is less than the next value of `n - a` and `count` will be increased by `ran` if `ran` is greater than or equal to 0.**
