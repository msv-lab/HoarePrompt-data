Example Answer: 
`n` is assigned the integer value of `line`, where `line` is read from the standard input. The value stored in `ans[n]` is printed, but the initial state or value of `ans[n]` is unknown. To execute the loop one more time, there must be at least one more line in the standard input. Therefore, the Output State is: the value stored in `ans[n]` is printed, `n` is an integer read from the standard input, and to execute the loop one more time, there must be at least one more line in the standard input.
Output State: **the value stored in `ans[n]` is printed, `n` is an integer read from the standard input, and to execute the loop one more time, there must be at least one more line in the standard input.**
