Example Answer:
`ans` is a list of size 4001 initialized with all elements as 0. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer less than or equal to 4,000. The integers a, b, c, d are in the range 0-1000 and satisfy the equation a + b + c + d = n; `ans` is a list of size 4001 with all elements as 0.
