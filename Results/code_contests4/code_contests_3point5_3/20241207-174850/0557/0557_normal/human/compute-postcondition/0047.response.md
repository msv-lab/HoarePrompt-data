Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer assigned the value of int(line), `ans[n]` is False, `count` is incremented by the sum of all values of `ran` from all iterations, `n` is less than 1000, `a` is 2, `e1` is calculated based on the given formula, `nab` is decremented `n` times from the initial value. For the loop to execute for the first time, `nab` is equal to n - a and `ran` is a positive value. `ran` is calculated as (nab if nab < 1000 else 1000) - (nab - 1001 if nab > 1000 else -1) and `ran` is greater than or equal to 0. `count` is incremented by the value of `ran`. For the loop to execute one more time, `nab` is greater than `e1` and `ran` is assigned the value of (nab if nab < 1000 else 1000) - (nab - 1001 if nab > 1000 else -1)***
