Output State: **`n` is an integer assigned the value of `int(line)`, `ans[n]` is equal to the total count of positive values of `ran` from all iterations, `count` is the sum of all positive values of `ran` from all iterations, `n` is less than or equal to 1000, `a` is equal to the last value assigned in the loop, `e1` is calculated based on the given formula using the last value of `a`, `nab` is decremented `n` times from the last value of `a`. If the loop does not execute, `count` remains 0**
