Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer assigned the value of int(line), `ans[n]` is False, `count` is incremented by an unknown value, `n` is less than 1000, `a` is 1, `e1` is calculated based on the given formula, `ran` is calculated based on the provided formula and the value of `ran` is greater than or equal to 0, for the loop to execute one more time `nab` should be within the range `(n - a, e1]` and decremented by 1, `ran` is determined as explained above.***
