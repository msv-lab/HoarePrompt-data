The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. The function calculates four integers a, b, c, and d such that their sum is equal to a positive integer n (less than or equal to 4,000), and each integer is in the range of 0-1000. The calculated values of a, b, c, and d satisfy the equation a + b + c + d = n. The function does not return any value, but it performs the calculation based on the constraints provided.
