Postcondition: ***`n` is less than 1000, `a` is such that `n > a`, `e1` is within the specified range, `n - a` is greater than `e1`, `ran` is calculated based on the conditions mentioned above, `count` has been incremented by a sum of values based on the calculations in the loop. If `ran` is greater than or equal to 0, then `count` is incremented by `ran`. If `ran` is less than 0, `count` remains unchanged. `e1` is either the result of the calculation `n - a - 1001` if it's greater than or equal to 0, otherwise it's -1.***
