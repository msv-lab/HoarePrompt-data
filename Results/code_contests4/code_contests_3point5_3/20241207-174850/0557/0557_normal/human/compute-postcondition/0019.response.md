Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer assigned the value of int(line), `ans[n]` is False, `count` is increased by the value of `ran`, for the loop to execute the third time `n` is less than 1000, `a` is 0, `e1` is calculated based on the given formula, `nab` is initialized, `ran` is calculated based on the formula provided. If `ran >= 0`, `count` is increased by the value of `ran` and `ran` is updated to the result of the formula `(nab if nab < 1000 else 1000) - (nab - 1001 if nab > 1000 else -1)`.***
