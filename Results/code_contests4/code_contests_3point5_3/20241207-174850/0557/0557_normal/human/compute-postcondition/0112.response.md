According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are lines in the standard input (stdin). At the end of the last iteration, the value stored in `ans[n]` is printed. So for the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more line in the standard input.
State: **The value stored in `ans[n]` is printed, for the loop to execute one more time there must be at least one more line in the standard input**
