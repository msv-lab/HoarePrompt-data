Example Answer:
`e1` is assigned the value of `n - a - 1001` if `n - a - 1001` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise it is assigned -1. The values of `n` and `a` are known to be obtained from `int(line)` and 0, respectively. Therefore, the Output State is: n is assigned the value of int(line), ans[n] is False, count is 0, for the loop to execute the first time n is less than 1000, a is 0, e1 is calculated based on the given formula.
Output State: **n is assigned the value of int(line), ans[n] is False, count is 0, for the loop to execute the first time n is less than 1000, a is 0, e1 is calculated based on the given formula.**
