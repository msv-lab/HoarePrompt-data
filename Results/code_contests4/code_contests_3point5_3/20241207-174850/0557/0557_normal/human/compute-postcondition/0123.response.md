Example Answer:
The value of `ran` is calculated based on the expression provided. If `nab` is less than 1000, then `ran` is set to `nab`, otherwise, it is set to 1000. The value of `nab` is calculated based on the conditions within the expression. The output state depends on the values of `nab`, so the final state will vary based on the input values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
Output State: **Depends on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`**
