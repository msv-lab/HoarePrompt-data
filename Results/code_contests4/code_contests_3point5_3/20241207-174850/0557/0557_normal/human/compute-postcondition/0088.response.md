Example Answer:
The value of `ran` is calculated based on the values of `nab`. If `nab` is less than 1000, `ran` is equal to `nab` subtracted by `nab - 1001`. If `nab` is greater than 1000, `ran` is equal to 1000 subtracted by `nab - 1001`. Since `n` is one less than the previous value of `nab`, the calculation of `ran` depends on the value of `nab`. 
Output State: **`n` is one less than the previous value of `nab`, `ran` is calculated based on the value of `nab`**
