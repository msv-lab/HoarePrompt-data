Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It takes multiple datasets of positive integers n, calculates the number of combinations of a, b, c, and d that satisfy the conditions a + b + c + d = n, and outputs the result for each dataset. The program uses dynamic programming to store the count for each value of n, which ensures that the program works efficiently even for larger values of n. The nested loops iterate through all possible combinations of a, b, c, and d within the given ranges to find the total count that satisfies the equation. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
