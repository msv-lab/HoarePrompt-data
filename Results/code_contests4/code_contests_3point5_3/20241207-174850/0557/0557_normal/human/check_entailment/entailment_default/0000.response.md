Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the input from stdin and calculates the count of combinations a, b, c, and d that satisfy the conditions for each input n.
- It ensures that the sum of a, b, c, and d is equal to n, with each integer in the range of 0-1000.
- The code efficiently computes the total count of positive values of 'ran' based on specific conditions and stores it in the ans array.
- The output produced by the code matches the expected output as described in the problem statement for all the given test cases.
