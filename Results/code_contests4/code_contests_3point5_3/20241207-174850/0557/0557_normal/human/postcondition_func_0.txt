The function func_1 reads input from stdin, calculates four integers a, b, c, and d such that their sum is equal to a positive integer n (<= 4,000) with each integer in the range of 0-1000. It then computes the total count of positive values of 'ran' based on specific conditions and stores it in the ans array. The function prints the calculated count for each input n.
