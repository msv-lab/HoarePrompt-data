Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. 

For example, if the input string is "a", the code should output 51 according to the problem description. However, the code calculates the result as `(len(n) + 1) * 26 - len(n)`, which is equivalent to `26 * 26 - 1 = 675`. This is not the correct output based on the problem description.

Therefore, the code is incorrect and does not produce the expected results.
