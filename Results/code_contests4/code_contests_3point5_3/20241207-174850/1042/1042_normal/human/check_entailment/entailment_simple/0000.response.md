Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description. 
1. The program uses `raw_input()` which is not a valid function in Python 3, it should use `input()` instead.
2. The formula used in the program `(len(n) + 1) * 26 - len(n)` is incorrect. It should be `(26 - len(set(n))) * (26 - len(n)) + len(n)`. This formula calculates the number of distinct photobooks Kyoya Ootori can make by inserting one extra photo into the existing photo booklet.
