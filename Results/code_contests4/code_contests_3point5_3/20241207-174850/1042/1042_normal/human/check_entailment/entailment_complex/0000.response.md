Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. The calculation `print(len(n) + 1) * 26 - len(n)` is incorrect. According to the problem description, Kyoya wants to insert one extra photo into the photobook he already has to create distinct photobooks. However, the provided program simply calculates a value based on the length of the input string without considering the insertion of an extra photo.

Additionally, the program lacks validation to ensure that the input string `n` only contains lowercase English letters, as required by the problem description.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
