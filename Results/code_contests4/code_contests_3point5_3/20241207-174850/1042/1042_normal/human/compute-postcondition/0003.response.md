Functionality: **The function `func` reads a string `n` as input, calculates a value based on the length of the string, and prints the result. The function does not explicitly return any value. However, there is a missing functionality in the code where the multiplication operation is missing brackets, which might affect the intended calculation. Additionally, there is no validation for the input string `n` to ensure it only contains lowercase English letters.**
