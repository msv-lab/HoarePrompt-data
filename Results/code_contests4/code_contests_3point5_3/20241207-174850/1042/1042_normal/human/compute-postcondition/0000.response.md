Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `raw_input()`, which takes a string input. Since the initial state specifies that `s` is a string of lowercase English letters, the value of `n` will also be a string of lowercase English letters. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of lowercase English letters with length between 1 and 20 (inclusive), `n` is a string of lowercase English letters.
Output State: **`s` is a string of lowercase English letters with length between 1 and 20 (inclusive), `n` is a string of lowercase English letters**
