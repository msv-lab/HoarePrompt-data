Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads a positive integer `n` representing the number of elements in a sequence, which aligns with the problem description.
- It then reads `n` integers into a list `a` where each integer is between 1 and 105 (inclusive), as specified in the input format.
- The function calculates the frequency of each unique element in the list `a` and stores it in a list `freq`, which is required to determine the points earned by Alex.
- It then computes a list `dp` where each element is the maximum value between the previous two elements of `dp` and the sum of the product of the frequency of the element at that index and the index itself. This logic correctly determines the maximum number of points Alex can earn based on the given rules.
- Finally, the function outputs the value at index `n` in the list `dp`, which is the expected output according to the problem description.

Overall, the code aligns with the problem description and the output hints provided. There are no edge cases or scenarios mentioned in the problem description that are not handled by the code. Hence, the correctness of the code is evaluated as **True**.
