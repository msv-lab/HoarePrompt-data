Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program correctly follows the problem description. It reads the input sequence, calculates the frequency of each unique element, and then computes the maximum number of points that Alex can earn according to the rules specified in the problem description. The final output is the maximum number of points that Alex can earn, which is the expected output based on the problem statement. The program iterates over all elements of the sequence and computes the maximum points that can be earned at each step, ensuring that Alex gets the maximum possible points.
