The function reads a positive integer `n` representing the number of elements in a sequence. It then reads `n` integers into a list `a` where each integer is between 1 and 105 (inclusive). The function calculates the frequency of each unique element in the list `a` and stores it in a list `freq`. It then computes a list `dp` where each element is the maximum value between the previous two elements of `dp` and the sum of the product of the frequency of the element at that index and the index itself. Finally, the function outputs the value at index `n` in the list `dp`.
