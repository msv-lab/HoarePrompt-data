The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function generates a sequence `a` of `n` integers where `n` is a positive integer. Each integer in the sequence `a` is between 1 and 105 (inclusive). The function does not return any value, it simply generates the sequence `a` based on the specified constraints. 
Functionality: **The function generates a sequence of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 105 (inclusive), with `n` being a positive integer.**
