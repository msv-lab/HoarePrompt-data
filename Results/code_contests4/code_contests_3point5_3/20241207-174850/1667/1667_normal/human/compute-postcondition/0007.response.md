Example Answer:
The list `freq` is assigned a list of size 10^5+1 where all elements are 0. The variables `n` and `a` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: n is assigned the value of ti() which is a function call, returning a positive integer; a is assigned the value of ma(int, ti()); freq is a list of size 10^5+1 with all elements set to 0.
Output State: **n is assigned the value of ti() which is a function call, returning a positive integer; a is assigned the value of ma(int, ti()); freq is a list of size 10^5+1 with all elements set to 0**
