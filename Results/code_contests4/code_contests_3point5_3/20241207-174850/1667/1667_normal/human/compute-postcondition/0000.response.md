Example Answer:
The lambda function `ti` is defined to read a line of input and strip any leading or trailing whitespace characters. The `ti` function will not directly affect the initial state variables `n` and `a`, so the output state remains the same.
Output State: **n is a positive integer. The sequence a consists of n integers such that each integer is between 1 and 105 (inclusive).**
