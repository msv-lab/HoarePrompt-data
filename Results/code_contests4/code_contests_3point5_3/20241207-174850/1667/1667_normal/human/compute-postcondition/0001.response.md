Example Answer:
The lambda function `ma` takes two arguments, `fxn` and `ti`. It then applies the function `fxn` to each element of the sequence `ti` after splitting it. However, since the values of `fxn` and `ti` are not provided in the initial state, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **n is a positive integer. The sequence a consists of n integers such that each integer is between 1 and 105 (inclusive).**
