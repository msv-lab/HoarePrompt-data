According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the frequency of the element at index `a[i]` in the `freq` list is increased by 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`.
State: **The frequency of the element at index `a[i+1]` in the `freq` list is increased by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than the new value of `i+1**
