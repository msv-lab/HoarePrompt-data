Example Answer:
`freq[a[i]]` is incremented by 1. The values of `a[i]`, `n`, and `freq` are not provided, so the output state is: The frequency of the element at index `a[i]` in the `freq` list is increased by 1.
Output State: **The frequency of the element at index `a[i]` in the `freq` list is increased by 1**
