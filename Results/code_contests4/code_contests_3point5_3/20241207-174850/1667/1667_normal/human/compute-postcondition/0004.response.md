Example Answer:
The lambda function olws takes an array `arr`, converts each element to a string, joins them together, and then writes them to the standard output with a newline character at the end. The lambda function does not directly affect any variables in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer. The sequence a consists of n integers such that each integer is between 1 and 105 (inclusive).
Output State: **n is a positive integer. The sequence a consists of n integers such that each integer is between 1 and 105 (inclusive)**
