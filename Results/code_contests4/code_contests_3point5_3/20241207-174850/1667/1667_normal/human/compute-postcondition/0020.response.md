According to the code, the loop can execute if `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `freq` contains the frequency of each unique element in list `a`, `dp` is updated, `i` is 3, and for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than or equal to 3. Since the loop is starting from `i = 2`, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.
State: **`freq` contains the frequency of each unique element in list `a`, `dp` is updated, `i` is 4, for the loop to execute one more time `n` is greater than or equal to 4**
