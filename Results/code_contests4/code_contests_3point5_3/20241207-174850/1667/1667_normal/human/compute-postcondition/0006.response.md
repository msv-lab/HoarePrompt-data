Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value of `ma(int, ti())`. The function `ti()` returns a positive integer, which is then passed to the `int` function and then the result is passed to the `ma` function. The specific values returned by `ti()` and the actions of `ma` are unknown, so the output state is: n is assigned the value of ti() which is a function call, returning a positive integer; a is assigned the value of ma(int, ti()).
Output State: **n is assigned the value of ti() which is a function call, returning a positive integer; a is assigned the value of ma(int, ti())**
