Example Answer:
The lambda function `ol` takes an array `arr`, converts each element to a string, joins them with a space, and then appends a newline character at the end. The function does not modify any existing variables in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer. The sequence a consists of n integers such that each integer is between 1 and 105 (inclusive).
Output State: **n is a positive integer. The sequence a consists of n integers such that each integer is between 1 and 105 (inclusive)**
