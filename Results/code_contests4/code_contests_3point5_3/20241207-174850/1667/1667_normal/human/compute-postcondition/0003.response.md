Example Answer:
The lambda function `os` takes an integer `i` and prints it followed by a newline character. The function is defined but not called, so it does not affect the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer. The sequence a consists of n integers such that each integer is between 1 and 105 (inclusive).
Output State: **n is a positive integer. The sequence a consists of n integers such that each integer is between 1 and 105 (inclusive)**
