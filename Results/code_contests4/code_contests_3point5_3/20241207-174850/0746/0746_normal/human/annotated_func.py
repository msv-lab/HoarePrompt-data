#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of strings `ar`, where each string represents a part of a string and is in the format "li-ci". The function processes these strings to create a list of tuples `p`, where each tuple contains the total integer value and the corresponding lowercase English letter. If the second element of the last tuple in `p` is the same as the letter `c` in the current string, the integer value in that tuple is incremented by `x`. The function then returns the list of tuples `p`.

#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function `func_2` accepts two strings `t` and `s`, and an integer `c`. It performs different operations based on the length of string `s`.
- If the length of `s` is 1, it iterates over `t` and calculates the difference between the first character of each element in `t` and the first character of `s`, then returns the total.
- If the length of `s` is 2, it counts the number of times the characters at index 0 and 1 of string `s` appear consecutively in string `t`.
- For other cases, it constructs a new list `v` based on the input strings and iterates to find patterns that match specific conditions, returning the total count of satisfying conditions.

The function's actual functionality may differ from the annotations provided, as the annotations do not cover all possible edge cases or accurately describe the behavior of the code. It's essential to consider the actual code execution rather than relying solely on the annotations.
