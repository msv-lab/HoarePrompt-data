You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Each employee of the "Blake Techologies" company uses a special messaging app "Blake Messenger". All the stuff likes this app and uses it constantly. However, some important futures are missing. For example, many users want to be able to search through the message history. It was already announced that the new feature will appear in the nearest update, when developers faced some troubles that only you may help them to solve.

All the messages are represented as a strings consisting of only lowercase English letters. In order to reduce the network load strings are represented in the special compressed form. Compression algorithm works as follows: string is represented as a concatenation of n blocks, each block containing only equal characters. One block may be described as a pair (li, ci), where li is the length of the i-th block and ci is the corresponding letter. Thus, the string s may be written as the sequence of pairs <image>.

Your task is to write the program, that given two compressed string t and s finds all occurrences of s in t. Developers know that there may be many such occurrences, so they only ask you to find the number of them. Note that p is the starting position of some occurrence of s in t if and only if tptp + 1...tp + |s| - 1 = s, where ti is the i-th character of string t.

Note that the way to represent the string in compressed form may not be unique. For example string "aaaa" may be given as <image>, <image>, <image>...

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 200 000) — the number of blocks in the strings t and s, respectively.

The second line contains the descriptions of n parts of string t in the format "li-ci" (1 ≤ li ≤ 1 000 000) — the length of the i-th part and the corresponding lowercase English letter.

The second line contains the descriptions of m parts of string s in the format "li-ci" (1 ≤ li ≤ 1 000 000) — the length of the i-th part and the corresponding lowercase English letter.

Output

Print a single integer — the number of occurrences of s in t.

Note

In the first sample, t = "aaabbccccaaacc", and string s = "aabbc". The only occurrence of string s in string t starts at position p = 2.

In the second sample, t = "aaabbbbbbaaaaaaacccceeeeeeeeaa", and s = "aaa". The occurrences of s in t start at positions p = 1, p = 10, p = 11, p = 12, p = 13 and p = 14.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 200,000. The descriptions of n parts of string t and m parts of string s are in the format "li-ci" where li is a positive integer and ci is a lowercase English letter.**
def func_1(ar):
    p = []
    for i in ar:
        x = int(i.split('-')[0])
        
        c = i.split('-')[1]
        
        if len(p) > 0 and p[-1][1] == c:
            p[-1][0] += x
        else:
            p.append([x, c])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` and `m` remain the same. `p` is a list of tuples. If the length of `p` is greater than 0 and the second element of the last tuple in `p` is equal to `c`, then the first element of the last tuple in `p` is incremented by `x`, where `x` is the integer value of the first part of `i`. If the length of `p` is not greater than 0 or the second element of the last tuple in `p` is not equal to `c`, then no changes are made to `p`.
    return p
    #The program returns the list of tuples `p`, potentially with the first element of the last tuple incremented by `x` if the conditions are met
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of strings `ar`, where each string represents a part of a string and is in the format "li-ci". The function processes these strings to create a list of tuples `p`, where each tuple contains the total integer value and the corresponding lowercase English letter. If the second element of the last tuple in `p` is the same as the letter `c` in the current string, the integer value in that tuple is incremented by `x`. The function then returns the list of tuples `p`.

        return ans
        #The program returns the final value of integer 'ans' after looping through the non-empty iterable 't' based on the conditions specified in the loop

            j += 1
        
        p[i] = j
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `ans` is 0, `s` is a string with length not equal to 1, `v` has a length greater than 1, `t` and `p` are lists of zeros with the same length as `v`, `i` is the length of `v` - 1, `j` is the maximum value that satisfies the conditions in the loop, `p[i]` is assigned the value of `j`.

    return ans
    #The program returns the total number of times the conditions in the loop are satisfied, stored in the variable `ans`.
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function `func_2` accepts two strings `t` and `s`, and an integer `c`. It performs different operations based on the length of string `s`.
- If the length of `s` is 1, it iterates over `t` and calculates the difference between the first character of each element in `t` and the first character of `s`, then returns the total.
- If the length of `s` is 2, it counts the number of times the characters at index 0 and 1 of string `s` appear consecutively in string `t`.
- For other cases, it constructs a new list `v` based on the input strings and iterates to find patterns that match specific conditions, returning the total count of satisfying conditions.

The function's actual functionality may differ from the annotations provided, as the annotations do not cover all possible edge cases or accurately describe the behavior of the code. It's essential to consider the actual code execution rather than relying solely on the annotations.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
