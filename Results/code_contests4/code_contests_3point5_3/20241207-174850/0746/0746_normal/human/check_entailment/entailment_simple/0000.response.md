Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The annotated program provided does not correctly implement the functionality described in the problem description. 

1. In `func_1`, the function is meant to compress the input strings into a list of tuples representing the compressed form. However, the logic in the function is incorrect and does not produce the correct compressed form. The function does not correctly handle cases where multiple characters are present in the compressed form, leading to incorrect compression of the strings.

2. In `func_2`, the function is supposed to find all occurrences of string `s` in string `t`. However, the implementation of the function is incorrect and does not accurately find all occurrences of `s` in `t`. The logic for checking the occurrences is flawed and does not consider all possible cases where `s` can occur in `t`.

Overall, the program does not correctly implement the required functionality as described in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
