Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
- The program fails to correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not always return the correct number of occurrences of string `s` in string `t`.
- The function `func_2` seems to rely on some pattern matching algorithm, but it is not clear how it is correctly identifying all occurrences of `s` in `t`.
- The code lacks clarity and the output hints do not provide a comprehensive understanding of how the code operates, making it difficult to determine the correctness of the program.
- Without a clear understanding of the implementation details and without examples of cases where the program fails to work as expected, it is challenging to confidently say that the code is correct.
