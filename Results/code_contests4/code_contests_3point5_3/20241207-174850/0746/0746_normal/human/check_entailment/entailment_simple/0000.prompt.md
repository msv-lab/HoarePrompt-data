You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Each employee of the "Blake Techologies" company uses a special messaging app "Blake Messenger". All the stuff likes this app and uses it constantly. However, some important futures are missing. For example, many users want to be able to search through the message history. It was already announced that the new feature will appear in the nearest update, when developers faced some troubles that only you may help them to solve.

All the messages are represented as a strings consisting of only lowercase English letters. In order to reduce the network load strings are represented in the special compressed form. Compression algorithm works as follows: string is represented as a concatenation of n blocks, each block containing only equal characters. One block may be described as a pair (li, ci), where li is the length of the i-th block and ci is the corresponding letter. Thus, the string s may be written as the sequence of pairs <image>.

Your task is to write the program, that given two compressed string t and s finds all occurrences of s in t. Developers know that there may be many such occurrences, so they only ask you to find the number of them. Note that p is the starting position of some occurrence of s in t if and only if tptp + 1...tp + |s| - 1 = s, where ti is the i-th character of string t.

Note that the way to represent the string in compressed form may not be unique. For example string "aaaa" may be given as <image>, <image>, <image>...

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 200 000) — the number of blocks in the strings t and s, respectively.

The second line contains the descriptions of n parts of string t in the format "li-ci" (1 ≤ li ≤ 1 000 000) — the length of the i-th part and the corresponding lowercase English letter.

The second line contains the descriptions of m parts of string s in the format "li-ci" (1 ≤ li ≤ 1 000 000) — the length of the i-th part and the corresponding lowercase English letter.

Output

Print a single integer — the number of occurrences of s in t.

Note

In the first sample, t = "aaabbccccaaacc", and string s = "aabbc". The only occurrence of string s in string t starts at position p = 2.

In the second sample, t = "aaabbbbbbaaaaaaacccceeeeeeeeaa", and s = "aaa". The occurrences of s in t start at positions p = 1, p = 10, p = 11, p = 12, p = 13 and p = 14.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 200,000. The descriptions of n parts of string t and m parts of string s are in the format "li-ci" where li is a positive integer and ci is a lowercase English letter.**
def func_1(ar):
    p = []
    for i in ar:
        x = int(i.split('-')[0])
        
        c = i.split('-')[1]
        
        if len(p) > 0 and p[-1][1] == c:
            p[-1][0] += x
        else:
            p.append([x, c])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` and `m` remain the same. `p` is a list of tuples. If the length of `p` is greater than 0 and the second element of the last tuple in `p` is equal to `c`, then the first element of the last tuple in `p` is incremented by `x`, where `x` is the integer value of the first part of `i`. If the length of `p` is not greater than 0 or the second element of the last tuple in `p` is not equal to `c`, then no changes are made to `p`.
    return p
    #The program returns the list of tuples `p`, potentially with the first element of the last tuple incremented by `x` if the conditions are met

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
