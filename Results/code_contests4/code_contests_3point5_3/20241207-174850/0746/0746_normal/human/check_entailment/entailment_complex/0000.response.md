Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not completely follow the problem description for every potential case. There are some issues with the implementation of the functions that may lead to incorrect results.

1. In `func_1`, the logic to merge consecutive blocks of the same character may not work correctly in all cases. The way the function processes the input strings to create a list of tuples may not accurately represent the compressed form of the strings as described in the problem. If the input strings have specific edge cases where merging blocks should happen differently, the function may not handle them correctly.

2. In `func_2`, there are multiple conditions based on the length of string `s`. The function tries to find occurrences of string `s` in string `t` based on certain patterns, but the implementation may not cover all possible scenarios. There could be edge cases where the conditions specified in the function do not accurately capture the occurrences of string `s` in string `t`.

Overall, without specific test cases to demonstrate the failure of the code to meet the problem description, it is difficult to determine the correctness of the program. It is essential to thoroughly analyze the code and consider potential edge cases to ensure that it aligns with the requirements of the problem.
