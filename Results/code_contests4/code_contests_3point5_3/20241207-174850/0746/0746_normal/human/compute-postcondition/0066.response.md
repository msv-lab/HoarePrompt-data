Postcondition: ***`ans` is 0, `s` is a string with length not equal to 1, `v` has a length greater than 2, `t` and `p` are lists of zeros with the same length as `v`, `i` is 3, `j` is updated to the value stored at index `j` in the list `p`, the loop finishes when `j` becomes 0 or `v[j]` is equal to `v[i]`. At this point, `v[j]` is equal to `v[i]`***
