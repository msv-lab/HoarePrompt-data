According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than the length of `t` - 1, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `ans` is an integer, `i` is 1, `t` is a string with a length of at least 2. If the characters at index `i` and `i + 1` of string `t` match the characters at index 0 and 1 of string `s`, then `ans` is increased by 1. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **`ans` is an integer, `i` is 2, `t` is a string with a length of at least 2. If the characters at index `i` and `i + 1` of string `t` match the characters at index 0 and 1 of string `s`, then `ans` is increased by 1**
