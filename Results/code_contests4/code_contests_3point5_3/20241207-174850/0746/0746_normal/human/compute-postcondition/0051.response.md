Example Answer: 
`j` is updated to the value of `p[j]`, `p` is a list of zeros with the same length as `v`. The loop will execute one more time if `j` is greater than 0 and `v[j]` is not equal to `v[i]`. The states of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is 0, `s` is a string with length not equal to 1, `v` has a length greater than 1, `t` and `p` are lists of zeros with the same length as `v`, `i` is 2, `j` is updated to the value of `p[j]`, for the loop to execute one more time `j` is greater than 0 and `v[j]` is not equal to `v[i].
Output State: **`ans` is 0, `s` is a string with length not equal to 1, `v` has a length greater than 1, `t` and `p` are lists of zeros with the same length as `v`, `i` is 2, `j` is updated to the value of `p[j]`, for the loop to execute one more time `j` is greater than 0 and `v[j]` is not equal to `v[i]**
