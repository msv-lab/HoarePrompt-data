Output State: **`ans` is 0, `s` is a string with length not equal to 1, `v` has a length greater than 2, `t` and `p` are lists of zeros with the same length as `v`, `i` is 3, `j` is 1, `p[i]` is assigned the value of `j`, `j` is assigned the value of `p[i - 1]` for the loop to execute the first time `j` should be greater than 0 and `v[j]` should not be equal to `v[i]`, `j` is updated to the value stored at index `j` in the list `p`.**
