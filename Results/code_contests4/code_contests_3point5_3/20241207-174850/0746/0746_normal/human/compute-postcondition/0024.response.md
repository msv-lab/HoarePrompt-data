Example Answer: 
`ans` is increased by 1 if the characters at index `i` and `i + 1` of string `t` match the characters at index 0 and 1 of string `s`. The values of `ans`, `i`, and `t` are not provided, so the output state is: `ans` is increased by 1 if the conditions are met.
Output State: **`ans` is increased by 1 if the conditions are met**
