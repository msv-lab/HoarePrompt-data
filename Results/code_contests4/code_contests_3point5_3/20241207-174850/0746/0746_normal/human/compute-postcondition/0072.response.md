Postcondition: ***`ans` is 0, `s` is a string with length not equal to 1, `v` has a length greater than 0, `t` and `p` are lists of zeros with the same length as `v`, `i` is the length of `v`, `j` is the maximum value that satisfies the conditions in the loop, `p[i]` is assigned the value of `j`. Additionally, `p[i]` is equal to `len(s) - 2`, `c(v[i - p[i]], s[0])` is true, and `c(v[i + 1], s[-1])` is true.***
