According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of string `t`. If `i` is less than the length of `t - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ans` is an integer, `i` is 0, `t` is a string with a length of at least 2. For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` should be increased by 1 and checked if the characters at index `i` and `i + 1` of string `t` match the characters at index 0 and 1 of string `s`.
State: **`ans` is an integer, `i` is 1, `t` is a string with a length of at least 2. If the characters at index `i` and `i + 1` of string `t` match the characters at index 0 and 1 of string `s`, then `ans` is increased by 1.**
