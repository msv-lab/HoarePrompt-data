Example Answer:
`j` is assigned the value of `p[i - 1]`, where `i` is 1 initially. Since `p` is a list of zeros with the same length as `v`, and `i` is 1, `j` will be assigned the value of the first element in the list `p`, which is 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is 0, `s` is a string with length not equal to 1, `v` has a length greater than 1, `t` and `p` are lists of zeros with the same length as `v`, `i` is 1, `j` is 0.
Output State: **`ans` is 0, `s` is a string with length not equal to 1, `v` has a length greater than 1, `t` and `p` are lists of zeros with the same length as `v`, `i` is 1, `j` is 0**
