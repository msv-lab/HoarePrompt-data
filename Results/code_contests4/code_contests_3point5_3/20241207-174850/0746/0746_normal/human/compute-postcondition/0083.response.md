The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `t` and `s`, which are strings containing lowercase English letters, and `c`, which is an integer between 1 and 1,000,000. 

Case_1: The program returns the final value of integer 'ans' after looping through the non-empty iterable 't' based on the conditions specified in the loop.

Case_2: The program returns the number of times the characters at index 0 and 1 of string `s` appear consecutively in string `t`.

Case_3: The program returns the total number of times the conditions in the loop are satisfied, stored in the variable `ans`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two strings `t` and `s`, and an integer `c`, and perform the specified operations as described in the cases above.
