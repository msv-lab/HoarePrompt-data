Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if else block, `ans` is an integer, `s` is a string with length not equal to 1, `v` has a length greater than 0, `t` and `p` are lists of zeros with the same length as `v`, `i` is the length of `v`, `j` is the maximum value that satisfies the conditions in the loop, `p[i]` is assigned the value of `j`. If `p[i]` is equal to `len(s) - 2` and `c(v[i - p[i]], s[0])` and `c(v[i + 1], s[-1])`, then `ans` is incremented by 1.***
