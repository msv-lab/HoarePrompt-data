According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the length of `v` is greater than 1. Before the loop starts, `ans` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `v` has a length greater than 1, `s` is a string with length not equal to 1, `i` is 1, `t` and `p` are lists of zeros with the same length as `v`.
State: **`ans` is 0, `s` is a string with length not equal to 1, `v` has a length greater than 1, `t` and `p` are lists of zeros with the same length as `v`, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 1**
