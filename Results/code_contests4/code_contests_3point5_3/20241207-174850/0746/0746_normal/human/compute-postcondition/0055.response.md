Postcondition: ***`ans` is 0, `s` is a string with length not equal to 1, `v` has a length greater than 1, `t` and `p` are lists of zeros with the same length as `v`, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `p[i]` is assigned the value of `j`, `j` is assigned the value of `p[i - 1]` after the loop finishes executing. If `v[j]` is equal to `v[i]`, then the overall state remains the same.***
