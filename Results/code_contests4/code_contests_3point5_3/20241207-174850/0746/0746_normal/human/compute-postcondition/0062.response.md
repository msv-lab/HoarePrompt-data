Output State: **`ans` is 0, `s` is a string with length not equal to 1, `v` has a length greater than 2, `t` and `p` are lists of zeros with the same length as `v`, `i` is 3, `j` is updated to the value stored at index `j` in the list `p`, for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be greater than 0 and `v[j]` should not be equal to `v[i]`**
