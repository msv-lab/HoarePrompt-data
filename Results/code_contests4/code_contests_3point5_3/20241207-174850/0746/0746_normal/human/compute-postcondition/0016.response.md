According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t. If the length of t is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `ans` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to the length of t is at least 2, i is 0, and t is a string with a length of 2.
State: **`ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `t` is a string with a length of at least 2, for the loop to execute the first time `t` is a string with a length of 2**
