Functionality: The function `func_2` accepts two strings `t` and `s`, and an integer `c`. It performs different operations based on the length of string `s`.
- If the length of `s` is 1, it iterates over `t` and calculates the difference between the first character of each element in `t` and the first character of `s`, then returns the total.
- If the length of `s` is 2, it counts the number of times the characters at index 0 and 1 of string `s` appear consecutively in string `t`.
- For other cases, it constructs a new list `v` based on the input strings and iterates to find patterns that match specific conditions, returning the total count of satisfying conditions.

The function's actual functionality may differ from the annotations provided, as the annotations do not cover all possible edge cases or accurately describe the behavior of the code. It's essential to consider the actual code execution rather than relying solely on the annotations.
