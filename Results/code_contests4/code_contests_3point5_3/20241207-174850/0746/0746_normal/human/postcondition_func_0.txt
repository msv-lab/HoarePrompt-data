The function `func_1` accepts a list of strings `ar`, where each string represents a part of a string and is in the format "li-ci". The function processes these strings to create a list of tuples `p`, where each tuple contains the total integer value and the corresponding lowercase English letter. If the second element of the last tuple in `p` is the same as the letter `c` in the current string, the integer value in that tuple is incremented by `x`. The function then returns the list of tuples `p`.
