Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to find all occurrences of string s in string t. The function func_2 is not handling the case where the lengths of s and t are different, leading to incorrect results. Additionally, the logic used in func_2 to find occurrences is flawed and does not align with the problem description. 

An example where the program does not work correctly:
Input
5 3
3-a 2-b 4-c 3-a 2-c
2-a 2-b 1-c

Output
0

In this case, the program should output 1 as there is an occurrence of string s = "aabbc" in string t = "aaabbccccaaacc".
