Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the logic to find all occurrences of string `s` in string `t`. The function `func_2` uses an incorrect approach to find the occurrences and does not handle all potential cases. The logic within the function is not consistent with the problem description and may fail for certain inputs.

For example, consider the following input:
```
Input
5 3
3-a 2-b 4-c 3-a 2-c
2-a 2-b 1-c

Output
1
```
For this input, the expected output should be `0` as there are no occurrences of string `s` in string `t`. However, the provided program incorrectly outputs `1`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
