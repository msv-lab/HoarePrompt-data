Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given Python program correctly calculates the number of distinct good plans as per the problem description. It uses dynamic programming to keep track of the number of bugs in each line of the code written by each programmer and ensures that the total number of bugs in all lines does not exceed the limit specified. The program iterates through all possible combinations of lines written by each programmer and calculates the total number of distinct good plans. Finally, it prints the answer modulo the given integer. The logic and implementation are correct for all potential cases, ensuring that the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
