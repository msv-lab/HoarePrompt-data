Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code initializes variables based on the input constraints and performs calculations within nested loops to calculate the number of distinct good plans.
- It correctly follows the problem description by considering all possible plans where each programmer contributes a specific number of lines, ensuring the total number of bugs in the written lines does not exceed the specified limit.
- The final result is calculated based on the values stored in the `mem` array, which tracks the number of valid plans.
- The code operates within the given constraints and accurately computes the number of distinct good plans modulo `mod`.
- There are no cases identified where the program does not work as expected based on the problem description and provided examples.
