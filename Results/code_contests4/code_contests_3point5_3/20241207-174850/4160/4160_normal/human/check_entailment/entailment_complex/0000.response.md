Correctness: **True**

The program follows the problem description accurately. It initializes variables based on the input constraints, performs calculations within nested loops to calculate the number of distinct good plans, and prints the result modulo `mod`. The final output is the correct answer to the problem described. The program updates the `mem` array correctly based on the bugs per line for each programmer and calculates the final answer as the sum of specific values in the `mem` array. The program adheres to the problem description for all potential cases and provides the correct output.
