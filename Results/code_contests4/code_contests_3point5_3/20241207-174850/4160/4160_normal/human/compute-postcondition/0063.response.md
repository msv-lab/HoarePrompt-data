Example Answer:
`mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`, where `^` represents the XOR operation. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ix` is 1, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `a[i - 1]` is a valid index, `b` is a valid value, `k` is incremented by 1, `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the sum of `mem[ix][j][k]` and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`, for the loop to execute a second time `k` should be less than or equal to `b + 1 and `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`.
Output State: **`ix` is 1, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `a[i - 1]` is a valid index, `b` is a valid value, `k` is incremented by 1, `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the sum of `mem[ix][j][k]` and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`, for the loop to execute a second time `k` should be less than or equal to `b + 1 and `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`.**
