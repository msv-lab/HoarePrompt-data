According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `ix` is 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1. Since `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be 2 and still less than or equal to `m`.
State: **`ix` is 1, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an array, `b` is a constant, `i` is adjusted accordingly, `k` is a variable, `mem` is a multidimensional array where `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the previous values of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k] and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`**
