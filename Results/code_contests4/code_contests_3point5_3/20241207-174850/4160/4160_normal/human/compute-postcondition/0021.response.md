Example Answer:
The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`. The values of `ix`, `j`, and `k` are adjusted, but the specific values are unknown. The states of `a`, `b`, `i`, and `m` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `ix` is adjusted, `j` is adjusted, `m` is adjusted, `a` has a value at index `i - 1`, `b` is greater than or equal to `a[i - 1]`, `i` is adjusted accordingly, `k` is the range from `a[i - 1]` to `b`, `mem` is adjusted based on the loop conditions.
Output State: **`ix` is adjusted, `j` is adjusted, `m` is adjusted, `a` has a value at index `i - 1`, `b` is greater than or equal to `a[i - 1]`, `i` is adjusted accordingly, `k` is the range from `a[i - 1]` to `b`, `mem` is adjusted based on the loop conditions**
