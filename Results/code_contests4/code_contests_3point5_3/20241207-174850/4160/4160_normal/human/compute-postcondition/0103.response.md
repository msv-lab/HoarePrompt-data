According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k`, `a`, `b`, and `i`. The loop will execute if `k` ranges from `a[i - 1]` to `b`. So, before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **the final value of `mem[ix][j+1][k]` will be determined by the values of `mem[ix ^ 1][j+1][k]` and `mem[ix][j][k - a[i - 1]]` after all iterations of the loop have executed, for the loop to execute `k` ranges from `a[i - 1]` to `b`**
