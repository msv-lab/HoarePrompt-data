Output State: **`ix` is 1, `j` is 3, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `a[i - 1]` is a valid index, `b` is a valid value, `k` is equal to `a[i - 1]`, `mem[ix][j][k]` contains the final result after all iterations of the loop have executed, and the value is updated based on the formula `mem[ix][j][k] = add(mem[ix][j][k], mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]])` where `a[i - 1]` is less than or equal to `b`**
