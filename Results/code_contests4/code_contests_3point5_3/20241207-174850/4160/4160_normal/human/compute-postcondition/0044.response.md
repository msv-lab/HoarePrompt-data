According to the code, the loop can execute if `m` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `ix` is assigned the result of the bitwise AND operation between `i` and 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `ix` needs to be 1 (result of the bitwise AND operation between 1 and 1) and `j` needs to start from 1.
State: **`ix` is 1, `j` starts from 1, for the loop to execute `m` is greater than 0**
