Example Answer:
The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`, where `^` represents the XOR operation. The loop will execute one more time when `k` is increased by 1 but less than or equal to `b`. Therefore, the Output State is: `ix` is 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `a[i - 1]` is a valid index, `b` is a valid value, `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated with the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`, and `k` is increased by 1 and less than or equal to `b`.
Output State: **`ix` is 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `a[i - 1]` is a valid index, `b` is a valid value, `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated with the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`, and `k` is increased by 1 and less than or equal to `b`**
