Example Answer:
`mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k] and mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`. The specific values of `ix`, `j`, `m`, `a[i-1]`, `b`, and `k` are not provided, so the resulting state cannot be determined accurately.
Output State: **Cannot determine the specific output state without knowing the specific values of `ix`, `j`, `m`, `a[i-1]`, `b`, and `k`.**
