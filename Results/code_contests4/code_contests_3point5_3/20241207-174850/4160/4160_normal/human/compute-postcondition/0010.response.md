Example Answer:
The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`. The values of `ix`, `j`, and `k` are not changed by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `ix` is 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `a[i - 1]` is less than or equal to `b`, `i` is adjusted accordingly, `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the previous value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`.
Output State: **`ix` is 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `a[i - 1]` is less than or equal to `b`, `i` is adjusted accordingly, `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the previous value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]**
