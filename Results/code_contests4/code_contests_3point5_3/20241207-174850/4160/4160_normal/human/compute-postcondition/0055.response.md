According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `m` is greater than 0. Since `j` is increased by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be 2 and `m` must be greater than or equal to 2.
State: **`ix` is 1, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `a[i - 1]` is a valid index, `b` is a valid value, `mem[ix][j][k]` contains the final result after all iterations of the loop have executed**
