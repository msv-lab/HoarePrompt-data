Example Answer:
The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated by adding the value of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`. The previous values of `mem[ix][j][k]`, `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`, and `a[i]` are needed to calculate the result. Since the initial states are given, `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the previous value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`, `a[i]`, and `j` and `k` values. 
Output State: **`ix` is 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `a[i]` satisfies the condition for the loop, `i` is adjusted accordingly, `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the previous value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k] for the next iteration**
