Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the value of `ans`, which is the sum of all `mem[n & 1][m][i]` for i ranging from 0 to `b`. Given the initial state, `i` is equal to `b + 1`, and `k` ranges from 0 to `b`. Therefore, the output state after executing the code is:
Output State: **The code snippet prints the sum of all `mem[n & 1][m][i]` for i ranging from 0 to `b`**
