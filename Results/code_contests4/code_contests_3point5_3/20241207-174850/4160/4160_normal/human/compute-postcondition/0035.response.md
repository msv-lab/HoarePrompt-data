Example Answer:
The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`. The other variables remain the same as they are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `ix`, `j+1`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `k+1`, `mem[ix][j+1][k+1]` are updated based on loop conditions, and `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`.
Output State: **`ix`, `j+1`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `k+1`, `mem[ix][j+1][k+1]` are updated based on loop conditions, and `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`**
