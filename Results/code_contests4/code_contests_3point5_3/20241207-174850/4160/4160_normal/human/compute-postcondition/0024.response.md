Example Answer:
The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated to the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ix` is adjusted, `j` is adjusted, `m` is adjusted, `a` has a value at index `i`, `b` is greater than or equal to `a[i]`, `i` is adjusted accordingly, `k` is the range from `a[i]` to `b`, `mem` is adjusted based on the loop conditions, `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated.
Output State: **`ix` is adjusted, `j` is adjusted, `m` is adjusted, `a` has a value at index `i`, `b` is greater than or equal to `a[i]`, `i` is adjusted accordingly, `k` is the range from `a[i]` to `b`, `mem` is adjusted based on the loop conditions, `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated**
