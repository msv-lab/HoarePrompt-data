According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k`, `a`, `b`, and `i`. If `k` is less than or equal to `b`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated according to the calculation mentioned. So for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **The value of `mem[ix][j][k+1]` is updated according to the calculation mentioned**
