Example Answer:
The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated by adding the previous value of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`. The loop will execute one more time if `k` is less than or equal to `b`. The initial states of variables `ix`, `j`, `m`, and `a[i]` remain the same. The value of `i` may be adjusted based on the loop condition. Therefore, the Output State is: `ix` is 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `a[i]` satisfies the loop condition, `i` may be adjusted, `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the previous value, and the loop may execute one more time.
Output State: **`ix` is 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `a[i]` satisfies the loop condition, `i` may be adjusted, `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the previous value, and the loop may execute one more time**
