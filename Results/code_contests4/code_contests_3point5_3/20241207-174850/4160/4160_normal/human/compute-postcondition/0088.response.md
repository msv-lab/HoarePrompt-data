Example Answer:
`mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`. Since we are only copying the value from one cell to another, the state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ix` can be 0 or 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `a[i-1]` is a valid index, `b` is a valid value, `k` is less than `b+1`, and `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k] and mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]].
Output State: **`ix` can be 0 or 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `a[i-1]` is a valid index, `b` is a valid value, `k` is less than `b+1`, and `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k] and mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]**
