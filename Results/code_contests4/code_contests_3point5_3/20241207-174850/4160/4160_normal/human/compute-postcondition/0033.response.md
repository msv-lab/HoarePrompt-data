Example Answer:
`mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the result of adding the current value of `mem[ix][j][k]` with the value of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. 
Output State: **`ix`, `j+1`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `k`, `mem[ix][j+1][k]` are updated based on loop conditions, and `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` after performing the addition operation described above.**
