According to the code, the final value of `mem[ix][j][k]` will be determined by the values of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` after all iterations of the loop have executed. At the end of the last iteration, the loop has executed for values of `j` from 1 to `m`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1 and still be less than or equal to `m`.
State: **the final value of `mem[ix][j+1][k]` will be determined by the values of `mem[ix ^ 1][j+1][k]` and `mem[ix][j][k - a[i - 1]]` after all iterations of the loop have executed**
