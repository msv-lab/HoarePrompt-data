According to the code, the loop will execute for each value of `j` from 1 to `m`. At the end of the previous iteration, `ix` is 1, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the next state should be:
State: **`ix` is 1, `j` is 3, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `a[i - 1]` is a valid index, `b` is a valid value, `k` is within the range of `a[i - 1]` to `b`, `mem[ix][j][k]` contains the final result after all iterations of the loop have executed**
