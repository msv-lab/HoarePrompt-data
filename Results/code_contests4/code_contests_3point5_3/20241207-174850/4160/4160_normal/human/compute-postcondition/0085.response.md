Example Answer:
The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`, where `^` represents the XOR operation. The previous values of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` are used in this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `ix` can be 0 or 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `a[i-1]` is a valid index, `b` is a valid value, `k` is less than `b`, and `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`.
Output State: **`ix` can be 0 or 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `a[i-1]` is a valid index, `b` is a valid value, `k` is less than `b`, and `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]**
