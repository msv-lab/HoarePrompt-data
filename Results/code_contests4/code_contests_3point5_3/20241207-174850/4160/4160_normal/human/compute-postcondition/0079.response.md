Example Answer:
`ix` is assigned the result of `i & 1`, where `i & 1` is a bitwise AND operation. The value of `ix` will be either 0 or 1 based on the least significant bit of `i`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `ix` is either 0 or 1, `j` is `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `a[i]` is a valid index, `b` is a valid value, `k` ranges from `a[i]` to `b`, `mem[ix][j][k]` contains the final result after all iterations of the loop have executed.
Output State: **`ix` is either 0 or 1, `j` is `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `a[i]` is a valid index, `b` is a valid value, `k` ranges from `a[i]` to `b`, `mem[ix][j][k]` contains the final result after all iterations of the loop have executed**
