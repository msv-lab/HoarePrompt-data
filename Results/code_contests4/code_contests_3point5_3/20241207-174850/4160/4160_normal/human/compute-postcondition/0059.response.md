According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `j`. If `k` is less than or equal to `b`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ix` is 1, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `a[i - 1]` is a valid index, `b` is a valid value. For the loop to execute again `k` should be within the range of `a[i - 1]` to `b`. 
At the end of the last iteration, `k` was already set to `b`, so for the loop to execute one more time `k` should be incremented by 1.
State: **`ix` is 1, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `a[i - 1]` is a valid index, `b` is a valid value, for the loop to execute a second time `k` is incremented by 1**
