Example Answer:
The lambda function `mult` takes two parameters `a` and `b`, computes the product of `a` mod `mod` and `b` mod `mod`, and then takes the result mod `mod` again. Since `a` and `b` can be any positive integers, and `mod` is a positive integer as well, the output of the function `mult` will be within the range 0 to `mod - 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: n, m, b, mod are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 500, 0 <= b <= 500, 1 <= mod <= 109 + 7, ai (bug count per line for each programmer) are non-negative integers such that 0 <= ai <= 500, `mult` is a lambda function that computes the product of two integers modulo `mod`.
Output State: **n, m, b, mod are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 500, 0 <= b <= 500, 1 <= mod <= 109 + 7, ai (bug count per line for each programmer) are non-negative integers such that 0 <= ai <= 500, `mult` is a lambda function that computes the product of two integers modulo `mod`**
