Example Answer:
`mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`, where `ix`, `j`, and `k` are used to access elements of a 3-dimensional array. The value of `k` must be less than or equal to `b - 1` for the loop to execute a second time. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the previous values of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`, `j`, and `k + 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be less than or equal to `b - 1.
Output State: **`mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the previous values of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`, `j`, and `k + 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be less than or equal to `b - 1**
