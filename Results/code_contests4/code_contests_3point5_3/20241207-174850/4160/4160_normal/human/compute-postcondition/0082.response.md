Example Answer:
`mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`, where `^` represents the bitwise XOR operation. The values of `ix`, `j`, and `k` are unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ix` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `a[i-1]` is a valid index, `b` is a valid value, `k` ranges from `a[i-1]` to `b`, for the loop to execute `i` is such that `a[i-1]` is a valid index.
Output State: **`ix` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `a[i-1]` is a valid index, `b` is a valid value, `k` ranges from `a[i-1]` to `b`, for the loop to execute `i` is such that `a[i-1]` is a valid index**
