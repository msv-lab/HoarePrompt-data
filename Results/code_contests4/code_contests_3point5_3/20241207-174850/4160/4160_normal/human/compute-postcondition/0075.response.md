Example Answer:
The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated by adding the value of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`. The previous values of `ix`, `j`, `k`, `a[i - 1]`, `b`, and `mem` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `ix` is 1, `j` is 4, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `a[i - 1]` is a valid index, `b` is a valid value, `k` is increased by 1 and less than or equal to `b`, and `mem[ix][j][k]` contains the final result after all iterations of the loop have executed with the updated value.
Output State: **`ix` is 1, `j` is 4, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `a[i - 1]` is a valid index, `b` is a valid value, `k` is increased by 1 and less than or equal to `b`, `mem[ix][j][k]` contains the final result after all iterations of the loop have executed with the updated value**
