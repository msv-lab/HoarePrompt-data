According to the code, the loop can execute if `a[i - 1]` is less than or equal to `b`. Before the loop starts, `ix` can be 0 or 1, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `a[i-1]` is a valid index, `b` is a valid value, and `k` ranges from `a[i-1]` to `b`. At the end of the last iteration, the value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is the final result. So, for the loop to execute, `a[i - 1]` must be less than or equal to `b` and `k` is now equal to `a[i - 1]`.
State: **`ix` can be 0 or 1, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `a[i-1]` is a valid index, `b` is a valid value, `k` ranges from `a[i-1]` to `b`, and the value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is the final result after all iterations of the loop have executed, for the loop to execute `a[i - 1]` is less than or equal to `b`, `k` is equal to `a[i - 1]`.**
