Example Answer:
The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated with the sum of the current value of `mem[ix][j][k]` and the value of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`. The values of `ix`, `j`, `m`, `a[i - 1]`, `b`, and `k` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `ix` is 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `a[i - 1]` is a valid index, `b` is a valid value, `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated with the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`, and `k` is increased by 1 and less than or equal to `b.
Output State: **`ix` is 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `a[i - 1]` is a valid index, `b` is a valid value, `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated with the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`, and `k` is increased by 1 and less than or equal to `b**
