According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, before the loop starts, the following adjustments need to be made:
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m`, `b`, `mod` are positive integers, `a` is a list of positive integers, `mem` is a 3D list initialized with zeros, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1**
