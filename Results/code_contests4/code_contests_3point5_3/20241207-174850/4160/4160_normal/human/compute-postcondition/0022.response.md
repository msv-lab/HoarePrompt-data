Example Answer:
The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated by adding the value of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`. The states of other variables remain the same. 
Output State: **`ix` is adjusted, `j` is adjusted, `m` is adjusted, `a` has a value at index `i - 1`, `b` is greater than or equal to `a[i - 1]`, `i` is adjusted accordingly, `k` is the range from `a[i - 1]` to `b`, `mem` is adjusted based on the loop conditions, `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated**
