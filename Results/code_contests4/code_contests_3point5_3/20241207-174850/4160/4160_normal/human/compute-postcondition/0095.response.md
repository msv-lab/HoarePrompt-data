According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `a`, `b`, `i`, `j`, `k`, and the values stored in `mem`. 

At the end of the last iteration, the value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated by adding the value of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` to it. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` needs to be adjusted. Since the loop starts from `a[i - 1]` and goes up to `b + 1`, for the next iteration, the value of `k` should be incremented by 1.

State: **The value of `mem[ix][j][k+1]` is updated by adding the value of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` to it**
