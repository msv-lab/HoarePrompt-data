Output State: **`ix` is 1, `j` is `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `a[i - 1]` is a valid index, `b` is a valid value, `i` is `b + 1`, `k` ranges from 0 to `b`, `mem[ix][j][k]` contains the final result after all iterations of the loop have executed, `ans` is updated by adding the value of `mem[n & 1][m][i]**
