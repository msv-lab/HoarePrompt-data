Example Answer:
The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`. The initial states of the variables are given, so after execution, the value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is equal to the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `ix` is 1, `j` is 3, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `a[i - 1]` is a valid index, `b` is a valid value, `k` is equal to `a[i - 1]`, `mem[ix][j][k]` contains the final result after all iterations of the loop have executed, for the loop to execute `a[i - 1]` is less than or equal to `b.
Output State: **`ix` is 1, `j` is 3, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `a[i - 1]` is a valid index, `b` is a valid value, `k` is equal to `a[i - 1]`, `mem[ix][j][k]` contains the final result after all iterations of the loop have executed, for the loop to execute `a[i - 1]` is less than or equal to `b**
