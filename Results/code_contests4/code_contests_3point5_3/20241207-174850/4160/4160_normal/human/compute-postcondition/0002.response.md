Example Answer:
The lambda function `rints` is defined to take input from the standard input and split it into integers. The function `rints` will return a list of integers. The variables in the initial state are not affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **n, m, b, mod are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 500, 0 <= b <= 500, 1 <= mod <= 109 + 7, ai (bug count per line for each programmer) are non-negative integers such that 0 <= ai <= 500, `mult` is a lambda function that computes the product of two integers modulo `mod`**
