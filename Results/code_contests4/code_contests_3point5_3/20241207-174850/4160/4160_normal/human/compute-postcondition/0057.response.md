Example Answer:
The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`, where `^` denotes the XOR operation. The previous values of `ix`, `j`, and `k` are known as 1, 2, and within the range of `a[i - 1]` to `b` respectively. Therefore, the output state is: `ix` is 1, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `a[i - 1]` is a valid index, `b` is a valid value, for the loop to execute `k` is within the range of `a[i - 1]` to `b`, and the value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is now equal to the previous value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`.
Output State: **`ix` is 1, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `a[i - 1]` is a valid index, `b` is a valid value, for the loop to execute `k` is within the range of `a[i - 1]` to `b`, `mem[ix][j][k]` is the previous value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`**
