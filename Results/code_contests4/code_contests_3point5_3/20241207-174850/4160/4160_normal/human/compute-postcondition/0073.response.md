According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `a`, `b`, `i`, and the array `a`. If `k` is less than or equal to `b`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ix` is 1, `j` is 4, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `a[i - 1]` is a valid index, `b` is a valid value, `k` is equal to `a[i - 1]`, `mem[ix][j][k]` contains the final result after all iterations of the loop have executed. 
So, for the loop to be executed one more time, `k` needs to be increased by 1 and must be less than or equal to `b`.
State: **`ix` is 1, `j` is 4, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `a[i - 1]` is a valid index, `b` is a valid value, `k` is increased by 1 and less than or equal to `b`, `mem[ix][j][k]` contains the final result after all iterations of the loop have executed**
