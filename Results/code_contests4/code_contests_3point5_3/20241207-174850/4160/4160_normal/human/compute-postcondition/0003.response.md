Example Answer:
`n`, `m`, `b`, and `mod` are assigned the values returned by the function `rints()`. The values of `n`, `m`, `b`, and `mod` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `b`, and `mod` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `b`, and `mod` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints**
