According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `a`, `b`, `i`, and the values in `mem[ix][j][k]`. If `k` is less than or equal to `b`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the result of the addition operation. To execute the loop one more time, `k` would need to be incremented by 1.

State: **The value of `mem[ix][j][k+1]` needs to be updated based on the result of the addition operation for the loop to execute another time, where `k+1` is less than or equal to `b`**
