Example Answer:
The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the previous values of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`, `j`, and `k + 1`. The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is determined by adding the value of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` to it. The loop will execute a second time if `k` is less than or equal to `b`. Therefore, the Output State is: `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the previous values of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`, `j`, and `k + 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be less than or equal to `b`.
Output State: **`mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the previous values of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`, `j`, and `k + 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be less than or equal to `b`**
