Example Answer:
`mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the sum of `mem[ix][j][k]` and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`. The values of `ix`, `j`, `k`, `m`, `a[i - 1]`, `b` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `ix` is 1, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `a[i - 1]` is a valid index, `b` is a valid value, for the loop to execute a second time `k` is incremented by 1, `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the sum of `mem[ix][j][k]` and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`.
Output State: **`ix` is 1, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `a[i - 1]` is a valid index, `b` is a valid value, for the loop to execute a second time `k` is incremented by 1, `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the sum of `mem[ix][j][k]` and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]**
