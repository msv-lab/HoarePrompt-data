Example Answer:
`mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`. The value of `ix` is 1, so `ix ^ 1` results in 0. The values of `j` and `k` remain unchanged. The loop will execute one more time if `k` is less than or equal to `b`. Therefore, the Output State is: `ix` is 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `a[i]` satisfies the condition for the loop, `i` is adjusted accordingly, `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the previous value of `mem[0][j][k]`, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than or equal to `b`.
Output State: **`ix` is 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `a[i]` satisfies the condition for the loop, `i` is adjusted accordingly, `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the previous value of `mem[0][j][k]`, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than or equal to `b`**
