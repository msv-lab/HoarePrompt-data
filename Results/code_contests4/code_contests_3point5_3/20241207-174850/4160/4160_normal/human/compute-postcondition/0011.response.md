Example Answer:
`mem[ix][j][k]` is updated by adding the value of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`. The previous values of `mem[ix][j][k]`, `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`, `ix`, `j`, `k`, `a`, and `i` are used in this calculation. After execution, the new value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is determined based on the previous values. Therefore, the Output State is: `ix` is 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `a[i - 1]` is less than or equal to `b`, `i` is adjusted accordingly, and `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the previous value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k].
Output State: **`ix` is 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `a[i - 1]` is less than or equal to `b`, `i` is adjusted accordingly, `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the previous value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]**
