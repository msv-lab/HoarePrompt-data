According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `ix`, `j`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `k` are updated based on the loop conditions, and `mem[ix][j][k]` is the final value after all iterations of the loop have finished. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`ix`, `j+1`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `k`, `mem[ix][j+1][k]` are updated based on the loop conditions**
