Example Answer:
The lambda function `add` is defined to take two parameters `a` and `b`, add them together, and then take the modulo `mod` of the result. The values of the variables `n`, `m`, `b`, and `mod` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n, m, b, mod are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 500, 0 <= b <= 500, 1 <= mod <= 109 + 7. ai (bug count per line for each programmer) are non-negative integers such that 0 <= ai <= 500.
Output State: **n, m, b, mod are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 500, 0 <= b <= 500, 1 <= mod <= 109 + 7. ai (bug count per line for each programmer) are non-negative integers such that 0 <= ai <= 500.**
