According to the code, the loop iterates over the range of `1` to `n + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be updated to the next value after the last iteration.

State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, the values of `ix`, `j`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `k`, `mem` will be updated based on the calculations described in the loop code. The final values of `mem[ix][j][k]` will reflect the cumulative changes made throughout all iterations of the loop. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to the next value after the last iteration**
