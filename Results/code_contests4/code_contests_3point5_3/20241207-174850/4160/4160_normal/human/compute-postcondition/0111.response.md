Example Answer:
`mem[ix][j][k]` is updated by adding the value of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` to its current value. The values of `ix`, `j`, and `k` are used to index the `mem` array. The loop will execute a second time only if `k` is less than or equal to `b - 1`. 
Output State: **`mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the previous values of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`, `j`, and `k + 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be less than or equal to `b - 1, `ix`, `j`, and `k` are used as indexes for the `mem` array.**
