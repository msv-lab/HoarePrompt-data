Example Answer:
The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated with the sum of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`. The variables `ix`, `j`, `m`, `a`, `b` are not affected by this operation. The value of `k` is increased by 2 and less than or equal to `b`. Therefore, the Output State is: `ix` is 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `a[i - 1]` is a valid index, `b` is a valid value, `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated with the sum of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`, `k` is increased by 2 and less than or equal to `b.
Output State: **`ix` is 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `a[i - 1]` is a valid index, `b` is a valid value, `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated with the sum of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`, `k` is increased by 2 and less than or equal to `b**
