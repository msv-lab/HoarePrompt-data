According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `ix` is 1, `j` is `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `a[i - 1]` is a valid index, `b` is a valid value, `k` ranges from `a[i - 1]` to `b`, and `mem[ix][j][k]` contains the final result.
To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
State: **`ix` is 1, `j` is `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `a[i]` is a valid index, `b` is a valid value, `k` ranges from `a[i]` to `b`, `mem[ix][j][k]` contains the final result after all iterations of the loop have executed**
