Example Answer:
The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`. The values of `ix`, `j`, `m`, `a[i-1]`, `b`, and `k` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `ix` can be 0 or 1, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `a[i-1]` is a valid index, `b` is a valid value, `k` ranges from `a[i-1]` to `b`, and the value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is the final result after all iterations of the loop have executed.
Output State: **`ix` can be 0 or 1, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `a[i-1]` is a valid index, `b` is a valid value, `k` ranges from `a[i-1]` to `b`, and the value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is the final result after all iterations of the loop have executed**
