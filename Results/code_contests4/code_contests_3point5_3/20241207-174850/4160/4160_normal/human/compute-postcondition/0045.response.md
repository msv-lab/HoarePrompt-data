According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `a`, `b`, `i`, and `m`. If `m` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `ix` is 1 and `j` starts from 1 do not ensure that the loop will execute, so they need to be adjusted to `m` is greater than 0, `ix` is 1, `j` is 1, `a[i - 1]` is a valid index, and `b` is a valid value.
State: **`ix` is 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `a[i - 1]` is a valid index, `b` is a valid value, for the loop to execute the first time**
