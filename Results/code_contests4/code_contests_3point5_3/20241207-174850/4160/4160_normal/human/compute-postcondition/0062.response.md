According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `b` at the end of the last iteration. At the end of the previous iteration, `ix` is 1, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `a[i - 1]` is a valid index, `b` is a valid value, `k` should be incremented by 1 for the loop to execute the second time, and `mem[ix][j][k]` should be assigned the sum of `mem[ix][j][k]` and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`.

State: **`ix` is 1, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `a[i - 1]` is a valid index, `b` is a valid value, `k` is incremented by 1, `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the sum of `mem[ix][j][k]` and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`, for the loop to execute a second time `k` should be less than or equal to `b + 1**.
