According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and `b`. If `k` is less than or equal to `b`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the previous values of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`, `j`, and `k + 1`, `k` is equal to `b`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `k` needs to be less than or equal to `b - 1`.
State: **`mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the previous values of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`, `j`, and `k + 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be less than or equal to `b - 1**
