Example Answer:
The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`. The previous values of `ix`, `j`, and `k` are known, and based on those values, the final result in `mem[ix][j][k]` will be the same as the value in `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `ix` is 1, `j` is 4, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `a[i - 1]` is a valid index, `b` is a valid value, `k` is equal to `a[i - 1]`, `mem[ix][j][k]` contains the final result after all iterations of the loop have executed.
Output State: **`ix` is 1, `j` is 4, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `a[i - 1]` is a valid index, `b` is a valid value, `k` is equal to `a[i - 1]`, `mem[ix][j][k]` contains the final result after all iterations of the loop have executed**
