According to the code, the loop can execute if `b` is at least 0. Before the loop starts, `ix` is 1, `j` is `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `a[i - 1]` is a valid index, `b` is a valid value. To ensure the loop executes, `i` should be 0, `k` should range from 0 to `b`, and `mem[ix][j][k]` should contain the final result after all iterations of the loop have executed.

State: **`ix` is 1, `j` is `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `a[i - 1]` is a valid index, `b` is a valid value, `i` is 0, `k` ranges from 0 to `b`, `mem[ix][j][k]` contains the final result after all iterations of the loop have executed**
