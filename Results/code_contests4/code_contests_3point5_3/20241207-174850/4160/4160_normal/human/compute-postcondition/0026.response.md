According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `mem`. If `k` is less than or equal to `b`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ix`, `j`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `k`, `mem` are adjusted. `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the calculation `add(mem[ix][j][k], mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]])`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`ix`, `j`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `k` is increased by 1, `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the calculation `add(mem[ix][j][k], mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i]])`**
