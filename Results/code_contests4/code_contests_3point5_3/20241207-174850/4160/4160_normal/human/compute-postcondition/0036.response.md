Example Answer:
The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated by adding the value of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` to it. The value of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` depends on the previous values of the variables involved in the calculation, which are not explicitly provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state can be generalized as follows:
Output State: **The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated according to the calculation mentioned.**
