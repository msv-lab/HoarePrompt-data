def func_1(arr):
    for i in range(n):
        tree[ddd][n + i] = arr[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is greater than or equal to the length of `arr`, values are assigned to `tree[ddd][n + i]` for each `i` in `arr`
    for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
        tree[ddd][i] = tree[ddd][i << 1] + tree[ddd][i << 1 | 1]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is greater than or equal to the length of `arr`, `i` is 0, for all `i` in the range from `n - 1` to `0`, `tree[ddd][i]` is updated to the sum of `tree[ddd][i << 1]` and `tree[ddd][i << 1 | 1]`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr` and populates a tree data structure based on the values in `arr`. The function iterates over the elements in `arr` and assigns them to specific positions in the tree. Then, it updates the tree nodes based on specific calculations. The actual return value or purpose of the function is not explicitly defined in the code or annotations.

def func_2(p, value):
    p += n
    tree[ddd][p] = value
    i = p
    while i > 1:
        tree[ddd][i >> 1] = tree[ddd][i] + tree[ddd][i ^ 1]
        
        i >>= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `p` is increased by the value of `n`, `tree[ddd][1]` is assigned the value `value`, `i` is assigned the value of 1, `tree[ddd][1]` is updated based on the sum of `tree[ddd][2]` and `tree[ddd][3]`, `p` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute, `i` is right-shifted by 1 until it reaches 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `p` and `value`. It increases `p` by the value of `n`, assigns `value` to `tree[ddd][p]`, updates the tree values based on certain calculations in a loop, and shifts `i` until it reaches 1. The function seems to be related to tree data structure manipulation, but the exact purpose or functionality is not explicitly provided in the annotations.

def func_3(l, r):
    res = 0
    l += n
    r += n
    while l < r:
        if l & 1:
            res += tree[ddd][l]
            l += 1
        
        if r & 1:
            r -= 1
            res += tree[ddd][r]
        
        l >>= 1
        
        r >>= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `res` is the sum of the values in `tree[ddd]` indexed by the odd positions between the values of `l` and `r`, `l` and `r` are both right shifted by the number of times the loop executed
    return res
    #The program returns the sum of the values in tree[ddd] indexed by the odd positions between the values of l and r, where l and r are both right-shifted by the number of times the loop executed
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts two integer parameters `l` and `r`. It then modifies `l` and `r` by adding an undefined value `n` and right-shifting them within a loop. The function calculates the sum of the values in `tree[ddd]` indexed by the odd positions between the modified values of `l` and `r`. However, the code does not define the variable `tree[ddd]` or `n`, which might lead to errors if not handled properly.
