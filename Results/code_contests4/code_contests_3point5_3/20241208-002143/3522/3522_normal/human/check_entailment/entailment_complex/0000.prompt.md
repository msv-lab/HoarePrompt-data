You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a string S of length N consisting of lowercase English letters.

Process Q queries of the following two types:

* Type 1: change the i_q-th character of S to c_q. (Do nothing if the i_q-th character is already c_q.)
* Type 2: answer the number of different characters occurring in the substring of S between the l_q-th and r_q-th characters (inclusive).

Constraints

* N, Q, i_q, l_q, and r_q are integers.
* S is a string consisting of lowercase English letters.
* c_q is a lowercase English letter.
* 1 \leq N \leq 500000
* 1 \leq Q \leq 20000
* |S| = N
* 1 \leq i_q \leq N
* 1 \leq l_q \leq r_q \leq N
* There is at least one query of type 2 in each testcase.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
S
Q
Query_1
\vdots
Query_Q


Here, Query_i in the 4-th through (Q+3)-th lines is one of the following:


1 i_q c_q



2 l_q r_q


Output

For each query of type 2, print a line containing the answer.

Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_1(arr):
    for i in range(n):
        tree[ddd][n + i] = arr[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is greater than or equal to the length of `arr`, values are assigned to `tree[ddd][n + i]` for each `i` in `arr`
    for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
        tree[ddd][i] = tree[ddd][i << 1] + tree[ddd][i << 1 | 1]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is greater than or equal to the length of `arr`, `i` is 0, for all `i` in the range from `n - 1` to `0`, `tree[ddd][i]` is updated to the sum of `tree[ddd][i << 1]` and `tree[ddd][i << 1 | 1]`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr` and populates a tree data structure based on the values in `arr`. The function iterates over the elements in `arr` and assigns them to specific positions in the tree. Then, it updates the tree nodes based on specific calculations. The actual return value or purpose of the function is not explicitly defined in the code or annotations.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_2(p, value):
    p += n
    tree[ddd][p] = value
    i = p
    while i > 1:
        tree[ddd][i >> 1] = tree[ddd][i] + tree[ddd][i ^ 1]
        
        i >>= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `p` is increased by the value of `n`, `tree[ddd][1]` is assigned the value `value`, `i` is assigned the value of 1, `tree[ddd][1]` is updated based on the sum of `tree[ddd][2]` and `tree[ddd][3]`, `p` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute, `i` is right-shifted by 1 until it reaches 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `p` and `value`. It increases `p` by the value of `n`, assigns `value` to `tree[ddd][p]`, updates the tree values based on certain calculations in a loop, and shifts `i` until it reaches 1. The function seems to be related to tree data structure manipulation, but the exact purpose or functionality is not explicitly provided in the annotations.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_3(l, r):
    res = 0
    l += n
    r += n
    while l < r:
        if l & 1:
            res += tree[ddd][l]
            l += 1
        
        if r & 1:
            r -= 1
            res += tree[ddd][r]
        
        l >>= 1
        
        r >>= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `res` is the sum of the values in `tree[ddd]` indexed by the odd positions between the values of `l` and `r`, `l` and `r` are both right shifted by the number of times the loop executed
    return res
    #The program returns the sum of the values in tree[ddd] indexed by the odd positions between the values of l and r, where l and r are both right-shifted by the number of times the loop executed
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts two integer parameters `l` and `r`. It then modifies `l` and `r` by adding an undefined value `n` and right-shifting them within a loop. The function calculates the sum of the values in `tree[ddd]` indexed by the odd positions between the modified values of `l` and `r`. However, the code does not define the variable `tree[ddd]` or `n`, which might lead to errors if not handled properly.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
