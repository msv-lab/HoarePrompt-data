Based on the provided code and problem description, let's analyze if the program is correct:

1. The program seems to correctly implement the process of changing characters in the string `S` and counting the number of different characters occurring in a substring of `S` based on the queries given.

2. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are used to populate and manipulate a tree data structure to efficiently handle the queries related to different characters in substrings.

3. The code initializes the tree structure, processes the queries, and calculates the number of different characters in the specified substrings.

4. The functions and the overall code seem to follow the problem description by changing characters when required and correctly counting the different characters in the substrings.

Based on the initial assessment, the program appears to be correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. The code handles the queries as described and seems to cover all potential cases.

Correctness: **True**.
