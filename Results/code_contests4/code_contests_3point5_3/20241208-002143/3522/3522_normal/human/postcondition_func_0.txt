The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr` and populates a tree data structure based on the values in `arr`. The function iterates over the elements in `arr` and assigns them to specific positions in the tree. Then, it updates the tree nodes based on specific calculations. The actual return value or purpose of the function is not explicitly defined in the code or annotations.
