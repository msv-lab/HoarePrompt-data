Postcondition: ***r, l, res are integers. If r is odd, l is right shifted by 1, l is incremented by 1, r is decremented by 1, res is incremented by the value of tree[ddd][r]. For the loop to execute again, l must be less than r. Additionally, if r is odd, res is further incremented by the value of tree[ddd][l] and l is incremented by 1.***
