Example Answer:
Since only `r` is affected by the code, it is right shifted by 1. Depending on its initial value being odd or even, the impact of the right shift varies. If `r` was odd, then after right shifting by 1, it becomes half of its original value. Therefore, the Output State is: If r is odd, l is right shifted by 1, l is incremented by 1, r is decremented by 1, res is incremented by the value of tree[ddd][r]. For the loop to execute again, l must be less than r. Additionally, if r is odd, res is further incremented by the value of tree[ddd][l] and l is incremented by 1.
Output State: **If r is odd, l is right shifted by 1, l is incremented by 1, r is decremented by 1, res is incremented by the value of tree[ddd][r]. For the loop to execute again, l must be less than r. Additionally, if r is odd, res is further incremented by the value of tree[ddd][l] and l is incremented by 1.**
