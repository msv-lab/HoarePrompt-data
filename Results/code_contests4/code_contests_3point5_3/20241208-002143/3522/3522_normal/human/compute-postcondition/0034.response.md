The function `func_3` accepts two parameters, `l` and `r`. Both `l` and `r` are integers. The function returns the sum of the values in tree[ddd] indexed by the odd positions between the values of `l` and `r`, where `l` and `r` are both right-shifted by the number of times the loop executed. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept two integer parameters `l` and `r`, right-shift them by the number of times the loop executed, and return the sum of the values in tree[ddd] indexed by the odd positions between the modified values of `l` and `r`.
