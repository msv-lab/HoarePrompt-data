Example Answer:
The value of `res` is incremented by the value of `tree[ddd][l]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: if r is odd, then l is less than r, l is incremented by n, r is assigned the value of r + n, res is incremented by the value of tree[ddd][r], and r is even, for the loop to execute again l is less than r; res is incremented by the value of tree[ddd][l].
Output State: **if r is odd, then l is less than r, l is incremented by n, r is assigned the value of r + n, res is incremented by the value of tree[ddd][r], and r is even, for the loop to execute again l is less than r; res is incremented by the value of tree[ddd][l]**
