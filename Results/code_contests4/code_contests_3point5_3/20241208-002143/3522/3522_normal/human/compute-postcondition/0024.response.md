Example Answer:
The value of `res` is incremented by the value of `tree[ddd][l]`. The loop will execute again as long as `l` is less than `r`. There are no changes to the values of `l`, `r`, or `ddd`. 
Output State: **If r is odd, l is right shifted by 1, l is incremented by 1, r is decremented by 1, res is incremented by the value of tree[ddd][r]. For the loop to execute again, l must be less than r, res is incremented by the value of tree[ddd][l]**
