Example Answer: 
`l` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `l` is unknown, so after execution, `l` will be increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: If r is odd, l is right shifted by 1, l is incremented by 1, r is decremented by 1, res is incremented by the value of tree[ddd][r]. For the loop to execute again, l must be less than r, res is incremented by the value of tree[ddd][l]; l is incremented by 1.
Output State: **If r is odd, l is right shifted by 1, l is incremented by 1, r is decremented by 1, res is incremented by the value of tree[ddd][r]. For the loop to execute again, l must be less than r, res is incremented by the value of tree[ddd][l]; l is incremented by 1**
