According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `r`. If `l` is less than `r`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `res` is 0, `l` is incremented by `n`, `r` is assigned the value of `r + n`. For the loop to execute the first time, `l` must be less than `r`. Therefore, `l` needs to be adjusted to be less than `r`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`res` is 0, `l` is less than `r`, `l` is incremented by `n`, `r` is assigned the value of `r + n`**
