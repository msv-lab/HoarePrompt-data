Example Answer:
If r is odd, the value of l is less than r and incremented by 1, r is assigned the value of r - 1, and res is incremented by the value of tree[ddd][r]. If r is even, no changes are made. Therefore, the Output State is: If r is odd, then l is less than r and incremented by 1, r is assigned the value of r - 1, res is incremented by the value of tree[ddd][r]. For the loop to execute again, l must be less than r. If r is even, no changes are made.
Output State: **If r is odd, then l is less than r and incremented by 1, r is assigned the value of r - 1, res is incremented by the value of tree[ddd][r]. For the loop to execute again, l must be less than r. If r is even, no changes are made.**
