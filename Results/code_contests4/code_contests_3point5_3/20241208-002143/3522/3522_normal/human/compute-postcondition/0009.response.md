Example Answer:
The value of `r` is decremented by 1. As the initial state mentions that `r` is odd, after decrementing by 1, `r` will become even. The other variables and conditions remain the same.
Output State: **`res` is an integer, `l` is less than `r`, `l` is incremented by `n`, `r` is assigned the value of `r + n`. If l is odd, `res` is incremented by the value of `tree[ddd][l]`. The value of `r` is even**
