According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `r`. If `l` is less than `r`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, if `r` is odd, then `l` is less than `r`, `l` is incremented by `n`, `r` is assigned the value of `r + n`, `res` is incremented by the value of `tree[ddd][r]`, and `r` is even. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:

State: **`if r is odd, then l is less than r, l is incremented by n, r is assigned the value of r + n, res is incremented by the value of tree[ddd][r], and r is even, for the loop to execute again l is less than r`**
