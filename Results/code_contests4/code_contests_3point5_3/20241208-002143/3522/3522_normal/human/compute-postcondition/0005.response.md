Example Answer:
`res` is incremented by the value of `tree[ddd][l]`, where `ddd` is a given index, and `l` is incremented by `n` and is odd. The previous value of `res` is 0, and the values of `l` and `r` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is incremented by the value of `tree[ddd][l]`.
Output State: **`res` is incremented by the value of `tree[ddd][l]**.
