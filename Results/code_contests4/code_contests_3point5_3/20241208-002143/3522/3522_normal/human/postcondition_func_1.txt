The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `p` and `value`. It increases `p` by the value of `n`, assigns `value` to `tree[ddd][p]`, updates the tree values based on certain calculations in a loop, and shifts `i` until it reaches 1. The function seems to be related to tree data structure manipulation, but the exact purpose or functionality is not explicitly provided in the annotations.
