The function `func_3` accepts two integer parameters `l` and `r`. It then modifies `l` and `r` by adding an undefined value `n` and right-shifting them within a loop. The function calculates the sum of the values in `tree[ddd]` indexed by the odd positions between the modified values of `l` and `r`. However, the code does not define the variable `tree[ddd]` or `n`, which might lead to errors if not handled properly.
