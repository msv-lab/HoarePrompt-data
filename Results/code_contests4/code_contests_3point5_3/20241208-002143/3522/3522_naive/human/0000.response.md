Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly handle the query of type 2. The function `func_3(l, r)` is not correctly calculating the number of different characters occurring in the substring of S between the l_q-th and r_q-th characters (inclusive). Instead, it is just counting the number of non-zero elements in the range, which does not represent the number of different characters.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following input and query:
```
7
abcdbbd
6
2 3 6
1 5 z
2 1 1
1 4 a
1 7 d
2 1 7
```
For the query `2 1 7`, the expected output should be `4` (as there are 4 different characters 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' in the substring 'abcdbbd'). However, the current implementation will not produce the correct output.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
