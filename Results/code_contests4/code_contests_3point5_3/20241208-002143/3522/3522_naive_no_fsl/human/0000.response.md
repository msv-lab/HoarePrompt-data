Correctness: **False**

The given Python program is incorrect because the function `func_3` always returns the total number of characters in the substring instead of the number of different characters occurring in the substring. This violates the problem description where it is required to count the number of different characters. 

For example, if the input is:
```
7
abcdbbd
6
2 3 6
1 5 z
2 1 1
1 4 a
1 7 d
2 1 7
```

The expected output should be:
```
3
1
5
```

However, the program will output incorrect values for the queries of type 2 as it does not count the number of different characters correctly.
