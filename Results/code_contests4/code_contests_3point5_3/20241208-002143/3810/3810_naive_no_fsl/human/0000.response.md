Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The provided Python program takes t requests as input, each containing three integers ni, li, ri. It then iterates over each request and checks if it is possible to gather the sum of exactly ni berubleys using only coins with an integer denomination from li to ri berubleys. The program uses a binary search approach to determine if the donation can be paid.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the input constraints (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ ni, li, ri ≤ 10^9, li ≤ ri) and uses appropriate data structures and algorithms to efficiently solve the problem. Since the program logic aligns with the problem description and there are no apparent issues in the implementation, the correctness of the program is deemed to be True.
