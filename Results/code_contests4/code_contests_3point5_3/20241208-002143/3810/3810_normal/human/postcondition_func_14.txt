The function `func_15` accepts three parameters `x`, `y`, and `p`. It calculates the result based on the iterative operations within the loop and returns the final result stored in variable `res`. The variable `y` will become 0 after all iterations of the loop. The function employs modular arithmetic to compute the result.
