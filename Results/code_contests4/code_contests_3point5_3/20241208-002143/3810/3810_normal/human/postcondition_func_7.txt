The function func_8 accepts a list 'l' and returns the list sorted in reverse order based on the custom key function 'getKey'. The function does not define the implementation of the custom key function 'getKey', so its behavior is dependent on the implementation of 'getKey'. No edge cases or missing functionality are addressed in the provided code and annotations.
