Correctness: **True**

The annotated program takes t queries, each containing three integers ni, li, ri as input. It then iterates through each query to determine if it is possible to pay the donation amount ni using coins with denominations in the range of li to ri. The program uses binary search to efficiently find the correct denomination range to pay the donation amount. Finally, it outputs "Yes" if the donation can be paid and "No" otherwise.

The program follows the problem description accurately by checking if it is possible to pay the donation amount within the specified denomination range for each query. The logic implemented in the program is correct and ensures that Alexey can enter the university based on the conditions provided in the problem description.
