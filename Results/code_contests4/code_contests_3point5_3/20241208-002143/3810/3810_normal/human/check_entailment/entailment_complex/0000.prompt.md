You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Alexey, a merry Berland entrant, got sick of the gray reality and he zealously wants to go to university. There are a lot of universities nowadays, so Alexey is getting lost in the diversity — he has not yet decided what profession he wants to get. At school, he had bad grades in all subjects, and it's only thanks to wealthy parents that he was able to obtain the graduation certificate.

The situation is complicated by the fact that each high education institution has the determined amount of voluntary donations, paid by the new students for admission — ni berubleys. He cannot pay more than ni, because then the difference between the paid amount and ni can be regarded as a bribe!

Each rector is wearing the distinctive uniform of his university. Therefore, the uniform's pockets cannot contain coins of denomination more than ri. The rector also does not carry coins of denomination less than li in his pocket — because if everyone pays him with so small coins, they gather a lot of weight and the pocket tears. Therefore, a donation can be paid only by coins of denomination x berubleys, where li ≤ x ≤ ri (Berland uses coins of any positive integer denomination). Alexey can use the coins of different denominations and he can use the coins of the same denomination any number of times. When Alexey was first confronted with such orders, he was puzzled because it turned out that not all universities can accept him! Alexey is very afraid of going into the army (even though he had long wanted to get the green uniform, but his dad says that the army bullies will beat his son and he cannot pay to ensure the boy's safety). So, Alexey wants to know for sure which universities he can enter so that he could quickly choose his alma mater.

Thanks to the parents, Alexey is not limited in money and we can assume that he has an unlimited number of coins of each type.

In other words, you are given t requests, each of them contains numbers ni, li, ri. For each query you need to answer, whether it is possible to gather the sum of exactly ni berubleys using only coins with an integer denomination from li to ri berubleys. You can use coins of different denominations. Coins of each denomination can be used any number of times.

Input

The first line contains the number of universities t, (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) Each of the next t lines contain three space-separated integers: ni, li, ri (1 ≤ ni, li, ri ≤ 109; li ≤ ri).

Output

For each query print on a single line: either "Yes", if Alexey can enter the university, or "No" otherwise.

Examples

Input

2
5 2 3
6 4 5


Output

Yes
No

Note

You can pay the donation to the first university with two coins: one of denomination 2 and one of denomination 3 berubleys. The donation to the second university cannot be paid.

    #The program returns a list of values calculated by calling func_3() for each query. The values of t, ni, li, and ri are positive integers within the specified ranges
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_5 does not accept any parameters and simply returns a list of values calculated by calling func_3(). The values of t, ni, li, and ri are expected to be positive integers within the specified ranges, but there is no explicit handling or validation of these parameters within the function itself.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **t is a positive integer representing the number of universities. Each query contains three space-separated integers ni, li, ri such that 1 ≤ ni, li, ri ≤ 10^9 and li ≤ ri.**
def func_6():
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1000000)

    thread = threading.Thread(target=main)
    thread.start()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` sets the recursion limit and stack size, creates a new thread that calls the `main` function to handle queries related to universities. Each query should consist of three positive integers ni, li, ri, where ni represents the number of universities, and li, ri represent the left and right boundaries respectively. The function ensures that ni, li, ri are within the range of 1 to 10^9 and li is less than or equal to ri. However, the function does not accept any parameters as indicated in the annotations, which might be misleading. Missing functionality includes the actual processing of the queries and error handling for invalid input.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_8 accepts a list 'l' and returns the list sorted in reverse order based on the custom key function 'getKey'. The function does not define the implementation of the custom key function 'getKey', so its behavior is dependent on the implementation of 'getKey'. No edge cases or missing functionality are addressed in the provided code and annotations.

#Function 9:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). Each of the next t lines contain three space-separated integers: ni, li, ri (1 ≤ ni, li, ri ≤ 10^9; li ≤ ri).**

    return [[num for x in range(m)] for y in range(n)]
    #The program returns a 2D list where each row contains 'm' repetitions of 'num' and there are 'n' rows in total.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_9` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `num`. It then returns a 2D list where each row contains 'm' repetitions of 'num' and there are 'n' rows in total. The function ensures that `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) and generates the 2D list accordingly.

#Function 11:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **t is a positive integer, ni, li, ri are positive integers such that 1 ≤ ni, li, ri ≤ 10^9 and li ≤ ri.**
def func_11(n):
    return bin(n).replace('0b', '')
    #The program returns the binary representation of the positive integer 'n' after removing the '0b' prefix

#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_13 accepts a positive integer n and a list of tuples r. It then calculates the result of dividing the factorial of n by the product of the factorial of r and the factorial of the maximum value between n-r and 1.

#Function 14:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_14(x, y):

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`. If `x` is divisible by `y`, the function returns the result of integer division of `x` by `y`. If `x` is not divisible by `y`, the function returns the result of dividing `x` by `y` (integer division) and then adding 1 to the result.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_15` accepts three parameters `x`, `y`, and `p`. It calculates the result based on the iterative operations within the loop and returns the final result stored in variable `res`. The variable `y` will become 0 after all iterations of the loop. The function employs modular arithmetic to compute the result.

#Function 16:

    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: n is a positive integer larger than 3 and not divisible by 2 and 3, i is greater than the square root of n. The loop has finished executing, and the condition (n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0) is false for all iterations.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function `func_17` accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of universities. Each university query contains three integers `ni`, `li`, `ri` where 1 ≤ `ni`, `li`, `ri` ≤ 10^9 and `li` ≤ `ri`. The function returns True or False based on specific conditions for different cases of `n`. It returns False if `n` is less than or equal to 1, 3, divisible by 2 or 3, or has factors i and i + 2. It returns True if none of these conditions are met. The program may not return the expected values for all cases as described in the annotations, specifically for the last case where it should return True, but it may return False due to missing logic in the code.

#Function 18:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_18():
    sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
    sys.stdout = open('output.txt', 'w')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_18 does not accept any parameters. It sets the standard input and output to read from 'input.txt' and write to 'output.txt', respectively. The function then returns the number 18.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After all the iterations of the loop have finished, the final values of the variables depend on the values returned by func_1() and func_3(). If the conditions in the loop are met at least once, the final state will have 'f' set to 1 and the program will output 'Yes'. If the conditions are never met, 'f' will remain 0 and the program will output 'No'. The final values of 'n', 'l', 'r', 'low', 'high', 'mid', 'x', 'y' will depend on the specific values assigned at the end of the loop execution based on the conditions met during the loop iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_19` processes `t` queries, each consisting of three space-separated integers. It uses binary search to determine if a given number `n` falls within a range defined by `l` and `r` multiplied by a factor. Depending on the conditions met during the binary search, it outputs 'Yes' or 'No'. The final state of variables including 'n', 'l', 'r', 'low', 'high', 'mid', 'x', 'y' is determined by the specific values assigned at the end of the loop execution based on the conditions met during the loop iterations. The function does not explicitly return any value, but it outputs 'Yes' or 'No' based on the processed queries.

#Function 20:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: The input consists of t requests, where t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. Each request contains three space-separated integers: ni, li, ri (1 <= ni, li, ri <= 10^9; li <= ri).

    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`sep`, `file`, `args` have assigned values. All elements in `args` have been written to the file separated by `sep`. `at_start` is False. A newline character `'\n'` has been written to the file. If the keyword argument 'flush' is True, it has been popped from `kwargs`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_20` does not accept any parameters. It processes multiple requests where each request consists of three integers. It writes these integers to a file stream with a separator between them and a newline character at the end. If the keyword argument 'flush' is True, it flushes the file stream. The function does not return any value.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
