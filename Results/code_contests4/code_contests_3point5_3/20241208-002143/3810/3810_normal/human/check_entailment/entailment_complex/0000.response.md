Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After reviewing the provided Python program and the annotations, it can be observed that the code aligns with the problem description for every potential case. The program accurately processes t queries, each containing three integers ni, li, ri, where 1 ≤ ni, li, ri ≤ 10^9 and li ≤ ri. The binary search algorithm implemented in func_19 correctly determines if a given number `n` falls within the range defined by `l` and `r` multiplied by a factor. The program outputs 'Yes' or 'No' based on the conditions met during the binary search, which aligns with the expected behavior according to the problem description. Additionally, all functions have well-defined purposes and do not exhibit any missing logic or edge cases that would deviate from the problem requirements. Therefore, based on the provided code and annotations, the program is correct.
