The function `func_6` sets the recursion limit and stack size, creates a new thread that calls the `main` function to handle queries related to universities. Each query should consist of three positive integers ni, li, ri, where ni represents the number of universities, and li, ri represent the left and right boundaries respectively. The function ensures that ni, li, ri are within the range of 1 to 10^9 and li is less than or equal to ri. However, the function does not accept any parameters as indicated in the annotations, which might be misleading. Missing functionality includes the actual processing of the queries and error handling for invalid input.
