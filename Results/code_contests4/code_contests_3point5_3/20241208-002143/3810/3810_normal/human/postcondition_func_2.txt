The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. The program reads t requests, where each request contains three integers ni, li, ri (1 ≤ ni, li, ri ≤ 10^9; li ≤ ri). After processing the input, the program returns a map object consisting of integers obtained by converting the input string into a list of integers.
