Example Answer:
`y` is reassigned the value of `r * mid`, but the previous values of the affected variables are not provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `l`, `r`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `x` and `f` remain unchanged, `y` is reassigned the value of `r * mid`.
Output State: **`n`, `l`, `r`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `x` and `f` remain unchanged, `y` is reassigned the value of `r * mid`**
