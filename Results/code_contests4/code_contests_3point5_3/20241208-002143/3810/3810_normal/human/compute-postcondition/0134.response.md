Functionality: **The function `func_19` processes `t` queries, each consisting of three space-separated integers. It uses binary search to determine if a given number `n` falls within a range defined by `l` and `r` multiplied by a factor. Depending on the conditions met during the binary search, it outputs 'Yes' or 'No'. The final state of variables including 'n', 'l', 'r', 'low', 'high', 'mid', 'x', 'y' is determined by the specific values assigned at the end of the loop execution based on the conditions met during the loop iterations. The function does not explicitly return any value, but it outputs 'Yes' or 'No' based on the processed queries.**
