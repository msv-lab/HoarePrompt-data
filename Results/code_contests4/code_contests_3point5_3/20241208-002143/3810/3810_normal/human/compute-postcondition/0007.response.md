Example Answer:
The value of `x` is converted to a string and then written to the file. If `at_start` is False, `sep` is written to the file before `x`. If `at_start` is True, there is no change to `sep` or `file`. The states of `sep` and `file` are not directly affected by the code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` and `file` are assigned values and `x` has been written to the file.
Output State: **`sep` and `file` are assigned values and `x` has been written to the file**
