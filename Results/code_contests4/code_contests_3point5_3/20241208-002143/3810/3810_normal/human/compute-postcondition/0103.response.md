Postcondition: ***`low` is 1, `high` is 1000000000, `f` is 1, `mid` is 500000000, `x` is the product of `l` and `mid`, `n`, `y` are integers, `n`, `l`, `r` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`, `y` is the product of `r` and `mid`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The value of `y` is greater than or equal to `n`***
