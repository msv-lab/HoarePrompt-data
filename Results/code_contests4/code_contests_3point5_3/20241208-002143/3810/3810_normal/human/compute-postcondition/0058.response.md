Example Answer:
`low` is assigned the value of `mid + 1`, and `mid` is 500000000. Therefore, after execution, `low` becomes 500000001. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`low` is 500000001, `high` is 1000000000, `f` is 1, `mid` is 500000000, `x`, `n`, `y` are integers. `x` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` is less than or equal to `y`, and `y` is less than `n`**
