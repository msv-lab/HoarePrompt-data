Output State: **`low`, `high`, `mid`, `x`, `n`, `l`, `r` maintain their initial values, `mid` is calculated as the floor division of the sum of `low` and `high`, `x` is updated to `l` times the floor division of the sum of `low` and `high`, `y` is assigned the value of `r` multiplied by `mid`, `f` is assigned the value 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
