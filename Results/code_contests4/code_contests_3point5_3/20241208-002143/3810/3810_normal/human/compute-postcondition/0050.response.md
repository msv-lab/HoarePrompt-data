Example Answer:
`mid` is assigned the value of the floor division of the sum of `low` and `high`. Since `low` is 1 and `high` is 1000000000, the value of `mid` is 500000000. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is 1, `high` is 1000000000, `f` is 0, `mid` is 500000000.
Output State: **`low` is 1, `high` is 1000000000, `f` is 0, `mid` is 500000000**
