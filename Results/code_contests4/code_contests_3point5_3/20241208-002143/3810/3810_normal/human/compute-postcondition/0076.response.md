Example Answer:
The variable `f` is assigned the value 1. The values of the other variables (`low`, `high`, `mid`, `x`, `n`, `y`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `low`, `high`, `f`, `mid`, `x`, `n`, `y` are integers, `x` is computed as `l * mid`, `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid`, `f` is 1.
Output State: **`low`, `high`, `f`, `mid`, `x`, `n`, `y` are integers, `x` is computed as `l * mid`, `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid`, `f` is 1**
