Postcondition: ***`low`, `high`, `f`, `mid`, `x`, `n`, `y` are integers, `x` is computed as `l * mid`, `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid`, `f` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `x` is less than or equal to `n` and `n` is less than or equal to `y`, then the function executes the if block.***
