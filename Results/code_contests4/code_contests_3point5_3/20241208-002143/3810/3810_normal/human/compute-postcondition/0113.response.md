Example Answer:
`low` is assigned the value `mid + 1`. Since the initial values of all variables remain the same and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, the Output State is: After the if statement executes, the variables `low`, `high`, `f`, `mid`, `x`, `n`, `l`, `r`, and `y` maintain their initial values and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State: **After the if statement executes, the variables `low`, `high`, `f`, `mid`, `x`, `n`, `l`, `r`, and `y` maintain their initial values and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
