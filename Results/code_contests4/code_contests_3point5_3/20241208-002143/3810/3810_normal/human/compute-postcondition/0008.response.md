Example Answer:
The variable `at_start` is assigned the boolean value `False`. The values of `sep` and `file` remain unchanged, and `x` has been written to the file. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` and `file` are assigned values, `x` has been written to the file, `at_start` is False.
Output State: **`sep` and `file` are assigned values, `x` has been written to the file, `at_start` is False**
