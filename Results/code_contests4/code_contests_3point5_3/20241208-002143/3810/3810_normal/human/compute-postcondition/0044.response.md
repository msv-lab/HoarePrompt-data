According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of 'f'. If 'f' is true, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, 'f' is true. So for the loop to execute one more time, 'f' must remain true.
State: **If 'n' is within the range of 'l * mid' and 'r * mid' for some integer 'mid', then 'f' is set to 1, 'f' is true**
