Example Answer:
The `pop()` method removes and returns the last item in the dictionary `kwargs`. In this case, it removes the item with key `'end'` and returns `'\n'`. The `write()` method then writes `'\n'` to the file. The values of `sep`, `file`, `args`, and `at_start` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` and `file` have assigned values, all elements in `args` have been written to the file separated by `sep`, `at_start` is False, and a newline character `'\n'` has been written to the file.
Output State: **`sep` and `file` have assigned values, all elements in `args` have been written to the file separated by `sep`, `at_start` is False, a newline character `'\n'` has been written to the file**
