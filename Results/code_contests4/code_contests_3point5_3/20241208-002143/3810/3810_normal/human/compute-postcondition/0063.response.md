Example Answer:
`mid` is assigned the value of the floor division of the sum of `low` and `high` divided by 2. The values of `low` and `high` are integers. Since the division result is rounded down, `mid` will also be an integer. 
Output State: **`low`, `high`, `f`, `mid`, `x`, `n`, `y` are integers and `low` must be less than or equal to `high`**
