Example Answer:
`y` is assigned the value of `r * mid`, where `r` is not defined in the initial state. The value of `x` is computed as `l * mid`, but `l` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `low`, `high`, `f`, `mid`, `x`, `n`, `y` are integers, `x` is computed as `l * mid`, `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid`.
Output State: **`low`, `high`, `f`, `mid`, `x`, `n`, `y` are integers, `x` is computed as `l * mid`, `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid`**
