Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `r`, `low`, `mid`, `x`, `y` remain unchanged. If `x` is less than or equal to `n` and `n` is less than or equal to `y`, `f` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `y` is less than `n`, the function updates `high` to the value of `mid - 1`.***
