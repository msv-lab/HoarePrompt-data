Example Answer:
The value of `x` is assigned the result of `l * mid`, where `l` and `mid` are known. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `l`, `r`, `low` is assigned the value of `mid + 1`, `high` is assigned the value of `mid - 1`, `mid` is recalculated, `x` is the result of `l * mid`, `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid`, `f` is assigned the value of 1 for the loop to execute again.
Output State: **`n`, `l`, `r`, `low` is assigned the value of `mid + 1`, `high` is assigned the value of `mid - 1`, `mid` is recalculated, `x` is the result of `l * mid`, `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid`, `f` is assigned the value of 1 for the loop to execute again**
