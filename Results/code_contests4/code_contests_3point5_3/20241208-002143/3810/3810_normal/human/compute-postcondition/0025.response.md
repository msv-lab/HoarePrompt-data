Functionality: **The function `func_20` does not accept any parameters. It processes multiple requests where each request consists of three integers. It writes these integers to a file stream with a separator between them and a newline character at the end. If the keyword argument 'flush' is True, it flushes the file stream. The function does not return any value.**
