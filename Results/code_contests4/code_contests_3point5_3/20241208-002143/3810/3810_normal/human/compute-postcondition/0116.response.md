According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `low` and `high`. If `low` is less than or equal to `high`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `low`, `high`, `f`, `mid`, `x`, `n`, `l`, `r`, and `y` maintain their initial values. If `y` is less than `n`, the program breaks out of the loop, so for the loop to execute again, `y` must be greater than or equal to `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`low`, `high`, `f`, `mid`, `x`, `n`, `l`, `r`, and `y` maintain their initial values and for the loop to execute again, `low` is less than or equal to `high` and `y` is greater than or equal to `n`.**
