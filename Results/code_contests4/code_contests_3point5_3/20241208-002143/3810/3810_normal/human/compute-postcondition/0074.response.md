Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value of `l` multiplied by `mid`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `low`, `high`, `f`, `mid`, `x`, `n`, `y` are integers, and `x` is computed as `l * mid`.
Output State: **`low`, `high`, `f`, `mid`, `x`, `n`, `y` are integers, `x` is computed as `l * mid`**
