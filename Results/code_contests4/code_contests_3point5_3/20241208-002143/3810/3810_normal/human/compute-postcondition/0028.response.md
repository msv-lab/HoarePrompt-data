According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `low` and `high`. If `low` is less than or equal to `high`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is less than `n`, so `low` and `high` need to be adjusted to `mid + 1` and `mid - 1` respectively for the loop to execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n`, `l`, `r`, `low` is assigned the value of `mid + 1`, `high` is assigned the value of `mid - 1`, `mid`, `x` remain unchanged, `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid`, `f` is assigned the value of 1 for the loop to execute again**
