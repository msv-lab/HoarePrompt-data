Output State: **After all the iterations of the loop have finished, the final values of the variables depend on the values returned by func_1() and func_3(). If the conditions in the loop are met at least once, the final state will have 'f' set to 1 and the program will output 'Yes'. If the conditions are never met, 'f' will remain 0 and the program will output 'No'. The final values of 'n', 'l', 'r', 'low', 'high', 'mid', 'x', 'y' will depend on the specific values assigned at the end of the loop execution based on the conditions met during the loop iterations.**
