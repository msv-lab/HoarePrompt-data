Postcondition: ***`low`, `high`, `f`, `mid`, `x`, `n`, `y` are integers. If `y` is less than `n`, `low` is updated to 500000001 and `high` remains 1000000000. If `y` is greater than or equal to `n`, `low` remains 1 and `high` is updated to 499999999. In both cases, `f` is 1, `mid` is 500000000, `x` is the product of `l` and `mid`, `n`, `l`, `r` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
