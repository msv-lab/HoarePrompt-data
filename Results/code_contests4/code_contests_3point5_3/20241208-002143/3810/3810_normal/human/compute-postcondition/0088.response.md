According to the code, the loop executes based on the return value of `func_1()`. If the return value of `func_1()` is greater than 0, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `low` is 500000001, `high` is 499999999, `f` is 1. To execute the loop one more time, the return value of `func_1()` must be greater than 0, which means `f` will remain true in this case.
State: **`low` is 500000001, `high` is 499999999, `f` is 1, `mid`, `x`, `n`, `y` are integers. If `f` is true, then the program remains in the same state**.
