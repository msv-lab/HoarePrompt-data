Postcondition: ***`low`, `high`, `f`, `mid`, `x`, `n`, `y` are integers. If `y` < `n`, then `low` is updated to 500000001, `high` remains the same, `f` remains the same, `mid` remains the same, `x` remains the same, `n` remains the same, and `y` remains the same. If `y` >= `n`, then `low` is updated to 1, `high` is updated to 499999999, `f` remains the same, `mid` remains the same, `x` remains the same, `n` remains the same, and `y` remains the same.***
