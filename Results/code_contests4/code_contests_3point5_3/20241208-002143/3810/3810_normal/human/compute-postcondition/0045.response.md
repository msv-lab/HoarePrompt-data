Example Answer:
The function `func_3()` returns three values, which are assigned to `n`, `l`, and `r` respectively. If `n` falls within the range of `l*mid` and `r*mid` for some integer `mid`, then `f` is set to 1, indicating `f` is true. However, without knowing the specific values returned by `func_3()` and the relationship between `n`, `l`, and `r`, we cannot determine the exact state of the variables after execution.
Output State: **The state of the variables `n`, `l`, `r`, and `f` depends on the values returned by `func_3()` and their relationship.**
