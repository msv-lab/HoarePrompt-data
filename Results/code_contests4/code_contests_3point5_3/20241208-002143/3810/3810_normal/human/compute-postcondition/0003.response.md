According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `args`. If `args` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `sep` is assigned a value and `file` is assigned a value, indicating that the loop can execute. `at_start` being True does not directly affect the loop execution. Therefore, to adjust the state for the loop to execute, `args` must not be empty.
State: **`sep` is assigned a value, `file` is assigned a value, `at_start` is True, for the loop to execute `args` is not empty**
