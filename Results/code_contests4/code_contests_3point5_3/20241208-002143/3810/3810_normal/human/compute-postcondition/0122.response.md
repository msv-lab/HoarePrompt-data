Postcondition: ***`low`, `high`, `f`, `mid`, `x`, `n`, `l`, `r` maintain their initial values. `mid` is calculated as the floor division of the sum of `low` and `high`. `x` is updated to `l` times the floor division of the sum of `low` and `high`. `y` is assigned the value of `r` multiplied by `mid`. If `x` is less than or equal to `n` and `n` is less than or equal to `y`, then `f` is assigned the value 1 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
