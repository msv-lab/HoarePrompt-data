Output State: **`low`, `high`, `f`, `mid`, `x`, `n`, `y` are integers. `low` must be less than or equal to `high`. `x` is assigned the value of `low` multiplied by `mid`, `y` is assigned the value of `r` multiplied by `mid`, `f` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if x is less than or equal to n and n is less than or equal to y. `high` is assigned the value of `mid - 1`.**
