Example Answer: 
`at_start` is assigned the boolean value `True`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is assigned the value returned by `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ') and `file` is assigned the value returned by `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)`, `at_start` is True.
Output State: **`sep` is assigned the value returned by `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ') and `file` is assigned the value returned by `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)`, `at_start` is True**
