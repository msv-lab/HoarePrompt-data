Example Answer:
`mid` is assigned the value of `(low + high) // 2`. The values of `low` and `high` are `mid + 1` and `mid - 1` respectively. Therefore, after execution, `mid` will be the average of `mid + 1` and `mid - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `l`, `r`, `low` is assigned the value of `mid + 1`, `high` is assigned the value of `mid - 1`, `mid` is recalculated, `x` remain unchanged, `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid`, `f` is assigned the value of 1 for the loop to execute again.
Output State: **`n`, `l`, `r`, `low` is assigned the value of `mid + 1`, `high` is assigned the value of `mid - 1`, `mid` is recalculated, `x` remain unchanged, `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid`, `f` is assigned the value of 1 for the loop to execute again**
