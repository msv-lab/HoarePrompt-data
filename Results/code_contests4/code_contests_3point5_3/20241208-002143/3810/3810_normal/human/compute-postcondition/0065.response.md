Example Answer:
`y` is assigned the value of `r` multiplied by `mid`. The previous values of the affected variables are as follows: `low`, `high`, `f`, `mid`, `x`, `n` are integers and `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `x` is assigned the value of `low` multiplied by `mid`. Therefore, the Output State is: `low`, `high`, `f`, `mid`, `x`, `n` are integers and `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `x` is assigned the value of `low` multiplied by `mid`, `y` is assigned the value of `r` multiplied by `mid`.
Output State: **`low`, `high`, `f`, `mid`, `x`, `n` are integers and `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `x` is assigned the value of `low` multiplied by `mid`, `y` is assigned the value of `r` multiplied by `mid`**
