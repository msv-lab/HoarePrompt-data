According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`. Right before the loop, `low` is 1 and `high` is 1000000000. Since `low` is already less than or equal to `high`, the loop can execute. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`low` is 1, `high` is 1000000000, `f` is 0**
