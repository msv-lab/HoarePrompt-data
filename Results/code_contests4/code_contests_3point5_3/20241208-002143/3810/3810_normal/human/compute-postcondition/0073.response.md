Example Answer:
`mid` is assigned the value of the integer division of `(low + high) by 2`. Based on the current values of `low` and `high`, `mid` is calculated. The values of other variables (`f`, `x`, `n`, `y`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `low`, `high`, `f`, `mid`, `x`, `n`, `y` are integers.
Output State: **`low`, `high`, `f`, `mid`, `x`, `n`, `y` are integers**
