Postcondition: ***`low` is updated to 500000001, `high` remains 1000000000, `mid` is 500000000, `x` is the product of `l` and `mid`, `n`, `l`, `r` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`. The program breaks out of the loop after the first iteration. If `f` is True, the program executes the if part, otherwise it executes the else part with the same assignments and ends after the first iteration.***
