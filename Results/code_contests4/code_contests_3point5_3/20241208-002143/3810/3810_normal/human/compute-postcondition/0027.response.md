Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `r`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `x`, `y`, `f` are integers. If `y` < `n`, `n`, `l`, `r`, `low` are assigned the value of `mid + 1`, `high`, `mid - 1`, `f` are assigned the value 1, `mid`, `x` remain unchanged, and `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `y` >= `n`, `n`, `l`, `r`, `low`, `high`, `mid - 1`, `f` are assigned the value 1, `mid`, `x` remain unchanged, and `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
