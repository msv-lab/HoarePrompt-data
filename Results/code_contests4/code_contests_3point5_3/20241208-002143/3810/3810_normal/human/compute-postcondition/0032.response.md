Example Answer: 
`f` is assigned the value 1. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `l`, `r`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `x` and `y` remain unchanged, `f` is 1.
Output State: **`n`, `l`, `r`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `x` and `y` remain unchanged, `f` is 1**
