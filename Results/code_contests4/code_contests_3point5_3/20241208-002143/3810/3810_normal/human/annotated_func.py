#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. The program reads t requests, where each request contains three integers ni, li, ri (1 ≤ ni, li, ri ≤ 10^9; li ≤ ri).

Each university query contains three integers `ni`, `li`, `ri` where 1 ≤ `ni`, `li`, `ri` ≤ 10^9 and `li` ≤ `ri`. The function returns True or False based on specific conditions for different cases of `n`. It returns False if `n` is less than or equal to 1, 3, divisible by 2 or 3, or has factors i and i + 2. It returns True if none of these conditions are met. The program may not return the expected values for all cases as described in the annotations, specifically for the last case where it should return True, but it may return False due to missing logic in the code.
