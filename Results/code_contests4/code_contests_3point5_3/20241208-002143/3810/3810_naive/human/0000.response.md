Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine whether Alexey can enter a university based on the given donation amount and the range of coin denominations allowed. The program iterates over each query and uses binary search to find if there exists a denomination within the specified range that can sum up to the required donation amount. If such a denomination exists, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No". The logic is sound and covers all possible cases, making the program correct.
