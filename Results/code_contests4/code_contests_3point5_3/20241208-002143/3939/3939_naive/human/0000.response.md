Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given Python program correctly calculates the number of ways in which the ant can go from vertex D to itself in exactly n steps in a tetrahedron. 
The program uses a memoization technique to keep track of the values and calculates the number of ways based on the previous values. 
For n=1, it correctly returns 3 as there are 3 ways for the ant to return to vertex D in 1 step. 
For n=2, it correctly returns 3 as there are 3 ways for the ant to return to vertex D in 2 steps. 
For n=4, it correctly returns 21 as there are 21 ways for the ant to return to vertex D in 4 steps. 
The program handles all potential cases and gives the correct output for each, so the correctness is True.
