Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the number of ways in which the ant can go from vertex D to itself in exactly n steps for all possible inputs within the given constraints. The logic implemented in the program follows the problem description and provides the correct output modulo 1000000007. The program handles the base cases for n=1 and n=2 separately, and then calculates the number of ways for larger values of n using a memoization approach. Overall, the program is correct for all potential cases.
