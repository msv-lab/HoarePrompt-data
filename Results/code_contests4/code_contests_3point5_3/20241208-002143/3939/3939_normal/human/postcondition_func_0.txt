The function `func` reads an integer `n` from input and performs a sequence generation calculation based on the value of `n`. It then prints the second last value of the sequence if `n` is greater than 2; otherwise, it prints 0 if `n` is 1 and 3 if `n` is 2. The function does not accept any parameters and operates with the predefined integer `n` within the given constraints.
