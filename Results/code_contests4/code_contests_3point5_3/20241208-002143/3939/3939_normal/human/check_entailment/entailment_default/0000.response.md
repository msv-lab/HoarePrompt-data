Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided correctly calculates the number of ways in which the ant can go from the initial vertex D to itself in exactly n steps as described in the problem. It follows the specified sequence generation calculation and returns the correct result modulo 1000000007. Additionally, the output hints agree with the code and further support the correctness of the program. The code handles all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the expected output for each case. Therefore, the code is correct.
