Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the number of ways in which the ant can go from vertex D to itself in exactly n steps within the given constraints. It generates a sequence based on the value of n and prints the second last value of the sequence if n is greater than 2, or prints 0 if n is 1 and 3 if n is 2. The program follows the problem description and produces the correct output for all possible cases.
