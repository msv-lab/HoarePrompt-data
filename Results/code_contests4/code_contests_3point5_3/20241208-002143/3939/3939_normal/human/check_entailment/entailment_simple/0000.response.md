Correctness: **True**

The program correctly counts the number of ways in which the ant can go from vertex D to itself in exactly n steps for a given tetrahedron. It follows the problem description by using a memoization technique to calculate the number of ways iteratively based on the previous values. The program correctly calculates the number of ways modulo 1000000007 and prints the result as required.
