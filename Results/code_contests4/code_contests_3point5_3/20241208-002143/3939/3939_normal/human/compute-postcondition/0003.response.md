According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, memo is 0, 3 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 2 and i is now 0.
State: **`memo` is 0, 3; `MOD` is 1000000007, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 2**
