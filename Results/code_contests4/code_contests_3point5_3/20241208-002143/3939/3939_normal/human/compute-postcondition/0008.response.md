Example Answer:
`x` and `y` are assigned the values from `memo`, which is a tuple with values 3. Therefore, after execution, `x` is 3 and `y` is 3. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`memo` is 3, `MOD` is 1000000007, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 3, `x` is 3, `y` is 3, `value` is 9**
