Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the second last value of the sequence generated by the loop. As per the initial state, `memo` is the second last and last values of the sequence, so printing `memo[1]` will output the second last value of the sequence.
Output State: **The second last value of the sequence generated by the loop is printed.**
