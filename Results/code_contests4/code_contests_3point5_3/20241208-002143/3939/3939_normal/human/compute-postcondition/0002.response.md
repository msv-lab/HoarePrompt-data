Example Answer:
The variable `MOD` is assigned the value `10 ** 9 + 7`, which is a large integer used for modular arithmetic calculations. The values of other variables (`memo`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `memo` is 0, 3; `MOD` is 1000000007.
Output State: **`memo` is 0, 3; `MOD` is 1000000007**
