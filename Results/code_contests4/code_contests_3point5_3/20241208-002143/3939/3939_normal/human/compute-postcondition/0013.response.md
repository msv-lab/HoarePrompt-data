Example Answer:
`value` is assigned the value of `2 * y + 3 * x`, where `y` is 9 and `x` is 9. Therefore, `value` is calculated as 2 * 9 + 3 * 9 = 18 + 27 = 45. The states of the other variables are not affected, so the Output State is: `memo` is 3, `MOD` is 1000000007, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be greater than 4, `x` is 9, `y` is 9, `value` is 45.
Output State: **`memo` is 3, `MOD` is 1000000007, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be greater than 4, `x` is 9, `y` is 9, `value` is 45**
