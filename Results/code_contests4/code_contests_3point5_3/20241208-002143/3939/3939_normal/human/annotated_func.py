#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^7.**
def func():
    n = input()
    memo = 0, 3
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
    for i in range(n - 2):
        x, y = memo
        
        value = 2 * y + 3 * x
        
        memo = y, value % MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `memo` is the second last and last values of the sequence generated by the loop, `MOD` is 1000000007
    if (n > 2) :
        print(memo[1])
    else :
        print(0 if n == 1 else 3)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`memo` is the second last and last values of the sequence generated by the loop, `MOD` is 1000000007. If n is greater than 2, the second last value of the sequence is printed. If n is less than or equal to 2, print 0 if n is 1, else print 3.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `n` from input and performs a sequence generation calculation based on the value of `n`. It then prints the second last value of the sequence if `n` is greater than 2; otherwise, it prints 0 if `n` is 1 and 3 if `n` is 2. The function does not accept any parameters and operates with the predefined integer `n` within the given constraints.
