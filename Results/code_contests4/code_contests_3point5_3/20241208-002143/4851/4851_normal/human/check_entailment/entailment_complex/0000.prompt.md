You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Bike loves looking for the second maximum element in the sequence. The second maximum element in the sequence of distinct numbers x1, x2, ..., xk (k > 1) is such maximum element xj, that the following inequality holds: <image>.

The lucky number of the sequence of distinct positive integers x1, x2, ..., xk (k > 1) is the number that is equal to the bitwise excluding OR of the maximum element of the sequence and the second maximum element of the sequence.

You've got a sequence of distinct positive integers s1, s2, ..., sn (n > 1). Let's denote sequence sl, sl + 1, ..., sr as s[l..r] (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n). Your task is to find the maximum number among all lucky numbers of sequences s[l..r].

Note that as all numbers in sequence s are distinct, all the given definitions make sence.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 < n ≤ 105). The second line contains n distinct integers s1, s2, ..., sn (1 ≤ si ≤ 109).

Output

Print a single integer — the maximum lucky number among all lucky numbers of sequences s[l..r].

Examples

Input

5
5 2 1 4 3


Output

7


Input

5
9 8 3 5 7


Output

15

Note

For the first sample you can choose s[4..5] = {4, 3} and its lucky number is (4 xor 3) = 7. You can also choose s[1..2].

For the second sample you must choose s[2..5] = {8, 3, 5, 7}.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_1(a):
    stack, ans = [], 0
    for i in a:
        while stack and stack[-1] < i:
            stack.pop()
        
        stack.append(i)
        
        if len(stack) > 1:
            ans = max(ans, stack[-1] ^ stack[-2])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `stack` contains elements in non-decreasing order, `ans` is the maximum XOR result of any two elements in the `stack`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the maximum XOR result of any two elements in the 'stack'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of elements, maintains a stack of elements in non-decreasing order, and calculates the maximum XOR result of any two elements in the stack.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
