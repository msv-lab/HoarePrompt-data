Example Answer:
The variable `ans` is assigned the maximum value between the result of the XOR operation between the last two elements of the `stack`. The elements in the `stack` are less than `i` excluding the popped elements, and `i` is appended to the `stack`. Since the `stack` has a length greater than 1, the XOR operation is performed between the last two elements. Therefore, the Output State is: *`stack` contains elements less than `i` excluding the popped elements, `i` is appended to the `stack`, and the length of `stack` is greater than 1; `ans` is updated with the result of XOR operation between the last two elements of the `stack`.
Output State: ***`stack` contains elements less than `i` excluding the popped elements, `i` is appended to the `stack`, and the length of `stack` is greater than 1; `ans` is updated with the result of XOR operation between the last two elements of the `stack`***
