According to the code, the loop can execute again if the condition `stack and stack[-1] < i` is satisfied. The states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
1. At the end of the last iteration, `stack` contains elements less than `i` excluding the popped elements and `i`.
2. The last element of `stack` is less than `i` after removing the last element.
Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the above two conditions need to be met.
State: **`stack` contains elements less than `i` excluding the popped elements and `i`, the last element of `stack` is less than `i` after removing the last element**
