Example Answer:
The last element of the `stack` is removed using the `pop()` function. Since the last element of the `stack` is less than `i`, the rest of the elements in the `stack` still satisfy the condition of being less than `i`. Therefore, after the execution of the code, the output state is: `stack` contains elements less than `i` excluding the popped elements and `i`, the last element of `stack` is less than `i` after removing the last element.
Output State: **`stack` contains elements less than `i` excluding the popped elements and `i`, the last element of `stack` is less than `i` after removing the last element**
