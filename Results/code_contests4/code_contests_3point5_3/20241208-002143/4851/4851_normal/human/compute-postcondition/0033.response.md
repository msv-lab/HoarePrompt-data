Example Answer:
The code appends the value of `i` to the `stack`. Since the `stack` contains elements less than `i` excluding the popped elements and `i`, the state after execution will be `stack` contains elements less than `i` excluding the popped elements, `i` is appended to the `stack`. 
Output State: **`stack` contains elements less than `i` excluding the popped elements, `i` is appended to the `stack`**
