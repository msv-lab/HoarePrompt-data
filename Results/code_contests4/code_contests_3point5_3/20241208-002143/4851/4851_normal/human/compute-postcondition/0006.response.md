According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `stack` and the condition `stack[-1] < i`. If `stack` is not empty and the last element of `stack` is less than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `stack` contains elements less than `i` excluding the popped element. For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `stack[-1] < i` must still hold true after the adjustment. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`stack` contains elements less than `i` excluding the popped element, `ans` is 0, for the loop to execute again `stack` is not empty and `stack[-1] < i`**
