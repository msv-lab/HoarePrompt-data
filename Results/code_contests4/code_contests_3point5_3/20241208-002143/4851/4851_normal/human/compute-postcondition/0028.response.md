According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `stack` and the condition `stack[-1] < i`. If `stack` is not empty and the last element of `stack` is less than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `stack` contains elements less than `i` excluding the popped elements and `i`. To ensure the loop executes one more time, the stack should still contain elements less than `i` excluding the popped elements and `i`, and the last element of the stack should be less than `i`. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`stack` contains elements less than `i` excluding the popped elements and `i`, for the loop to execute again the last element of `stack` is less than `i`**
