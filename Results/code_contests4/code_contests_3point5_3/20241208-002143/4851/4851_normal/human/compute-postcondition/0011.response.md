Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is updated to be the maximum of the current value of `ans` and the result of the XOR operation between the last two elements of the `stack`. Since `stack` contains elements less than `i` excluding the popped elements, and the length of `stack` is greater than 1, the XOR operation is performed on the last two elements of the stack. Therefore, the Output State is: `stack` contains elements less than `i` excluding the popped elements, `ans` is updated to the maximum of the XOR result of the last two elements of the stack.
Output State: **`stack` contains elements less than `i` excluding the popped elements, `ans` is updated to the maximum of the XOR result of the last two elements of the stack**
