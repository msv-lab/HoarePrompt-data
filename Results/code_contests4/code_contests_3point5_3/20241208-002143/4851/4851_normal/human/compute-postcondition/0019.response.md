Example Answer:
`stack` pops the last element from the list. The elements in the `stack` are now less than `i` excluding the popped element. The condition for the loop to execute again is met as the last element of `stack` is now less than `i`. `ans` remains an integer.
Output State: **`stack` contains elements less than `i` excluding the popped elements, `ans` is an integer, for the loop to execute again the last element of `stack` should be less than `i`**
