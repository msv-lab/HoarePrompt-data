Example Answer:
`i` is appended to the `stack` list. The elements in the `stack` are less than `i` excluding the popped elements, so after appending `i`, the `stack` will contain elements less than `i` excluding the popped elements. The value of `ans` remains 0 as it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `stack` contains elements less than `i` excluding the popped elements and `ans` is 0.
Output State: **`stack` contains elements less than `i` excluding the popped elements, `ans` is 0**
