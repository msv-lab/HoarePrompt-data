Example Answer:
The last element of the `stack` is removed by using the `pop()` function. Since the elements are less than `i` and excluding the popped elements, the state of `stack` changes accordingly. The length of `stack` decreases by 1. The value of `ans` remains the same as it is not directly affected by the code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `stack` contains elements less than `i` excluding the popped elements, `ans` is an integer.
Output State: **`stack` contains elements less than `i` excluding the popped elements, `ans` is an integer**
