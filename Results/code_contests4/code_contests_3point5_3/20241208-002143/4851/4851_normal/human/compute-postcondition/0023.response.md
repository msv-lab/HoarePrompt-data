Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is updated to the maximum value between the current `ans` and the result of `stack[-1] ^ stack[-2]`. The `^` operator represents the bitwise XOR operation. Since the stack contains elements less than `i` excluding the popped elements and `i`, and the length of `stack` is greater than 1, the bitwise XOR operation is performed on the last two elements of the stack. The updated value of `ans` will be the maximum value between the previous `ans` and the result of the XOR operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `stack` contains elements less than `i` excluding the popped elements and `i`, `i`, `ans` is an integer.
Output State: **`stack` contains elements less than `i` excluding the popped elements and `i`, `i`, `ans` is an integer**
