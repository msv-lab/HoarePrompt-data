Postcondition: ***`stack` contains elements less than `i` excluding the popped elements and `ans` is an integer. If the length of `stack` is greater than 1, `ans` is updated to the maximum XOR result of the last two elements of the stack. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `stack` and `ans`.***
