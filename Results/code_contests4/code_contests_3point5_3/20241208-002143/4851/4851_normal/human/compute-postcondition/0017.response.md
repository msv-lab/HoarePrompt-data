Example Answer:
The last element of `stack` is popped from the stack. The elements of `stack` are now less than `i` excluding the popped element. The loop can execute again as the last element of `stack` is still less than `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `stack` contains elements less than `i` excluding the popped elements, `ans` is an integer, for the loop to execute again the last element of `stack` should be less than `i`.
Output State: **`stack` contains elements less than `i` excluding the popped elements, `ans` is an integer, for the loop to execute again the last element of `stack` should be less than `i`**
