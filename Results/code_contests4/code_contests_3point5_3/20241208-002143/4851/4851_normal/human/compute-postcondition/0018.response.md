According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition that the last element of `stack` should be less than `i`. At the end of the previous iteration, `stack` contains elements less than `i` excluding the popped elements. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, the last element of `stack` needs to be less than `i`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`stack` contains elements less than `i` excluding the popped elements, `ans` is an integer, for the loop to execute again the last element of `stack` should be less than `i`**
