Example Answer:
The last element of `stack` is removed by using the `pop()` function. The elements in `stack` will now contain one less element. Therefore, the Output State is: `stack` contains elements less than `i` excluding the popped elements and `i`, for the loop to execute again the last element of `stack` is less than `i` after removing the last element.
Output State: **`stack` contains elements less than `i` excluding the popped elements and `i`, for the loop to execute again the last element of `stack` is less than `i` after removing the last element**
