According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `stack` and `i`. If the condition `stack and stack[-1] < i` is satisfied, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `stack` contains elements less than `i` excluding the popped elements and `i`. To satisfy the loop condition for another iteration, `i` should be adjusted to be greater than the maximum element in `stack`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`stack` contains elements less than `i` excluding the popped elements and `i`, for the loop to execute the first time `i` should be greater than the maximum element in `stack`**
