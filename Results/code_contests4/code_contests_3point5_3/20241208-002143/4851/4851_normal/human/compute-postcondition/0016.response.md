According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `stack` and the condition that the last element of `stack` is less than `i`. If the last element of `stack` is less than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `stack` contains elements less than `i` excluding the popped elements. For the loop to execute one more time, the last element of `stack` should still be less than `i`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`stack` contains elements less than `i` excluding the popped elements, `ans` is an integer, for the loop to execute again the last element of `stack` should be less than `i`**
