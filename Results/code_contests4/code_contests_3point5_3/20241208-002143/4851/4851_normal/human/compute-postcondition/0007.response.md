Example Answer:
The `pop()` method removes and returns the last element from the `stack`. Since the `stack` contains elements less than `i` excluding the popped element, after executing `stack.pop()`, the last element is removed from the `stack`. The value of `ans` remains 0. For the loop to execute again, `stack` must not be empty and `stack[-1]` must be less than `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `stack` contains elements less than `i` excluding the popped element, `ans` is 0, for the loop to execute again `stack` is not empty and `stack[-1] < i`.
Output State: **`stack` contains elements less than `i` excluding the popped element, `ans` is 0, for the loop to execute again `stack` is not empty and `stack[-1] < i`**
