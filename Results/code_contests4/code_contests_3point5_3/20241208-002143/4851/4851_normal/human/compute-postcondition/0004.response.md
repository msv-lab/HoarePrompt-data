According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `stack` and the condition `stack[-1] < i`. If `stack` is not empty and the last element of `stack` is less than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `stack` is an empty list, which means trying to access `stack[-1]` will raise an IndexError. Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `stack` needs to contain at least one element that is less than `i`.
State: **`stack` contains at least one element that is less than `i`, `ans` is 0**.
