Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem described. The issue lies in the `func_3` function. The function is supposed to return a list of weights that can be used to balance the scales based on the weights already placed. However, the implementation of `func_3` is incorrect as it does not consider the condition that weights should not be placed consecutively. This leads to incorrect output in certain cases where consecutive weights are placed.

For example, if the input is:
```
0000000001
3
```
The correct output should be:
```
YES
1 3 1
```
But the given program may produce an incorrect output due to the issue mentioned above.
