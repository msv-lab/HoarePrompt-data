The function `func_1` takes a parameter `result`, which is a string of exactly ten characters consisting of only "0"s and "1"s. The second parameter `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000. If the first character of `result` is "1", the function prints 'YES' followed by each element in `result[1]`. If the first character of `result` is not "1", the function prints 'NO'.
