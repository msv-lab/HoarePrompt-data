Postcondition: ***`l` is a string of length 10 with only '0's and '1's, `w` is an integer where 1 ≤ w ≤ 1000, `m` is a non-negative integer, `i` is the next value returned by `func_3(l, w)`, and the first element of `tmp` is False. If `tmp[0]` is True, the program returns True and the second element of `tmp`. Otherwise, the program does not change the state described in the precondition.***
