Example Answer:
`i` is appended to the `result` list. Since `i` is 3, the `result` list now contains 1, 2, 3. The loop will execute one more time as the element at index `i-1` of list `w` is '1'. The states of other variables remain the same.
Output State: **`result` is a list containing 1, 2, 3, `w` has at least one element, `i` is 3, and the element at index `i-1` of list `w` is '1' for the loop to execute one more time**
