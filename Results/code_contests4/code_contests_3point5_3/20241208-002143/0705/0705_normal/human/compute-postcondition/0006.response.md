Example Answer:
The value of `i` (which is 2) is appended to the list `result`. Since the loop will execute one more time, the element at index `i-1` of list `w` must be '1'. Therefore, after execution, `result` will contain 1, 2.
Output State: **`result` is a list containing 1, 2, `w` has at least one element, `i` is 2, and the element at index `i-1` of list `w` is '1'**
