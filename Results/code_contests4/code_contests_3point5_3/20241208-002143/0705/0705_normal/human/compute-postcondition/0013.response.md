The function `func_4` accepts a parameter `w`, which is a string of length 10 consisting of only zeros and ones, and an integer `m` such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000. After executing the function body, the program returns a list containing the indices of all elements in the list `w` that have the value '1'. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_4` is to accept a string `w` and an integer `m`, and return a list containing the indices of elements in `w` that have the value '1'.
