According to the code, the loop will execute for each value of `i` in the range from 1 to the length of list `w`. Therefore, the loop will execute if the list `w` has at least one element. Before the loop starts, `result` is an empty list, so for the loop to execute the first time `w` must have at least one element and `i` is 1.
State: **`result` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `w` has at least one element, `i` is 1**
