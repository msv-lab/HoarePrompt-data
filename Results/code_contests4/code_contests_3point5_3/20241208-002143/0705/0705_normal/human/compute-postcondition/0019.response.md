The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: a string `l` of length 10 consisting of only '0's and '1's, an integer `w` where 1 ≤ w ≤ 1000, and a non-negative integer `m`. 

The function has multiple return cases:
- Case 1: The program returns True and the string `l`, which is of length 10 consisting of only '0's and '1's.
- Case 2: The program returns True and the second element of the list `tmp`.
- Case 3: The program returns True and the second element of the list 'tmp' which contains the result of func_2(l + [i], w, m).
- Case 4: The program returns True and the second element of list 'tmp'.
- Case 5: The program always returns False.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a string `l`, an integer `w`, and a non-negative integer `m`, and based on the different cases, return specific values or False.
