    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *The input is a string of exactly ten characters, where each character is either "0" or "1". The second input is an integer m, where 1 <= m <= 1000. If the first character of the string is "1", then `result[1]` is a list with at least one element for the loop to execute. If the first character of the string is not "1", the program prints 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a parameter `result`, which is a string of exactly ten characters consisting of only "0"s and "1"s. The second parameter `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000. If the first character of `result` is "1", the function prints 'YES' followed by each element in `result[1]`. If the first character of `result` is not "1", the function prints 'NO'.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a string of length 10 consisting of only '0's and '1's, w is an integer such that 1 ≤ w ≤ 1000, and m is a non-negative integer.**

    if (len(l) == m) :

The loop will either return True with the second element of tmp or it will not change the state as described in the precondition.
        return False,
        #The program always returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a string `l` of length 10 consisting of only '0's and '1's, an integer `w` where 1 ≤ w ≤ 1000, and a non-negative integer `m`. The function iterates through the values returned by `func_3(l, w)` and recursively calls itself with updated parameters. There are multiple return cases:
- Case 1: Returns True and the string `l`.
- Case 2: Returns True and the second element of the list `tmp`.
- Case 3: Returns True and the second element of the list 'tmp' which contains the result of `func_2(l + [i], w, m)`.
- Case 4: Returns True and the second element of list 'tmp'.
- Case 5: Always returns False.
The functionality of the function is to handle different cases based on the input parameters and iterative calls, returning specific values accordingly.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: seq is a string of length 10 consisting of only '0's and '1's, weights is an integer such that 1 ≤ weights ≤ 1000.**
def func_3(seq, weights):

        return result
        #The program returns a list containing elements from `weights` that are greater than the absolute difference between the count of '1's at even indices and the count of '1's at odd indices in `seq`, and are not equal to the last character of `seq`
    else :
        return weights
        #The program returns the integer value of 'weights' which is in the range of 1 to 1000
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a string `seq` of length 10 consisting of only '0's and '1's, and an integer `weights` in the range of 1 to 1000. If `seq` is not empty, it calculates the absolute difference between the count of '1's at even indices and odd indices. Then, it returns a list of elements from `weights` that are greater than this difference and not equal to the last character of `seq`. If `seq` is empty, the function simply returns the integer value of `weights`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input w is a string of length 10 consisting of only zeros and ones, and m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000.**

    for i in range(1, len(w) + 1):
        if w[i - 1] == '1':
            result.append(i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `result` is a list containing the indices of all elements in list `w` that have the value '1', `w` has at least one element.
    return result
    #The program returns the list containing the indices of all elements in list 'w' that have the value '1'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts a parameter `w`, which is a string of length 10 consisting of only zeros and ones. It iterates through the string and returns a list containing the indices of all elements in the list `w` that have the value '1'. The function does not utilize the integer `m` as stated in the annotations.
