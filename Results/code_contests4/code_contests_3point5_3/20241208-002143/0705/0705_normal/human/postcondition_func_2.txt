The function `func_3` accepts a string `seq` of length 10 consisting of only '0's and '1's, and an integer `weights` in the range of 1 to 1000. If `seq` is not empty, it calculates the absolute difference between the count of '1's at even indices and odd indices. Then, it returns a list of elements from `weights` that are greater than this difference and not equal to the last character of `seq`. If `seq` is empty, the function simply returns the integer value of `weights`.
