You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Xenia has a set of weights and pan scales. Each weight has an integer weight from 1 to 10 kilos. Xenia is going to play with scales and weights a little. For this, she puts weights on the scalepans, one by one. The first weight goes on the left scalepan, the second weight goes on the right scalepan, the third one goes on the left scalepan, the fourth one goes on the right scalepan and so on. Xenia wants to put the total of m weights on the scalepans.

Simply putting weights on the scales is not interesting, so Xenia has set some rules. First, she does not put on the scales two consecutive weights of the same weight. That is, the weight that goes i-th should be different from the (i + 1)-th weight for any i (1 ≤ i < m). Second, every time Xenia puts a weight on some scalepan, she wants this scalepan to outweigh the other one. That is, the sum of the weights on the corresponding scalepan must be strictly greater than the sum on the other pan.

You are given all types of weights available for Xenia. You can assume that the girl has an infinite number of weights of each specified type. Your task is to help Xenia lay m weights on ​​the scales or to say that it can't be done.

Input

The first line contains a string consisting of exactly ten zeroes and ones: the i-th (i ≥ 1) character in the line equals "1" if Xenia has i kilo weights, otherwise the character equals "0". The second line contains integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000).

Output

In the first line print "YES", if there is a way to put m weights on the scales by all rules. Otherwise, print in the first line "NO". If you can put m weights on the scales, then print in the next line m integers — the weights' weights in the order you put them on the scales.

If there are multiple solutions, you can print any of them.

Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of a string of exactly ten characters, where each character is either "0" or "1". The second input is an integer m, where 1 <= m <= 1000.**
def func_1(result):
    if result[0] :
        print('YES')
        for i in result[1]:
            print(i),
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: The input string has the first character as "1", `result[1]` is a list with at least one element for the loop to execute
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *The input is a string of exactly ten characters, where each character is either "0" or "1". The second input is an integer m, where 1 <= m <= 1000. If the first character of the string is "1", then `result[1]` is a list with at least one element for the loop to execute. If the first character of the string is not "1", the program prints 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a parameter `result`, which is a string of exactly ten characters consisting of only "0"s and "1"s. The second parameter `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000. If the first character of `result` is "1", the function prints 'YES' followed by each element in `result[1]`. If the first character of `result` is not "1", the function prints 'NO'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a string of length 10 consisting of only '0's and '1's, w is an integer such that 1 ≤ w ≤ 1000, and m is a non-negative integer.**
def func_2(l, w, m):
    if (len(l) == m) :
        return True, l
        #The program returns True and the string l, which is of length 10 consisting of only '0's and '1's
    else :
        i = 0
        for i in func_3(l, w):
            tmp = func_2(l + [i], w, m)
            
            if tmp[0]:
                return True, tmp[1]
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After all iterations of the loop, the final output state will be the same as the output state after the loop executes 1 time. The loop will either return True with the second element of tmp or it will not change the state as described in the precondition.
        return False,
        #The program always returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a string `l` of length 10 consisting of only '0's and '1's, an integer `w` where 1 ≤ w ≤ 1000, and a non-negative integer `m`. The function iterates through the values returned by `func_3(l, w)` and recursively calls itself with updated parameters. There are multiple return cases:
- Case 1: Returns True and the string `l`.
- Case 2: Returns True and the second element of the list `tmp`.
- Case 3: Returns True and the second element of the list 'tmp' which contains the result of `func_2(l + [i], w, m)`.
- Case 4: Returns True and the second element of list 'tmp'.
- Case 5: Always returns False.
The functionality of the function is to handle different cases based on the input parameters and iterative calls, returning specific values accordingly.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: seq is a string of length 10 consisting of only '0's and '1's, weights is an integer such that 1 ≤ weights ≤ 1000.**
def func_3(seq, weights):
    if seq :
        tmp = abs(sum(seq[0::2]) - sum(seq[1::2]))
        result = [i for i in weights if i > tmp and i != seq[-1]]
        return result
        #The program returns a list containing elements from `weights` that are greater than the absolute difference between the count of '1's at even indices and the count of '1's at odd indices in `seq`, and are not equal to the last character of `seq`
    else :
        return weights
        #The program returns the integer value of 'weights' which is in the range of 1 to 1000
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a string `seq` of length 10 consisting of only '0's and '1's, and an integer `weights` in the range of 1 to 1000. If `seq` is not empty, it calculates the absolute difference between the count of '1's at even indices and odd indices. Then, it returns a list of elements from `weights` that are greater than this difference and not equal to the last character of `seq`. If `seq` is empty, the function simply returns the integer value of `weights`.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input w is a string of length 10 consisting of only zeros and ones, and m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000.**
def func_4(w):
    result = []
    for i in range(1, len(w) + 1):
        if w[i - 1] == '1':
            result.append(i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `result` is a list containing the indices of all elements in list `w` that have the value '1', `w` has at least one element.
    return result
    #The program returns the list containing the indices of all elements in list 'w' that have the value '1'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts a parameter `w`, which is a string of length 10 consisting of only zeros and ones. It iterates through the string and returns a list containing the indices of all elements in the list `w` that have the value '1'. The function does not utilize the integer `m` as stated in the annotations.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
