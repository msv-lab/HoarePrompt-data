Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not implement the problem description correctly. The `func_2` function is supposed to generate a sequence of weights that satisfy Xenia's rules, but it does not ensure that the weights are placed in the correct order (i-th weight should be different from the (i + 1)-th weight). Additionally, the program does not check the condition that the weight placed on each scalepan should outweigh the other one.

Therefore, the program does not always produce a valid solution as per the problem description.
