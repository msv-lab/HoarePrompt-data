Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After reviewing the code and the problem description, the provided functions seem to correctly handle the requirements of the problem statement. The functions are designed to help Xenia place weights on the scales according to the specified rules. The functions take into account the available weights, the sequence of weights, and the total number of weights to be placed on the scales.

Additionally, the annotations provide insights into the functionality of each function and the state of the program before and after the function calls. The annotations describe the input parameters, the expected behavior, and the output of each function.

Overall, the code aligns with the problem description, and there are no apparent cases where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, the correctness of the code is considered **True**.
