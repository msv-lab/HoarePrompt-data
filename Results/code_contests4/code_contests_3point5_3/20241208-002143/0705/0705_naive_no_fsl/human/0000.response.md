Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It recursively tries to find a valid combination of weights to satisfy Xenia's requirements. The program checks all possible combinations and returns "YES" if a valid solution is found, along with the weights used. Otherwise, it returns "NO". The program also correctly handles the input format and converts it into the required data structure for processing. Overall, the program follows the rules specified in the problem description and provides the correct output for the given inputs.
