Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n`. It then checks if `n` is a prime number by iterating up to the square root of `n` and checking if `n` is divisible by any integer in that range. If `n` is divisible by any integer, the function returns False; otherwise, it returns True. The function may return True or False based on specific conditions within the function, contrary to the annotations.**
