Output State: *A and B are positive integers such that 1 <= A, B <= 10^12, n is not equal to 1. For the loop to execute, n is such that the square root of n is greater than or equal to 2, and n is not divisible by any integer from 2 to int(math.sqrt(n)). If n is divisible by any of these integers, the program returns False. Otherwise, the loop completes without changing the state of the program variables.*
