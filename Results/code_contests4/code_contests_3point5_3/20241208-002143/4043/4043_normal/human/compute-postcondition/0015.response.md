The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. The constraints for `n` are that A and B are positive integers such that 1 <= A, B <= 10^12. After executing the function body, there are multiple return points with different outcomes: 
- Case 1: The program returns True
- Case 2: The program returns False
- Case 3: The program returns False
- Case 4: The program returns False
- Case 5: The program returns True

Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a positive integer `n` and return True or False based on specific conditions within the function.
