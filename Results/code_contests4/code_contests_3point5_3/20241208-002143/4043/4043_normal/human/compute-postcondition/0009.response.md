Postcondition: ***A and B are positive integers such that 1 <= A, B <= 10^12, n is not equal to 1, for the loop to execute n is such that the square root of n is greater than or equal to 2, and n is not divisible by k. If n is divisible by k, the program returns False. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program.***
