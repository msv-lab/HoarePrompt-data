Postcondition: ***A and B are positive integers where 1 <= A, B <= 10^12. n is a positive integer not equal to 1. For the loop to execute, n is such that the square root of n is greater than or equal to 2, and n is not divisible by the next value of k in the loop. If n % k == 0, the program returns False. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables.***
