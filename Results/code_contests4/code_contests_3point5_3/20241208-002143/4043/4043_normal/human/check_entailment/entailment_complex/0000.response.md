Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The program is supposed to find the maximum number of divisors that can be chosen for positive common divisors of A and B, where any two chosen divisors must be coprime. However, the program is actually checking if a single number is a prime number, which is not the same as finding the maximum number of common divisors that are coprime.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description and does not provide the correct output for the given problem.
