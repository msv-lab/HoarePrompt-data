Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully comply with the problem description. The function `func_1` is supposed to check if a given positive integer `n` is a prime number. However, the implementation of `func_1` is incorrect. The function only checks if `n` is divisible by any integer up to the square root of `n`, which is not sufficient to determine if `n` is prime. For example, the input (1, 2019) should output 1 according to the problem description, but the code incorrectly outputs 2 because `func_1(1)` returns False. Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
