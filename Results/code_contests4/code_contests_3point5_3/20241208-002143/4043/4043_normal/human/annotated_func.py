    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: *A and B are positive integers such that 1 <= A, B <= 10^12, n is not equal to 1. For the loop to execute, n is such that the square root of n is greater than or equal to 2, and n is not divisible by any integer from 2 to int(math.sqrt(n)). If n is divisible by any of these integers, the program returns False. Otherwise, the loop completes without changing the state of the program variables.*

    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n`. It then checks if `n` is a prime number by iterating up to the square root of `n` and checking if `n` is divisible by any integer in that range. If `n` is divisible by any integer, the function returns False; otherwise, it returns True. The function may return True or False based on specific conditions within the function, contrary to the annotations.
