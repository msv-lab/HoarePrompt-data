Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly determine the maximum number of divisors that can be chosen to satisfy the condition of having coprime divisors. 

One potential case where the program does not work correctly is when the input values are such that both A and B are prime numbers. In this case, the program will not be able to correctly determine the maximum number of divisors that can be chosen. 

For example:
Input:
A = 7
B = 11

Expected Output:
1

The program should output 1 in this case since 7 and 11 are prime numbers and have no common divisors other than 1. However, the program may output a different value due to the way it checks for common divisors and coprimality. 

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
