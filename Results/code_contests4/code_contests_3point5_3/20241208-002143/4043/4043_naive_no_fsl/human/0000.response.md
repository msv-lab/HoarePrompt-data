Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem description. The code provided does not ensure that the chosen divisors are coprime, which is a requirement in the problem description. The function `func_1` is also not correctly checking if a number is prime.

Example:
Input
```
6 15
```

Expected Output
```
2
```

Actual Output
```
3
```

In this case, the program should output 2 because the only common divisor of 6 and 15 that is coprime is 3. However, the program outputs 3 because it is not correctly handling coprime divisors.
