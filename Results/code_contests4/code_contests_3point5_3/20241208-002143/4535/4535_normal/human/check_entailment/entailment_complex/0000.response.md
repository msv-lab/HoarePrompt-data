Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code consists of two functions, func_1 and func_2, that work together to find a valid integer 'a' such that a + reverse(a) = n. 

The func_1 function correctly reverses a positive integer 'x' without any missing functionality or edge cases. 

The func_2 function correctly sums an integer 'x' with the reverse of 'x' obtained from func_1. 

Combining these two functions, the code is able to find a valid 'a' for any given input 'n' as per the problem description. The code handles all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for each case.
