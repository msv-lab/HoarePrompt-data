Correctness: **True**

The program consists of two functions that work together to find a valid integer 'a' based on the input 'n' as described in the problem description. 

Function 1 (func_1) takes an integer 'x' and returns the reverse of 'x', which is used to find 'ar' in the problem description.

Function 2 (func_2) takes an integer 'x', adds the reverse of 'x' obtained from func_1, and returns the sum, which corresponds to 'n' in the problem description.

Therefore, the program follows the problem description accurately and provides a valid solution for the given input 'n'.
