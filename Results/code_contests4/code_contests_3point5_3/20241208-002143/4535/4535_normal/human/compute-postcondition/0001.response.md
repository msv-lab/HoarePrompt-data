The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `x`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10100000. The function returns the sum of integer x and the value returned by func_1(x). Therefore, the functionality of the function func_2 is to accept an integer x within the specified range and return the sum of x and the value returned by func_1(x). 
Functionality: **The function accepts an integer x within the range 1 ≤ x ≤ 10100000 and returns the sum of x and the value returned by func_1(x)**.
