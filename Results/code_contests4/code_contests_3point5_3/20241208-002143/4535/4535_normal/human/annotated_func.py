#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= 101000000.**
def func_1(x):
    return int(str(x)[::-1])
    #The program returns the reverse of the positive integer 'x'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer x and returns the reverse of x. The code correctly reverses the positive integer x without any missing functionality or edge cases.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10100000.**
def func_2(x):
    return x + func_1(x)
    #The program returns the sum of integer x and the value returned by func_1(x)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_2 accepts an integer x within the range 1 ≤ x ≤ 10100000. It then returns the sum of x and the value returned by func_1(x).
