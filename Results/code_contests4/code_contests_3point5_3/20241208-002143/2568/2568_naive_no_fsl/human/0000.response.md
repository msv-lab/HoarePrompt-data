Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input, calculates the maximal area of a special quadrilateral using the provided formula, and outputs the result. It iterates through all combinations of pairs of points to form the edges of the special quadrilateral and calculates the area using the given function. The program then updates the maximum area found so far and outputs it at the end. 

The logic of the program seems correct and follows the problem description. It considers all possible combinations of points to form the quadrilateral and calculates the area accordingly. Since the program covers all cases and provides the correct output for the given input, it can be considered correct.
