Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program iterates through all possible combinations of points to form a quadrilateral and calculates the area using the given formula. It then selects the maximum area among all the quadrilaterals formed. Since the program considers all possible combinations of points and calculates the area correctly, it will output the maximal area of a special quadrilateral as required by the problem description. Additionally, the program handles the input format specified in the problem description.
