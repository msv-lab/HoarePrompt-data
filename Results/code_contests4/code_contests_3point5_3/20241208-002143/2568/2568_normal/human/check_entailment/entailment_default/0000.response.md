Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads the input correctly and stores the points in a list.
- It then iterates through all possible pairs of points to form a quadrilateral.
- For each pair of points, it calculates the area of the quadrilateral formed by those points and all other points.
- The code correctly calculates the area of the quadrilateral using the `func_1` function based on the coordinates of the points.
- Finally, it updates the maximum area found so far and outputs the maximal area of a special quadrilateral.
- The code follows the problem description for every potential case, correctly calculating the maximal area of a special quadrilateral based on the given set of special points.
