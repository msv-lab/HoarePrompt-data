Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not calculate the maximal area of a special quadrilateral as described in the problem description. Instead, it calculates the area of a triangle using the provided points x1, x2, x3, y1, y2, y3. This is not the correct calculation for the maximal area of a special quadrilateral. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
