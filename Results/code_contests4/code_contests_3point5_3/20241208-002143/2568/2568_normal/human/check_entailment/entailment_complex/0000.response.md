Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not calculate the maximal area of a special quadrilateral as required by the problem description. Instead, it calculates the area of a triangle formed by 3 points and returns half of that area. This does not align with the problem description which asks for the maximal area of a special quadrilateral formed by 4 points. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect for the given problem description.
