The function `func_1` accepts 6 parameters: x1, x2, x3, y1, y2, y3, which represent the coordinates of 3 points in a triangle. It calculates the area of the triangle formed by these points using a specific formula and returns half of that area. The code assumes that the points are not collinear and do not coincide with each other.
