The function `func_1` accepts 6 parameters: x1, x2, x3, y1, y2, y3, which represent the coordinates of 3 points in a triangle. Each pair of xi, yi represents the x and y coordinates of a point. These parameters are integers such that -1000 <= xi, yi <= 1000. 

The function calculates the area of the triangle formed by these 3 points and returns half of that area. The points are assumed to not be collinear and not coincide with each other. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept the coordinates of 3 points in a triangle and return half of the area of the triangle formed by these points.
