Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values of n and m.
2. It correctly reads the log stream and extracts the date and time information.
3. It calculates the time difference between the current log entry and the previous log entries.
4. It keeps track of the number of warnings in the last n seconds and checks if it's not less than m.
5. If the condition is met, it prints the first moment of time.
6. If no moment of time satisfies the condition, it correctly prints -1. 

Overall, the program follows the problem description and works correctly for all potential cases.
