Correctness: **True**

The program reads the input of the log stream and processes each line to extract the date and time information. It then calculates the time difference between the current log entry and the previous log entries to determine if the number of warnings for the last `n` seconds is not less than `m`. 

If the condition is met, it prints the timestamp for that moment. If the condition is never met, it prints -1.

The program correctly follows the problem description and outputs the expected results for all potential cases.
