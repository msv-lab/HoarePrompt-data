You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You've got a list of program warning logs. Each record of a log stream is a string in this format: 

"2012-MM-DD HH:MM:SS:MESSAGE" (without the quotes). 

String "MESSAGE" consists of spaces, uppercase and lowercase English letters and characters "!", ".", ",", "?". String "2012-MM-DD" determines a correct date in the year of 2012. String "HH:MM:SS" determines a correct time in the 24 hour format.

The described record of a log stream means that at a certain time the record has got some program warning (string "MESSAGE" contains the warning's description).

Your task is to print the first moment of time, when the number of warnings for the last n seconds was not less than m.

Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10000).

The second and the remaining lines of the input represent the log stream. The second line of the input contains the first record of the log stream, the third line contains the second record and so on. Each record of the log stream has the above described format. All records are given in the chronological order, that is, the warning records are given in the order, in which the warnings appeared in the program. 

It is guaranteed that the log has at least one record. It is guaranteed that the total length of all lines of the log stream doesn't exceed 5·106 (in particular, this means that the length of some line does not exceed 5·106 characters). It is guaranteed that all given dates and times are correct, and the string 'MESSAGE" in all records is non-empty.

Output

If there is no sought moment of time, print -1. Otherwise print a string in the format "2012-MM-DD HH:MM:SS" (without the quotes) — the first moment of time when the number of warnings for the last n seconds got no less than m.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10000. The log stream consists of strings in the format "2012-MM-DD HH:MM:SS:MESSAGE".**
def func():
    n, m = map(int, raw_input().split())
    log = sys.stdin.readlines()
    logtime = []
    last = 0
    for line in log:
        a = line.find(' ')
        
        year, month, day = map(int, line[:a].split('-'))
        
        b = line.rfind(':')
        
        hour, minute, second = map(int, line[a:b].split(':'))
        
        now = datetime.datetime(year, month, day, hour, minute, second)
        
        logtime.append(now)
        
        print(line[:b], last)
        
        for x in logtime[last:]:
            delta = int((now - x).total_seconds())
            print(delta)
            if delta >= n:
                last += 1
            else:
                break
        
        if len(logtime) - last >= m:
            print(line[:b])
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After all iterations of the loop, `n`, `m`, `logtime`, `last`, `line`, `a`, `b`, `hour`, `minute`, `second`, `now` remain unchanged. If the length of `logtime` minus `last` is greater than or equal to `m`, then the substring of `line` starting from index 0 up to index `b` (excluding `b`) is printed. If that condition is never met, -1 is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads input for two positive integers `n` and `m`, and processes a log stream containing timestamped messages. It extracts timestamp information from each log entry and stores it for comparison. The function iterates through the log entries, calculating the time difference between each entry and the current one. If the time difference is greater than or equal to `n`, it increments a counter. If the total number of entries minus the counter is greater than or equal to `m`, the function prints out the timestamp of the current entry. If this condition is never met, the function prints -1.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
