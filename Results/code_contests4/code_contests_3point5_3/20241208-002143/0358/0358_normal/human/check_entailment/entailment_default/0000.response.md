Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the input for two positive integers n and m.
- It processes a log stream containing timestamped messages and extracts timestamp information from each log entry.
- It iterates through the log entries, calculating the time difference between each entry and the current one.
- If the time difference is greater than or equal to n, it increments a counter.
- If the total number of entries minus the counter is greater than or equal to m, the code prints out the timestamp of the current entry.
- If this condition is never met, the code prints -1.
- The code handles all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for each case.
