Correctness: **True**

The program correctly reads the input for two positive integers `n` and `m` and processes a log stream containing timestamped messages. It extracts timestamp information from each log entry, calculates the time difference between each entry and the current one, and keeps track of the number of warnings in the last `n` seconds. The program correctly prints out the timestamp of the first moment when the number of warnings for the last `n` seconds is not less than `m`, or -1 if no such moment exists.

The program follows the problem description as it iterates through the log entries in chronological order, calculating the time difference correctly and checking the conditions to determine the first moment when the number of warnings is not less than `m`.
