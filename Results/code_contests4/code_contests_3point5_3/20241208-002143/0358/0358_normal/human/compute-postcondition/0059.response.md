According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `last`, `delta`, and `n`. If `delta` is greater than or equal to `n`, `last` is increased by 1. At the end of the last iteration, there was no change in the initial state. So for the loop to execute one more time, we need to check if `delta` is greater than or equal to `n`. If it is, then `last` should be increased by 1.
State: **No change in the initial state. If delta is greater than or equal to n, `last` is increased by 1**
