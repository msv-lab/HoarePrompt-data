Postcondition: ***The loop iterated over the elements in logtime starting from the index last. Delta was calculated as the difference in seconds between now and the current element x. If delta is greater than or equal to n, the value of last was incremented by 1. If delta is less than n, the loop broke. After entering the if condition, len(logtime) - last is greater than or equal to m. The program prints the substring of line starting from index 0 up to b.***
