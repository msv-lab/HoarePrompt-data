Example Answer:
The list `logtime` is initialized as an empty list. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10000; `logtime` is an empty list.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10000; `logtime` is an empty list**
