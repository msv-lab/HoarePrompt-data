Example Answer:
The code prints the value of `delta`, which is the difference between `now` and `x`. The initial state does not provide the values of `now` and `x`, so the output state will be the same as the initial state with the addition of the printed value of `delta`.
Output State: **`last` remains the same integer, `delta` is an integer calculated from the difference between `now` and `x, and the value of `delta` is printed.**
