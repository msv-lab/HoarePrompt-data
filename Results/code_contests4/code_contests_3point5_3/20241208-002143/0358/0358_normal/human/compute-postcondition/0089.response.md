Example Answer:
`last` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `last` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `last` is incremented by 1, `delta` is an integer calculated from the difference between `now` and `x, and the value of `delta` is printed.
Output State: **`last` is incremented by 1, `delta` is an integer calculated from the difference between `now` and `x, and the value of `delta` is printed**
