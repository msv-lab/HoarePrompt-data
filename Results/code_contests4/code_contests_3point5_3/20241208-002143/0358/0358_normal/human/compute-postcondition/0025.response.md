Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10000; `logtime` contains the appended `now` datetime object; `last` is updated to the new value after incrementing by 1 if delta >= n, and `last` remains the same if delta < n; `line` refers to the first element in `logtime`; `a` is the index of the first space character in `line`; `b` is the index of the last occurrence of ':' in `line`; `hour`, `minute`, `second` are integers extracted from the substring of `line` between indexes `a` and `b` split by ':'; and `now` is a datetime object created with the specified parameters.***
