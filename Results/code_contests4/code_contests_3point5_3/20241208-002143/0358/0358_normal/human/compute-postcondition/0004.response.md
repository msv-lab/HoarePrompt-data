According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the log list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `n` and `m` being positive integers does not ensure the loop will execute, so the states need to be adjusted to `log` is a non-empty list with at least 1 element, `line` refers to the first element in `log`, and `last` is updated to the last element in `log`.
State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10000; `logtime` is an empty list, `last` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `log` is a non-empty list with at least 1 element, `line` refers to the first element in `log`, `last` is updated to the last element in `log`**
