Functionality: **The function `func` reads input for two positive integers `n` and `m`, and processes a log stream containing timestamped messages. It extracts timestamp information from each log entry and stores it for comparison. The function iterates through the log entries, calculating the time difference between each entry and the current one. If the time difference is greater than or equal to `n`, it increments a counter. If the total number of entries minus the counter is greater than or equal to `m`, the function prints out the timestamp of the current entry. If this condition is never met, the function prints -1.**
