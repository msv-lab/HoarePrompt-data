Postcondition: ***The variables `now`, `x`, `n`, and `last` are dependent on their initial values and the conditions of the if and else parts. If `delta` is greater than or equal to `n`, the values of `now`, `x`, and `last` are updated accordingly. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement without any further changes to the variables.***
