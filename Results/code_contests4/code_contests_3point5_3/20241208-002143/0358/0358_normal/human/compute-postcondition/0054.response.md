Example Answer:
`delta` is assigned the value of the difference in seconds between `now` and the next `x` converted to total seconds. If `delta` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `last` is increased by 1. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: The difference in seconds between `now` and the next `x` is printed out, if `delta` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `last` is increased by 1.
Output State: **The difference in seconds between `now` and the next `x` is printed out, if `delta` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `last` is increased by 1**
