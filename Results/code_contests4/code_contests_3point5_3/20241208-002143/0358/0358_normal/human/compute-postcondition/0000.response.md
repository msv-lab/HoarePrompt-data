Example Answer:
`n` and `m` are assigned the values of the integers obtained by splitting the input string. The values of `n` and `m` can range from 1 to 10000. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10000.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10000**
