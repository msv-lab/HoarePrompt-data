Postcondition: ***The difference in seconds between `now` and `x` is printed out. If the value of `delta` is greater than or equal to `n`, then the program enters the if condition and `last` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the difference in seconds between `now` and `x` is less than `n` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
