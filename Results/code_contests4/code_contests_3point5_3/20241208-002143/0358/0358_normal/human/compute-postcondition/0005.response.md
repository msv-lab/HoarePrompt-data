Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the index of the first space character in `line`. The value of `line` is the first element in `log`, and `log` is a non-empty list. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10000; `logtime` is an empty list, `last` is updated to the last element in `log`, `line` refers to the first element in `log`, `a` is the index of the first space character in `line`.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10000; `logtime` is an empty list, `last` is updated to the last element in `log`, `line` refers to the first element in `log`, `a` is the index of the first space character in `line`**
