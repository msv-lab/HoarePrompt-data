According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `last`, `delta`, and `n`. If `delta` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `last` is an integer. If `delta` is less than `n`, `last` remains the same and the program prints the value of `delta`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `delta` should be less than `n`.
State: **`last` is an integer, if `delta` < `n`, `last` remains the same, `delta` is the same as the previous iteration**
