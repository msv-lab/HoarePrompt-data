Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10000; `logtime` contains the appended `now` datetime object; `last` is updated to the last element in `logtime` if delta >= n, and `last` remains the same if delta < n; `line` refers to the first element in `logtime`; `a` is the index of the first space character in `line`; `b` is the index of the last occurrence of ':' in `line`; `hour`, `minute`, `second` are integers extracted from the substring of `line` between indexes `a` and `b` split by ':'; and `now` is a datetime object created with the specified parameters, for the loop to execute `logtime` has elements starting from the index `last`. If delta >= n, then the loop starts from the last element in `logtime` + 1, and `delta` is greater than or equal to `n`. If delta < n, the loop starts from the last element in `logtime`, and `delta` is less than `n`.***
