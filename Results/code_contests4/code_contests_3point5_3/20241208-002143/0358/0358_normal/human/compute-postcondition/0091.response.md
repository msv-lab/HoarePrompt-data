Postcondition: ***`last` remains the same integer, `delta` is an integer calculated from the difference between `now` and `x`, and the value of `delta` is printed. If `delta` is greater than or equal to `n`, `last` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
