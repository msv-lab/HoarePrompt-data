Postcondition: ***`n`, `m` are positive integers between 1 and 10000; `logtime` contains the appended `now` datetime object; `last` is updated to the new value after incrementing by 1 each time delta >= n; `line`, `a`, `b`, `hour`, `minute`, `second`, `now` maintain their original definitions. The loop will continue to iterate through `logtime` until delta < n, at which point it will stop, keeping `last` at its final updated value.***
