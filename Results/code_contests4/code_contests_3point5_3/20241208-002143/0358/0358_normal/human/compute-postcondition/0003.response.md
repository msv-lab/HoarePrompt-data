Example Answer:
`last` is assigned the value 0. There are no other affected variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10000; `logtime` is an empty list, `last` is 0.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10000; `logtime` is an empty list, `last` is 0**
