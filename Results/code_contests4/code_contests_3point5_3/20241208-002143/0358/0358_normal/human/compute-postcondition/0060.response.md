Example Answer:
`delta` is assigned the value of the difference in seconds between `now` and `x`, converted to an integer. If `delta` is greater than or equal to `n`, `last` is increased by 1. The initial state remains unchanged. 
Output State: **No change in the initial state. If delta is greater than or equal to n, `last` is increased by 1**
