Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `n`, `m`, `logtime`, `last`, `line`, `a`, `b`, `hour`, `minute`, `second`, `now` remain unchanged. If the length of `logtime` minus `last` is greater than or equal to `m`, then the substring of `line` starting from index 0 up to index `b` (excluding `b`) is printed. If that condition is never met, -1 is printed.**
