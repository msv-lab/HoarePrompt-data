Example Answer:
`delta` is assigned the value of `(now - x).total_seconds()` converted to an integer. The value of `delta` is dependent on the values of `now` and `x`, which are not provided in the initial state. If `delta` is less than `n`, `last` remains the same as it was in the previous iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `last` remains the same integer, `delta` is an integer calculated from the difference between `now` and `x`.
Output State: **`last` remains the same integer, `delta` is an integer calculated from the difference between `now` and `x**`.
