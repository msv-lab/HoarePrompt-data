Example Answer: 
The variable `log` is assigned the value of `sys.stdin.readlines()`. Assuming `sys.stdin.readlines()` reads input from the standard input, the values of `n` and `m` are not directly affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10000.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10000**
