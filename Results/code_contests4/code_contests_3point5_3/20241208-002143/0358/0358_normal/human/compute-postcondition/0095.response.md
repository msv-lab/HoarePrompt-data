Example Answer:
The value of `last` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `last` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: dependent on the initial values of `now`, `x`, `n`, and the new value of `last`.
Output State: **dependent on the initial values of `now`, `x`, `n`, and the new value of `last`**
