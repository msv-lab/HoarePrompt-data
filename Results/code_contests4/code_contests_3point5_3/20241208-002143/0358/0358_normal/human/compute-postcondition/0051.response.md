Example Answer: 
The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: The difference in seconds between `now` and `x` is printed out. The difference in seconds between `now` and `x` is less than `n` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State: **The difference in seconds between `now` and `x` is printed out. The difference in seconds between `now` and `x` is less than `n` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
