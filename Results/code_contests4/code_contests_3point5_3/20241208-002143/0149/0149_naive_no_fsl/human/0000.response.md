Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly calculates the minimum number of moves required to place all the pieces in the cells of the same color. It iterates through the positions of the pieces and calculates the total moves needed for both even and odd indexes. Finally, it returns the minimum of these two values, which represents the minimum number of moves required. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description and covers all potential cases.
