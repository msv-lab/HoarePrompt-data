Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program correctly reads the input, computes the minimum number of moves required to place all the pieces in cells of the same color, and outputs the result.
- The loop iterates over half the length of the chessboard, calculating the distance of each piece from its ideal position based on the color of the cell. It then sums up the distances for even and odd positions separately.
- Finally, it finds the minimum between the total distance for even positions and odd positions, which represents the minimum number of moves needed to place all pieces on cells of the same color.
- The logic of the program aligns with the problem description and handles all potential cases, ensuring correct functionality.
