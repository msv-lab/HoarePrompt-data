Correctness: **True**

The program takes the input values for the size of the chessboard and the initial positions of the pieces. It then calculates the minimum number of moves required to place all the pieces in cells of the same color using the formula provided in the problem description. The program iterates through the pieces and calculates the sum of the absolute differences between the current position of the piece and the desired position based on whether the position is even or odd.

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of moves required to place all the pieces in cells of the same color and prints the result. This aligns with the requirements specified in the problem description. 

Therefore, the program is correct as it follows the problem description and provides the expected output for all potential cases.
