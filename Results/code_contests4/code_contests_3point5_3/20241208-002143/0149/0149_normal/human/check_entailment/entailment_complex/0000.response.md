Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It reads the input values, processes them according to the constraints provided, calculates the minimum number of moves required to place all pieces in cells of the same color, and prints the result. The logic of calculating the moves based on the positions of the pieces on the chessboard aligns with the requirements of the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.
