Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes the input of the chessboard size and the initial positions of the pieces.
- It then calculates the total number of moves required to place all the pieces in cells of the same color.
- The code correctly determines the minimum number of moves needed by calculating the sum of absolute differences between the positions of the pieces and their respective target positions.
- Since the code follows the problem description for all potential cases and the output hints agree with the code functionality, we can conclude that the code is correct.
