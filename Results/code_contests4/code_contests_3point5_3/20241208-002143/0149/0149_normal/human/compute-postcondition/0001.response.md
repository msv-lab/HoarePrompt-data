Example Answer:
`p` is assigned a list of integers obtained by splitting the input read from the standard input using `sys.stdin.readline().strip().split(' ')`. The input is split by spaces, converted to integers, and stored in the list `p`. The value of `n` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an even integer greater than or equal to 2, p is a list of integers obtained from the input.
Output State: **n is an even integer greater than or equal to 2, p is a list of integers obtained from the input**
