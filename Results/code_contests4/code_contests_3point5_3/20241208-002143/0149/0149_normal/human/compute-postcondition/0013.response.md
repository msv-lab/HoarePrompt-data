Output State: **`n` is an even integer greater than or equal to 2, `p` is a list of integers where each element is one less than the original input values, `even` is the sum of absolute differences between `i * 2` and `p[i]` for all iterations of the loop, `odd` is the sum of absolute differences between `i * 2 + 1` and `p[i]` for all iterations of the loop.**
