Example Answer: 
`n` is assigned the value of `int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())`, which reads an input from the standard input and converts it to an integer. Since `n` is an even integer greater than or equal to 2, the value of `n` remains an even integer greater than or equal to 2. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an even integer greater than or equal to 2.
Output State: **n is an even integer greater than or equal to 2**
