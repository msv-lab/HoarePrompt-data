Example Answer:
Each element `pi` in the list `p` is decremented by 1 and assigned back to `p`. Since `n` is an even integer greater than or equal to 2, the list `p` obtained from input is modified accordingly. 
Output State: **n is an even integer greater than or equal to 2, p is a list of integers where each element is one less than the original input values**
