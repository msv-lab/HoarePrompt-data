The function `func` reads input from the user, processes it based on the constraints of `n` being an even integer greater than or equal to 2 and updates the values of `p`, `even`, and `odd` accordingly. It then calculates the sum of absolute differences between certain values derived from the loop iterations and the elements of `p`. Finally, it prints the minimum value between `even` and `odd`. The function does not explicitly state its purpose or return any values.
