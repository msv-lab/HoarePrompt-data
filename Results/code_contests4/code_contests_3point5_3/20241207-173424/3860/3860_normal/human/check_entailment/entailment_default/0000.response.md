Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code has no implementation and only contains comments. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if the code follows the problem description or not. As there is no code logic to analyze, we cannot identify any potential edge cases that the code might not be handling. Since there is no code to verify against the problem description, we cannot determine if the code is correct or not based on the description alone.
