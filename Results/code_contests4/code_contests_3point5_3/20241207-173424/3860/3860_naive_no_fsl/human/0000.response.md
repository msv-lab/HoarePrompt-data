Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program seems to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It takes the input for the number of roads, followed by the schedule of intersections. It then determines the days when road works will be in progress as per the given conditions and outputs them in ascending order.

The logic of checking whether both roads at an intersection have been asphalted before proceeding to asphalt them is implemented correctly in the program. The output also matches the expected output for the given examples.

Since the program follows the problem description for all potential cases and the provided examples work as expected, we can conclude that the program is correct.
