You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Tanechka is shopping in the toy shop. There are exactly n toys in the shop for sale, the cost of the i-th toy is i burles. She wants to choose two toys in such a way that their total cost is k burles. How many ways to do that does she have?

Each toy appears in the shop exactly once. Pairs (a, b) and (b, a) are considered equal. Pairs (a, b), where a=b, are not allowed.

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n, k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{14}) — the number of toys and the expected total cost of the pair of toys.

Output

Print the number of ways to choose the pair of toys satisfying the condition above. Print 0, if Tanechka can choose no pair of toys in such a way that their total cost is k burles.

Examples

Input

8 5


Output

2


Input

8 15


Output

1


Input

7 20


Output

0


Input

1000000000000 1000000000001


Output

500000000000

Note

In the first example Tanechka can choose the pair of toys (1, 4) or the pair of toys (2, 3).

In the second example Tanechka can choose only the pair of toys (7, 8).

In the third example choosing any pair of toys will lead to the total cost less than 20. So the answer is 0.

In the fourth example she can choose the following pairs: (1, 1000000000000), (2, 999999999999), (3, 999999999998), ..., (500000000000, 500000000001). The number of such pairs is exactly 500000000000.
Program:
```
def func_1():
    arr = list(map(int, raw_input().strip().split(' ')))
    return arr
(n, k) = map(int, raw_input().strip().split(' '))
if n >= k:
    x = k - 1
    print(max(0, x // 2))
else:
    l = k - n
    l = n - l + 1
    print(max(0, l // 2))
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
