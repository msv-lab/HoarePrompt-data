Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code takes input for the number of toys and the expected total cost of the pair of toys. It then calculates the number of ways to choose the pair of toys satisfying the condition where the total cost is k burles. The code correctly handles the cases where Tanechka can choose a pair of toys with the total cost being k burles. The logic behind calculating the number of pairs is also correct as it considers all possible pairs and outputs the correct result. The code aligns with the problem description and provides the expected output for all potential cases.
