#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^14.**
def func_1():
    arr = list(map(int, raw_input().strip().split(' ')))
    return arr
    #The program returns the list of integers 'arr' obtained from input
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads input from the user, converts it into a list of integers 'arr', and returns this list. It does not accept any parameters. The function operates under the assumption that the input consists of space-separated positive integers.
