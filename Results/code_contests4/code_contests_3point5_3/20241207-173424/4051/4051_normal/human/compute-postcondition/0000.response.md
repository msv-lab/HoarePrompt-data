Example Answer:
`arr` is assigned the list of integers obtained by splitting the input string. The content of the input string is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact values in the list. Therefore, the Output State is: n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^14; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from input.
Output State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^14; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from input**
