According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `i` from 1 to n+1. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with size `n+1`, `i` is between 1 and n+1, `ans` contains the maximum XOR value calculated between all elements of `a`, `j` is 0 and `i` has been updated to a new value. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1 and remain within the range of 1 to n+1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with size `n+1`, `i` is between 1 and n+2, `ans` contains the maximum XOR value calculated between all elements of `a`, `j` is 0**
