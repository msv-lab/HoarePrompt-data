Example Answer:
`ans` is updated to be the maximum value between the current `ans` and the XOR value of `a[i]` and `a[j]`. The value of `i` ranges from 1 to `n`, and `j` is always 1. Therefore, `ans` will contain the maximum XOR value calculated between all elements of `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with size `n+1`, `i` is between 1 and `n`, `ans` contains the maximum XOR value calculated between all elements of `a`, `j` is 1 for the loop to execute one more time**
