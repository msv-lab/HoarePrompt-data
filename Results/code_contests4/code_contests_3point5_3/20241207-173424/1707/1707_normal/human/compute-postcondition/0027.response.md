According to the code, the loop can execute for values of `i` from 1 to n. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is between 1 and n+2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1 and should be less than or equal to n. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with size `n+1`, `i` is between 1 and n, `ans` contains the maximum XOR value calculated between all elements of `a`, `j` is i**
