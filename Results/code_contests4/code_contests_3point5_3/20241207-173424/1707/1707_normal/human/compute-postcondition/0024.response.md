According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is between 1 and n+2, `j` is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with size `n+1`, `i` is between 1 and n+2, `ans` contains the maximum XOR value calculated between all elements of `a`, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute `j` is less than i**
