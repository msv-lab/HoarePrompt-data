Example Answer:
`ans` is updated to the maximum value between the current `ans` and the XOR result of `a[i]` and `a[j]`, where `i` and `j` are indices of elements in the list `a`. The loop iterates over all possible pairs of elements in `a`, calculating the XOR value and updating `ans` if a greater value is found. The Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with size `n+1`, `i` is between 1 and n+2, `ans` contains the maximum XOR value calculated between all elements of `a`, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute `j` is less than i.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with size `n+1`, `i` is between 1 and n+2, `ans` contains the maximum XOR value calculated between all elements of `a`, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute `j` is less than i**
