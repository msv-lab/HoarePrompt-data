Example Answer:
The value of `a[i]` is updated by performing the XOR operation between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`. The initial value of `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` are known from the initial state. Therefore, after the operation, the updated value of `a[i]` is calculated. Other variables remain unaffected. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with size `n+1` containing the updated values after XOR operation, `i` is 3**
