Example Answer:
The program prints the value stored in `ans`, which contains the maximum XOR value calculated between all elements of list `a`. The loop finishes when `j` reaches 0. The initial states indicate that `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with size `n+1`, `i` is between 1 and n+1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with size `n+1`, `i` is between 1 and n+1, `ans` contains the maximum XOR value calculated between all elements of `a`, `j` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with size `n+1`, `i` is between 1 and n+1, `ans` contains the maximum XOR value calculated between all elements of `a`, `j` is 0**
