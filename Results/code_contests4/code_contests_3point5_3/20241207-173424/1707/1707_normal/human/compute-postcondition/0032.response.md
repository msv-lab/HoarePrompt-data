According to the code, the loop will execute based on the variables `i` and `j`. If `j` is less than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is between 1 and `n`, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to a value less than `i`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with size `n+1`, `i` is between 1 and `n`, `ans` contains the maximum XOR value calculated between all elements of `a`, `j` is 2 for the loop to execute one more time**
