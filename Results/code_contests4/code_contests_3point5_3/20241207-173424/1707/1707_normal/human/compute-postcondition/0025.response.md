Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with size `n+1`, `i` is between 1 and n+2, `ans` contains the maximum XOR value calculated between all elements of `a`, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute `j` is less than i, `ans` is updated to the maximum value between the previous value of `ans` and the XOR result of `a[i]` and `a[j]`.**
