Example Answer:
The value at index `i` in list `a` is updated by performing XOR operation with the value at index `i-1`. The value of `i` is 2, so the value at index 2 in list `a` will be updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with size `n+1` containing the updated values after XOR operation, `i` is 2**
