Example Answer:
The value at index `i` in list `a` is updated by performing XOR operation between the value at index `i` and the value at index `i-1`. The output state will reflect the updated values in list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with size `n+1` containing the updated values after XOR operation, `i` is 1**
