Example Answer:
`s` is assigned the split input values as a list. The input values are stored as strings in the list `s`. The elements of the array `s` are non-negative integers less than 230. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, array elements are non-negative integers less than 230, `s` is a list of input values as strings.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, array elements are non-negative integers less than 230, `s` is a list of input values as strings**
