Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since the initial state mentions that `n` is a positive integer, after this assignment, `n` remains a positive integer. The array elements being non-negative integers less than 230 are not affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, and the array elements are non-negative integers less than 230**
