According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `i`. Since `i` is between 1 and n+2, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than i. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with size `n+1`, `i` is between 1 and n+2, `ans` contains the maximum XOR value calculated between all elements of `a`, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute `j` is less than i**
