According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `j` is less than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with size `n+1`, `i` is between 1 and n+1, `ans` is updated based on the XOR operation, `j` is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with size `n+1`, `i` is between 1 and n+1, `ans` is updated based on the XOR operation, `j` is 2**
