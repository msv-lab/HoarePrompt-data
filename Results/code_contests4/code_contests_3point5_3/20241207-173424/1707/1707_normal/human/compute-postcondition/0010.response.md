Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the value 0. No other variables are affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with size `n+1` containing the final values after XOR operations, `i` is equal to `n`, `ans` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with size `n+1` containing the final values after XOR operations, `i` is equal to `n`, `ans` is 0**
