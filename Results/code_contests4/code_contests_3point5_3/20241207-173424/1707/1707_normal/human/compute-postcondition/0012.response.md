According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range 1 to n+1. Therefore, the initial state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `i` is within this range. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with size `n+1` containing the final values after XOR operations, `i` is between 1 and n+1, `ans` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 0**
