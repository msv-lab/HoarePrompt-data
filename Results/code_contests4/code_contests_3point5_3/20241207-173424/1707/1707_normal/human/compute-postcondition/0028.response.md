According to the code, the loop can execute if `i` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted such that `j` is 0, and `i` is between 1 and `n`. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with size `n+1`, `i` is between 1 and `n`, `ans` contains the maximum XOR value calculated between all elements of `a`, `j` is 0 for the loop to execute**
