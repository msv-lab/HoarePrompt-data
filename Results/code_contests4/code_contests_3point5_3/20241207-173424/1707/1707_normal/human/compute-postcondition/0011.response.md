According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range `1` to `n+1`. Therefore, before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted such that `i` is within the range `1` to `n+1`. Since `i` is initially equal to `n`, it needs to be adjusted to `1`. Additionally, the loop initializes with `ans` equal to `0`, so no modifications are needed for `ans`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with size `n+1` containing the final values after XOR operations, `i` is 1, `ans` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is within the range 1 to n+1**
