According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with size `n+1`, `i` is between 1 and n+1, `ans` is updated based on the XOR operation, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1. So the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with size `n+1`, `i` is between 1 and n+1, `ans` is updated based on the XOR operation, `j` is 1**
