According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `j` is less than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with size `n+1`, `i` is between 1 and `n`, `ans` contains the maximum XOR value calculated between all elements of `a`, `j` is 0. Since `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than `i+1`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with size `n+1`, `i` is between 1 and `n`, `ans` contains the maximum XOR value calculated between all elements of `a`, `j` is 1 for the loop to execute one more time**
