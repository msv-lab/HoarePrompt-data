Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is updated to be the maximum of the current value of `ans` and the result of `a[i] ^ a[j]`. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged, `i` is between 1 and n+1, and `j` is 0. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with size `n+1`, `i` is between 1 and n+1, `ans` is updated based on the XOR operation, `j` is 0**
