According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with size `n+1`, and `i` is 2. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at the start of each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be 3.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with size `n+1` containing the updated values after XOR operation, `i` is 3**
