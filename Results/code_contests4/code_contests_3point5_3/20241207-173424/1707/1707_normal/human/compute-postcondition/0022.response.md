According to the code, for the loop to execute again, variable `j` must be less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is between 1 and n+2, `j` is 0. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with size `n+1`, `i` is between 1 and n+2, `ans` contains the maximum XOR value calculated between all elements of `a`, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute `j` is less than i**
