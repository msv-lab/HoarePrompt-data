Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the maximum value between the current value of `ans` and the XOR result of `a[i]` and `a[j]`. The loop runs for one more iteration as `j` is 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with size `n+1`, `i` is between 1 and `n`, `ans` contains the updated maximum XOR value, `j` is 2 for the next iteration.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with size `n+1`, `i` is between 1 and `n`, `ans` contains the updated maximum XOR value, `j` is 2 for the next iteration**
