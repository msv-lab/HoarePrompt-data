According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. Since the loop iterates from 1 to n, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be less than n, i.e., `i` should be less than or equal to n-1. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with size `n+1` containing the updated values after XOR operation, and `i` is 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with size `n+1` containing the updated values after XOR operation, `i` is 2**
