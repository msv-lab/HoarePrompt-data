Correctness: False

The given program is not correct. The issue lies in the calculation of the answer. The formula used to calculate the number of cyclic permutations is not correct. The expression `print(ans - 2 ** (n - 1)) % mod` does not accurately compute the number of cyclic permutations.

To correct this, a proper algorithm needs to be implemented to count the number of cyclic permutations based on the problem description. The current implementation does not adhere to the requirements specified in the problem description.
