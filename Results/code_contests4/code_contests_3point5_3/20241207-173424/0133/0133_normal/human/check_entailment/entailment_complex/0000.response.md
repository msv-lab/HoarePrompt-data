Correctness: **False**

The provided functions do not fully implement the requirements outlined in the problem description. Specifically, the functions do not address the construction of the graph based on the permutation as described in the problem statement. As a result, the code does not generate the correct output for finding the number of cyclic permutations of length n.

Additionally, the annotations do not provide details on how the functions relate to the problem description, making it difficult to determine if the code aligns with the requirements. The lack of implementation of the key graph building step indicates that the code is incorrect for the given problem.
