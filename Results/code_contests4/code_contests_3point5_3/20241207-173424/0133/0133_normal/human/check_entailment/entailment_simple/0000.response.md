Correctness: **False**

The annotated program provided does not implement the logic required to find the number of cyclic permutations of length n as described in the problem description. The functions defined in the program do not handle the specific requirements of building the graph based on the permutation and counting the number of cyclic permutations correctly.

The functions in the program are mainly focused on input processing and basic mathematical operations like prime factorization and factorial calculation. There is no implementation of the graph-building logic or the counting of cyclic permutations.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
