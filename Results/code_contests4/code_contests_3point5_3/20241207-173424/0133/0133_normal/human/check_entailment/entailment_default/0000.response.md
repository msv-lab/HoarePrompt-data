Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The output hints suggest that the code should compute the number of cyclic permutations of length n modulo 10^9+7. However, the provided code does not seem to be related to the problem description. The functions described in the output hints do not have any relevance to the given problem description. Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not meet the specified requirements.
