#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^6.**
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer value that is input by the user
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 prompts the user to input an integer value and returns that integer value. The code does exactly what the annotations describe without any missing functionality or edge cases.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^6.**
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained by mapping the input values after splitting them
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_2 does not accept any parameters. It reads input values, splits them, and then returns a list of integers obtained by mapping these split values. The function lacks error handling for non-integer inputs or empty input, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.**
def func_3():
    s = input()
    return list(s[:len(s) - 1])
    #The program returns a list containing all characters of the input string 's' except for the last character
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads an input string 's', then it returns a list containing all characters of the input string 's' except for the last character. The function does not accept any parameters, and it assumes the input string 's' is non-empty.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.**
def func_4():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing integers after splitting the input
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It reads input from the user, splits it, converts the split values to integers, and returns a map object containing those integers. The program does not validate the input or handle any exceptions that might occur during the conversion process.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^6.**
def func_5():
    s = input()
    return s.split(' ')
    #The program returns a list of substrings obtained by splitting the string 's' using space (' ') as the delimiter
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` reads a string input, splits it by spaces, and returns a list of the resulting substrings. The function does not accept any parameters. The code does not mention any error handling for invalid inputs or cases where the input string is empty.

    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: After the loop executes, `n` is 1, `ans` is a list containing all prime factors of the original value of `n`, `i` is greater than `cap`, `cap` is the square root of the original value of `n`.
    if (n > 1) :
        ans.append(n)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *After the loop executes, `n` is 1, `ans` is a list containing all prime factors of the original value of `n` including the original value of `n` itself, `i` is greater than `cap`, and `cap` is the square root of the original value of `n`.
    return ans
    #The program returns a list containing all prime factors of the original value of 'n' including 'n' itself
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` correctly computes and returns a list containing all prime factors of the input integer `n`, including `n` itself. It handles prime factors up to the square root of `n`, but is missing annotations for cases where `n` is a prime number greater than the square root of `n` or where `n` itself is a prime number.

def func_7(n, k):
    if (n == 1 or n == k) :

    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^6. n is not equal to 1 or k.
    if (k > n) :

    else :
        a = math.factorial(n)
        b = math.factorial(k)
        c = math.factorial(n - k)
        div = a // (b * c)
        return div
        #The program returns the result of the floor division operation 'div'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` is in the range 3 <= n <= 10^6. If `n` is equal to 1 or `n` is equal to `k`, the function returns 1. If `k` is greater than `n`, the function returns 0. Otherwise, the function calculates the factorial of `n`, `k`, and `n-k`, performs a floor division operation, and returns the result.
