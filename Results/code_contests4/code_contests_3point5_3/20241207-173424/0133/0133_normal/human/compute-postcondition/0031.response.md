The function `func_6` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^6. After executing the function body, if `n` is equal to 1, the function returns a list containing the integer 1. If `n` is not equal to 1, the function returns a list containing all prime factors of the original value of `n`, including `n` itself. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_6` is to accept an integer `n` within the specified range and return a list containing either the integer 1 or all prime factors of `n`.
