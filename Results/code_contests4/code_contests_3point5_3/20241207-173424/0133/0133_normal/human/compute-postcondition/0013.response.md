Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^6 and n is not equal to 1. If n % 2 == 0, then `n` is updated after integer division with 2, `ans` contains the value 2, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute the first time `cap` is greater than or equal to 2, `cap` is assigned the square root of `n`. If n % 2 != 0, `n` remains the same, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is 3, for the loop to execute the first time `cap` is greater than or equal to 2.***
