Example Answer:
The code calculates the factorial of the integer `n` using the `math.factorial()` function. Since `n` is an integer between 3 and 10^6, the factorial of `n` will be a large number. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^6. n is not equal to 1 or k, a is the factorial of n.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^6. n is not equal to 1 or k, a is the factorial of n**.
