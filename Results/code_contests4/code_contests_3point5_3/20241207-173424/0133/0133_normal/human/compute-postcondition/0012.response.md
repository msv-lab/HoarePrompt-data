Functionality: ** The function `func_7` accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` is in the range 3 <= n <= 10^6. If `n` is equal to 1 or `n` is equal to `k`, the function returns 1. If `k` is greater than `n`, the function returns 0. Otherwise, the function calculates the factorial of `n`, `k`, and `n-k`, performs a floor division operation, and returns the result.**
