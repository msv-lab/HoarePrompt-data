The function `func_7` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^6. 

Case_1: If the program is executed, it returns the integer 1.
Case_2: If the program is not executed, it returns 0.
Case_3: If the program performs a floor division operation 'div', it returns the result of that operation.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_7` is to accept two integer parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` satisfies the constraint 3 <= n <= 10^6, and based on the execution of the program, it returns different values depending on the cases described.
