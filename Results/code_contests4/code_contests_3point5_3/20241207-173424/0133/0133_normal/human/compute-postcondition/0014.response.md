According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `cap`. If `i` is less than or equal to `cap`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `cap` contains the square root of `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3 and `cap` must be greater than or equal to 3.
State: **if n % 2 == 0 then n is updated after integer division with 2, ans contains the value 2, i is 3 and for the loop to execute the first time cap is greater than or equal to 3. If n % 2 != 0 then n remains the same, ans is an empty list, i is 3 and for the loop to execute the first time cap is greater than or equal to 2**
