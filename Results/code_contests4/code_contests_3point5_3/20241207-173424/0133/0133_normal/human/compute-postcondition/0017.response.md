Example Answer:
`cap` is assigned the square root of `n`, where `n` is updated after integer division with `i`, and `i` is 3. The value of `i` does not affect the calculation of `cap`. For the loop to execute the first time, `cap` should be greater than or equal to 2. Therefore, the Output State is: n is updated after integer division with i, ans contains i, i is 3, cap is the square root of n.
Output State: **n is updated after integer division with i, ans contains i, i is 3, cap is the square root of n**
