Example Answer:
The value of cap is assigned the square root of n. The value of n, i, and ans is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: n is updated to n divided by i, ans is a list containing either 2 or an empty list with the appended value of i, i is an integer either 3 or 4, cap is the square root of n, and for the loop to execute again i is less than or equal to cap.
Output State: **n is updated to n divided by i, ans is a list containing either 2 or an empty list with the appended value of i, i is an integer either 3 or 4, cap is the square root of n, and for the loop to execute again i is less than or equal to cap**
