Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the value of factorial of `k`, but `k` is not defined in the initial state. Since `k` is not defined, the code will raise an error. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^6 and n is not equal to 1 or k, a is the factorial of n.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^6 and n is not equal to 1 or k, a is the factorial of n**
