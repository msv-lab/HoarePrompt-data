Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, n is an integer, ans is a list containing either 2 or an empty list, i is an integer either 3 or 4, and cap is the square root of n. If n % i == 0, n is updated after integer division with i, ans contains i, i is 3, and cap is the square root of n. If n % 2 == 0, n is updated after integer division with 2, ans contains the value 2, i is 4, and for the loop to execute the first time cap is greater than or equal to 3. If n % 2 != 0, n remains the same, ans is an empty list, i is 4, and for the loop to execute the first time cap is greater than or equal to 2.***
