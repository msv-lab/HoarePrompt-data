Example Answer:
`div` is assigned the value of the floor division between `a` and the product of `b` and `c`. The previous values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are known. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^6 and n is not equal to 1 or k, `a` is the factorial of n, `c` is the factorial of (n - k), and `div` is the result of the floor division operation.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^6 and n is not equal to 1 or k, `a` is the factorial of n, `c` is the factorial of (n - k), `div` is the result of the floor division operation**
