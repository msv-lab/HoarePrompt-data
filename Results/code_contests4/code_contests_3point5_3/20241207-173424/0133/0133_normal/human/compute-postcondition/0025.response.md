Postcondition: ***n is an integer, ans is a list containing either 2 or an empty list, i is an integer either 3 or 4, cap is the square root of n. If n % i == 0, n is updated to n divided by i, ans is a list containing either 2 or an empty list with the appended value of i, i is an integer either 3 or 4, cap is the square root of n, and for the loop to execute again i is less than or equal to cap. If n % i != 0, n remains the same, ans remains the same, i remains the same, cap remains the same, and for the loop to execute again i is less than or equal to cap.***
