Output State: **if n % 2 == 0 then n is updated after integer division with 2, ans contains the value 2 and i, for the loop to execute the first time cap is greater than or equal to 3. If n % 2 != 0 then n remains the same, ans contains i, i is 3 and for the loop to execute the first time cap is greater than or equal to 2**
