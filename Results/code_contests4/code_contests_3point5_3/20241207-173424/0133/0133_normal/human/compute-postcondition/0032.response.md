Functionality: The function `func_6` accepts an integer `n` within the range 3 to 10^6. If `n` is equal to 1, the function returns a list containing the integer 1. If `n` is not equal to 1, the function computes and returns a list containing all prime factors of the original value of `n`, including `n` itself. The function correctly identifies prime factors up to the square root of `n` and appends them to the result list. It handles the case where `n` is a prime number by directly adding it to the list of prime factors. However, there are missing annotations for scenarios where `n` is a prime number greater than the square root of `n` or where `n` itself is a prime number.
