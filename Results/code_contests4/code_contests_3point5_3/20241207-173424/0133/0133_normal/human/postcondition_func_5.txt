The function `func_6` correctly computes and returns a list containing all prime factors of the input integer `n`, including `n` itself. It handles prime factors up to the square root of `n`, but is missing annotations for cases where `n` is a prime number greater than the square root of `n` or where `n` itself is a prime number.
