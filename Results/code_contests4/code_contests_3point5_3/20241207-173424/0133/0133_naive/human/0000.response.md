Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of cyclic permutations of length n. The issue lies in the calculation of `ans` where it is multiplied by `i` for each iteration of the loop. The correct calculation should involve dividing by `i` instead of multiplying. This is because the number of cyclic permutations is calculated using the formula (n-1)! and not n!.

For example, if n = 4, the program would calculate ans as 24 (4!) and then subtract 2^(4-1) = 8, resulting in 16. However, the correct answer for n = 4 is 6, as there are only 6 cyclic permutations for n = 4. 

Therefore, the program does not adhere to the problem description for all potential cases, making the correctness **False**.
