Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for the number of days and bag's capacity.
2. The program then calculates the minimum number of bags Vasya needs to dispose of all garbage for the given n days.
3. The logic in the `func_1` function properly handles the disposal of garbage based on the given conditions.
4. The `func_2` function correctly calls `func_1` to calculate the minimum number of bags needed for both the original order of days and the reversed order of days, and outputs the minimum value.
5. The program works for all potential cases and follows the problem description, ensuring that no garbage is left after the n-th day.
