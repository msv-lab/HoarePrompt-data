The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, a list of integers `a` and an integer `k`. It calculates the number of bags needed to carry all the elements in `a` based on the floor division of the sum of all elements in `a` by `k`. If there is a non-zero remainder `carry`, an additional bag is required. The function then returns the total number of bags needed.
