The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `k`. Parameter `a` is a list of integers, and parameter `k` is an integer. 

After executing the function body, the program returns the updated value of 'bags'. This updated value is calculated by performing the floor division of the sum of all elements in list 'a' by integer 'k'. If the remainder 'carry' is not equal to 0, the result is incremented by 1 before being returned.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `a` and an integer `k`, and return the updated value of 'bags' after performing the specified calculations. If the remainder 'carry' is not equal to 0, the result is incremented by 1.
