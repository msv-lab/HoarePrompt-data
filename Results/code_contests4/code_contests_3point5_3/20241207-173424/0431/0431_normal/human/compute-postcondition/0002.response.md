Example Answer:
The code snippet calculates the minimum value between the result of calling `func_1(a, k)` and `func_1(a[::-1], k)`, where `a[::-1]` reverses the list `a`. The output state depends on the implementation of `func_1` and the values of `a` and `k`, which are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact output state without additional information.
Output State: **Cannot be determined without the implementation of `func_1` and the values of `a` and `k`**
