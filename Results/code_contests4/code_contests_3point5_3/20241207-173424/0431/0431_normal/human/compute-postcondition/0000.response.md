Example Answer:
`_` (underscore variable) is used as a placeholder for a value that is not needed in the program. Here, `_` is assigned the value of the first element of the input obtained by splitting the input at the space character, but it is not used further in the code. `k` is assigned the second element of the input after converting it to an integer. Therefore, the Output State is: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, a_i are integers such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each i.
Output State: **n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, a_i are integers such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each i.**
