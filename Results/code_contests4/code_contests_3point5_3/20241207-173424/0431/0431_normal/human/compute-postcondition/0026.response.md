Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, a list of integers `a` and an integer `k`. It calculates the number of bags needed to carry all the elements in `a` based on the floor division of the sum of all elements in `a` by `k`. If there is a non-zero remainder `carry`, an additional bag is required. The function then returns the total number of bags needed. **

In the current implementation, the function correctly calculates the number of bags based on the floor division of the sum of elements in the list `a` by `k`. It also handles the case where a non-zero remainder requires an extra bag. However, it is missing a potential edge case where the input list `a` is empty. In this scenario, the function should return 0 bags. This missing logic should be included for completeness.
