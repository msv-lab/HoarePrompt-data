Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned the values obtained by mapping integers from the input split by spaces. The values of `n` and `k` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, a is a list of integers.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `a` is a list of integers**
