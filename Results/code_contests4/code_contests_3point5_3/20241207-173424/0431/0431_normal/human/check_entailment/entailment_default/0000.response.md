Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes the number of days `n` and the bag's capacity `k` as input.
- It then reads the number of units of garbage produced on each day.
- The `func_1` function calculates the minimum number of bags needed to dispose of all the garbage produced over the `n` days.
- It iterates over each day's garbage production, calculates the number of full bags needed for that day, and keeps track of any remaining units of garbage that can be carried over to the next day.
- The function appropriately handles the cases where the remaining garbage from the previous day needs to be carried over to the next day.
- The function then returns the total number of bags needed to dispose of all the garbage produced over the `n` days.
- The `func_2` function calls `func_1` twice with the original list of garbage units and the reversed list to determine the minimum number of bags needed, considering carrying over garbage from the last day to the first day.
- The code follows the problem description for every potential case, ensuring that all garbage is disposed of efficiently.
