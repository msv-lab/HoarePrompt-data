Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code consists of two functions. 
- `func_1` calculates the minimum number of bags needed to dispose of all garbage produced over `n` days based on the given constraints. It iterates through the list of garbage produced on each day, calculates the number of bags required for that day, and updates the total bags count accordingly. It then returns the total number of bags needed.
- `func_2` reads the input values, calls `func_1` twice with different inputs (original and reversed list of garbage produced), and prints the minimum result of these function calls. This approach covers the case where Vasya can dispose of garbage either on the day it was produced or on the next day.

The code follows the problem description for every potential case by ensuring that no garbage is left after the `n-th` day and by considering the constraints of bag capacity (`k`). The annotations and the code logic align with the problem statement, and there are no apparent edge cases where the code fails to meet the requirements. Thus, the correctness of the code is **True**.
