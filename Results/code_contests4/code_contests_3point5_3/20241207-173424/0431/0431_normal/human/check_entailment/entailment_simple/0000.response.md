Correctness: **True**

The program consists of two functions. The first function, `func_1`, takes a list of integers representing the number of units of garbage produced on each day and an integer `k` representing the bag's capacity. It calculates the minimum number of bags Vasya needs to dispose of all the garbage based on the problem description. The function iterates through the list of garbage produced each day, calculates the number of bags needed for each day, and updates the total number of bags required.

The second function, `func_2`, takes input from the user, constructs the list of garbage produced each day, and then calls `func_1` twice with the list of garbage produced and its reverse, taking the minimum of the two results. 

The program is correct because it follows the problem description accurately. It calculates the minimum number of bags needed to dispose of all the garbage produced over the given days considering the bag's capacity constraint. The program handles multiple bags being composed and dropped into the garbage container in a single day and ensures that no garbage is left after the last day.
