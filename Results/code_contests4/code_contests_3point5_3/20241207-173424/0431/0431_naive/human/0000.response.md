Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given Python program correctly calculates the minimum number of bags Vasya needs to dispose of all garbage for the given n days. The function `func_1` iterates through the list of garbage units produced each day and calculates the number of bags needed based on the bag's capacity. The function `func_2` reads the input, calls `func_1` twice (once with the original list and once with the reversed list to handle the case where leftover garbage needs to be disposed on the last day), and prints the minimum of the two results. The logic implemented in the program aligns with the problem description for all potential cases, ensuring that no garbage is left after the n-th day.
