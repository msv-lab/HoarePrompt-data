Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program reads the input correctly by parsing the test cases, the size of the grid, and the initial grid configuration.
2. It correctly calculates the total number of tokens in the grid and determines the number of operations needed to make the grid a draw.
3. It then assigns colors to the cells based on their positions and token types ('X' or 'O') and selects the color that needs to be changed to achieve a draw configuration.
4. The program changes the tokens as required to make the grid a draw in at most ⌊ k/3⌋ operations.
5. Finally, it prints the resulting grid after applying the operations for each test case.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and should work correctly for all test cases as per the requirements specified.
