Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given Python program correctly implements the problem description. It reads the input, calculates the number of tokens 'X' and 'O', determines the number of operations needed to make the grid a draw, and then changes the tokens accordingly. The program iterates over the grid and changes tokens in a way that makes the grid a draw with the minimum number of operations possible. Additionally, it handles multiple test cases as described in the problem statement. 

Upon reviewing the program and the problem description, it seems that the program fulfills all the requirements and there are no potential cases identified where the program would not work as expected. Therefore, the correctness of the program is deemed to be True.
