Postcondition: ***After the if-else block executes, `M` is a list containing the return values of `func_3()` for each iteration of the loop, `k` is the total sum of occurrences of 'X' and 'O' in all elements of `M`, `K` is the integer division of `k` by 3.0, `cnt` is [1, 1, 0] if the element at index (i, j) in M is 'X' and `clr[i, j]` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt` is a list [1, 0, 0], and `clr[i, j]` is assigned the value -1 if the element at index (i, j) in M is not 'X'.***
