Example Answer:
The code increments the value at index (i+j)%3 in the list `cnt` by 1. Since `i` is 0 and `j` is 0, the value at index (0+0)%3 = 0 in `cnt` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `M` is a list containing return values of `func_3()` for each iteration of the loop, `k` is the total sum of occurrences of 'X' and 'O' in all elements of `M`, `K` is the integer division of `k` by 3.0, `cnt` is a list [1, 0, 0], `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0. The element at index (i, j) in M is 'X', `clr[i, j]` is 0.
Output State: **`M` is a list containing return values of `func_3()` for each iteration of the loop, `k` is the total sum of occurrences of 'X' and 'O' in all elements of `M`, `K` is the integer division of `k` by 3.0, `cnt` is a list [1, 0, 0], `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0. The element at index (i, j) in M is 'X', `clr[i, j]` is 0**
