Example Answer:
The value of `k` is increased by the sum of occurrences of 'X' and 'O' in the last element of `M`. The value of `k` is dependent on the elements in `M`. The loop executes only if `n` is greater than 1, but the initial state of `n` is not provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `M` contains the return value of `func_3()`, `k` is updated based on the occurrences of 'X' and 'O' in the last element of `M`, and for the loop to execute `n` must be greater than 1.
Output State: **`M` contains the return value of `func_3()`, `k` is updated based on the occurrences of 'X' and 'O' in the last element of `M`, and for the loop to execute `n` must be greater than 1**
