Postcondition: ***After the next iteration, M contains the return value of func_3(), k is updated to include the sum of occurrences of 'X' and 'O' in the new element of M, K is recalculated based on the updated k value, cnt may be adjusted based on the new sum of indices, i is incremented by 1, n is greater than the new value of i for the loop to execute again, and M[i][j] is equal to 'X'***
