Output State: **`M` is a list containing return values of `func_3()` for each iteration of the loop, `k` is the total sum of occurrences of 'X' and 'O' in all elements of `M`, `K` is the integer division of `k` by 3.0, `cnt` is a list initialized with [0, 0, 0], `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0. The element at index (i, j) in M is 'X', `clr[i, j]` is 0**
