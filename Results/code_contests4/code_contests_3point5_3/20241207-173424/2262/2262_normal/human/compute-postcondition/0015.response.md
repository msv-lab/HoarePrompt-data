Example Answer: 
A list `cnt` is initialized with 3 zeros. This means `cnt` will be `[0, 0, 0]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `M` is a list containing the return values of `func_3()` for each iteration of the loop, `k` is the total sum of occurrences of 'X' and 'O' in all elements of `M`, `K` is the integer division of `k` by 3.0, `cnt` is a list initialized with [0, 0, 0].
Output State: **`M` is a list containing the return values of `func_3()` for each iteration of the loop, `k` is the total sum of occurrences of 'X' and 'O' in all elements of `M`, `K` is the integer division of `k` by 3.0, `cnt` is a list initialized with [0, 0, 0]**
