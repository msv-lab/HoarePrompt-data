Output State: **After the loop finishes executing, M will contain the return value of func_3(), k will have the sum of occurrences of 'X' and 'O' in all elements of M, K will be recalculated based on the final k value, cnt will be adjusted based on the final sum of indices, i will be equal to n, and j will be equal to n-1. If M[i][j] == 'X', clr[i, j] will be (i + j) % 3. If M[i][j] != 'X', clr[i, j] will be -1.**
