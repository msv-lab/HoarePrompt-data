Example Answer:
`M` is appended with the return value of `func_3()`. The sum of occurrences of 'X' and 'O' in the last element of `M` is stored in variable `k`. The loop will only execute if `n` is greater than 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `M` contains the return value of `func_3()`, `k` is the sum of occurrences of 'X' and 'O' in the last element of `M`, for the loop to execute `n` must be greater than 1.
Output State: **`M` contains the return value of `func_3()`, `k` is the sum of occurrences of 'X' and 'O' in the last element of `M`, for the loop to execute `n` must be greater than 1**
