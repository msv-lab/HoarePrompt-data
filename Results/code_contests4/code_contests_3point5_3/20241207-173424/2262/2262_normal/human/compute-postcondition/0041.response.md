Output State: **After not entering the if block, M is a list containing the return values of func_3() for each iteration of the loop, k is the total sum of occurrences of 'X' and 'O' in all elements of M, K is the integer division of k by 3.0, cnt is a list representing the occurrences of each remainder when the sum of the indices is divided by 3, i is 1, n is greater than 1 for the loop to execute, all elements in clr have been assigned values based on the conditions in the loop code, for the loop to execute the first time n is greater than 0, j is 0, and M[i][j] is not equal to 'X', clr[i, j] is assigned the value -1**
