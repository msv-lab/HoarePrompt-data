Postcondition: ***`M` is a list containing the return values of `func_3()` for each iteration of the loop, `k` is the total sum of occurrences of 'X' and 'O' in all elements of `M`, `K` is the integer division of `k` by 3.0, `cnt` is a list [1, 0, 0], `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `j` is 0. If the element at index (i, j) in M is 'X', then `clr[i, j]` is 0. Otherwise, if the element at index (i, j) in M is not 'X', then `clr[i, j]` is assigned the value -1.***
