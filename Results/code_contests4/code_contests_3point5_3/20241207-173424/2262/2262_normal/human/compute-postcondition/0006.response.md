At the end of the previous iteration, the loop's execution depends on the variables `n`, `M`, and `k`. 
- The list `M` contains the return value of `func_3()`.
- The sum of occurrences of 'X' and 'O' in the last element of `M` is stored in `k`.
- For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`M` is a list containing the return value of `func_3()`, `k` is the sum of occurrences of 'X' and 'O' in the last element of `M`, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 1**
