According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If n is greater than 0, the loop will execute. However, since the loop does not seem to interact with `M` or `k`, there is no need to adjust their values for the loop to execute. 
State: **`M` is an empty list, `k` is 0, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0**
