Example Answer:
The function `func_3()` is called and its return value is appended to the list `M`. The value of `k` is updated based on the occurrences of 'X' and 'O' in the last element of `M`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1. The states of other variables are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `M` contains the return value of `func_3()`, `k` is updated based on the occurrences of 'X' and 'O' in the last element of `M`, for the loop to execute `n` must be greater than 1.
Output State: **`M` contains the return value of `func_3()`, `k` is updated based on the occurrences of 'X' and 'O' in the last element of `M`, for the loop to execute `n` must be greater than 1**
