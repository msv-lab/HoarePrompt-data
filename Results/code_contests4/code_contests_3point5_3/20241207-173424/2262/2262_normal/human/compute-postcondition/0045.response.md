Example Answer:
For each pair of indices (i, j) in the clr list, the value of (i + j) % 3 is calculated and used as an index to increment the corresponding value in the cnt list by 1. The clr list is updated based on the formula (i + j) % 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **clr list is updated based on the formula (i + j) % 3, all other variables remain unchanged**
