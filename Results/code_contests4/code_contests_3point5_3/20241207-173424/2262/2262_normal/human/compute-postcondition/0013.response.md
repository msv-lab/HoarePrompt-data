Example Answer:
`K` is assigned the value of `k` divided by 3.0 and then converted to an integer. The value of `k` is the total sum of occurrences of 'X' and 'O' in all elements of `M`. The loop will only execute if `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `M` is a list containing the return values of `func_3()` for each iteration of the loop, `k` is the total sum of occurrences of 'X' and 'O' in all elements of `M`, `K` is the integer division of `k` by 3.0.
Output State: **`M` is a list containing the return values of `func_3()` for each iteration of the loop, `k` is the total sum of occurrences of 'X' and 'O' in all elements of `M`, `K` is the integer division of `k` by 3.0**
