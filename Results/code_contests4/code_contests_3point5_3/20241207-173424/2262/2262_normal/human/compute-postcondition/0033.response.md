Postcondition: ***After the if-else block executes, `M` is a list containing the return values of `func_3()` for each iteration of the loop, `k` is the total sum of occurrences of 'X' and 'O' in all elements of `M`, `K` is the integer division of `k` by 3.0, `cnt` is updated based on the conditions mentioned, and `clr[i, j+1]` is assigned a value based on the conditions. If `M[i][j]` is 'X', `cnt` is [1, 1, 0], and `clr[i, j+1]` is assigned the value -1. If `M[i][j]` is not 'X', `cnt` is [1, 0, 0], and `clr[i, j]` is assigned the value -1.***
