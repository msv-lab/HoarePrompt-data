According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `M` contains the return value of `func_3()`, `k` is updated based on the occurrences of 'X' and 'O' in the last element of `M`, and `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `n` must still be greater than 1.
State: **`M` contains the return value of `func_3()`, `k` is updated based on the occurrences of 'X' and 'O' in the last element of `M`, for the loop to execute `n` must be greater than 1**
