Output State: **After the execution of the if else block, M contains the return value of func_3(), k is updated to include the sum of occurrences of 'X' and 'O' in the new element of M, K is recalculated based on the updated k value, cnt may be adjusted based on the new sum of indices, i is incremented by 1, n is greater than the new value of i, and j is less than n. If M[i][j] == 'X', cnt, i, and j are updated based on the current values of i and j, and clr[i, j] is assigned the value of (i + j) % 3. If M[i][j] != 'X', cnt, i, and j are updated based on the current values of i and j, clr[i, j] is assigned the value -1, for the loop to execute one more time j needs to be updated to the next value**
