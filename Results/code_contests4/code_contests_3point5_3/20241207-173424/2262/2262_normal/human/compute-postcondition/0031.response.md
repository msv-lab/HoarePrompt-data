The code snippet `cnt[(i + j) % 3] += 1` increments the value at index `(i + j) % 3` in the list `cnt` by 1. The previous values of variables are `M` is a list containing return values, `k` is the total sum of occurrences of 'X' and 'O' in all elements of `M`, `K` is the integer division of `k` by 3.0, `cnt` is either [1, 1, 0] or [1, 0, 0] based on the conditions mentioned, and `clr[i, j+1]` is assigned a value based on the element at index (i, j+1) in `M`.

Output State: **After the if-else block executes, `M` is a list containing the return values of `func_3()` for each iteration of the loop, `k` is the total sum of occurrences of 'X' and 'O' in all elements of `M`, `K` is the integer division of `k` by 3.0, `cnt` is updated based on the increment operation, and `clr[i, j+1]` is assigned a value based on the conditions mentioned.**
