Output State: **M contains the return values of func_3() for each iteration of the loop, k represents the total sum of occurrences of 'X' in all elements of M, K is the integer division of k by 3.0, cnt stores the occurrences of each remainder when the sum of the indices is divided by 3, i is equal to n, j is equal to n-1, clr has values assigned based on the conditions in the loop code, use_clr is 3, chg is 0, n is greater than 0, clr[i, j] is equal to use_clr. M[i][j] is assigned the value 'O'.**
