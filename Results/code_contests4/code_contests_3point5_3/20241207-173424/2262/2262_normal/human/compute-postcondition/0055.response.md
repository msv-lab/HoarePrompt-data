According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the value of `i` is less than `n`. Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted so that M contains the return value of func_3() for the new iteration, k is updated to include the sum of occurrences of 'X' and 'O' in the new element of M, K is recalculated based on the updated k value, cnt may be adjusted based on the new sum of indices, i is incremented by 1, and n is greater than the new value of i for the loop to execute again.

State: **After the next iteration, M contains the return value of func_3(), k is updated to include the sum of occurrences of 'X' and 'O' in the new element of M, K is recalculated based on the updated k value, cnt may be adjusted based on the new sum of indices, i is incremented by 1, and n is greater than the new value of i for the loop to execute again**
