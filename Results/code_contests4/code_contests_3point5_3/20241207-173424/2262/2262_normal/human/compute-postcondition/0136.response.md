The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters. It reads the input consisting of integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` test cases each including an integer `n` denoting the size of the grid and an `n x n` grid represented by strings of characters. The characters in the grid can be '.', 'X', or 'O'. The function processes the input accordingly, but the return value is not specified.
