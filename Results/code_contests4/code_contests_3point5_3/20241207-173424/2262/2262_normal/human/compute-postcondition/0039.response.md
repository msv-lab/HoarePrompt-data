Example Answer:
`cnt[(i + j) % 3]` is incremented by 1, where `i` and `j` are variables with unknown values at this point. The value of `clr[i, j]` is `(i + j) % 3`, all other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: After the assignment, `clr[i, j]` is assigned the remainder of `(i + j) divided by 3`, `cnt[(i + j) % 3]` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **After the assignment, `clr[i, j]` is assigned the remainder of `(i + j) divided by 3`, `cnt[(i + j) % 3]` is incremented by 1**
