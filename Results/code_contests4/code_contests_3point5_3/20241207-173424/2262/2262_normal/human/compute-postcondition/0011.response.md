Example Answer: 
The value of `k` is updated based on the occurrences of 'X' and 'O' in the last element of `M`. The sum of occurrences of 'X' and 'O' in the last element of `M` is calculated and added to `k`. The loop will only execute if `n` is greater than 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `M` contains the return value of `func_3()`, `k` is updated based on the occurrences of 'X' and 'O' in the last element of `M`, and the loop will execute only if `n` is greater than 1.
Output State: **`M` contains the return value of `func_3()`, `k` is updated based on the occurrences of 'X' and 'O' in the last element of `M`, and the loop will execute only if `n` is greater than 1**
