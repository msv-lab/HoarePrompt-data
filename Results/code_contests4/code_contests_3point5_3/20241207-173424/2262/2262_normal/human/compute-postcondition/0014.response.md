Example Answer:
No variables are affected by the code snippet `clr = dict()`. Therefore, the Output State is: `M` is a list containing the return values of `func_3()` for each iteration of the loop, `k` is the total sum of occurrences of 'X' and 'O' in all elements of `M`, `K` is the integer division of `k` by 3.0.
