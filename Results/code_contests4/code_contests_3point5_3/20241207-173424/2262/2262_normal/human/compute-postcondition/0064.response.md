Example Answer: 
The value of (i + j) % 3 is calculated and used as an index to increment the value in cnt. The previous values of cnt, i, and j are unknown, so the output state is: cnt, i, and j are all updated based on the current values of i and j, and clr[i, j] is assigned the value of (i + j) % 3.
Output State: **cnt, i, and j are all updated based on the current values of i and j, and clr[i, j] is assigned the value of (i + j) % 3**
