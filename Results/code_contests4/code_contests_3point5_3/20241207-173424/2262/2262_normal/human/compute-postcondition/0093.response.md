According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is equal to `n-2`, and `n` is greater than 0. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the next iteration, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **M contains the return values of func_3() for each iteration of the loop, k represents the total sum of occurrences of 'X' in all elements of M, K is the integer division of k by 3.0, cnt stores the occurrences of each remainder when the sum of the indices is divided by 3, i is equal to n, j is equal to n-1, clr has values assigned based on the conditions in the loop code, use_clr is 3, chg is incremented by 1, n is greater than 0, clr[i, j] is equal to use_clr, M[i][j] is assigned the value 'O' if clr[i, j] == use_clr.**
