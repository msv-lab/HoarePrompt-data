According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. 

Before the loop starts, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute:
- `M` is a list containing the return values of `func_3()` for each iteration of the loop
- `k` is the total sum of occurrences of 'X' and 'O' in all elements of `M`
- `K` is the integer division of `k` by 3.0
- `cnt` is a list initialized with [0, 0, 0]
- `i` is now 0

State: **`M` is a list containing the return values of `func_3()` for each iteration of the loop, `k` is the total sum of occurrences of 'X' and 'O' in all elements of `M`, `K` is the integer division of `k` by 3.0, `cnt` is a list initialized with [0, 0, 0], `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0**
