Example Answer:
The code calculates the sum of occurrences of 'X' and 'O' in the last element of list `M` and increments `k` by that sum. The previous value of `k` is 0, and the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `M` is a list containing the return value of `func_3()`, `k` is the sum of occurrences of 'X' and 'O' in the last element of `M`, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`M` is a list containing the return value of `func_3()`, `k` is the sum of occurrences of 'X' and 'O' in the last element of `M`, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0**
