The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters. It reads the input consisting of integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` test cases each including an integer `n` denoting the size of the grid and an `n x n` grid represented by strings of characters. The function processes the input by counting the occurrences of 'X' and 'O' characters in the grid, calculating certain values based on grid indices, and changing certain characters in the grid based on specific conditions. However, the return value of the function is not specified.
