** The input consists of t test cases, where each test case includes an integer n (1≤ n ≤ 300) representing the size of the grid, followed by n lines containing strings of n characters representing the initial grid. The characters in the grid are either '.' (empty cells) or 'X' (tokens). The character 'O' does not appear in the input for the easy version of the problem.
