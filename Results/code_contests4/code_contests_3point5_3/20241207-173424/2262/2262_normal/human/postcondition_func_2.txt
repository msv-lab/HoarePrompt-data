The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads a string input, and then returns a list of characters from the input string excluding the last character. The function does not have any constraints on 't' or 'n', so the annotations regarding 't' and 'n' are irrelevant. The grid containing '.' or 'X' characters is also not used in the function. Therefore, the actual functionality of the function is to simply remove the last character of the input string and return a list of the remaining characters.
