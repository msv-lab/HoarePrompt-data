**Precondition:** The input consists of integer t (1≤ t≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (1≤ n≤ 300) denoting the size of the grid, followed by n lines each containing a string of n characters representing the initial grid. The characters in the grid can be '.', 'X', or 'O', where 'O' does not appear in the input of the easy version. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 300.
