Correctness: **True**

The annotated program follows the problem description accurately. It handles the input of test cases, constructs the grid with the provided characters, determines the number of tokens in the grid, calculates the number of operations needed to make it a draw, changes the tokens accordingly, and prints the final state of the grid after the operations.

The program ensures that the sum of occurrences of 'X' and 'O' tokens does not exceed the specified limit, and it makes the necessary changes to achieve a draw configuration within the allowed number of operations. It follows the constraints and requirements stated in the problem description for both easy and hard versions.
