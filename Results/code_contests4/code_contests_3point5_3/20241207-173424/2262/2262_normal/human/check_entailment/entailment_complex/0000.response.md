Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The code reads the input correctly, including the number of test cases, the size of the grid, and the initial grid characters.
2. It processes the input by counting the occurrences of 'X' and 'O', calculating certain values based on grid indices, and changing characters in the grid to achieve a draw configuration.
3. The code ensures that the number of operations is at most ⌊ k/3⌋ as required by the problem description.
4. The output is printed correctly after applying the operations to make the grid a draw.
5. The code handles the easy version where the character 'O' does not appear in the input.

Overall, the code aligns with the problem description and fulfills the requirements specified, making it correct.
