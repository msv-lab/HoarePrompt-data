You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The only difference between the easy and hard versions is that tokens of type O do not appear in the input of the easy version.

Errichto gave Monogon the following challenge in order to intimidate him from taking his top contributor spot on Codeforces.

In a Tic-Tac-Toe grid, there are n rows and n columns. Each cell of the grid is either empty or contains a token. There are two types of tokens: X and O. If there exist three tokens of the same type consecutive in a row or column, it is a winning configuration. Otherwise, it is a draw configuration.

<image> The patterns in the first row are winning configurations. The patterns in the second row are draw configurations. 

In an operation, you can change an X to an O, or an O to an X. Let k denote the total number of tokens in the grid. Your task is to make the grid a draw in at most ⌊ k/3⌋ (rounding down) operations.

You are not required to minimize the number of operations.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1≤ t≤ 100) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤ n≤ 300) — the size of the grid.

The following n lines each contain a string of n characters, denoting the initial grid. The character in the i-th row and j-th column is '.' if the cell is empty, or it is the type of token in the cell: 'X' or 'O'.

It is guaranteed that not all cells are empty.

In the easy version, the character 'O' does not appear in the input.

The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 300.

Output

For each test case, print the state of the grid after applying the operations.

We have proof that a solution always exists. If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

XXXXXX
XX.X.X

5

Output

.X.
XX.XXO
XOXXOX
OXX.XX
XOOXXO
XX.X.X
OXXOXX
XOX.X
.X..X
XXO.O
..X..
..X..

Note

In the first test case, there are initially three 'X' consecutive in the second row and the second column. By changing the middle token to 'O' we make the grid a draw, and we only changed 1≤ ⌊ 5/3⌋ token.

In the second test case, we change only 9≤ ⌊ 32/3⌋ tokens, and there does not exist any three 'X' or 'O' consecutive in a row or column, so it is a draw.

In the third test case, we change only 3≤ ⌊ 12/3⌋ tokens, and the resulting grid is a draw.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is a positive integer representing the size of the grid and the grid is represented by a 2D list of characters containing 'X' or '.' only.**
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns the integer input value for the number of test cases

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: ** The input consists of t test cases, where each test case includes an integer n (1≤ n ≤ 300) representing the size of the grid, followed by n lines containing strings of n characters representing the initial grid. The characters in the grid are either '.' (empty cells) or 'X' (tokens). The character 'O' does not appear in the input for the easy version of the problem.
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers after converting the input strings to integers

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 300, and the grid contains '.' or 'X' characters only.
def func_3():
    s = input()
    return list(s[:len(s) - 1])
    #The program returns a list of characters from string 's' excluding the last character. 't' is a positive integer and 'n' is a positive integer with 1 <= n <= 300. The grid contains '.' or 'X' characters only.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is a positive integer representing the size of the grid, such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 300. The input grid contains characters '.' (empty cell), 'X' (token type) but does not contain 'O' in the easy version.**

The characters in the grid can be '.', 'X', or 'O', where 'O' does not appear in the input of the easy version. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 300.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
