Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code seems to follow the problem description accurately. It reads the input for the number of test cases, the size of the grid, and the characters in the grid correctly.
- It calculates the total number of tokens in the grid and then proceeds to change the tokens to make the grid a draw in at most ⌊ k/3⌋ operations.
- The code iterates through the grid, changes the characters based on certain conditions, and prints the final state of the grid after applying the operations.
- The implementation seems to cover all potential cases and correctly handles the task as described in the problem statement.
- The output hints also align with the code logic, indicating that the code should work correctly for the given problem.

Therefore, based on the code and the problem description, the correctness of the program is considered **True**.
