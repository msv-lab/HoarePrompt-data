Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality to determine if two given nodes belong to the same strongly connected component in a directed graph. It first constructs the graph and its reverse, then uses depth-first search (DFS) to find the strongly connected components. Finally, it processes the queries to check if the given nodes belong to the same component. The implementation follows the description of the problem and handles all possible cases.
