The function func_3 accepts parameters now, num_cmp, used, and cmp. It marks the current index as used, assigns num_cmp to cmp for the current index, and recursively calls itself on neighboring indices in rg that have not been used yet. The function continues this process until all connected indices have been visited and marked as used.
