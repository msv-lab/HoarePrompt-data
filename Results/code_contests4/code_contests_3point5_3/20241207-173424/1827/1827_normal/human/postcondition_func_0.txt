The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `frm` and `to`, both of which are positive integers representing nodes in a directed graph G(V, E) with nodes numbered from 0 to |V|-1. The function then updates the graph by adding an edge from node `frm` to node `to` and an edge from node `to` to node `frm` in the reverse graph, without returning any specific output. It is important to note that the annotations mention the state of the program before the function call, but don't provide any information about the state after the function execution.
