The function `func_2` recursively visits nodes in a graph represented by the adjacency list `g`. It marks each visited node as `True` in the `used` array and appends the visited nodes to the `back_track` list. The function accepts three parameters: `now`, `used`, and `back_track`, but the specific return value or output is not provided in the constraints.
