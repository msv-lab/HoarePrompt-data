Postcondition: ***All elements in the list `used` are updated to `True` for node `v`, `back_track` contains the path taken, `cmp` is a list of length `n` filled with updated values, `num_cmp` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute again `back_track` is not empty, `v` is initialized to the second last element in `back_track`, the value of `used[v]` is `True`, and if `v` is not already used, `num_cmp` is incremented by 2.***
