According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `back_track`, `v`, and `used`. If `back_track` is not empty and `v` meets the specified conditions, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, all elements in the list `used` are updated to `True` for node `v`, `back_track` contains the path taken, `cmp` is a list of length `n` filled with updated values, `num_cmp` is incremented by 1, `v` is initialized to the second last element in `back_track`, the value of `used[v]` is `True`, and if `v` is not already used, `num_cmp` is incremented by 2. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `back_track` should not be empty, `v` should be the second last element in `back_track`, the value of `used[v]` should be `True`, and if `v` is not already used, `num_cmp` should be incremented by 2.
State: **All elements in the list `used` are updated to `True` for node `v`, `back_track` contains the path taken, `cmp` is a list of length `n` filled with updated values, `num_cmp` is incremented by 1 and 2, for the loop to execute again `back_track` is not empty, `v` is initialized to the last element in `back_track`, the value of `used[v]` is `True`, and if `v` is not already used, `num_cmp` is incremented by 2**
