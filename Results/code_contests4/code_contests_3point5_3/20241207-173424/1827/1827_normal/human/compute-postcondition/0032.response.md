Functionality: **The function func_4 accepts a positive integer n representing the number of nodes in a directed graph G(V, E). It initializes lists used, back_track, and cmp. It then iterates through the nodes of the graph, updating the lists used, back_track, and cmp accordingly. After the iteration, it resets the used list, calculates the number of unique nodes in the back_track path, and updates the cmp list. Finally, it returns the number of unique nodes in the path stored in 'num_cmp' and the updated values for all nodes in the list 'cmp'.**
