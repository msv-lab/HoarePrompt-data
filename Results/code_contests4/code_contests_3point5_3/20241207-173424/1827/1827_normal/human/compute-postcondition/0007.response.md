According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `v` and the list `used`. If `v` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `v` is 0, `used[v]` is `True`. For the loop to execute one more time, `v` needs to be incremented by 1 and the value of `used[v]` should now be `True` as well.
State: **All elements in the list `used` are `True` for each node in the graph, `back_track` is a list containing the path taken, `cmp` is a list of length `n` filled with updated values, for the loop to execute the second time `v` is 1, and the value of `used[v]` is now `True`**
