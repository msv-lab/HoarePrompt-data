Example Answer:
`num_cmp` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `num_cmp` is unknown, so the new value of `num_cmp` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements in the list `used` are `True` for node `v`, `back_track` contains the path taken, `cmp` is a list of length `n` filled with updated values, `num_cmp` is updated value after incrementing by 1, for the loop to execute `back_track` is not empty, `v` is initialized to the last element in `back_track`, and the value of `used[v]` is `True`.
Output State: **All elements in the list `used` are `True` for node `v`, `back_track` contains the path taken, `cmp` is a list of length `n` filled with updated values, `num_cmp` is updated value after incrementing by 1, for the loop to execute `back_track` is not empty, `v` is initialized to the last element in `back_track`, and the value of `used[v]` is `True`**
