According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `back_track` is not empty. In this case, the loop will start iterating from the last element in `back_track` and move in reverse order. 

Before the loop starts, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute:
- `back_track` should not be empty
- `v` should be initialized to the last element in `back_track`
- `used` should remain as is with all elements set to `False`
- `cmp` should remain as is, a list of length `n` filled with updated values
- `num_cmp` should remain as is, set to 0

State: **All elements in the list `used` are `False` for each node in the graph, `back_track` contains the path taken, `cmp` is a list of length `n` filled with updated values, `num_cmp` is 0, for the loop to execute `back_track` is not empty, `v` is initialized to the last element in `back_track`**
