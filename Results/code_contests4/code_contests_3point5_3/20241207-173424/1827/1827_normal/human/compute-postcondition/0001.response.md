Example Answer: 
`back_track` is initialized as an empty list. The elements in the list `used` remain `False` for each node in the graph. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements in the list `used` are `False` for each node in the graph, `back_track` is an empty list.
Output State: **All elements in the list `used` are `False` for each node in the graph, `back_track` is an empty list**
