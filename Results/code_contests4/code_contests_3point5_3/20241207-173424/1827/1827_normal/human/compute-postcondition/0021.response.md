According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `back_track` and `v`. If `back_track` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, all elements in the list `used` are updated to `True` for node `v`, `back_track` contains the path taken, `cmp` is a list of length `n` filled with updated values, `num_cmp` is incremented by 1, `back_track` is not empty, `v` is initialized to the last element in `back_track`, and the value of `used[v]` is `True`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `back_track` must still not be empty, and `v` should be updated to the previous element in `back_track`, and the value of `used[v]` should be `True`.
State: **All elements in the list `used` are updated to `True` for node `v`, `back_track` contains the path taken, `cmp` is a list of length `n` filled with updated values, `num_cmp` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute again `back_track` is not empty, `v` is initialized to the second last element in `back_track`, and the value of `used[v]` is `True`**
