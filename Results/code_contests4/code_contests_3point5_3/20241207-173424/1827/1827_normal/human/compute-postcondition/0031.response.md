The function `func_4` accepts a parameter `n`, which represents a directed graph G(V, E) where |V| is the number of nodes and |E| is the number of edges in the graph. Each query contains a pair of nodes u and v, where 0 â‰¤ u, v < |V|. After executing the function body, the program returns the number of unique nodes in the path taken stored in 'num_cmp' and the list 'cmp' containing updated values for all nodes. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_4 is to accept a directed graph and a pair of nodes, then return the number of unique nodes in the path taken and the list containing updated values for all nodes.
