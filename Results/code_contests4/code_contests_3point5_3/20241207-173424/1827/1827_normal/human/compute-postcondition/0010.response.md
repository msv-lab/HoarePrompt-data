According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `v` and `used[v]`. If `v` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, all elements in the list `used` are `True` for each node in the graph, `back_track` contains the path taken, `cmp` is a list of length `n` filled with updated values. For the loop to execute the second time, `v` is 1 and the value of `used[v]` is now `True`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `v` should be 2 and the value of `used[v]` should be `True`.
State: **All elements in the list `used` are `True` for each node in the graph, `back_track` contains the path taken, `cmp` is a list of length `n` filled with updated values, `v` is 2 and the value of `used[v]` is now `True`**
