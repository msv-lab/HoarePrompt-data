According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, all elements in the list `used` are `False` for each node in the graph, `back_track` is an empty list, and `cmp` is a list of length `n` filled with -1. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, `v` should be set to 0.
State: **All elements in the list `used` are `False` for each node in the graph, `back_track` is an empty list, `cmp` is a list of length `n` filled with -1, for the loop to execute the first time `v` is 0**
