Example Answer:
All elements in the list `used` are initialized to `False` for each node in the graph. The length of the list `used` is `n`, which is the number of nodes in the graph. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements in the list `used` are `False` for each node in the graph.
Output State: **All elements in the list `used` are `False` for each node in the graph**
