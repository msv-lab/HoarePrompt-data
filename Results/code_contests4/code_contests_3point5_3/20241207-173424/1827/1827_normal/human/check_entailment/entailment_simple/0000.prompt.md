You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: A direced graph is strongly connected if every two nodes are reachable from each other. In a strongly connected component of a directed graph, every two nodes of the component are mutually reachable.

Constraints

* 1 ≤ |V| ≤ 10,000
* 0 ≤ |E| ≤ 30,000
* 1 ≤ Q ≤ 100,000

Input

A directed graph G(V, E) and a sequence of queries where each query contains a pair of nodes u and v.


|V| |E|
s0 t0
s1 t1
:
s|E|-1 t|E|-1
Q
u0 v0
u1 v1
:
uQ-1 vQ-1


|V| is the number of nodes and |E| is the number of edges in the graph. The graph nodes are named with the numbers 0, 1,..., |V|-1 respectively.

si and ti represent source and target nodes of i-th edge (directed).

ui and vi represent a pair of nodes given as the i-th query.

Output

For each query, pinrt "1" if the given nodes belong to the same strongly connected component, "0" otherwise.

Example

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: |V| and |E| are positive integers. The graph G(V, E) is a directed graph with nodes numbered from 0 to |V|-1. Each query pair u and v are nodes in the graph.**
def func_1(frm, to):
    g[frm].append(to)
    rg[to].append(frm)

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_2(now, used, back_track):
    used[now] = True
    for nx in g[now]:
        if not used[nx]:
            func_2(nx, used, back_track)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: All elements in `g[now]` have been visited and set to `True` in `used` after the loop finishes executing.
    back_track.append(now)

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_3(now, num_cmp, used, cmp):
    used[now] = True
    cmp[now] = num_cmp
    for nx in rg[now]:
        if not used[nx]:
            func_3(nx, num_cmp, used, cmp)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `used[now]` remains True, `cmp[now]` retains the value of `num_cmp`, `rg[now]` remains unchanged. The loop will only call `func_3` for `nx` in `rg[now]` where `used[nx]` is initially False.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **The input consists of a directed graph G(V, E) where |V| is the number of nodes and |E| is the number of edges in the graph. The graph nodes are named with numbers 0, 1,..., |V|-1. Each query contains a pair of nodes u and v, where 0 ≤ u, v < |V|.
def func_4(n):
    used = [False] * n
    back_track = []
    cmp = [-1] * n
    for v in xrange(n):
        if not used[v]:
            func_2(v, used, back_track)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: All elements in the list `used` are `True` for each node in the graph, `back_track` contains the path taken, `cmp` is a list of length `n` filled with updated values.
    used = [False] * n
    num_cmp = 0
    for v in back_track[::-1]:
        if not used[v]:
            func_3(v, num_cmp, used, cmp)
            num_cmp += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: All elements in the list `used` are updated to `True` for all nodes in the graph, `back_track` contains the path taken, `cmp` is a list of length `n` filled with updated values, `num_cmp` is equal to the number of unique nodes in `back_track`
    return num_cmp, cmp
    #The program returns the number of unique nodes in the path taken stored in 'num_cmp' and the list 'cmp' containing updated values for all nodes


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
