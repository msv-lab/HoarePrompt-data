Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After reviewing the provided code and the problem description, it is evident that the functions defined in the code correspond to the requirements of checking whether two nodes belong to the same strongly connected component in a directed graph. 

The `func_1` function correctly updates the directed graph by adding edges between nodes in both the original graph and the reverse graph.

The `func_2` function recursively visits nodes in the graph and marks them as visited in the `used` array, while adding the visited nodes to the `back_track` list.

The `func_3` function assigns component numbers to nodes based on their connectivity in the reverse graph, ensuring that nodes within the same strongly connected component are marked with the same component number.

The `func_4` function initializes the necessary arrays, calls `func_2` and `func_3` to determine the strongly connected components, and returns the number of unique components and the component numbers for each node.

Overall, the code handles the problem description requirements of identifying strongly connected components in a directed graph and determining whether two nodes belong to the same component. The annotations also align with the logic implemented in the code. Since no discrepancies or potential cases where the code does not work as expected were found, the correctness of the code is deemed to be true.
