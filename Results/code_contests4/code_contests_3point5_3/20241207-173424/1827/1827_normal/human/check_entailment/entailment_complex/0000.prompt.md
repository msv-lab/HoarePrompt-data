You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A direced graph is strongly connected if every two nodes are reachable from each other. In a strongly connected component of a directed graph, every two nodes of the component are mutually reachable.

Constraints

* 1 ≤ |V| ≤ 10,000
* 0 ≤ |E| ≤ 30,000
* 1 ≤ Q ≤ 100,000

Input

A directed graph G(V, E) and a sequence of queries where each query contains a pair of nodes u and v.


|V| |E|
s0 t0
s1 t1
:
s|E|-1 t|E|-1
Q
u0 v0
u1 v1
:
uQ-1 vQ-1


|V| is the number of nodes and |E| is the number of edges in the graph. The graph nodes are named with the numbers 0, 1,..., |V|-1 respectively.

si and ti represent source and target nodes of i-th edge (directed).

ui and vi represent a pair of nodes given as the i-th query.

Output

For each query, pinrt "1" if the given nodes belong to the same strongly connected component, "0" otherwise.

Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: |V| and |E| are positive integers. The graph G(V, E) is a directed graph with nodes numbered from 0 to |V|-1. Each query pair u and v are nodes in the graph.**
def func_1(frm, to):
    g[frm].append(to)
    rg[to].append(frm)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `frm` and `to`, both of which are positive integers representing nodes in a directed graph G(V, E) with nodes numbered from 0 to |V|-1. The function then updates the graph by adding an edge from node `frm` to node `to` and an edge from node `to` to node `frm` in the reverse graph, without returning any specific output. It is important to note that the annotations mention the state of the program before the function call, but don't provide any information about the state after the function execution.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_2(now, used, back_track):
    used[now] = True
    for nx in g[now]:
        if not used[nx]:
            func_2(nx, used, back_track)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: All elements in `g[now]` have been visited and set to `True` in `used` after the loop finishes executing.
    back_track.append(now)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` recursively visits nodes in a graph represented by the adjacency list `g`. It marks each visited node as `True` in the `used` array and appends the visited nodes to the `back_track` list. The function accepts three parameters: `now`, `used`, and `back_track`, but the specific return value or output is not provided in the constraints.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_3(now, num_cmp, used, cmp):
    used[now] = True
    cmp[now] = num_cmp
    for nx in rg[now]:
        if not used[nx]:
            func_3(nx, num_cmp, used, cmp)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `used[now]` remains True, `cmp[now]` retains the value of `num_cmp`, `rg[now]` remains unchanged. The loop will only call `func_3` for `nx` in `rg[now]` where `used[nx]` is initially False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_3 accepts parameters now, num_cmp, used, and cmp. It marks the current index as used, assigns num_cmp to cmp for the current index, and recursively calls itself on neighboring indices in rg that have not been used yet. The function continues this process until all connected indices have been visited and marked as used.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **The input consists of a directed graph G(V, E) where |V| is the number of nodes and |E| is the number of edges in the graph. The graph nodes are named with numbers 0, 1,..., |V|-1. Each query contains a pair of nodes u and v, where 0 ≤ u, v < |V|.
def func_4(n):
    used = [False] * n
    back_track = []
    cmp = [-1] * n
    for v in xrange(n):
        if not used[v]:
            func_2(v, used, back_track)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: All elements in the list `used` are `True` for each node in the graph, `back_track` contains the path taken, `cmp` is a list of length `n` filled with updated values.
    used = [False] * n
    num_cmp = 0
    for v in back_track[::-1]:
        if not used[v]:
            func_3(v, num_cmp, used, cmp)
            num_cmp += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: All elements in the list `used` are updated to `True` for all nodes in the graph, `back_track` contains the path taken, `cmp` is a list of length `n` filled with updated values, `num_cmp` is equal to the number of unique nodes in `back_track`
    return num_cmp, cmp
    #The program returns the number of unique nodes in the path taken stored in 'num_cmp' and the list 'cmp' containing updated values for all nodes
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_4 accepts a positive integer n representing the number of nodes in a directed graph G(V, E). It initializes lists used, back_track, and cmp. It then iterates through the nodes of the graph, updating the lists used, back_track, and cmp accordingly. After the iteration, it resets the used list, calculates the number of unique nodes in the back_track path, and updates the cmp list. Finally, it returns the number of unique nodes in the path stored in 'num_cmp' and the updated values for all nodes in the list 'cmp'.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
