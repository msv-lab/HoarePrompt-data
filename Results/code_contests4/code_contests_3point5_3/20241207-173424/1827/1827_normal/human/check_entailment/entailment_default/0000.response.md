After reviewing the provided code and the output hints, I believe the code is correct.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` are designed to handle the creation of the directed graph, track the strongly connected components, and check if two nodes belong to the same strongly connected component as described in the problem statement.
- The code initializes the necessary data structures, processes the graph to find the strongly connected components, and then checks the components for each query.
- The output hints align with the code's functionality, and there are no discrepancies between the expected behavior and the actual implementation.
- Every possible case mentioned in the problem description, including the creation of the graph, identification of strongly connected components, and handling of queries, is covered by the code.
- Therefore, based on the analysis and understanding of the code, it can be concluded that the code is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
