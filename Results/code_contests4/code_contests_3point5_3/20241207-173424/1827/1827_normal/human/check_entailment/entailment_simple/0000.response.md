Correctness: **True**

The annotated program consists of four functions that work together to determine if two nodes in a directed graph belong to the same strongly connected component. The functions correctly implement the algorithm to find strongly connected components in a directed graph by performing depth-first searches and keeping track of the components.

The program correctly handles the input format specified in the problem description, builds the directed graph, and processes the queries to determine if the given nodes belong to the same strongly connected component. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` work together to achieve the desired outcome.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
