Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The provided Python program correctly implements the functionality to determine if two nodes belong to the same strongly connected component in a directed graph. The program first constructs the directed graph by adding edges between nodes and their reverse edges. Then, it performs a depth-first search to find the strongly connected components using the Kosaraju's algorithm. Finally, it checks if the given pair of nodes belong to the same strongly connected component and prints the result accordingly.

The program follows the problem description by correctly identifying the strongly connected components based on the provided queries. The implementation seems to cover all potential cases and edge cases, ensuring that it accurately determines the connectivity between nodes in the directed graph. Therefore, the correctness of the program is deemed to be True.
