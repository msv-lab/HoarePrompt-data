Correctness: False

Explanation: The given program does not follow the problem description as it does not find the largest value among A+B, A-B, and A*B as required. Instead, it calculates A+B, A-B, and A*B separately and then finds the maximum value among them. This approach does not guarantee that the largest value among A+B, A-B, and A*B is being calculated. 

For example, for input 2 3, the correct output should be 6 (A*B), but the program will output 5 (A+B) since it finds the maximum value among A+B, A-B, and A*B, which is incorrect.
