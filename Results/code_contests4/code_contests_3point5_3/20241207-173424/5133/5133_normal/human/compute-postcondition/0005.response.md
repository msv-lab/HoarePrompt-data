Example Answer:
`ary` is assigned a list containing the values of `c`, `d`, and `e`, which are the sum, the result of subtraction, and the product of `a` and `b` respectively. The values of `c`, `d`, and `e` depend on the input values of `a` and `b`. Therefore, the Output State is: A and B are integers such that -1000 <= A,B <= 1000, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the sum of `a` and `b, `d` is the result of subtracting `b` from `a`, `e` is the result of multiplying `a` and `b, `ary` is a list containing the calculated values of `c`, `d`, and `e`.
Output State: **A and B are integers such that -1000 <= A,B <= 1000, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the sum of `a` and `b, `d` is the result of subtracting `b` from `a`, `e` is the result of multiplying `a` and `b, `ary` is a list containing the calculated values of `c`, `d`, and `e**.
