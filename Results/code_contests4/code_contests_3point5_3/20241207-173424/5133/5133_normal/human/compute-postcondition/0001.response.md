Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `A` and `B` are not affected, so the output state is: A and B are integers such that -1000 <= A,B <= 1000, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer.
Output State: **A and B are integers such that -1000 <= A,B <= 1000, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**
