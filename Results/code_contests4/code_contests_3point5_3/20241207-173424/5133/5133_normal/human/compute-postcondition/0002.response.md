Example Answer:
`c` is assigned the value of `a + b`, where `a` and `b` are input integers. The sum of `a` and `b` is calculated and stored in `c`. Therefore, the Output State is: A and B are integers such that -1000 <= A,B <= 1000, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the sum of `a` and `b.
Output State: **A and B are integers such that -1000 <= A,B <= 1000, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the sum of `a` and `b**.
