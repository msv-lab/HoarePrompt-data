Functionality: ** The function takes user input for two integers A and B, calculates their sum, difference, and product, stores them in an array, finds the maximum value among them, and prints the maximum value as 'Max: f'. **

Note: The function does not return any value, contrary to what the annotations suggest. Also, it does not cover the case where an invalid input is provided, such as non-integer inputs.
