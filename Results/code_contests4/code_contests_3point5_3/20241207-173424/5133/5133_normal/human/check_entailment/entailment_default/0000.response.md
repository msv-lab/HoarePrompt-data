Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code reads the input integers incorrectly by using `int(input())` twice, which will cause an error when entering the second integer. The code should read the input integers as a single line and split them to get A and B. Additionally, the code does not consider the case when the result of subtraction or multiplication is the largest value. For example, if A = 5 and B = 2, the correct output should be 10 (A * B), but the code will output 5 (A + B). Therefore, the code does not handle all potential cases as required by the problem description.
