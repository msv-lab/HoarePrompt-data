Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly follows the problem description. It takes two integers A and B as input, calculates the sum, difference, and product of A and B, then finds the maximum value among A+B, A-B, and A*B. Finally, it prints the maximum value as output. The program covers all possible cases within the given constraints and outputs the correct result.
