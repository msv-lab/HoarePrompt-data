The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `x4`, which is a string. 

Case 1: The program returns the result of applying 'func_1' to the first two characters of string 'x4', then passing that result to 'func_2' along with the remaining characters of 'x4' starting from the third character.

Case 2: The program returns the result of calling function func_1 with the first character of string 'x4' and the second character of string 'x4'.

Case 3: The program returns the first character of the string `x4`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a string `x4` and perform different operations based on the specified cases.
