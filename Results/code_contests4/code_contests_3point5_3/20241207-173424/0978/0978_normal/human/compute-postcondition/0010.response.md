The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`, both of which are integers. The function has multiple return points:

Case_1: The program returns the value of variable `y`.
Case_2: The program returns the result of recursively calling `func_1` with the parameters `y` and the remainder of `x` divided by `y`.
Case_3: The program returns the integer value of `x`, where `x` is less than `y` and `y` is divisible by `x`.
Case_4: The program returns the result of recursively calling `func_1` with the updated values of `x` and `y % x` until `y % x` is 0.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integer parameters `x` and `y`, and return different values based on the conditions specified in each case.
