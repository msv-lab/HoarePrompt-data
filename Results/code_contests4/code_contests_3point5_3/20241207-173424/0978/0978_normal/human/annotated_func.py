            #The program returns the result of recursively calling func_1 with the updated values of x and y % x until y % x is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two integer parameters `x` and `y`. It returns the value of variable `y` if `x` is greater than or equal to `y`. If `x` is less than `y`, it recursively calls `func_1` with updated parameters until `y % x` is 0, then it returns the integer value of `x`. The function does not handle the case where `x` or `y` is 0, and there is potential for an infinite loop if the recursion never reaches a base case.

def func_2(x4):
    if (len(x4) > 2) :
        return func_2([func_1(x4[0], x4[1])] + x4[2:])
        #The program returns the result of applying 'func_1' to the first two characters of string 'x4', then passing that result to 'func_2' along with the remaining characters of 'x4' starting from the third character.
    else :
        if (len(x4) == 2) :
            return func_1(x4[0], x4[1])
            #The program returns the result of calling function func_1 with the first character of string 'x4' and the second character of string 'x4'
        else :
            return x4[0]
            #The program returns the first character of the string `x4`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `x4`, which is a string. It checks the length of `x4` and performs different operations based on the length of the string. 
- If the length of `x4` is greater than 2, it applies 'func_1' to the first two characters of `x4`, then calls itself recursively with the result and the remaining characters of `x4`.
- If the length of `x4` is exactly 2, it calls 'func_1' with the first and second characters of `x4`.
- If the length of `x4` is less than 2, it returns the first character of `x4`.
The functionality provided in the annotations covers the main cases, but it does not explicitly mention what happens if the length of `x4` is 0. In that case, the code would throw an error since it is not handled explicitly.
