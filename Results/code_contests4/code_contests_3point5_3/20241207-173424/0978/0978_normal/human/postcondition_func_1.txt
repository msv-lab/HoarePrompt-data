The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `x4`, which is a string. It checks the length of `x4` and performs different operations based on the length of the string. 
- If the length of `x4` is greater than 2, it applies 'func_1' to the first two characters of `x4`, then calls itself recursively with the result and the remaining characters of `x4`.
- If the length of `x4` is exactly 2, it calls 'func_1' with the first and second characters of `x4`.
- If the length of `x4` is less than 2, it returns the first character of `x4`.
The functionality provided in the annotations covers the main cases, but it does not explicitly mention what happens if the length of `x4` is 0. In that case, the code would throw an error since it is not handled explicitly.
