Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not directly related to the problem description, and their annotations do not provide any insight into how they relate to the grid of cells and moving coins.

Without a clear mapping between the provided functions and the problem description, it is difficult to determine the correctness of the program. Therefore, the program is considered incorrect as it does not align with the requirements outlined in the problem description.
