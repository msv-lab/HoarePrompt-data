# Your task:

Problem description: There is a grid of square cells with H horizontal rows and W vertical columns. The cell at the i-th row and the j-th column will be denoted as Cell (i, j).

In Cell (i, j), a_{ij} coins are placed.

You can perform the following operation any number of times:

Operation: Choose a cell that was not chosen before and contains one or more coins, then move one of those coins to a vertically or horizontally adjacent cell.

Maximize the number of cells containing an even number of coins.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 1 \leq H, W \leq 500
* 0 \leq a_{ij} \leq 9

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


H W
a_{11} a_{12} ... a_{1W}
a_{21} a_{22} ... a_{2W}
:
a_{H1} a_{H2} ... a_{HW}


Output

Print a sequence of operations that maximizes the number of cells containing an even number of coins, in the following format:


N
y_1 x_1 y_1' x_1'
y_2 x_2 y_2' x_2'
:
y_N x_N y_N' x_N'


That is, in the first line, print an integer N between 0 and H \times W (inclusive), representing the number of operations.

In the (i+1)-th line (1 \leq i \leq N), print four integers y_i, x_i, y_i' and x_i' (1 \leq y_i, y_i' \leq H and 1 \leq x_i, x_i' \leq W), representing the i-th operation. These four integers represents the operation of moving one of the coins placed in Cell (y_i, x_i) to a vertically or horizontally adjacent cell, (y_i', x_i').

Functions with output description for each function:

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(x, y):
    if x >= y:
        if x % y == 0:
            return y
        else:
            return func_1(y, x % y)
    elif y % x == 0:
        return x
    else:
        return func_1(x, y % x)
''' 

 Output decription for function1:  The function `func_1` takes two integer parameters `x` and `y`. It returns the value of variable `y` if `x` is greater than or equal to `y`. If `x` is less than `y`, it recursively calls `func_1` with updated parameters until `y % x` is 0, then it returns the integer value of `x`. The function does not handle the case where `x` or `y` is 0, and there is potential for an infinite loop if the recursion never reaches a base case.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(x4):
    if len(x4) > 2:
        return func_2([func_1(x4[0], x4[1])] + x4[2:])
    elif len(x4) == 2:
        return func_1(x4[0], x4[1])
    else:
        return x4[0]
(N, X) = map(int, input().split())
x = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
x.append(X)
x3 = []
for i in range(len(x) - 1):
    x3.append(abs(x[i + 1] - x[i]))
print(func_2(x3))
''' 

 Output decription for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `x4`, which is a string. It checks the length of `x4` and performs different operations based on the length of the string. 
- If the length of `x4` is greater than 2, it applies 'func_1' to the first two characters of `x4`, then calls itself recursively with the result and the remaining characters of `x4`.
- If the length of `x4` is exactly 2, it calls 'func_1' with the first and second characters of `x4`.
- If the length of `x4` is less than 2, it returns the first character of `x4`.
The functionality provided in the annotations covers the main cases, but it does not explicitly mention what happens if the length of `x4` is 0. In that case, the code would throw an error since it is not handled explicitly.

Based on the provided functions, it is clear that they are not related to the problem description. Therefore, we cannot determine the correctness of the provided Python program for the grid of square cells based on the functions provided. 

Correctness: **False**.
