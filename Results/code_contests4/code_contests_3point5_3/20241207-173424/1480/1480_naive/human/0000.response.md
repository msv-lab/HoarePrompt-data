Correctness: **False**

The given program does not handle the case when `x = 1` properly. In this case, the program should output a binary string where there are exactly `a` zeroes, exactly `b` ones, and only one index `i` such that `s_i ≠ s_{i + 1}`. However, the program does not provide the correct output for this case.

For example, if we input `1 3 1`, the expected output should be `1011` where there is only one index `i=1` such that `s_i ≠ s_{i + 1}`. But the program would output `0111` which does not satisfy the condition.
