Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly constructs a binary string "s" of length n = a + b such that there are exactly a zeroes, exactly b ones, and exactly x indices i such that s_i â‰  s_{i + 1}. 

The program handles the case when x > 1 and a == 1 by starting with '1' at the beginning of the string and decrementing b. It then iterates through the remaining x-1 indices and alternates between '0' and '1' to satisfy the condition. Finally, it appends the remaining '1's and '0's based on the updated values of a and b.

The logic of the program is correct and it satisfies the problem description for all possible input cases.
