Correctness: **True**

The program correctly constructs a binary string `s` of length `n = a + b` such that there are exactly `a` zeros, `b` ones, and exactly `x` indices `i` such that `s_i â‰  s_{i + 1}`. The program uses a simple logic to alternate between '0' and '1' characters in the string `s` based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `x`. The final string `s` satisfies all the conditions specified in the problem description.
