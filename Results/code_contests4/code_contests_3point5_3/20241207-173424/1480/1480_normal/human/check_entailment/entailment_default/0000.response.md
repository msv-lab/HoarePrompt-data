Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description. It fails to handle cases where `a` is not equal to 1 and `x` is greater than 1. The output hints also suggest that the code may not be handling all potential cases correctly. There are missing explanations for various cases in the code, which indicates that the actual functionality might differ from what is described in the annotations. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
