According to the code, the loop can execute if `x` is greater than 1. Right before the loop, `a`, `b`, `x` are positive integers. If `x` > 1 and `a` is 1, then `a` remains 1, `b` becomes one less than its previous value, `x` remains a positive integer greater than 1, and `s` is the string '1'. If `x` is not greater than 1 or `a` is not 1, then `a` is decreased by 1, `b` and `x` are positive integers satisfying the given conditions, and `s` is the string '0'. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `x` is still greater than 1. If `x` is greater than 1, no other states need adjustment. 

State: **`a`, `b`, `x` are positive integers. If `x` > 1 and `a` is 1, then `a` remains 1, `b` becomes one less than its previous value, `x` remains a positive integer greater than 1, and `s` is the string '1'. If `x` is not greater than 1 or `a` is not 1, then `a` is decreased by 1, `b` and `x` are positive integers satisfying the given conditions, and `s` is the string '0'. (Repeat state if `x` is greater than 1)**
