Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer, `a` is either 1 or 0, `b` is `x - 1` or `x - 2` based on the initial conditions, `s` is a string of length `x` with alternating '1's and '0's. If `s[-1]` is not equal to '0', then `a` is 0, `b` is `x - 1`, `x` is 1, and `s` is a string of length `x` with alternating '1's and '0's***
