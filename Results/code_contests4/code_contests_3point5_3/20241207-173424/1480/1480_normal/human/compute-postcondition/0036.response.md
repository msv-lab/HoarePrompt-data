Example Answer:
The code appends '0' to the string `s` `a` number of times. Since `a` can be either 1 or 0, the string `s` will have '0' appended once if `a` is 1 and no '0's appended if `a` is 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer, `a` is either 1 or 0, `b` is `x - 1` or `x - 2`, `s` is a string of length `x` with alternating '1's and '0's with an additional '0' if `a` is 1.
Output State: **`x` is an integer, `a` is either 1 or 0, `b` is `x - 1` or `x - 2`, `s` is a string of length `x` with alternating '1's and '0's with an additional '0` if `a` is 1**
