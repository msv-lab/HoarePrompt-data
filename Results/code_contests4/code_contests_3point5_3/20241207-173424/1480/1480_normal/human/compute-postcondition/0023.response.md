Output State: **If `x` is greater than 1 and `a` is 1, then after the execution of the if else block, `a` remains 1, `b` is two less than its previous value, `x` is a positive integer greater than 1, and `s` is the string '11'. If `x` is not greater than 1 or `a` is not 1, then after the execution of the if else block, `a` becomes 0, `b` is one less than its previous value, `x` is a positive integer greater than 1, and `s` is the string '10'.**
