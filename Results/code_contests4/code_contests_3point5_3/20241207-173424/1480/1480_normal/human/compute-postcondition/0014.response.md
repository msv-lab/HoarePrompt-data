Example Answer:
The value of `a` is decreased by 1 regardless of the previous state. If `x` was greater than 1 and `a` was 1, then `b` is also one less than its previous value, `x` remains a positive integer greater than 1, and `s` is the string '10'. If `x` was not greater than 1 or `a` was not 1, then `a` is still decreased by 1, `b` and `x` are positive integers satisfying the conditions, and `s` is the string '00'.
Output State: **`a` is decreased by 1, `b` is one less than its previous value if `x > 1 and a = 1`, `x` remains a positive integer greater than 1, `s` is the string '10' if `x > 1 and a = 1`; otherwise, `a` is decreased by 1, `b` and `x` are positive integers satisfying the conditions, `s` is the string '00'**
