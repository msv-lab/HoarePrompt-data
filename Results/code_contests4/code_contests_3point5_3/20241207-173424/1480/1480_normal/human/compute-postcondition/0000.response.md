Example Answer:
The values of `a`, `b`, and `x` are assigned by mapping the integer inputs from `raw_input().split(' ')`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `x` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ x < a + b. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, and `x` are positive integers satisfying the given conditions.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `x` are positive integers satisfying the given conditions**
