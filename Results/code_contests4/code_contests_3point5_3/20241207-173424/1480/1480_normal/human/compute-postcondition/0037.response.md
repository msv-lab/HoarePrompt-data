Example Answer:
`s` is appended with '1' repeated `b` times. The value of `b` is either `x - 1` or `x - 2`, and the value of `x` is known to be an integer. If `a` is 1, an additional '0' is added to the end of the string. Therefore, after execution, `s` will have its original alternating '1's and '0's pattern extended by the additional '1's based on the value of `b`. 
Output State: **`x` is an integer, `a` is either 1 or 0, `b` is `x - 1` or `x - 2`, `s` is a string of length `x + b + 1` with alternating '1's and '0's.**
