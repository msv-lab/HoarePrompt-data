Example Answer:
`a` is decremented by 1, and since `a` was initially 1, after execution, `a` becomes 0. The values of `b`, `x`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is 0, `b` is two less than its previous value, `x` is a positive integer greater than 1, `s` is the string '110'.
Output State: **`a` is 0, `b` is two less than its previous value, `x` is a positive integer greater than 1, `s` is the string '110'**
