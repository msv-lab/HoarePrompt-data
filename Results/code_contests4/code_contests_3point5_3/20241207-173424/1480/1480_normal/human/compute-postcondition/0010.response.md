Output State: **`a`, `b`, `x` are positive integers. If `x` > 1 and `a` is 1, then `a` remains 1, `b` becomes one less than its previous value, `x` remains a positive integer greater than 1, and `s` is the string '11'. If `x` is not greater than 1 or `a` is not 1, then `a` is decreased by 1, `b` and `x` are positive integers satisfying the given conditions, and `s` is the string '01'. Additionally, after entering the if condition where `s[-1] == '0'`, `a` is decreased by 1, `b` and `x` are positive integers, and `s` is the string '01'.**
