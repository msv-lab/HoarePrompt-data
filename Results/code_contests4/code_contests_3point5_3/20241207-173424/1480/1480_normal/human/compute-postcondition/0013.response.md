Output State: **`a` is decreased by 1 if `x` > 1 and `a` is 1, `b` is one less than its previous value if `x` > 1 and `a` is 1, `x` remains a positive integer greater than 1, and `s` is the string '10' if `x` > 1 and `a` is 1. If `x` is not greater than 1 or `a` is not 1, `a` is decreased by 1, `b` and `x` are positive integers satisfying the given conditions, and `s` is the string '00'**
