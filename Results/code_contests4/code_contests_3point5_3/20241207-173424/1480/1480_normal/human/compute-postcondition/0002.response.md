Example Answer: 
`s` is assigned the string '1'. The values of the other variables `a`, `b`, and `x` remain the same as positive integers. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is 1, `b` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer greater than 1, `s` is the string '1'.
Output State: **`a` is 1, `b` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer greater than 1, `s` is the string '1'**
