According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `x`. If `x` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is a positive integer greater than 1. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `x` needs to remain greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **If `x` is greater than 1 and `a` is 1, then `a` is 1, `b` is one less than its previous value, `x` is a positive integer greater than 1, and `s` is the string '1'.**
