Output State: **If `x` > 1 and `a` is 1, then `a` is 1, `b` is one less than its previous value, `x` is a positive integer greater than 1, and `s` is the string '1'. If `x` is not greater than 1 or `a` is not 1, then `a` is decreased by 1, `b` and `x` are positive integers satisfying the given conditions, and `s` is the string '0'.**
