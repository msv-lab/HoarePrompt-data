Output State: **If `x` is greater than 1 and `a` is 1, then `a` remains 1, `b` is `x - 2`, `x` is 1, and `s` is a string of length `x + b + a` with alternating '1's and '0's. If `x` is not greater than 1 or `a` is not 1, then `a` is 0, `b` is `x - 1`, `x` is 1, and `s` is a string of length `x + b + 1` with alternating '1's and '0's.**
