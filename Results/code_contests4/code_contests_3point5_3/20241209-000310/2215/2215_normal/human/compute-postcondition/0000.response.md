Since the code snippet provided is a simple print statement that prints the number 3, it does not affect the initial state variables. Therefore, the Output State is: id is an integer between 0 and 10^6, name of the document is a string, and text of the document is a string with size not exceeding 10 kilobytes.
Output State: **id is an integer between 0 and 10^6, name of the document is a string, and text of the document is a string with size not exceeding 10 kilobytes**
