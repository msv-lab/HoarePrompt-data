The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function is responsible for processing and analyzing a document. The document has an `id` which is an integer between 0 and 10^6, a `name` which is a string, and a `text` which is a string with a size not exceeding 10 kilobytes. The function processes the document and performs some analysis or computation based on the content of the document. The function does not return any specific value, as the output or result of the analysis will depend on the specific implementation of the function.
