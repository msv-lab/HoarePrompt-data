You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The Smart Beaver from ABBYY came up with another splendid problem for the ABBYY Cup participants! This time the Beaver invites the contest participants to check out a problem on sorting documents by their subjects. Let's describe the problem:

You've got some training set of documents. For each document you know its subject. The subject in this problem is an integer from 1 to 3. Each of these numbers has a physical meaning. For instance, all documents with subject 3 are about trade.

You can download the training set of documents at the following link: http://download4.abbyy.com/a2/X2RZ2ZWXBG5VYWAL61H76ZQM/train.zip. The archive contains three directories with names "1", "2", "3". Directory named "1" contains documents on the 1-st subject, directory "2" contains documents on the 2-nd subject, and directory "3" contains documents on the 3-rd subject. Each document corresponds to exactly one file from some directory.

All documents have the following format: the first line contains the document identifier, the second line contains the name of the document, all subsequent lines contain the text of the document. The document identifier is used to make installing the problem more convenient and has no useful information for the participants.

You need to write a program that should indicate the subject for a given document. It is guaranteed that all documents given as input to your program correspond to one of the three subjects of the training set.

Input

The first line contains integer id (0 ≤ id ≤ 106) — the document identifier. The second line contains the name of the document. The third and the subsequent lines contain the text of the document. It is guaranteed that the size of any given document will not exceed 10 kilobytes.

The tests for this problem are divided into 10 groups. Documents of groups 1 and 2 are taken from the training set, but their identifiers will not match the identifiers specified in the training set. Groups from the 3-rd to the 10-th are roughly sorted by the author in ascending order of difficulty (these groups contain documents which aren't present in the training set).

Output

Print an integer from 1 to 3, inclusive — the number of the subject the given document corresponds to.

Examples
Program:
```
print('3')
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
