Example Answer:
The list `tmp` is appended to the list `data`. The contents of `tmp` are added to `data`. The initial state of `data` contained integers mapped from input split by whitespace, and `tmp` contained the list of integers mapped from input split by whitespace. After the execution, `data` will have the integers from both `data` and `tmp` combined.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `data` contains the combined integers from input split by whitespace, `tmp` contains the list of integers mapped from input split by whitespace**
