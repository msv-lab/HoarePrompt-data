Example Answer: 
The list `tmp` is appended to the list `data`. The contents of `tmp` are added as a single element in `data`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `data` contains the integers mapped from input split by whitespace and `tmp` contains the list of integers mapped from input split by whitespace.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `data` contains the integers mapped from input split by whitespace, `tmp` contains the list of integers mapped from input split by whitespace**
