According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `n` must still be greater than 0. 
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `data` is a list containing the integers mapped from input split by whitespace, `tmp` contains the integers mapped from input split by whitespace**
