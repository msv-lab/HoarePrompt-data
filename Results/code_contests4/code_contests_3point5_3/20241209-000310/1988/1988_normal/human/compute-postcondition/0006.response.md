Example Answer:
`tmp` is assigned the list of integers obtained by mapping the input split by whitespace to integers. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `data` is a list containing the integers mapped from input split by whitespace, `tmp` contains the list of integers mapped from input split by whitespace.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `data` is a list containing the integers mapped from input split by whitespace, `tmp` contains the list of integers mapped from input split by whitespace**
