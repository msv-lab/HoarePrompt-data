Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` as input and then reads `n` lines, each containing 10 integers separated by whitespace. It stores these integers in a list of lists named `data`. The function does not accept any parameters and solely relies on user input to populate the `data` list. The purpose or specific functionality of the function beyond this input processing is not defined and would need to be clarified based on additional information or constraints. **
