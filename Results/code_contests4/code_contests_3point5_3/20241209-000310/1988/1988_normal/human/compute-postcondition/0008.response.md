According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0. For the next iteration, `i` will be increased by 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `data` contains the integers mapped from input split by whitespace, `tmp` contains the list of integers mapped from input split by whitespace**
