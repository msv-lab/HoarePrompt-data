Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
1. The program does not implement the logic required to determine whether both cylinder B and cylinder C can arrange large balls on the small numbered balls. The program only reads the input data but does not perform any comparisons or calculations to determine the arrangement of balls in the cylinders.
2. The program does not output "YES" or "NO" based on the arrangement of balls in the cylinders as required by the problem description.
3. The program is incomplete and does not include the necessary logic to solve the problem described.
