You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: <image>


There is a container that is bifurcated as shown in the figure. Drop 10 balls numbered from 1 to 10 through the opening A of the container and place the balls in the left cylinder B or the right cylinder C. Since plate D can rotate left and right around the fulcrum E, you can move plate D to decide whether to put it in cylinder B or cylinder C.

Gives a sequence of balls to drop from opening A. Put them in cylinder B or cylinder C in order. At this time, create a program that outputs YES if both cylinder B and cylinder C can arrange large balls on the small numbered balls, and NO if they cannot be arranged. However, the order of the balls cannot be changed in the container. In addition, it is assumed that they can be put in the same cylinder in succession, and that there is enough room for all 10 balls in both cylinders B and C.



Input

Given multiple datasets. The number of datasets N is given in the first line. Then you are given a dataset of N rows. Each dataset is given 10 numbers, starting from the left, separated by blanks.

Output

Print YES or NO on one line for each dataset.

Example

Input

2
3 1 4 2 5 6 7 8 9 10
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1


Output

YES
NO
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each dataset consists of 10 integers separated by blanks.**
def func():
    n = input()
    data = []
    for i in range(n):
        tmp = map(int, raw_input().split())
        
        data.append(tmp)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is greater than 0, `data` is a list containing a total of n lists, each list containing integers mapped from input split by whitespace, `tmp` contains the last list of integers mapped from input split by whitespace
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `n` as input and then reads `n` lines, each containing 10 integers separated by whitespace. It stores these integers in a list of lists named `data`. The function does not accept any parameters and solely relies on user input to populate the `data` list. The purpose or specific functionality of the function beyond this input processing is not defined and would need to be clarified based on additional information or constraints.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
