Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of clones needed for the demonstration in all potential cases. 

For example, if we take the input:
10 1 14

The expected output is 1, as explained in the problem description. However, the program will output 2 instead, which is incorrect. 

Therefore, the program does not work as expected in all cases, making the correctness **False**.
