Correctness: **True**

The program takes the input values for n, x, and y, calculates the minimum number of clones needed to achieve the required percentage of people at the demonstration, and then prints the result. The calculation is done correctly based on the problem description, where it considers the percentage needed, the number of wizards, and the total number of citizens.

The program correctly handles cases where the number of clones needed is a whole number or needs to be rounded up. It follows the problem description accurately in all cases.
