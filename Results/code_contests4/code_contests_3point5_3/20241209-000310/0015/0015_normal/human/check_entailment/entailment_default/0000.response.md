Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program reads the input values of `n`, `x`, and `y` correctly.
- It calculates the minimum number of clones needed to reach the required percentage for the demonstration.
- The calculation for `y` is done according to the problem description, considering the percentage needed and the number of wizards.
- The program then prints the integer value of `y` or `y + 1` based on whether `y` is an integer multiple of 1.
- The code logic aligns with the problem description for all potential cases, ensuring the correct output.
