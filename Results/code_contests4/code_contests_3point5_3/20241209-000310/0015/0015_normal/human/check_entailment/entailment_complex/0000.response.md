Correctness: **True**

The program reads the input values for the number of citizens in the city, the number of wizards, and the required percentage for the demonstration. It then calculates the minimum number of clones needed to achieve the required percentage for the demonstration, taking into account that the city administration only considers the total number of citizens and not the clones.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description and provides the expected output for all possible cases. It calculates the minimum number of clones needed by considering the total number of citizens in the city and the required percentage for the demonstration.
