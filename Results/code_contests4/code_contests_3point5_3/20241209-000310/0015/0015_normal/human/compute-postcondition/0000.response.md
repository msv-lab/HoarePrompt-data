Example Answer:
`c` is assigned the value `raw_input()`. Since `raw_input()` is not a valid Python function in Python 3, assuming it was meant to be `input()` in Python 3, the program would wait for user input and assign it to `c`. The variables `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n, x, and y are integers such that 1 ≤ n, x, y ≤ 104 and x ≤ n; c is user input.
Output State: **n, x, and y are integers such that 1 ≤ n, x, y ≤ 104 and x ≤ n; c is user input**
