According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `p`. If there are more elements in `p`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `x`, `y`, `p`, and `num` are as described and `i` is the last element in the split input list. So for the loop to execute one more time, there must be more elements in `p`, and `i` will be the next element in the split input list.
State: **`n`, `x`, `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, x, y ≤ 104 and x ≤ n; `p` is the result of splitting the user input into at least one element, `num` is a list containing the integer value of `i`, for the loop to execute the next time `i` is the next element in the split input list**
