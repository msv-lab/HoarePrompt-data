Example Answer:
`int(i)` is appended to the list `num`. The previous state of `num` is a list containing integer values of `i`, and now `int(i)` is added to it. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `x`, `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, x, y ≤ 104 and x ≤ n; `p` has at least one more element to iterate through, `num` is a list containing the integer values of `i` and the newly appended integer value.
Output State: **`n`, `x`, `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, x, y ≤ 104 and x ≤ n; `p` has at least one more element to iterate through, `num` is a list containing the integer values of `i` and the newly appended integer value**
