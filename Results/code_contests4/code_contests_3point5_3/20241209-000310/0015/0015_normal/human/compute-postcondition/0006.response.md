Example Answer:
`int(i)` converts the input `i` into an integer and appends it to the list `num`. Since `num` initially contains the integer value of `i`, after execution, the new integer value of `i` will be added to the list. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `x`, `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, x, y ≤ 104 and x ≤ n; `p` is the result of splitting the user input into at least one element, `num` is a list containing the integer values of `i`.
Output State: **`n`, `x`, `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, x, y ≤ 104 and x ≤ n; `p` is the result of splitting the user input into at least one element, `num` is a list containing the integer values of `i`**
