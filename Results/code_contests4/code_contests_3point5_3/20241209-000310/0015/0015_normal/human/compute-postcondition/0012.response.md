Example Answer:
The code simply prints the integer value of `y`. Since `y` is an integer multiple of 1, the value of `y` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: n, x, y are integers such that 1 ≤ n, x, y ≤ 104 and x ≤ n; p has been fully iterated through, num is a list containing the integer values of all elements in p. Additionally, y is an integer multiple of 1.
Output State: **n, x, y are integers such that 1 ≤ n, x, y ≤ 104 and x ≤ n; p has been fully iterated through, num is a list containing the integer values of all elements in p. Additionally, y is an integer multiple of 1.**
