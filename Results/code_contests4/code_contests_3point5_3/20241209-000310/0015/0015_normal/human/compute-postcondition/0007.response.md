According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `p` and the next element in `p`. If there are more elements left in `p`, the loop can execute one more time. 

At the end of the last iteration, `p` has been split into at least one element, `num` contains the integer values of `i`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more element left in `p` after the current iteration.

State: **`n`, `x`, `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, x, y ≤ 104 and x ≤ n; `p` has at least one more element to iterate through, `num` is a list containing the integer values of `i`**
