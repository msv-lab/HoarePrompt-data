Example Answer: 
`int(i)` converts the value of `i` to an integer and appends it to the `num` list. Since `i` is the first element in the split input list, the value of `num` after execution will be a list containing the integer value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `x`, `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, x, y ≤ 104 and x ≤ n; `p` is the result of splitting the user input into at least one element, `num` is a list containing the integer value of `i`, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is the first element in the split input list.
Output State: **`n`, `x`, `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, x, y ≤ 104 and x ≤ n; `p` is the result of splitting the user input into at least one element, `num` is a list containing the integer value of `i`, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is the first element in the split input list**
