Example Answer:
`num` is initialized as an empty list. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: n, x, y are integers such that 1 ≤ n, x, y ≤ 104 and x ≤ n; p is the result of splitting the user input; `num` is an empty list.
Output State: **n, x, y are integers such that 1 ≤ n, x, y ≤ 104 and x ≤ n; p is the result of splitting the user input; `num` is an empty list**
