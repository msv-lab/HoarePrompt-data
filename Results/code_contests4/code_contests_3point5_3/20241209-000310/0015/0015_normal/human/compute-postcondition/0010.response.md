Example Answer:
`y` is assigned the value of `(num[0] * num[2]) / 100 - num[1]`, where `num` is a list containing integer values. The value of `y` is calculated based on the elements in `num`. The previous values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `x`, `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, x, y ≤ 104 and x ≤ n; `p` has been fully iterated through, `num` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `p`.
Output State: **`n`, `x`, `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, x, y ≤ 104 and x ≤ n; `p` has been fully iterated through, `num` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `p`**
