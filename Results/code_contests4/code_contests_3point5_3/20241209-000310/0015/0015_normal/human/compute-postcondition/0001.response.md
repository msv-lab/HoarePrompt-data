Example Answer:
`p` is assigned the result of splitting the user input `c`. Since `c` is a user input, the values of `p` will depend on what the user enters. Therefore, the Output State is: n, x, y are integers such that 1 ≤ n, x, y ≤ 104 and x ≤ n; p is the result of splitting the user input.
Output State: **n, x, y are integers such that 1 ≤ n, x, y ≤ 104 and x ≤ n; p is the result of splitting the user input**
