Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the function described in the problem statement. The logic in the `func_1` function does not properly compute the function f(a, b) as described in the problem. It seems to be attempting to calculate some kind of transformation on the array elements, but the implementation is incorrect.

Additionally, the input reading mechanism is overly complex and not necessary for solving the problem described. The usage of `FastIO` and `IOWrapper` classes along with the `func_2` function to read input is not needed and adds unnecessary complexity to the code.

Therefore, based on the incorrect implementation of the main function and unnecessary complexity in input reading, the correctness of the program is considered **False**.
