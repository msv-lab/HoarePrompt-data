Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. In the function `func_1`, the calculation of the function f(a_i, a_j) as described in the problem description is not correctly implemented. The logic for alternating digits of two numbers is incorrect in the code, leading to incorrect results. For example, the code does not handle the cases where p < q properly, which results in incorrect calculations. Therefore, the program does not work as expected according to the problem description.
