Based on the provided code and the problem description, as well as the output hints, the correctness of the program can be evaluated.

The code appears to correctly implement the function `func_1` to calculate the sum of the function `f(a_i, a_j)` for all pairs of elements in the input array `a`. The implementation seems to follow the specified rules for alternating the digits of two numbers and calculating the final sum modulo 998244353.

The output hints also provide an explanation of how the function `func_1` operates and how it processes the elements of the input list to calculate the final result. The hints reinforce the understanding that the code aligns with the problem description and correctly computes the required sum.

Hence, based on the code, description, and output hints, the correctness of the program can be determined as:

Correctness: **True**.
