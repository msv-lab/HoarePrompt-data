According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `x`. If `j` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` is the updated calculated value after the operation. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to decrease by 1 and `x` remains the same.
State: **`res` is the updated calculated value after the operation, for the loop to execute another time `j` is decreased by 1, `x` remains the same**
