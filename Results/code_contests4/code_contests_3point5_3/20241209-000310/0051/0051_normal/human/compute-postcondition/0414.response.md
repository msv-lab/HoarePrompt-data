Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is incremented by the product of `arr[i - 1]` and `res`. The value of `res` is the cumulative sum of products calculated in each iteration for all values of `j` from `x - 1` to 0. All other variables retain their initial values. 
Output State: **`ans` is updated, `res` is the cumulative sum of products calculated from `x - 1` to 0, all other variables retain their initial values**
