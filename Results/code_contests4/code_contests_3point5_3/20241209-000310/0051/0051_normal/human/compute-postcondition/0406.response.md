Output State: **`mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer, `l1` is a list of elements with at least 2 elements, `item` is the third element in `l1`, `arr` is a list with 10 elements, `ans` is the updated value after one more iteration of the loop, `i` is the next value in the range (2 if `i` was 1, 3 if `i` was 2), `x` is the length of the next element in `l1`, `res` is the updated value after one more iteration of the loop, `j` is from `x - 1` to 0 where `res` is updated by adding the product of `int(item[j])` and `pow(10, (x - j) * 2 - 1, mod)` modulo `mod`**
