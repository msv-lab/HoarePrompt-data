According to the code, the loop will execute for each value of `i` from 1 to 10. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are as follows:
State: **`mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer, `l1` is a list of elements with at least 2 elements, `item` is the second element in `l1`, `arr` is a list with 10 elements, `ans` is the final calculated value after all iterations of the loop, `i` is 1, `x` is the length of `item`, `res` contains the final computed value after all iterations of the loop, `j` is either -1 or -10 based on the condition**
