Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100,000, `a_i` is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for 1 <= i <= n, `conv` is assigned the function `ord` if Python version is 2, otherwise, it is assigned a lambda function, `A` is an empty list, `numb` is assigned an unknown value `zero`, `sign` is 1, `i` is 0. The character at index `i` in string `s` is greater than or equal to the character '0'***
