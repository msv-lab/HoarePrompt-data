According to the code, the loop can execute based on the variables `i` and `j`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be at least 1. The loop decreases `j` by 1 each iteration until `j` reaches -1. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be 0.
State: **`mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer, `l1` is a list of elements with at least 2 elements, `item` is the third element in `l1`, `arr` is a list with 10 elements, `ans` is the final calculated value after all iterations of the loop, `i` is 1, `x` is the length of the third element in `l1`, `res` is updated based on the formula provided, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute the next time `i` is at least 1, `res` is updated based on the formula provided**
