Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100,000, `a_i` is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for 1 <= i <= n, `conv` is assigned the function `ord` if Python version is 2, otherwise, it is assigned a lambda function, `A` contains the appended values of sign * numb based on the conditions met during each iteration of the loop, `numb` is the final value after all calculations, `sign` is the final value after all calculations, `i` is the index of the last character in string `s` after the loop finishes execution. Additionally, `s` is a non-empty string and the last character in `s` has an ASCII value greater than or equal to the ASCII value of character '0'[0]***
