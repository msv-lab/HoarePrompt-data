Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100,000, `a_i` is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for 1 <= i <= n, `conv` is assigned the function `ord` if Python version is 2, otherwise, it is assigned a lambda function, `A` contains the appended value of sign * numb. If s[i] == b'-'[0], then `numb` is assigned zero and `sign` is -1. If s[i] != b'\r'[0], no change in the program state occurs, `sign` remains 1.***
