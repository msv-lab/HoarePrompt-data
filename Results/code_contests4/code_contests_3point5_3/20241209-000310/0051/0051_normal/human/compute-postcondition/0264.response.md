Example Answer:
The value of `j` is decreased by 1, and `x` remains the same. The value of `item[j]` is used in the calculation. After the calculation, `res` is updated with the new calculated value based on the formula provided. The result is then taken modulo `mod`. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is the updated calculated value after the operation, `j` is decreased by 1, `x` remains the same.
Output State: **`res` is the updated calculated value after the operation, `j` is decreased by 1, `x` remains the same**
