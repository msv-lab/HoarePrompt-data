According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be greater than or equal to -1.
State: **`mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer, `l1` is a list of elements with at least 2 elements, `item` is the second element in `l1`, `arr` is a list with 10 elements, `ans` is the final calculated value after all iterations of the loop, `i` is 1, `x` is the length of `item` and greater than 1, `res` is updated based on the calculation, `j` is 0, `res` is the updated value after the calculation**
