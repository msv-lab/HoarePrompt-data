Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100,000, a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for 1 <= i <= n, conv is assigned the function ord if Python version is 2, otherwise, it is assigned a lambda function, A contains the appended value of sign * numb, numb is reset to zero, sign is 1, i is 0. The character at index i in string s is less than '0', indicating that the program did not enter the if block. The character at index i in string s is not equal to the ASCII value of '-'. The condition s[i] is not equal to b'\r'[0] is satisfied, sign is 1.**
