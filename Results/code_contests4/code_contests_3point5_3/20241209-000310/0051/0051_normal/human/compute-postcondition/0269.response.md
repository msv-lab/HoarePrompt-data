Example Answer:
`ans` is updated by adding the product of `arr[i-1]` and `res`. The values of `arr`, `i`, and `res` are not provided, so the final value of `ans` cannot be calculated. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is the final calculated value after all iterations of the loop, `j` is -2, `x` remains the same.
Output State: **`res` is the final calculated value after all iterations of the loop, `j` is -2, `x` remains the same**
