A possible exception that could occur in the program is an `IndexError` when trying to access an index that is out of bounds in the string `s`. The `try` block attempts to parse a string `s` containing integer values separated by certain characters. It iterates through the string, performing specific operations based on the characters encountered, such as updating the `numb` variable, changing the `sign` variable, or appending values to list `A`. After the loop finishes execution, the output state includes updated values for `A`, `numb`, `sign`, and `i`, reflecting the final calculations and operations performed during the loop. If an exception occurs, the `except` block does not affect any variables and simply continues the program without interruption.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100,000, `a_i` is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for 1 <= i <= n, `conv` is assigned the function `ord` if Python version is 2, otherwise, it is assigned a lambda function, `A` contains the appended values of sign * numb based on the conditions met during each iteration of the loop, `numb` is the final value after all calculations, `sign` is the final value after all calculations, `i` is the index of the last character in string `s` after the loop finishes execution.**
