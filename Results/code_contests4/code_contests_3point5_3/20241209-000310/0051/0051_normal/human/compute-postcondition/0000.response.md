Example Answer: 
The variable `conv` is assigned the function `ord` if the Python version is 2, otherwise, it is assigned a lambda function that returns the input value as it is. Since there are no other variables in the initial state, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100,000 and a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for 1 <= i <= n; conv is assigned the function `ord` if Python version is 2, otherwise, it is assigned a lambda function.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100,000 and a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for 1 <= i <= n; conv is assigned the function `ord` if Python version is 2, otherwise, it is assigned a lambda function**
