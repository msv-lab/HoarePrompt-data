Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100,000, `a_i` is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for 1 <= i <= n, `conv` is assigned the function `ord` if Python version is 2, otherwise, it is assigned a lambda function, `A` contains the appended value of sign * numb. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is greater than or equal to the ASCII value of '0', then `numb` is updated to 10 times the previous value plus the integer value of the character at index `i` in string `s`, `sign` remains 1, and `i` is incremented by 1. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is less than the ASCII value of '0', `A` contains the appended value of sign * numb, `numb` is reset to zero, `sign` is -1 if the character at index `i` in string `s` is equal to the ASCII value of '-', and 1 otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1.***
