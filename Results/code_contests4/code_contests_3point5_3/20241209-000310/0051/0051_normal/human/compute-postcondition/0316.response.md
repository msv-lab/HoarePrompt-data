According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `x`. If `j` is greater than or equal to -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is -2, `x` is the length of the third element in `l1`. So, for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` should be -1.
State: **`mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer, `l1` is a list of elements with at least 2 elements, `item` is the third element in `l1`, `arr` is a list with 10 elements, `ans` is the final calculated value after all iterations of the loop, `i` is 1, `x` is the length of the third element in `l1`, `res` is updated based on the formula provided in the code snippet, `j` is -1, the element at index `i - 1` in `arr` is 0**.
