According to the code, the loop can execute if `j` is within the range specified. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `j` is equal to the length of `item` - 2. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be within the specified range which is from `i - 1` to -1. Therefore, `j` needs to be adjusted to be -1 for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer, `l1` is a list of elements with at least 2 elements, `item` is the second element in `l1`, `arr` is a list with 10 elements, `ans` is the final calculated value after all iterations of the loop, `i` is 1, `x` is the length of `item`, `res` is the accumulated calculated value after all iterations of the loop, `j` is -1**
