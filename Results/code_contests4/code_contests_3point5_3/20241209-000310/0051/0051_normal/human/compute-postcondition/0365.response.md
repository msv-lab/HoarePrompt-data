Example Answer:
The value of `res` is updated by adding the product of the integer value of the `j`-th index of `item` and 10 raised to the power of `(x - j) * 2 - 1`, all modulo `mod`. The other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **mod is 998244353, n is an input integer, l1 is a list of elements with at least 2 elements, item is the third element in l1, arr is a list with 10 elements, ans is the final calculated value after all iterations of the loop, i is 1, x is the length of the third element in l1, res is the updated result with the new calculated value, j is -1, for the loop to execute again the length of the third element in l1 must be greater than 1**
