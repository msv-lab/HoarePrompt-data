The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `zero`, which is an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 100,000. Additionally, the function accepts a list of integers `a_i` such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for 1 <= i <= n. After executing the function body, the program returns the list `A` containing appended values based on conditions met during iterations. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n and a list of integers a_i. It then returns the list A containing appended values based on conditions met during iterations.**
