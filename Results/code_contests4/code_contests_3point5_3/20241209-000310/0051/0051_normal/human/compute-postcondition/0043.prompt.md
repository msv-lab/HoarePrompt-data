You have been assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for summarizing the state of the function after executing a Python `try` statement. You will be provided with the final state of the program after executing the `try` block, and the changes in the program after executing one or more `except` blocks in any situation. Please combine this information to summarize the program's state after the complete execution of the `try` statement. If there is a return always include it in the output sate. You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state**.
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.


Example 1:

Initial State: `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer.
Code for the try except block:
```
try:
    result = a / b
    return result
except ZeroDivisionError:
    return None
```
Ouput state after the execution of the try statement: `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `result` is the result of `a` divided by `b`, and the function returns `result`.
Output state after the execution of the except statement(s): The function returns None if a ZeroDivisionError occurs.

Now, please think step by step: At which point in the program could such an exception occur? Summarise what the try except statement accomplishes and what the program output state is after it is executed.


Example Answer 1:
A `ZeroDivisionError` might be triggered at `result = a / b`. If `b` is 0, the `ZeroDivisionError` is raised, and the function returns `None`. Otherwise, the function returns the value of `a` divided by `b`. Therefore, the output state is: `a` and `b` are integers. If `b` is zero, the function returns `None`, otherwise, the function returns the value of `a` divided by `b`.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers. If `b` is zero, the function returns `None`, otherwise the function returns the value of `a` divided by `b`.**

Example 2:

Program state after fully executing the `try` block:
Initial State: file_path is a string that's supposed to be a path to a file.

Code for the try except block:
```
def read_file(file_path):
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
            data = file.read()
            print("File content successfully read.")
            return data

    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("Error: The file was not found. Please check the file path.")
        return None

    except PermissionError:
        print("Error: You do not have permission to read this file.")
        return None
```
Output state after the execution of the try statement: `file_path` is a string that's supposed to be a path to a file, data is the contents of that file and the function returns that content.
Output state after the execution of the except statement(s):
Except statement 1:The function return None and prints "Error: The file was not found. Please check the file path." 
Except statement 2: The function return None and prints "Error: You do not have permission to read this file."

Now, please think step by step: At which point in the program could such an exception occur? Summarise what the try except statement accomplishes and what the program output state is after it is executed.


Example Answer 2 :
The program could raise a `FileNotFoundError` if the file is not found at the specified path or a `PermissionError` if the user does not have permission to read the file. If the file is found and the user has permission, the function reads the file content and returns it. 
Therefore: Output State: **file_path is a string that's supposed to be a path to a file. If the file is found and the user has permission, the function returns the file content, otherwise, it prints an error message and returns None.**


Your Task:

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100,000, `a_i` is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for 1 <= i <= n, `conv` is assigned the function `ord` if Python version is 2, otherwise, it is assigned a lambda function, `A` is an empty list, `numb` is assigned an unknown value `zero`, `sign` is 1, `i` is 0
Code for the try except block:
```
try:
    while True:
        if s[i] >= b'0'[0]:
            numb = 10 * numb + conv(s[i]) - 48
        elif s[i] == b'-'[0]:
            sign = -1
        elif s[i] != b'\r'[0]:
            A.append(sign * numb)
            numb = zero
            sign = 1
        i += 1
except:
    pass

```
Output state after the execution of the try statement: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100,000, `a_i` is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for 1 <= i <= n, `conv` is assigned the function `ord` if Python version is 2, otherwise, it is assigned a lambda function, `A` contains the appended values of sign * numb based on the conditions met during each iteration of the loop, `numb` is the final value after all calculations, `sign` is the final value after all calculations, `i` is the index of the last character in string `s` after the loop finishes execution.
Output state after the execution of the except statement(s): 
except_1: No variables are affected, the program simply passes over this line of code.

Now, please think step by step: At which point in the program could such an exception occur? Summarise what the try except statement accomplishes and what the program output state is after it is executed.
