According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `x`. If `j` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` is the updated calculated value after the operation, `j` is decreased by 1, `x` remains the same. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to be one less than its current value.
State: **`res` is the updated calculated value after the operation, `j` is decreased by 2, `x` remains the same for the loop to execute one more time**
