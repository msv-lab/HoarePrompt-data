According to the code, the loop can execute if `j` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `j` is 0, so for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be -1 to satisfy the range condition.
State: **`mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer, `l1` is a list of elements with at least 2 elements, `item` is the third element in `l1`, `arr` is a list with 10 elements, `ans` is the final calculated value after all iterations of the loop, `i` is 2, `x` is the length of `item`, `res` is updated based on the calculation in the code snippet, `j` is -1**
