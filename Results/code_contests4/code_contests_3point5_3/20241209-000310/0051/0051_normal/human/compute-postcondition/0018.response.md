Postcondition: ***n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100,000, a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for 1 <= i <= n, conv is assigned the function ord if Python version is 2, otherwise, it is assigned a lambda function, A contains the appended value of sign * numb, numb is reset to zero, sign is -1 if the character at index i in string s is equal to b'-'[0] and 1 otherwise, i is 0. The character at index i in string s is less than '0', indicating that the program did not enter the if block. If the character at index i in string s is equal to b'-'[0], then sign is set to -1 and the program remains in the same state. If the character at index i in string s is not equal to the ASCII value of '-', then sign is set to 1, numb is updated to zero, and the program remains in the same state.***
