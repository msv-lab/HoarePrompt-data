The value of `res` is updated by adding the product of the integer value at index `j` of `item` and the result of `pow(10, (x - j - 1) * 2, mod)`, then taking the modulo `mod`. The value of `x` is the length of the third element in `l1`, and `j` is `x - 1`. 

Output State: **mod is 998244353, n is an input integer, l1 is a list of elements with at least 2 elements, item is the third element in l1, arr is a list with 10 elements, ans is the final calculated value after all iterations of the loop, i is 1, x is the length of the third element in l1, res is the updated result, j is x-1, for the loop to execute again the length of the third element in l1 must be greater than 1**
