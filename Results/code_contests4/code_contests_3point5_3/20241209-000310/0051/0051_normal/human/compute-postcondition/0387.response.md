According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the range defined by `range(i - 1, -1, -1)` contains at least one value. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `i` must be at least 2.

State: **`mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer, `l1` is a list of elements with at least 2 elements, `item` is the third element in `l1`, `arr` is a list with 10 elements, `ans` is the final calculated value after all iterations of the loop, `i` is 2, `x` is the length of `item`, `res` is the final calculated result, `j` is equal to `x - i + 1`, for the loop to execute `i` is at least 2**
