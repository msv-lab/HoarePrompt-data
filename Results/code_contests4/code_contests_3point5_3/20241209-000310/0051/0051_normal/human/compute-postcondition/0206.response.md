Postcondition: ***`mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer, `l1` is a list of elements with at least 2 elements, `item` is the second element in `l1`, `arr` is a list with 10 elements, `ans` is the final calculated value after all iterations of the loop, `i` is 1, `x` is the length of `item`. If x <= i, `res` is the final updated value after all iterations of the loop, `j` is -1, `ans` is updated by adding the product of arr[i - 1] and `res`. If x > i, `res` is the accumulated calculated value after all iterations of the loop, `j` is equal to -1, `ans` is updated by adding the product of arr[i - 1] and `res`.***
