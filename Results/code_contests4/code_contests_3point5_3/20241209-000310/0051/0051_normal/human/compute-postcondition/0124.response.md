Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will continue to execute indefinitely. Therefore, all the states should remain the same for the next iteration.
State: **`ys` remains a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `xs` and its index, `zs` has been updated with the new value at index `i + 1`, `ts` has been updated based on the conditions inside the loop, `us` has been updated such that each element has been incremented by the cumulative sum of `ts[x - 1]` for all iterations of the loop, `i` is less than 0, `x` is updated with the last element of `zs` incremented by 1**
