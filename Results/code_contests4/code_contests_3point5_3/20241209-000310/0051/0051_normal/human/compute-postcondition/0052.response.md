Output State: **`ys` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `xs` and its index, `zs` is a list of zeros, `ts[x - 1]` is incremented by 1, `us[i]` is incremented by the cumulative sum of `ts[x - 1]` for all iterations of the loop, `x` is updated by a bitwise operation until it becomes less than or equal to 0, `x` is greater than the length of `ts`**
