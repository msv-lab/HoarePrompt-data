According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `i` is greater than or equal to 1. Since `j` is decremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be -1.
State: **`mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer, `l1` has at least 3 elements, `item` is the third element in `l1`, `arr` is a list with 10 elements, `ans` is the updated value after all iterations of the loop, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is equal to `i`, `res` contains the final calculated value after the operation, `j` is -1, `x` is the length of `item`**
