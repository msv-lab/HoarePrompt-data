According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`. If `i` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` is updated based on the formula provided. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be greater than 1, and in the for loop, `i` is decreased by 1 each iteration.
State: **`res` is updated based on the formula provided, for the loop to execute another time `i` must be greater than 1**
