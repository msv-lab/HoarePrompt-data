Example Answer:
`res` is updated by adding the product of `int(item[j + (x - i)])` and `pow(10, (i - j) * 2 - 1, mod)`, then taking the modulo `mod`. The loop iterates from `j = 2` to `0`. The other variables remain the same. 
Output State: **`mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer, `l1` is a list of elements with at least 2 elements, `item` is the second element in `l1`, `arr` is a list with 10 elements, `ans` is the final calculated value after all iterations of the loop, `i` is 3, `x` is the length of `item`, `res` is the sum of all values calculated in each iteration of the loop, `j` is 2 to 0 for the loop to execute, `res` is updated based on the formula given.**
