Postcondition: ***`mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer, `l1` is a list of elements with at least 2 elements, `item` is the second element in `l1`, `arr` is a list with 10 elements, `ans` is the final calculated value after all iterations of the loop, `i` is 2, `x` is the length of `item`, `res` contains the final calculated value after the loop, `j` is -1. If `x` is less than or equal to 2, `ans` is updated by adding the product of the element at index i-1 in `arr` and `res`. If `x` is greater than 2, `res` is updated based on the calculations in the loop, `res` is the final calculated value after all iterations of the loop, `ans` is updated by adding the product of `arr[i - 1]` and `res`.***
