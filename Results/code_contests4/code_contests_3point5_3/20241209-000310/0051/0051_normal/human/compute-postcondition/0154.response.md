Example Answer:
`ans` is updated by adding the product of `arr[i - 1]` and `res`. The loop iterates at least once with `i` greater than 0. The final calculated value is stored in `ans`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains the final calculated value, `i` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.
Output State: **`res` contains the final calculated value, `i` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once**
