Postcondition: ***`mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer, `l1` is a list of elements with at least 2 elements, `item` is the second element in `l1`, `arr` is a list with 10 elements, `ans` is the final calculated value after all iterations of the loop, `i` is 3, `x` is the length of `item` after the next iteration, `res` contains the final calculated value after the loop, `j` is -1. If `arr[i - 1]` is equal to 0, the program remains in the same state as before.***
