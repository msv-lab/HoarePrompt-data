According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x`. Before the loop starts, x is the length of the third element in l1, so it needs to be adjusted to `x` is greater than 1 and j is now equal to x - 1. 
State: **mod is 998244353, n is an input integer, l1 is a list of elements with at least 2 elements, item is the third element in l1, arr is a list with 10 elements, ans is the final calculated value after all iterations of the loop, i is 1, x is the length of the third element in l1, res is 0, j is x-1, for the loop to execute again the length of the third element in l1 must be greater than 1**
