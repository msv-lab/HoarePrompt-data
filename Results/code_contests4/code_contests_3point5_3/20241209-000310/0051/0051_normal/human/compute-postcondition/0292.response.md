According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is within the range `(i - 1, -1, -1)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be -1 (one less than the current value of `j`).

State: **`mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer, `l1` is a list of elements with at least 2 elements, `item` is the second element in `l1`, `arr` is a list with 10 elements, `ans` is the final calculated value after all iterations of the loop, `i` is 3, `x` is the length of `item`, `res` is the sum of all values calculated in each iteration of the loop, `j` is -1 to 0 for the loop to execute, `res` is updated based on the formula given**.
