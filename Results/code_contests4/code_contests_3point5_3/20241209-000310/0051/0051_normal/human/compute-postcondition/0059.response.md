Since the `while` loop condition is `while True`, the loop will certainly execute one more time. Therefore, all the states right before the loop need to be repeated as they are without any adjustments.
State: **`ys` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `xs` and its index, `zs` has been updated with the new value at index `i`, `ts` has been updated based on the conditions inside the loop, `us[i]` is incremented by the cumulative sum of `ts[x - 1]` for all iterations of the loop, `x` has been updated by a bitwise operation until it became less than or equal to 0, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is greater than or equal to 0**
