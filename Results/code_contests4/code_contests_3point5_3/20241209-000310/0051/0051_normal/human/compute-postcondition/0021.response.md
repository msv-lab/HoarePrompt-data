Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute. Therefore, all states remain the same for the next iteration.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100,000, `a_i` is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for 1 <= i <= n, `conv` is assigned the function `ord` if Python version is 2, otherwise, it is assigned a lambda function, `A` contains the appended value of sign * numb**
