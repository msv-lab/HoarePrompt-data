Example Answer:
The value of `x` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `x` is unknown, so the output state is: `mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer, `l1` has at least 3 elements, `item` is the third element in `l1`, `arr` is a list with 10 elements, `ans` is the updated value after one more iteration of the loop, `i` is the next value in the range, `x` is the new decremented value, `res` is the new calculated value, `j` is 0.
Output State: **`mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer, `l1` has at least 3 elements, `item` is the third element in `l1`, `arr` is a list with 10 elements, `ans` is the updated value after one more iteration of the loop, `i` is the next value in the range, `x` is the new decremented value, `res` is the new calculated value, `j` is 0**
