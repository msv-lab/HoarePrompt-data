Example Answer:
The value of `x` is assigned as `zs[i] + 1`. Since `i` is less than 0, accessing `zs[i]` would refer to the last element of `zs`. Therefore, `x` is updated with the value of the last element in `zs` incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged based on the given initial state.
Output State: **`ys` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `xs` and its index, `zs` has been updated with the new value at index `i + 1`, `ts` has been updated based on the conditions inside the loop, `us[i + 1]` has been incremented by the cumulative sum of `ts[x - 1]` for all iterations of the loop, `x` is within the length of `ts`, `i` is less than 0, `x` is updated with the last element of `zs` incremented by 1**
