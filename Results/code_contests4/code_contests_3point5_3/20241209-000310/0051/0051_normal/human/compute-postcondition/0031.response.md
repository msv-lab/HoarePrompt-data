Since the `while` loop condition is `True`, the loop will execute indefinitely until a break condition is encountered within the loop body. Therefore, the loop will always execute one more time without any adjustments to the program state.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100,000, `a_i` is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for 1 <= i <= n, `conv` is assigned the function `ord` if Python version is 2, otherwise, it is assigned a lambda function, `A` contains the appended value of sign * numb, `i` is incremented by 1**
