Output State: **mod is 998244353, n is an input integer, l1 is a list of elements with at least 2 elements, item is the third element in l1, arr is a list with 10 elements, ans is the final calculated value after all iterations of the loop, i is 1, x is the length of the third element in l1, res is the final updated value after all iterations, j is -1, and for the loop to execute again the length of the third element in l1 must be greater than 1. If arr[i - 1] == 0, the program continues with the given state.**
