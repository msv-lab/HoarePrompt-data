Example Answer:
The value of `res` is updated by calculating `(int(item[j + (x - i)]) * pow(10, (i - j - 1) * 2, mod)) % mod` and adding it to the current value of `res`. The value of `j` is -1, `x` is the length of `item`, `i` is 1, and `mod` is 998244353. The output state after this operation is not provided as the final state is not mentioned in the initial state.
Output State: **Res has been updated based on the calculation**
