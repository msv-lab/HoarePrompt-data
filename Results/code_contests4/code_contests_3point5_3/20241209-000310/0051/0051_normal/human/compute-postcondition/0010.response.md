Postcondition: ***n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100,000, a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for 1 <= i <= n, conv is assigned the function ord if Python version is 2, otherwise, it is assigned a lambda function, A is an empty list, numb is assigned an unknown value zero, sign is 1, i is 0. The character at index i in string s is less than '0', indicating that the program did not enter the if block. Additionally, the character at index i in string s is equal to b'-'[0]***
