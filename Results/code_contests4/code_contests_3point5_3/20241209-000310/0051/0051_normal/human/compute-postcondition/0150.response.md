According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`. If `i` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` is updated based on the formula provided, and `i` is greater than 1. Since the loop is iterating in reverse from `i-1` to 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than 2.
State: **`res` is updated based on the formula provided, for the loop to execute another time `i` must be greater than 2**
