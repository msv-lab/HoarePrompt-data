According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variables `j` and `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `x` is the length of `item` which is greater than 1. Since the loop is iterating in reverse, `j` needs to be decremented by 1 to continue the loop. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be -1.
State: **`mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer, `l1` is a list of elements with at least 2 elements, `item` is the second element in `l1`, `arr` is a list with 10 elements, `ans` is the final calculated value after all iterations of the loop, `i` is 1, `x` is the length of `item` and greater than 1, `res` is updated value after the calculation, `j` is -1**
