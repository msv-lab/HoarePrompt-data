According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `j` is greater than or equal to -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` is decreased by 1 and `x` is still at least 2. So, for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer, `l1` is a list of elements with at least 2 elements, `item` is the second element in `l1`, `arr` is a list with 10 elements, `ans` is the final calculated value after all iterations of the loop, `i` is 2, `res` is updated with the new calculated value, `j` is x-2, for the loop to execute the second time `x` is at least 2**
