Example Answer:
`numb` is assigned the value `10 * numb + conv(s[i]) - 48`, where `s[i]` is a character in string `s`, `conv` is a function that converts characters to integers, and `numb` is a number. The value of `numb` will be updated based on the calculation. Other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a_i` is an integer, `conv` is assigned a function, `A` contains appended values, `i` is incremented by 1, `numb` is updated based on the calculation**
