According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the range for `j` is valid. In this case, the loop can execute if `i` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted so that `i` is greater than or equal to 1 and `j` starts at `i-1`. 
State: **`mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer, `l1` has at least 3 elements, `item` is the third element in `l1`, `arr` is a list with 10 elements, `ans` is the updated value after all iterations of the loop, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is equal to `i`, `res` contains the final calculated value, `j` starts at `i-1`, `x` is the length of `item`**
