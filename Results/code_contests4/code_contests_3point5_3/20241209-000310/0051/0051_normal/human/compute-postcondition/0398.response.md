Postcondition: ***mod is 998244353, n is an input integer, l1 is a list of elements with at least 2 elements, item is the third element in l1, arr is a list with 10 elements, ans is the final calculated value after all iterations of the loop, i is either 1 or 2, x is the length of the third element in l1, res is the total calculated value from all iterations of the loop, j is -1. If x <= i, ans is updated by adding the product of the (i-1)th element of arr and res. If x > i, ans is updated by adding arr[1] multiplied by res.***
