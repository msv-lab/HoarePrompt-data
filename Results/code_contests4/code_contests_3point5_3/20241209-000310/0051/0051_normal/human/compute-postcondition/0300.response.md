Postcondition: ***`mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer, `l1` is a list of elements with at least 2 elements, `item` is the second element in `l1`, `arr` is a list with 10 elements, `ans` is the final calculated value after all iterations of the loop, `i` is 3, `x` is the length of `item`, `res` is the final calculated value after all iterations of the loop, `j` is -2. If x <= i, `res` remains the final calculated value after all iterations of the loop. Otherwise, `res` is updated based on the formula: `ans = ans + arr[i - 1] * res`***
