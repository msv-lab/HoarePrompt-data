Output State: After the loop executes, `vvs`, `dx`, `dy` have the same length. `pnum` is updated, `pu` is updated, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `u` is recalculated, `num` is updated, `x` and `y` are integers, `ux` is the quotient of `pu` divided by `w`, `uy` is the remainder of `pu` divided by `w`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `pu` is equal to `goal`. For the loop to execute, `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` must have elements to iterate over. `x` is assigned the sum of `ux` and `xx`, and `y` is assigned the sum of `uy` and `yy`.
**Output State: `x` and `y` are updated based on the calculations described above.**
