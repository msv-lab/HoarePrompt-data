Example Answer:
`rows` is assigned the value of `h` and `cols` is assigned the value of `w`. The values of `h` and `w` are unknown, so the output state is: `dh` is decremented by 2, `dw` is unknown, `ch` is decremented by 1, `cw` is decreased by 1, `rows` is assigned the value of `h`, `cols` is assigned the value of `w`.
Output State: **`dh` is decremented by 2, `dw` is unknown, `ch` is decremented by 1, `cw` is decreased by 1, `rows` is assigned the value of `h`, `cols` is assigned the value of `w`**
