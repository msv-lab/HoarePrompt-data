Example Answer:
`num` is assigned the value `pnum + vv`. The values of `pnum` and `vv` are not provided in the initial state, so the exact value of `num` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` and `y` are updated based on the values of `ux`, `xx`, `uy`, and `yy`.
Output State: **`x` and `y` are updated based on the values of `ux`, `xx`, `uy`, and `yy`**
