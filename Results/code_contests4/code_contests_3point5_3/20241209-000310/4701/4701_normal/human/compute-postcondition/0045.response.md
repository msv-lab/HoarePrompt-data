According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and the values in `vvs`. If `j` is less than 3, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is -2, `j` is -2, `vvs` contains either 1 or 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` should be less than 2. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the updated states should be:
State: **`vvs` is a list containing either 1 or 0, `i` is -2, `j` is -1 for the loop to execute a second time.**
