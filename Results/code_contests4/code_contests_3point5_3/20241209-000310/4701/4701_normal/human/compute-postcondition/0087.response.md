According to the code, the loop will execute as long as j ranges from -2 to 2 inclusive. The states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `vvs` must contain either 1 or 0 based on the conditions.
- `i` remains 0.
- `j` ranges from -2 to 2 inclusive.
- `dx` remains [-2, -1, -1, -1].
- `dy` remains [2, -2, 3, 3, 1].

State: **`vvs` is a list containing either 1 or 0 based on the conditions, `i` is 0, `j` ranges from -2 to 2 inclusive, `dx` is [-2, -1, -1, -1], `dy` is [2, -2, 3, 3, 1] for the loop to execute**
