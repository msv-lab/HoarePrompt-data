Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if else block, `x` and `y` are updated based on the values of `ux`, `xx`, `uy`, and `yy`. If any of the conditions `x < 0`, `y < 0`, `x >= h`, `y >= w`, or `ss[x][y] == '#'` are true, then `x` and `y` are not updated. If `seen[u]` is None or `seen[u]` is greater than `num`, then `seen[u]` is updated to the value of `num`.***
