Example Answer:
`u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y`. The values of `x` and `y` are given as integers. Therefore, the Output State is: `vvs` has the same length as `dx` and `dy`, `pnum` is equal to `pu`, `i` and `j` are both 2, `u` is the result of the calculation `x * w + y`, `num` is equal to `pnum + vv`, `x` and `y` are both integers.
Output State: **`vvs` has the same length as `dx` and `dy`, `pnum` is equal to `pu`, `i` and `j` are both 2, `u` is the result of the calculation `x * w + y`, `num` is equal to `pnum + vv`, `x` and `y` are both integers**
