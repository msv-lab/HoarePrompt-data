Example Answer:
The value of `u` is calculated as the product of `x` and `w` added to `y`. Since the initial state mentions that `x` and `y` are integers, `w` is not defined directly, and `u` is updated based on the calculation. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` and `y` are updated based on the calculations described above.
Output State: **`x` and `y` are updated based on the calculations described above.**
