Output State: **After the loop executes, `vvs`, `dx`, `dy` have the same length. `pnum` is updated, `pu` is updated, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `u` is recalculated, `num` is updated, `x` and `y` are integers, `ux` is the quotient of `pu` divided by `w`, `uy` is the remainder of `pu` divided by `w` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
