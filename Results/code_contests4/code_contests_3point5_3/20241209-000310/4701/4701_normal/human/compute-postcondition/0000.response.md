Example Answer:
The lambda function `input` is defined to read a line from `sys.stdin` and remove any trailing whitespaces. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `input` is a lambda function that reads a line and removes trailing whitespaces.
Output State: **`input` is a lambda function that reads a line and removes trailing whitespaces**
