According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` which ranges from -2 to 2 inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is -1 and `j` is 2. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to the next value in the range, which is 3.
State: **`vvs` is a list containing either 1 or 0 based on the conditions, `i` is -1, `j` is 3, `dx` is [-2, -1], `dy` is [2, -2]**.
