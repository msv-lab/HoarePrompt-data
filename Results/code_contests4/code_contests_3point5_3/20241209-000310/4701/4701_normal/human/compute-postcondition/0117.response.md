Output State: **`vvs` is a list containing either 1 or 0 based on the conditions, `i` and `j` are both 2, `dx` is [-2, -1, -1, -1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2], `dy` is [2, -2, 3, 3, 1, next_j, j, 1, 3, 0, 2, -2, 3, 3, 1, next_j, j, 1, 3, 0] or [2, -2, 3, 3, 1, next_j, j, 1, 3, 0, 2, -2, 3, 3, 1, next_j, j, 1, 3, 0] depending on the condition, `pnum` and `pu` are returned by the function `hpp(q)`. Additionally, `pu` is equal to `goal`.**
