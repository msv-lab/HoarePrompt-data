Example Answer: 
`q` and `(num, u)` are passed as arguments to the function `hp()`. `num` is the sum of `pnum` and `vv`, and `u` is `x * w + y`. The value of `seen[u]` is updated to `num`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `u` is assigned the value `x * w + y`, `num` is assigned the value `pnum + vv`, `x`, `y` are integers, `h`, `w` are integers, `ss` is a 2D list of characters, `seen[u]` is now `num`.
Output State: **`u` is assigned the value `x * w + y`, `num` is assigned the value `pnum + vv`, `x`, `y` are integers, `h`, `w` are integers, `ss` is a 2D list of characters, `seen[u]` is now `num`**
