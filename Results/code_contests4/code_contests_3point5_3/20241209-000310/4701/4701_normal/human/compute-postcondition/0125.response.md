Postcondition: ***`vvs` has the same length as `dx` and `dy`, `pnum` is equal to `pu`, `i` and `j` are both 2, `u` is the result of the calculation `x * w + y`, `num` is equal to `pnum + vv`, `x` and `y` are both integers. If either `x` is less than 0, or `y` is less than 0, or `x` is greater than or equal to `h`, or `y` is greater than or equal to `w`, or `ss[x][y]` is equal to '#', then the program variables remain unchanged.***
