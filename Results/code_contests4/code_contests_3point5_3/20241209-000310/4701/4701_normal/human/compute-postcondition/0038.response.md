Example Answer:
The value of `j` is appended to the `dy` list. As `j` is -2, after execution, the `dy` list will contain [-2]. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `vvs` is an empty list, `i` is -2, `j` is -2 for the loop to execute the first time, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is not equal to 0, `dx` contains -2, `dy` contains -2.
Output State: **`vvs` is an empty list, `i` is -2, `j` is -2 for the loop to execute the first time, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is not equal to 0, `dx` contains -2, `dy` contains -2**
