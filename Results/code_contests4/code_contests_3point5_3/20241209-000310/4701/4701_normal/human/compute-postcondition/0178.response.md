Example Answer:
The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State remains the same.
Output State: **`x` and `y` are updated based on the values of `ux`, `xx`, `uy`, and `yy`**
