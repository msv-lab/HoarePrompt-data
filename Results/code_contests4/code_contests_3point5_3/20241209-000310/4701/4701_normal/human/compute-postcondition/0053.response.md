Example Answer:
`i` is appended to the list `dx`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `vvs` is a list containing either 1 or 0. If abs(i) + abs(j) > 1, the value 1 is appended to `vvs`. Otherwise, `vvs` remains unchanged with the same values of 1 and 0 for the next iteration.
Output State: **`vvs` is a list containing either 1 or 0. If abs(i) + abs(j) > 1, the value 1 is appended to `vvs`. Otherwise, `vvs` remains unchanged with the same values of 1 and 0 for the next iteration**
