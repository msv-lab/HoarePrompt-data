Example Answer:
`num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`, where `pnum` is equal to `pu`, and `vv` is a variable with the same length as `vvs`, `dx`, and `dy`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `vvs` has the same length as `dx` and `dy`, `pnum` is equal to `pu`, `i` and `j` are both 2, `u` is the result of the calculation `x * w + y`, `num` is equal to `pnum + vv`.
Output State: **`vvs` has the same length as `dx` and `dy`, `pnum` is equal to `pu`, `i` and `j` are both 2, `u` is the result of the calculation `x * w + y`, `num` is equal to `pnum + vv`**
