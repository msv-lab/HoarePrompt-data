Example Answer:
The value of `ch` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `ch` is unknown, so the output state is: `dh` and `dw` are assigned the integer values obtained by splitting the input, `ch` is decremented by 1.
Output State: **`dh` and `dw` are assigned the integer values obtained by splitting the input, `ch` is decremented by 1**
