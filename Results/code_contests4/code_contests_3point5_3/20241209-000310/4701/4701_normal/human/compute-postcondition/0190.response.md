Example Answer:
The variables `x` and `y` are updated based on the values of `ux`, `uy`, `xx`, and `yy`. The new values of `x` and `y` are calculated by adding `xx` to `ux` and `yy` to `uy`. Therefore, the Output State is: `pnum` and `pu` are updated based on the function `hpp(q)`, `pu` is not equal to `goal`, for the loop to execute the first time `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` have at least 1 element, `x` and `y` are updated based on the values of `ux`, `uy`, `xx`, and `yy`.
Output State: **`pnum` and `pu` are updated based on the function `hpp(q)`, `pu` is not equal to `goal`, for the loop to execute the first time `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` have at least 1 element, `x` and `y` are updated based on the values of `ux`, `uy`, `xx`, and `yy`**
