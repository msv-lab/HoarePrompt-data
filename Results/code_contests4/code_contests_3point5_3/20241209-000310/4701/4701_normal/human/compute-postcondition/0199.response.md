Postcondition: ***`u` is assigned the value `x * w + y`, `num` is assigned the value `pnum + vv`, `x`, `y` are integers, `h`, `w` are integers, `ss` is a 2D list of characters. If `x` is less than 0 or `y` is less than 0 or `x` is greater than or equal to `h` or `y` is greater than or equal to `w` or `ss[x][y]` is equal to '#', then the program fragment is executed. After the execution of the if-else block, `seen[u]` has been updated to `num` or remains unchanged based on its previous value.***
