Example Answer:
`vvs` appends the value 0 to the list. The previous values of `vvs` are unknown, but after this operation, `vvs` will contain the appended value 0. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `vvs` is a list containing either 1 or 0 with the appended value 0.
Output State: **`vvs` is a list containing either 1 or 0 with the appended value 0**
