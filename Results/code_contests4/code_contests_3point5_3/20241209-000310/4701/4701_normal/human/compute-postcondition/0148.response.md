Output State: **After the loop executes, `vvs`, `dx`, `dy` have the same length. `pnum` is equal to `pu`, `i` and `j` are both 2, `u` is the result of `x * w + y`, `num` is equal to `pnum + vv`, `x` and `y` are integers. If x < 0 or y < 0 or x >= h or y >= w or ss[x][y] == '#', then the program state remains the same. `seen[u]` is assigned the value `num` if `seen[u]` was None or greater than `num`.**
