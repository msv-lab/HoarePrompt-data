Example Answer:
`u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y`. The previous values of `x`, `w`, and `y` are unknown, so the exact value of `u` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: New values of `x` and `y` are calculated based on the given expressions.
Output State: **New values of `x` and `y` are calculated based on the given expressions**
