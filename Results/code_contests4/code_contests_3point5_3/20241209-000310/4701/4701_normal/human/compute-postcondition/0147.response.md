Postcondition: ***`vvs`, `dx`, `dy` have the same length, `pnum` is equal to `pu`, `i` and `j` are both 2, `u` is the result of `x * w + y`, `num` is equal to `pnum + vv`, `x` and `y` are integers, `x` and `y` are updated to `ux + xx` and `uy + yy`, `u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y`, `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`. The conditions are met for x < 0 or y < 0 or x >= h or y >= w or ss[x][y] == '#'. If `seen[u]` is None or `seen[u]` is greater than `num`, then `num` is added to the dictionary `seen` with key `u`.***
