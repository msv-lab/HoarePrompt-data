Example Answer:
The value 0 is appended to the list `vvs`, so after execution, `vvs` will contain [1, 0]. The values of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `vvs` is a list containing 1 and 0, `i` is -2, `j` is -1 for the loop to execute a second time, `dx` contains [-2], `dy` contains [-1].
Output State: **`vvs` is a list containing 1 and 0, `i` is -2, `j` is -1 for the loop to execute a second time, `dx` contains [-2], `dy` contains [-1]**
