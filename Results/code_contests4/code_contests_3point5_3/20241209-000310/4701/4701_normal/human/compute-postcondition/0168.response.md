Example Answer:
`num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`, where `pnum` and `vv` are used to calculate the new value of `num`. The previous values of `pnum` and `vv` are unknown, so the output state is: new value of `num` is calculated based on the given expressions.
Output State: **new value of `num` is calculated based on the given expressions**
