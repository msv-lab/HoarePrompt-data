Example Answer:
The function `hp` is called with parameters `q` and a tuple `(num, u)`. This means `num` and `u` are passed to the function `hp`. The value of `seen[u]` is updated to `num`, which means the value of `seen[u]` is now equal to the value of `num`. Therefore, the Output State is: `seen[u]` is updated to the value of `num`.
Output State: **`seen[u]` is updated to the value of `num`**
