Example Answer:
`pnum` and `pu` are assigned values returned by the function `hpp(q)`. The values of `q`, `pnum`, and `pu` are unknown, so the output state is: `vvs` is a list containing either 1 or 0 based on the conditions, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `dx` is [-2, -1, -1, -1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2], `dy` is [2, -2, 3, 3, 1, next_j, j, 1, 3, 0, 2, -2, 3, 3, 1, next_j, j, 1, 3, 0] or [2, -2, 3, 3, 1, next_j, j, 1, 3, 0, 2, -2, 3, 3, 1, next_j, j, 1, 3, 0] depending on the condition, `pnum` and `pu` are returned by the function `hpp(q)`.
Output State: **`vvs` is a list containing either 1 or 0 based on the conditions, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `dx` is [-2, -1, -1, -1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2], `dy` is [2, -2, 3, 3, 1, next_j, j, 1, 3, 0, 2, -2, 3, 3, 1, next_j, j, 1, 3, 0] or [2, -2, 3, 3, 1, next_j, j, 1, 3, 0, 2, -2, 3, 3, 1, next_j, j, 1, 3, 0] depending on the condition, `pnum` and `pu` are returned by the function `hpp(q)`**
