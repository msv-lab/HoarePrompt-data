The code appends the value of `j` to the list `dy`. Since the current value of `j` is 3, after the execution of the code, the list `dy` will have the value 3 appended to it. 

Output State: **`vvs` is a list containing either 1 or 0 based on the conditions, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `dx` is [-2, -1, -1, -1, 0, 0, 0], `dy` is [2, -2, 3, 3, 1, next_j, j, 1, 3]**
