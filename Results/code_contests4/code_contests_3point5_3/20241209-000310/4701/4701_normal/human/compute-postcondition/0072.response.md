Example Answer:
The value of the list `dx` is modified by appending `i` to it. The list `dx` originally contained [-2, -1], and `i` is -1. After appending -1 to the list `dx`, the new value of `dx` will be [-2, -1, -1]. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `vvs` is a list containing either 1 or 0 based on the conditions, `i` is -1, `j` is 3, `dx` is [-2, -1, -1], `dy` is [2, -2].
Output State: **`vvs` is a list containing either 1 or 0 based on the conditions, `i` is -1, `j` is 3, `dx` is [-2, -1, -1], `dy` is [2, -2]**
