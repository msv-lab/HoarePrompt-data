Example Answer:
The recursion limit is set to the maximum value between 1000 and 10^9. As the recursion limit is set globally for the Python interpreter, it affects the entire program. Therefore, the Output State is: `input` is a lambda function that reads a line and removes trailing whitespaces, recursion limit is set to the maximum value between 1000 and 10^9.
Output State: **`input` is a lambda function that reads a line and removes trailing whitespaces, recursion limit is set to the maximum value between 1000 and 10^9**
