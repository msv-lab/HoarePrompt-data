Example Answer:
`num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`. The other variables `u`, `x`, `w`, and `y` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `u` is assigned the value `x * w + y`, `num` is assigned the value `pnum + vv`.
Output State: **`u` is assigned the value `x * w + y`, `num` is assigned the value `pnum + vv`**
