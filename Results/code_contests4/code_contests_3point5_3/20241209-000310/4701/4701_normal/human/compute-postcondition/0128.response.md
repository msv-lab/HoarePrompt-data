Output State: **`vvs` has the same length as `dx` and `dy`, `pnum` is equal to `pu`, `i` and `j` are both 2, `u` is the result of the calculation `x * w + y`, `num` is equal to `pnum + vv`, `x` and `y` are both integers. If conditions for `x`, `y`, `h`, `w`, `ss[x][y]`, and `seen[u]` are met, then `seen[u]` is assigned the value `num`.**
