Postcondition: ***`vvs` is a list containing either 1 or 0. If abs(i) + abs(j) > 1, the value 1 is appended to `vvs`, otherwise 0 is appended to `vvs`. Additionally, `dy` contains the values of `j` appended to it. If i and j are both 0, `vvs` remains unchanged with the same values of 1 and 0 for the next iteration.***
