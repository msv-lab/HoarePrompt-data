According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If abs(i) + abs(j) is greater than 1, a value of 1 is appended to the list `vvs`. If abs(i) + abs(j) is not greater than 1, `vvs` remains unchanged. At the end of the last iteration, `vvs` contains 0 and 1 values based on the condition abs(i) + abs(j) > 1. 

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`vvs` is a list containing either 1 or 0. If abs(i) + abs(j) > 1, the value 1 is appended to `vvs`. Otherwise, `vvs` remains unchanged with the same values of 1 and 0 for the next iteration.**
