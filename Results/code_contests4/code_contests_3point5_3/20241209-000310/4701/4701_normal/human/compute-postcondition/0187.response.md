Example Answer: 
The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `pnum` and `pu` are updated based on the function `hpp(q)` and other variables within the function, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
