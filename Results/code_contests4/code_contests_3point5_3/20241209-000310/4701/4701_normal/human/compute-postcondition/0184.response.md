According to the code, the loop will execute based on the non-empty condition of the queue `q`. At the end of the previous iteration, the values of variables `x`, `y`, `h`, `w`, `ss[x][y]`, `num`, `seen`, and `q` have been updated. In order for the loop to execute one more time, the queue `q` must still be non-empty. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **After the loop executes, the values of variables `x`, `y`, `h`, `w`, `ss[x][y]`, `num`, `seen`, and `q` have been updated and for the loop to execute again `q` is still non-empty**
