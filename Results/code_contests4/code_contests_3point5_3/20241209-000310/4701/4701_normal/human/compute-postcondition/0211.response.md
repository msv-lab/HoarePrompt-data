Example Answer:
`u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y`, where values of `x`, `y`, and `w` are specific. The new value of `u` is calculated based on these specific values. The values of `num`, `h`, `w`, `ss` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `u`, `num`, `x`, `y`, `h`, `w`, `ss` are all assigned specific values, `u` is updated based on `x * w + y`.
Output State: **`u`, `num`, `x`, `y`, `h`, `w`, `ss` are all assigned specific values, `u` is updated based on `x * w + y`**
