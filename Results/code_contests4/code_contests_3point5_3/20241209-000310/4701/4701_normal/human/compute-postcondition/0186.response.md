Example Answer:
The values of `pu` and `w` are used to calculate the quotient and remainder when `pu` is divided by `w`. The variables `ux` and `uy` are assigned these values accordingly. Since the initial state of `pu` and `w` is unknown, the specific values of `ux` and `uy` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: Variables `pnum` and `pu` are updated based on the function `hpp(q)` and other variables within the function.
Output State: **Variables `pnum` and `pu` are updated based on the function `hpp(q)` and other variables within the function.**
