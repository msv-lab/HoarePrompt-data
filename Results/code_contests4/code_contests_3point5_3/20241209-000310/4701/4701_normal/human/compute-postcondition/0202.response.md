Output State: **`u` is assigned the value `x * w + y`, `num` is assigned the value `pnum + vv`, `x`, `y` are integers, `h`, `w` are integers, `ss` is a 2D list of characters. If the loop is to execute another time, the conditions for `x`, `y`, `h`, `w`, and `ss` must be met. `seen[u]` has been updated to `num` or remains unchanged based on its previous value.**
