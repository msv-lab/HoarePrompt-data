According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range of values that `j` takes on, which is from -2 to 2 inclusive. Before the loop starts, the initial values of `i`, `j`, `dx`, and `dy` need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. In this case, `i` should be set to -1, `j` should be set to -2, `dx` should be set to -2, and `dy` should be set to 2.
State: **`vvs` is a list containing either 1 or 0 based on the conditions, `i` is -1, `j` is -2, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 2, for the loop to execute `j` ranges from -2 to 2 inclusive**
