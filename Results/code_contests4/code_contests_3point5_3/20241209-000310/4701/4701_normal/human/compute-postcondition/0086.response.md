According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `i` is less than 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is -1, `j` ranges from -2 to 2 inclusive. At the start of the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than 2.
State: **`vvs` is a list containing either 1 or 0 based on the conditions, `i` is 0, `j` ranges from -2 to 2 inclusive, `dx` is [-2, -1, -1, -1], `dy` is [2, -2, 3, 3, 1].**
