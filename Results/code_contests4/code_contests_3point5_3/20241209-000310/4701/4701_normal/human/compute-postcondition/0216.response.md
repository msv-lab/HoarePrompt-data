Example Answer:
If the conditions x < 0 or y < 0 or x >= h or y >= w or ss[x][y] == '#' are met, then u is updated to x * w + y and num is assigned the value of pnum + vv. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of the variables. The function hp(q, (num, u)) is called with the updated values of num and u.
Output State: **Updated values of u and num based on conditions, other variables remain the same.**
