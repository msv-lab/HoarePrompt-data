Example Answer:
The function `hp` is called with arguments `q` and a tuple `(num, u)`. The element `num` is added to the dictionary `seen` with the key `u`. The values of the variables `q`, `num`, `u`, and `seen` are not specified in the initial state, so after execution, the output state is: Element `num` is added to the dictionary `seen` with key `u`.
Output State: **Element `num` is added to the dictionary `seen` with key `u**.
