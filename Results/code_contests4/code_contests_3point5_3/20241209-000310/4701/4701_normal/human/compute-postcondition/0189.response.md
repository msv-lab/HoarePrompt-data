According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs`. If all of these lists have at least 1 element, the loop can execute. `pnum` and `pu` are updated based on the function `hpp(q)`, so they need to be adjusted accordingly. If `pu` is equal to `goal`, the loop will break out. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` must have at least 1 element, `pnum` and `pu` must be updated based on the function `hpp(q)`, and `pu` must not be equal to `goal`.
State: **`pnum` and `pu` are updated based on the function `hpp(q)`, `pu` is not equal to `goal`, for the loop to execute the first time `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` have at least 1 element**
