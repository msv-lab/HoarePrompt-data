Example Answer:
The value of `u` is calculated as the product of `x` and `w` added to `y`. The values of `x`, `y`, `w` are not given in the initial state, so the final value of `u` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` and `y` are updated based on the values of `ux`, `xx`, `uy`, and `yy`.
Output State: **`x` and `y` are updated based on the values of `ux`, `xx`, `uy`, and `yy`**
