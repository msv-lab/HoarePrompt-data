Example Answer:
`dx` is a list that will have `i` appended to it. The current value of `dx` is unknown, but `i` is -2. Therefore, after execution, `dx` will contain [-2]. The values of other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`vvs` is a list containing either 1 or 0, `i` is -2, `j` is -1 for the loop to execute a second time, `dx` contains [-2]**
