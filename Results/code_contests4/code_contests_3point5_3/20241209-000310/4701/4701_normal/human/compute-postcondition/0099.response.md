The code appends the value of `j` to the list `dy`. The current value of `j` ranges from -2 to 3 inclusive, so after the append operation, the list `dy` will contain the appended values of `j` and the previous values of `dy`. Therefore, the Output State is: `vvs` is a list containing either 1 or 0 based on the conditions, `i` is 0, `j` ranges from -2 to 3 inclusive, `dx` is [-2, -1, -1, -1, 0, 0], `dy` is [2, -2, 3, 3, 1, next_j, j].
Output State: **`vvs` is a list containing either 1 or 0 based on the conditions, `i` is 0, `j` ranges from -2 to 3 inclusive, `dx` is [-2, -1, -1, -1, 0, 0], `dy` is [2, -2, 3, 3, 1, next_j, j]**
