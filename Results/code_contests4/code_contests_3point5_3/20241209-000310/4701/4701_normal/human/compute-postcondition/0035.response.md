According to the code, the loop will execute as long as j is within the range -2 to 2. Since the initial value of j is -2, the loop will execute the first time. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: `vvs` is an empty list, `i` is -2, and `j` is -2.
State: **`vvs` is an empty list, `i` is -2, `j` is -2 for the loop to execute the first time**
