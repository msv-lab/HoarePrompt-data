Postcondition: ***`vvs` is a list with either 1 or 0 based on certain conditions and an additional 0 at the end, `i` is -1, `j` is 3, `dx` is [-2, -1, -1, -1], `dy` is [2, -2, 3, 3, 1] if abs(i) + abs(j) > 1. Otherwise, `vvs` remains the same with `i` as -1, `j` as 3, `dx` as [-2, -1, -1, -1], `dy` as [2, -2, 3, 3].***
