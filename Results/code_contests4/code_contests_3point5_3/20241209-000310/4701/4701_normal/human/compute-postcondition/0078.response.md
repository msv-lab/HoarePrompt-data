According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `i`, and the condition abs(i) + abs(j) > 1. If this condition is met, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, `vvs` is a list containing either 1 or 0 based on the conditions and possibly an additional 0 at the end, `i` is -1, `j` is 3, `dx` is [-2, -1, -1], `dy` is [2, -2, 3]. Since abs(i) + abs(j) is not greater than 1, an extra 0 must be added at the end of `vvs` for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`vvs` is a list containing either 1 or 0 based on the conditions and an additional 0 at the end, `i` is -1, `j` is 3, `dx` is [-2, -1, -1], `dy` is [2, -2, 3]**.
