Example Answer:
`cw` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `cw` is unknown, so after execution, `cw` will be decreased by 1. The values of `dh` and `dw` are not affected. `ch` was decremented by 1 in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `dh` and `dw` are assigned the integer values obtained by splitting the input, `ch` is decremented by 1, `cw` is decreased by 1.
Output State: **`dh` and `dw` are assigned the integer values obtained by splitting the input, `ch` is decremented by 1, `cw` is decreased by 1**
