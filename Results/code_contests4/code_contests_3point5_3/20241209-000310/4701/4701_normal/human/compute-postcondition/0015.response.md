According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `rows` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `rows` is assigned the value of `h`, so as long as `h` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop will execute. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute, `rows` should be greater than 0 and `i` should be set to 0 before the loop starts.
State: **`dh` is decremented by 2, `dw` is unknown, `ch` is decremented by 1, `cw` is decreased by 1, `rows` is assigned the value of `h`, `cols` is assigned the value of `w`, `OK` is '.', `NG` is '#', `ns` is a defaultdict of sets, `ss` is a list of `None` elements with a length of `rows`, `rows` is greater than 0, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
