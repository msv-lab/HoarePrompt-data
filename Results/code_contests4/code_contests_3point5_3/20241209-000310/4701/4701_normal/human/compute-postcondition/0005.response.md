Example Answer:
dh and dw are assigned the integer values obtained by splitting the input. The values of dh and dw are dependent on the input provided, so their specific values cannot be determined without knowing the input. Therefore, the output state is: dh and dw are assigned the integer values obtained by splitting the input.
Output State: **dh and dw are assigned the integer values obtained by splitting the input**
