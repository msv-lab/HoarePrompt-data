Example Answer:
`vvs` list is updated by adding 0 at the end. The list originally contained either 1 or 0 based on conditions, and now it has an additional 0 at the end. The values of `i`, `j`, `dx`, and `dy` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `vvs` is a list containing either 1 or 0 based on conditions with an additional 0 at the end, `i` is -1, `j` is 3, `dx` is [-2, -1, -1], `dy` is [2, -2, 3].
Output State: **`vvs` is a list containing either 1 or 0 based on conditions with an additional 0 at the end, `i` is -1, `j` is 3, `dx` is [-2, -1, -1], `dy` is [2, -2, 3]**
