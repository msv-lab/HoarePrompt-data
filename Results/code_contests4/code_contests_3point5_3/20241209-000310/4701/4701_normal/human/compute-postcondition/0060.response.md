According to the code, the loop will iterate over the range from -2 to 2 inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is -2. To execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1 and the loop should execute for `i` equal to -1. Additionally, since the values in `vvs` are determined by the absolute values of `i` and `j`, with 1 being appended if the sum is greater than 1 and 0 otherwise, the values in `vvs` need to be updated accordingly based on the new values of `i` and `j`. The values of `j`, `dx`, and `dy` remain the same.
State: **`vvs` is a list containing either 1 or 0 based on the conditions, `i` is -1, `j` is 2, `dx` contains -2, `dy` contains 2**
