Example Answer: 
The keyword `continue` is used to skip the current iteration in a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop provided in the code snippet, the program will simply continue to the next line. As there are no variables affected or changed, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.
Output State: **new value of `num` is calculated based on the given expressions**
