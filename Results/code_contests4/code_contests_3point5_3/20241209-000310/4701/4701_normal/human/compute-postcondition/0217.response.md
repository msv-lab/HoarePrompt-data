Postcondition: ***`u`, `num`, `x`, `y`, `h`, `w`, `ss`, `pnum`, `vv` are all assigned specific values. If x < 0 or y < 0 or x >= h or y >= w or ss[x][y] == '#', then u is updated based on x * w + y and num is assigned the value of pnum + vv. If seen[u] is None or seen[u] > num, then the values of u and num are updated as per the conditions mentioned. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of the variables except for u and num based on the if part conditions.***
