According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`, as well as the conditions for appending values to the `vvs` list. If the absolute value of `i` plus the absolute value of `j` is greater than 1, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, `vvs` is a list containing either 1 or 0 based on the conditions, `i` is 0, `j` ranges from -2 to 2 inclusive, `dx` is [-2, -1, -1, -1, 0], `dy` is [2, -2, 3, 3, 1, j]. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, the values of `i` and `j` should be adjusted based on the conditions. Specifically, the next value of `j` should be considered where the absolute value of `i` plus the absolute value of the next `j` is greater than 1, and `j` is not 0.

State: **`vvs` is a list containing either 1 or 0 based on the conditions, `i` is 0, `j` ranges from -2 to 3 inclusive, `dx` is [-2, -1, -1, -1, 0], `dy` is [2, -2, 3, 3, 1, next_j] for the loop to execute a second time. The values of `i` and `next_j` satisfy the condition of absolute value of `i` plus the absolute value of `next_j` being greater than 1, and `next_j` is not 0.**
