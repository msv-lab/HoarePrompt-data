Postcondition: ***`vvs` is a list containing either 1 or 0, `i` is -2, `j` is -2 for the loop to execute the first time, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is not equal to 0, `dx` contains -2, `dy` contains -2. If the absolute value of `i` plus the absolute value of `j` is greater than 1, `vvs` contains 1. If the absolute value of `i` plus the absolute value of `j` is less than or equal to 1, `vvs` contains 0.***
