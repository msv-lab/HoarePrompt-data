Postcondition: ***`vvs` is a list containing either 1 or 0 based on the conditions, `i` is 0, `j` ranges from -2 to 3 inclusive, `dx` is [-2, -1, -1, -1, 0, 0], `dy` is [2, -2, 3, 3, 1, next_j, j]. If abs(i) + abs(j) > 1, the `dy` list contains an additional element 1. Otherwise, `vvs` appends 0.***
