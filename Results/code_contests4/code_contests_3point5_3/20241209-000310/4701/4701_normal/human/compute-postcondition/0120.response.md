Example Answer:
The values of `x` and `y` are updated by adding `ux` to `xx` and `uy` to `yy` respectively. The values of `ux`, `xx`, `uy`, and `yy` are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot calculate the exact values of `x` and `y`. Therefore, the Output State is: `vvs` has the same length as `dx` and `dy`, `pnum` is equal to `pu`, `i` and `j` are both 2, and `x, y` have been updated based on the provided formula.
Output State: **`vvs` has the same length as `dx` and `dy`, `pnum` is equal to `pu`, `i` and `j` are both 2, `x, y` have been updated based on the provided formula**
