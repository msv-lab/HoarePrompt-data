According to the code, the loop will execute for each value of `i` ranging from -2 to 2 inclusive. Since `i` is the variable controlling the loop, it needs to be adjusted accordingly. Before the loop starts, `vvs` is an empty list. To ensure the loop executes, `i` should be set to -2, which is the starting value of the range.
State: **`vvs` is an empty list, `i` is -2 for the loop to execute the first time**
