Example Answer: 
`num` is assigned the value of `pnum` + `vv`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `u`, `num`, `x`, `y`, `h`, `w`, `ss` are all assigned specific values, `u` is updated based on `x * w + y`; `num` is assigned the value of `pnum` + `vv`.
Output State: **`u`, `num`, `x`, `y`, `h`, `w`, `ss` are all assigned specific values, `u` is updated based on `x * w + y`; `num` is assigned the value of `pnum` + `vv`**
