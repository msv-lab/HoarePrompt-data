Output State: **`vvs` is a list containing either 1 or 0 based on the conditions, `i` is -1, `j` ranges from -2 to 2 inclusive, `dx` is [-2, -1, -1, -1], `dy` is [2, -2, 3, 3, 1]. If not both `i` and `j` are zero, the absolute value of `i` plus the absolute value of `j` is checked. If it is greater than 1, an additional 1 is added to the `vvs` list. If it is less than or equal to 1, an additional 0 is added to the `vvs` list.**
