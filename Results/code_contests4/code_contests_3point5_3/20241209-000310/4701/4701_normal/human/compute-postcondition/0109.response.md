Postcondition: ***`vvs` is a list containing either 1 or 0 based on the conditions. If abs(i) + abs(j) > 1, an additional 1 is added at the end of the list. Otherwise, the list remains the same. `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `dx` is [-2, -1, -1, -1, 0, 0, 0], `dy` is [2, -2, 3, 3, 1, next_j, j, 1, 3] or [2, -2, 3, 3, 1, next_j, j, 1, 3, 0] depending on the condition.***
