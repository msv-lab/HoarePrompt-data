Example Answer:
`ux` is assigned the quotient of `pu` divided by `w`, and `uy` is assigned the remainder of `pu` divided by `w`. Given that the initial state mentions `pu` and `w` have been updated, the values of `ux` and `uy` will be calculated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: After the loop executes, `vvs`, `dx`, `dy` have the same length. `pnum` is updated, `pu` is updated, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `u` is recalculated, `num` is updated, `x` and `y` are integers, `ux` is the quotient of `pu` divided by `w`, `uy` is the remainder of `pu` divided by `w`.
Output State: **After the loop executes, `vvs`, `dx`, `dy` have the same length. `pnum` is updated, `pu` is updated, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `u` is recalculated, `num` is updated, `x` and `y` are integers, `ux` is the quotient of `pu` divided by `w`, `uy` is the remainder of `pu` divided by `w`**
