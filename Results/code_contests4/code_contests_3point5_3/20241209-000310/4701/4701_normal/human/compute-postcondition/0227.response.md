Functionality: **The function `func` reads input about a grid and two points, performs a pathfinding algorithm on the grid to find the shortest path from one point to another, and then prints the length of the shortest path. It does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. If the algorithm fails to find a path (value is None), it prints -1.**
