Example Answer:
The new values of `x` and `y` are calculated by adding `ux + xx` to `x` and `uy + yy` to `y`. The previous values of `x`, `y`, `ux`, `uy`, `xx`, and `yy` are known. Therefore, after execution, the new values of `x` and `y` are determined based on the given expressions.
Output State: **New values of `x` and `y` are calculated based on the given expressions.**
