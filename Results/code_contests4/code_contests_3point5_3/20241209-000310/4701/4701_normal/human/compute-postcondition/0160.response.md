Postcondition: ***`x`, `y` are integers. If `x` is less than 0 or `y` is less than 0 or `x` is greater than or equal to `h` or `y` is greater than or equal to `w` or `ss[x][y]` is equal to '#', then the program state remains unchanged. No modifications are made to the variables `x`, `y`, or `num`.***
