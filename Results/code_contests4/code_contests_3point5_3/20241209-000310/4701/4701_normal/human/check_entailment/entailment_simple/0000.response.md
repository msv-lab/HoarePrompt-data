Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. It reads the input, initializes the necessary variables, performs the required operations to find the minimum number of times the magician needs to use magic to reach the destination, and then prints the result. The program uses a breadth-first search approach to explore the maze and find the minimum path.

The program handles the constraints mentioned in the problem description, such as checking for out-of-bounds indices, walls in the maze, and unreachable destinations. It accounts for both types of moves the magician can make and calculates the minimum number of magic uses required accurately. The output is also as expected, either printing the minimum number of magic uses or -1 if the destination is unreachable.

Therefore, the program is correct and follows the problem description accurately.
