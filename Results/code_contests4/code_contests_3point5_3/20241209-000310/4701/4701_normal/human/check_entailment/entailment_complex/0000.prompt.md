You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: A maze is composed of a grid of H \times W squares - H vertical, W horizontal.

The square at the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left - (i,j) - is a wall if S_{ij} is `#` and a road if S_{ij} is `.`.

There is a magician in (C_h,C_w). He can do the following two kinds of moves:

* Move A: Walk to a road square that is vertically or horizontally adjacent to the square he is currently in.
* Move B: Use magic to warp himself to a road square in the 5\times 5 area centered at the square he is currently in.



In either case, he cannot go out of the maze.

At least how many times does he need to use the magic to reach (D_h, D_w)?

Constraints

* 1 \leq H,W \leq 10^3
* 1 \leq C_h,D_h \leq H
* 1 \leq C_w,D_w \leq W
* S_{ij} is `#` or `.`.
* S_{C_h C_w} and S_{D_h D_w} are `.`.
* (C_h,C_w) \neq (D_h,D_w)

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


H W
C_h C_w
D_h D_w
S_{11}\ldots S_{1W}
\vdots
S_{H1}\ldots S_{HW}


Output

Print the minimum number of times the magician needs to use the magic. If he cannot reach (D_h,D_w), print `-1` instead.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func():
    input = lambda : sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()
    sys.setrecursionlimit(max(1000, 10 ** 9))
    write = lambda x: sys.stdout.write(x + '\n')
    h, w = map(int, input().split())
    ch, cw = map(int, input().split())
    dh, dw = map(int, input().split())
    ch -= 1
    cw -= 1
    dh -= 1
    dw -= 1
    rows, cols = h, w
    OK = '.'
    NG = '#'
    ns = defaultdict(set)
    ss = [None] * rows
    for i in range(rows):
        s = input()
        
        ss[i] = s
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `dh` is decremented by 2, `dw` is unknown, `ch` is decremented by 1, `cw` is decreased by 1, `rows` is assigned the value of `h`, `cols` is assigned the value of `w`, `OK` is '.', `NG` is '#', `ns` is a defaultdict of sets, `ss` is a list where `ss[i]` is assigned the value of `s`, `rows` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `rows - 1`, `s` is the input string
    n = rows * cols
    start = ch * w + cw
    goal = dh * w + dw
    seen = [None] * n
    seen[start] = 0
    q = [(0, start)]
    dx = []
    dy = []
    vvs = []
    for i in range(-2, 3):
        for j in range(-2, 3):
            if not i == j == 0:
                dx.append(i)
                dy.append(j)
                if abs(i) + abs(j) > 1:
                    vvs.append(1)
                else:
                    vvs.append(0)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `vvs` is a list containing either 1 or 0 based on the conditions, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `dx` is [-2, -1, -1, -1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2], `dy` is [2, -2, 3, 3, 1, next_j, j, 1, 3, 0, 2, -2, 3, 3, 1, next_j, j, 1, 3, 0] or [2, -2, 3, 3, 1, next_j, j, 1, 3, 0, 2, -2, 3, 3, 1, next_j, j, 1, 3, 0] depending on the condition
    while q:
        pnum, pu = hpp(q)
        
        ux, uy = divmod(pu, w)
        
        if pu == goal:
            break
        
        for xx, yy, vv in zip(dx, dy, vvs):
            x, y = ux + xx, uy + yy
            u = x * w + y
            num = pnum + vv
            if x < 0 or y < 0 or x >= h or y >= w or ss[x][y] == '#':
                continue
            if seen[u] is None or seen[u] > num:
                seen[u] = num
                hp(q, (num, u))
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: After the loop executes, the variables `u`, `num`, `x`, `y`, `h`, `w`, `ss`, `pnum`, `vv`, `dx`, `dy`, `vvs`, `seen`, and `q` will have specific values based on the conditions within the loop. The loop will update `seen[u]` with the minimum value of `num` encountered during the loop iterations. If `pu` is equal to `goal`, the loop will break. Additionally, the loop control variable `q` will be False, indicating the end of the loop.
    val = seen[goal]
    if (val is None) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        print(val)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`val` is assigned the value of `seen[goal]`. If `val` is None, then `val` is assigned the value of `seen[goal]` and -1 is printed. Otherwise, `val` retains the value of `seen[goal]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads input about a grid and two points, performs a pathfinding algorithm on the grid to find the shortest path from one point to another, and then prints the length of the shortest path. It does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. If the algorithm fails to find a path (value is None), it prints -1.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
