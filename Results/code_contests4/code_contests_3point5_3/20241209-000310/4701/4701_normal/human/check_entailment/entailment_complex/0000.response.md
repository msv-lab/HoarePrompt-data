Correctness: **True**

The annotated program is correct because it follows the problem description accurately. The program reads the input grid, starting and ending points, performs a pathfinding algorithm to find the shortest path using a breadth-first search, and then prints the length of the shortest path. It considers the constraints given in the problem description and handles the cases where the magician cannot reach the destination point by printing -1. The program uses the correct logic to determine the minimum number of times the magician needs to use magic to reach the destination point.
