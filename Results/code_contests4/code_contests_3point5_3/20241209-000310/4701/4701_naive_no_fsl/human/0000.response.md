Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of times the magician needs to use magic to reach the destination (D_h, D_w) from the starting position (C_h, C_w) in the given maze. 

The program uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore possible paths and efficiently find the minimum number of magic uses required. It considers both types of moves the magician can make: Move A (walking to adjacent road squares) and Move B (warping to a road square within a 5x5 area).

The program correctly handles the constraints provided in the problem description, such as the maze grid size, the positions of the magician and destination, and the wall/road configurations.

The output of the program provides the minimum number of magic uses required to reach the destination, or -1 if the destination is unreachable. The logic for determining whether the destination is reachable is also correctly implemented.

Overall, based on the provided problem description and examples, the program appears to be correct and meets the requirements specified.
