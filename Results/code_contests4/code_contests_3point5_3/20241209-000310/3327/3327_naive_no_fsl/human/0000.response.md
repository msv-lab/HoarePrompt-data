Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given Python program correctly calculates the minimum number of edges needed to make the graph harmonious. It correctly reads the input, constructs the graph, and then iterates through the nodes to find the connected components. The program then checks if the components are harmonious and updates the answer accordingly. The logic implemented in the code follows the problem description accurately, and there are no potential cases identified where the program would not work as expected. Therefore, the program is correct.
