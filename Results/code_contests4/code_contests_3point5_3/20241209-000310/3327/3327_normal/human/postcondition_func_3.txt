The function `func_4` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of tuples representing the edges in a graph. Each tuple contains two integers u and v. The function then prints the elements of each tuple in the list `arr` separated by a space. The parameter constraints dictate that `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000. The function does not explicitly return a value, but it outputs the elements of the tuples in `arr` formatted as a string.
