The function `func_5` reads input from stdin to obtain integers `n` and `m`, where `n` and `m` are integers satisfying the constraints 3 <= n <= 200,000 and 1 <= m <= 200,000. Each pair of integers u_i and v_i (1 ≤ u_i, v_i ≤ n, u_i ≠ v_i) represents an edge between nodes u and v in the graph. The function then returns a map object containing integers.
