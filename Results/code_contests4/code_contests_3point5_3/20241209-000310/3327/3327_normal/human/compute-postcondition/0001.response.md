The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters. The program reads input from stdin to get integers n and m, where n and m are integers satisfying the constraints 3 <= n <= 200,000 and 1 <= m <= 200,000. Each pair of integers u_i and v_i (1 ≤ u_i, v_i ≤ n, u_i ≠ v_i) represents an edge between nodes u and v in the graph. The program then returns a map object containing integers. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_5 is to read input from stdin to get integers n and m, create edges between nodes u and v based on the input pairs, and return a map object containing integers.
