Correctness: **False**

The provided annotated program does not implement the logic required to determine the minimum number of edges needed to make the graph harmonious. The functions defined in the program simply handle input and output operations and do not perform any computations related to the harmonious graph property. As a result, the program does not follow the problem description and is incorrect.
