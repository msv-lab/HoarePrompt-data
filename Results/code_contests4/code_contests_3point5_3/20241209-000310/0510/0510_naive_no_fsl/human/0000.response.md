Correctness: False

The given program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where throwing a katana results in more damage than wielding the maximum damage katana. In such a scenario, the program should consider throwing the katana instead of wielding it to minimize the number of attacks required to defeat the monster. 

For example, consider the input:
```
2 10
6 8
4 9
```
The correct output should be 2, as throwing the second katana with damage 9 is more efficient than wielding the first katana with damage 6 multiple times. However, the program will output 3 in this case. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, making the correctness **False**.
