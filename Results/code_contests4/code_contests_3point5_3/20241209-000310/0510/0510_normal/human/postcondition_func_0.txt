The function `func` reads input integers N and H, then reads N pairs of integers and stores them in lists A and B. It finds the maximum value in list A and sorts list B in descending order. It iterates over list B, calculating the number of times a certain condition is met, and prints the final count. The function does not have a specific return value.
