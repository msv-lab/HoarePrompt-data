Postcondition: ***B is a list with -1 appended; h is either 0 or -1; c is either 0, 1, or 2; bi is either 0 or 1; H is greater than 0; b is assigned the value at index bi in list B. If b < am, c is updated based on the calculation and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If b is not less than am, h is updated based on the value at index bi in list B and bi is increased by 1.***
