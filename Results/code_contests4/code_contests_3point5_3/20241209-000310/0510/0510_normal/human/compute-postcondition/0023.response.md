According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `h` and `H`. If `h` is less than `H`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `h` is 0, `H` is not provided. Since `H` is not given, we cannot be certain if the loop will execute. So, for the loop to execute the first time, `H` needs to be greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **Output State: B is a list with -1 appended; h is 0, c is 0, bi is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `H` is greater than 0**
