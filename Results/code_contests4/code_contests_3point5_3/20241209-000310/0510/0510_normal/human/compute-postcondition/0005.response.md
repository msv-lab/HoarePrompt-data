Example Answer:
A is appended with the value of a. Since A was initially an empty list, it now contains a. The other variables remain unaffected. 
Output State: **N is greater than 0, H is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ H ≤ 10^9, A contains the value of a, B is an empty list, i is 0, a and b are assigned values obtained from mapping integers from the input split**
