Example Answer:
`c` is incremented by the integer value of the ceiling of `(H - h) * 1.0 / am`. The previous values of `c`, `H`, `h`, and `am` are known. Therefore, the Output State is: B is a list with -1 appended; h is either 0 or -1; c is either 0 or 1; bi is either 0 or 1; H is greater than 0; b is assigned the value at index bi in list B; c is updated based on the calculation.
Output State: **B is a list with -1 appended; h is either 0 or -1; c is either 0 or 1; bi is either 0 or 1; H is greater than 0; b is assigned the value at index bi in list B; c is updated based on the calculation.**
