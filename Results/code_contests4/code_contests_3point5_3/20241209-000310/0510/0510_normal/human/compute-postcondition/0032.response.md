Postcondition: ***B is a list with -1 appended; h is either 0 or -1; c is either 0 or 1; bi is either 0 or 1; for the loop to execute the first time H is greater than 0; b is -1. If b < am, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If b is greater than or equal to am, h is set to -1, c is set to 1, and bi is set to 1.***
