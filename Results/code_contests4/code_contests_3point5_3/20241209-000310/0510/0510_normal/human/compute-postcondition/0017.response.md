Example Answer:
The list B is sorted in ascending order. The values of B are rearranged accordingly. The states of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: N is greater than 0, H is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ H ≤ 10^9, A contains the values of `a` from all iterations appended, B contains the sorted values of `b` from all iterations, `i` is N-1, `a` and `b` are assigned the last integer values obtained from mapping `int` to the input split by whitespace, `am` is the maximum value in list A.
