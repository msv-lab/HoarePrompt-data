Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the value of `B[bi]`, where `B` is a list with -1 appended, and `bi` is 0. Therefore, `b` is assigned -1 since `B[0]` is -1. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **B is a list with -1 appended; h is 0, c is 0, bi is 0, for the loop to execute the first time H is greater than 0; b is -1**
