Example Answer: 
`bi` is incremented by 1. If `bi` was 0, it becomes 1. The value of `bi` can now be either 0 or 1. The other variables remain the same, so the output state is: B is a list with -1 appended; h is either 0 or -1; c is either 0, 1, or 2; bi is either 0 or 1; H is greater than 0; b is the value at index bi in list B; h is less than H; b is the value at index bi in list B; h is increased by the value at index bi in list B; c is increased by 1.
Output State: **B is a list with -1 appended; h is either 0 or -1; c is either 0, 1, or 2; bi is either 0 or 1; H is greater than 0; b is the value at index bi in list B; h is less than H; b is the value at index bi in list B; h is increased by the value at index bi in list B; c is increased by 1**
