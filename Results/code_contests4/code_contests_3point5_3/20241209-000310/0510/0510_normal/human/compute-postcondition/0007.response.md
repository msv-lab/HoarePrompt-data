According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `N` is greater than 0, `H` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ H ≤ 10^9, A contains the value of `a`, B contains the appended value of `b`, `i` is 0. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. So for the next iteration, `i` should be 1.

State: **N is greater than 0, H is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ H ≤ 10^9, A contains the value of `a`, B contains the appended value of `b`, `i` is 1**.
