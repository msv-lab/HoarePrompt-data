Output State: N is greater than 0, H is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ H ≤ 10^9, A contains the values of `a` from all iterations appended, B contains the values of `b` from all iterations appended, `i` is N-1, `a` and `b` are assigned the last integer values obtained from mapping `int` to the input split by whitespace. After executing the code snippet, the maximum value in list A is stored in variable `am`.
