According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `h` and `H`. If `h` is less than `H`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `B` is a list with -1 appended, `h` is either 0 or -1, `c` is either 0 or 1, `bi` is either 0 or 1, H is greater than 0, and b is -1. For the loop to execute one more time, `h` needs to be increased so that it is less than `H`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **B is a list with -1 appended; h is either 0 or -1; c is either 0 or 1; bi is either 0 or 1; H is greater than 0; b is -1, for the loop to execute one more time, h needs to be less than H**
