The value of `b` is appended to list `B`. The previous values of variables are not impacted, so the Output State is: N is greater than 0, H is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ H ≤ 10^9, A contains the value of `a`, B contains the appended value of `b`, `i` is 0, a and b are assigned values obtained from mapping integers from the input split.
Output State: **N is greater than 0, H is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ H ≤ 10^9, A contains the value of `a`, B contains the appended value of `b`, `i` is 0, a and b are assigned values obtained from mapping integers from the input split.**
