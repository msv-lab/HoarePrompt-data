Postcondition: ***B is a list with -1 appended; h is either 0 or -1; c is either 0, 1, or 2; bi is either 0 or 1; H is greater than 0; b is the value at index bi in list B; h is less than H. If b < am, c is incremented by the ceiling value of ((H - h) * 1.0 / am) and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If b is not less than am, h is increased by the value at index bi in list B; c is increased by 1.***
