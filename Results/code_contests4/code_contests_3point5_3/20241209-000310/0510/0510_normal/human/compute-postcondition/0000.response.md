Example Answer: 
N and H are assigned values using the map function that splits the input and converts them to integers. The values of N and H are constrained by the given preconditions. Therefore, the Output State is: N and H are integers satisfying 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ H ≤ 10^9.
Output State: **N and H are integers satisfying 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ H ≤ 10^9**
