#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function reads input values for transportation costs, the number of times Vasya uses buses and trolleys, and calculates the total cost for Vasya's transportation. It considers the minimum cost between using buses and trolleys without monthly passes, then adds the cost of monthly passes if it reduces the overall cost. Finally, it prints the total cost for Vasya's transportation. However, there is a potential edge case where the lists of buses and trolleys might be empty, which is not handled in the code.
