According to the code, the loop execution depends on the trol list. If the trol list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. 

To adjust the state before the loop starts for the loop to execute, the following adjustments need to be made:
State: **`c1, c2, c3, c4` are integers such that 1 ≤ c1, c2, c3, c4 ≤ 1000, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000, `ai` and `bi` are lists of integers representing the number of times Vasya is going to use the buses and trolleys respectively, `bus` is a list of buses, `trol` is a list of trolleys with at least 1 element, `busc1` is an empty list, `bussum` is the sum of the minimum value between each element of `bus` multiplied by `c1` and `c2`, `trolsum` is 0**
