Example Answer:
`c1, c2, c3, c4` are assigned the values `[int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]`, which means the user will input 4 integers separated by spaces. The values of `c1, c2, c3, c4` will be updated accordingly. Other variables are not affected.
Output State: **`c1, c2, c3, c4` are integers such that 1 ≤ c1, c2, c3, c4 ≤ 1000. n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000. ai and bi are lists of integers representing the number of times Vasya is going to use the buses and trolleys respectively.**
