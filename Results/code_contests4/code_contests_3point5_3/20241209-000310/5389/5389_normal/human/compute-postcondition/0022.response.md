Example Answer:
The value of `res` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and `c4`. Since `c4` is between 1 and 1000, the final value of `res` could be either the current value of `res` or `c4`. Therefore, the Output State is: `c1, c2, c3, c4` are integers such that 1 ≤ c1, c2, c3, c4 ≤ 1000, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000, `ai` and `bi` are lists of integers representing the number of times Vasya is going to use the buses and trolleys respectively, `bus` is a list of buses, `trol` is a list of trolleys with at least 1 element, `busc1` is an empty list, `bussum` is the sum of the minimum value between each element of `bus` multiplied by `c1` and `c2`, `trolsum` is the sum of the minimum value between each element of `trol` multiplied by `c1` and `c2`, `res` is the minimum of `bussum` and `c3` added to the minimum of `trolsum` and `c3` and `res` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and `c4`.
Output State: **`c1, c2, c3, c4` are integers such that 1 ≤ c1, c2, c3, c4 ≤ 1000, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000, `ai` and `bi` are lists of integers representing the number of times Vasya is going to use the buses and trolleys respectively, `bus` is a list of buses, `trol` is a list of trolleys with at least 1 element, `busc1` is an empty list, `bussum` is the sum of the minimum value between each element of `bus` multiplied by `c1` and `c2`, `trolsum` is the sum of the minimum value between each element of `trol` multiplied by `c1` and `c2`, `res` is the minimum of `bussum` and `c3` added to the minimum of `trolsum` and `c3` and `res` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and `c4`**
