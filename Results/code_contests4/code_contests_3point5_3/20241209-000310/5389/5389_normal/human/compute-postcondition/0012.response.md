Example Answer:
`bussum` is updated by adding the minimum value between `x * c1` and `c2`. The value of `x` is the third element in the list `bus`. Therefore, `bussum` is updated based on the minimum value between the product of the third element of `bus` and `c1` and `c2`. 
Output State: **`c1, c2, c3, c4` are integers such that 1 ≤ c1, c2, c3, c4 ≤ 1000, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000, `ai` and `bi` are lists of integers representing the number of times Vasya is going to use the buses and trolleys respectively, `bus` is a list of buses with at least 2 elements, `trol` is a list of integers obtained from the user input, `busc1` is an empty list, `bussum` is the updated value after the calculation, `trolsum` is 0, for the loop to execute the third time `bus` is a list of buses with at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in the list `bus`, `bussum` is updated based on the minimum value between `x * c1` and `c2 is updated based on the minimum value between the product of the third element of `bus` and `c1` and `c2`**
