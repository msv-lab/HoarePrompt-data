Example Answer:
The `trolsum` is updated by adding the minimum value between `x * c1` and `c2` for each element `x` in the list `trol`. The previous state of the variables is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `c1, c2, c3, c4` are integers such that 1 ≤ c1, c2, c3, c4 ≤ 1000, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000, `ai` and `bi` are lists of integers representing the number of times Vasya is going to use the buses and trolleys respectively, `bus` is a list of buses, `trol` is a list of trolleys with at least 2 elements, `busc1` is an empty list, `bussum` is the sum of the minimum value between each element of `bus` multiplied by `c1` and `c2`, and `trolsum` is the updated sum of the minimum value between each element of `trol` multiplied by `c1` and `c2`.
Output State: **`c1, c2, c3, c4` are integers such that 1 ≤ c1, c2, c3, c4 ≤ 1000, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000, `ai` and `bi` are lists of integers representing the number of times Vasya is going to use the buses and trolleys respectively, `bus` is a list of buses, `trol` is a list of trolleys with at least 2 elements, `busc1` is an empty list, `bussum` is the sum of the minimum value between each element of `bus` multiplied by `c1` and `c2`, and `trolsum` is the updated sum of the minimum value between each element of `trol` multiplied by `c1` and `c2`**
