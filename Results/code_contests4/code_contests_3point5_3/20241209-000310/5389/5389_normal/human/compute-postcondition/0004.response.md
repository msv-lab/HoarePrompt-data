Example Answer:
`busc1` is assigned an empty list. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `c1, c2, c3, c4` are integers such that 1 ≤ c1, c2, c3, c4 ≤ 1000, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000, `ai` and `bi` are lists of integers representing the number of times Vasya is going to use the buses and trolleys respectively, `bus` is a list of integers, `trol` is a list of integers obtained from the user input, `busc1` is an empty list.
Output State: **`c1, c2, c3, c4` are integers such that 1 ≤ c1, c2, c3, c4 ≤ 1000, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000, `ai` and `bi` are lists of integers representing the number of times Vasya is going to use the buses and trolleys respectively, `bus` is a list of integers, `trol` is a list of integers obtained from the user input, `busc1` is an empty list**
