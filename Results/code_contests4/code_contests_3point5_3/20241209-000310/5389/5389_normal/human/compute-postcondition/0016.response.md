According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `trol` list. If the list has more elements, the loop executes again for the next element. At the end of the last iteration, `trol` is a list with at least 1 element. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `trol` must have more elements.
State: **`c1, c2, c3, c4` are integers such that 1 ≤ c1, c2, c3, c4 ≤ 1000, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000, `ai` and `bi` are lists of integers representing the number of times Vasya is going to use the buses and trolleys respectively, `bus` is a list of buses, `trol` is a list of trolleys with at least 2 elements, `busc1` is an empty list, `bussum` is the sum of the minimum value between each element of `bus` multiplied by `c1` and `c2`, `trolsum` is the sum of the minimum value between each element of `trol` multiplied by `c1` and `c2`**
