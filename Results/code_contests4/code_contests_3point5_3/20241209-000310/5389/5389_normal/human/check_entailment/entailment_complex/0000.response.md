Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where the lists of buses and trolleys might be empty. According to the problem description, Vasya can travel on buses and trolleys, which means there should be at least one bus or trolley available. However, the program does not check for this condition and might produce incorrect results or errors if the lists are empty. This violates the requirements of the problem description.
