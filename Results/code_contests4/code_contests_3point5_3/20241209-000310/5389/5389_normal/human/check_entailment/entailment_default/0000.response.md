Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes input values for transportation costs, the number of times Vasya uses buses and trolleys, and calculates the total cost for Vasya's transportation.
- It considers the minimum cost between using buses and trolleys without monthly passes, then adds the cost of monthly passes if it reduces the overall cost.
- Finally, it prints the total cost for Vasya's transportation.
- The code correctly handles the cases where Vasya uses buses, trolleys, or both, and calculates the minimum sum of burles required based on the provided costs and frequency of usage. 
- There are no cases identified where the code does not meet the problem description.
