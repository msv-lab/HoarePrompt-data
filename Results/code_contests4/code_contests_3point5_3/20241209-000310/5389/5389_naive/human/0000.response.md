Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided program correctly calculates the minimum sum of burles Vasya will have to spend on the tickets based on the given inputs. It considers all four types of tickets and calculates the cost for each bus and trolley based on the number of times Vasya is going to use them. Then, it calculates the minimum sum of burles by considering the different ticket options for buses and trolleys separately, and then for all buses and all trolleys combined. Finally, it outputs the minimum cost correctly. The program follows the problem description for every potential case and provides the correct output.
