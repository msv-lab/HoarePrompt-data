According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`, which is a user input value. If the user enters a valid integer value for `n`, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted so that `n` is a positive integer value. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer value for the loop to execute**
