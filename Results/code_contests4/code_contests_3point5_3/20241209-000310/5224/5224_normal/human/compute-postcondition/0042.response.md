Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `xa, ya, ra, xb, yb, rb` are assigned new input values, `d` is calculated based on the new values of `xa, ya, xb, yb`. If (rb - ra) ** 2 > d, the program prints -2. Otherwise, `n` is a positive integer, `xa, ya, ra, xb, yb, rb` are assigned new input values, `d` is calculated based on the new values of `xa, ya, xb, yb`.***
