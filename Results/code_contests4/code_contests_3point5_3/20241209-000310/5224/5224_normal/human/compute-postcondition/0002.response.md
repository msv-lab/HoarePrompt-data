Example Answer:
The variables `xa, ya, ra, xb, yb, rb` are assigned values by splitting the input provided through `raw_input()` and then converting them to integers using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The values of `xa, ya, ra, xb, yb, rb` are now determined by the input provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer value for the loop to execute; `xa, ya, ra, xb, yb, rb` have been assigned specific integer values based on the input.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer value for the loop to execute; `xa, ya, ra, xb, yb, rb` have been assigned specific integer values based on the input**
