According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **n is a positive integer, xa, ya, ra, xb, yb, rb are assigned values based on input. If d > (ra + rb), for the loop to execute one more time `i` should be incremented by 1**
