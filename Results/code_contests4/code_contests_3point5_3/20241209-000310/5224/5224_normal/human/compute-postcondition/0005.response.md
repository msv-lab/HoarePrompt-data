Example Answer:
The code simply prints 0. There are no changes to the initial state variables. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, xa, ya, ra, xb, yb, rb are specific integers, d is calculated as the square of the difference between xa and xb, and the square of the difference between ya and yb. The calculated value of d is greater than the square of the sum of ra and rb.
Output State: **n is a positive integer. xa, ya, ra, xb, yb, rb are specific integers. d is calculated as the square of the difference between xa and xb, and the square of the difference between ya and yb. The calculated value of d is greater than the square of the sum of ra and rb.**
