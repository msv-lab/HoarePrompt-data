According to the code, the loop can execute based on the value of `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be a positive integer.

State: **n is a positive integer for the loop to execute again**
