Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer for the loop to execute; xa, ya, ra, xb, yb, rb, d have specific integer values based on the input. If d is greater than (ra + rb) ** 2, the function calculates the difference between ra and rb if ra is greater than rb. If ra is less than or equal to rb, the function calculates the difference between rb and ra. If d is less than or equal to (ra + rb) ** 2, the function calculates the difference between ra and rb if ra is greater than rb. If ra is less than or equal to rb, the function calculates the difference between rb and ra.***
