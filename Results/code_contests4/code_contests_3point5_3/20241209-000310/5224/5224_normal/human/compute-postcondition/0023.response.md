Example Answer:
The value of `d` is calculated by taking the square of the difference between `xa` and `xb`, and the square of the difference between `ya` and `yb`, and adding them together. The values of `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are provided based on input. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, xa, ya, ra, xb, yb, rb are assigned values based on input, and `d` is calculated using the provided values.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, xa, ya, ra, xb, yb, rb are assigned values based on input, and `d` is calculated using the provided values**
