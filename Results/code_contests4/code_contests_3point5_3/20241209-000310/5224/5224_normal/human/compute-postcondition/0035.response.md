Example Answer:
The variable `d` is assigned the value of the square of the difference between `(xa - xb)` and `(ya - yb)`. The values of `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb` are new input values, so the value of `d` will be calculated based on these new inputs. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `xa, ya, ra, xb, yb, rb` are assigned new input values, `d` is calculated based on the new values of `xa, ya, xb, yb`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `xa, ya, ra, xb, yb, rb` are assigned new input values, `d` is calculated based on the new values of `xa, ya, xb, yb`**
