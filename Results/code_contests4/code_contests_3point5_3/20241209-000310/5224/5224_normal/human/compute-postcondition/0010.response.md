Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer value for the loop to execute; `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` have been assigned specific integer values based on the input; `d` is calculated as the square of the difference between `xa` and `xb`, and the square of the difference between `ya` and `yb`. The value of `d` is less than or equal to (ra + rb). Additionally, `ra` is greater than `rb`. ((ra - rb) ** 2) is less than or equal to `d`***
