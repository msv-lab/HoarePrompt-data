Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer value for the loop to execute; `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb`, `d` have specific integer values based on the input. The value of `d` is less than or equal to `(ra + rb)`, and `ra` is less than or equal to `rb`. If `(rb - ra) ** 2 > d`, `((rb - ra)`; `print(-2)` is executed. Otherwise, `1` is executed.***
