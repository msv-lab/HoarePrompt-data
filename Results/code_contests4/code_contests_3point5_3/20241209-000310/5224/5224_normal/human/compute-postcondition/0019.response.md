Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer for the loop to execute; `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb`, `d` have specific integer values based on the input. The value of `d` is less than or equal to `(ra + rb)`. If `ra` is greater than `rb`, the function executes the if part and calculates the difference between `ra` and `rb`. If `(ra - rb)`. Otherwise, if `ra` is less than or equal to `rb`, the function executes the else part and calculates the difference between `rb` and `ra`. If `(rb - ra)`.***
