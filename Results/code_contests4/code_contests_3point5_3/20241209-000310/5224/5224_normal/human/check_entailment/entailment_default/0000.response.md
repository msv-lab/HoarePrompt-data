Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The main issue is that the code is using `int` type instead of `float` type for the input values, which can lead to inaccurate calculations since the input values are real numbers. The code should use `float` type instead of `int` type for the input values to accurately represent the real numbers in the datasets. This can cause the code to incorrectly determine whether the circles are overlapping, contained within each other, or intersecting.
