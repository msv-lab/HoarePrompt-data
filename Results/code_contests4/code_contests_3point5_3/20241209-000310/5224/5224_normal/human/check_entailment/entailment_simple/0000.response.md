Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It calculates the distance between the centers of the two circles and compares it with the sum and difference of their radii to determine the relationship between the circles. The conditions in the program match the conditions specified in the problem description, and the program outputs the correct values for each case. Therefore, the program is correct.
