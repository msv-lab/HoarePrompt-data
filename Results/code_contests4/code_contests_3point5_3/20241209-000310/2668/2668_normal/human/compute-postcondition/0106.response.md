Example Answer:
The code appends a tuple containing `subs[y]` and `y + 1` to the list `templis`. The value of `y` is 0, so the tuple `(subs[0], 1)` is appended to `templis`. For the initial state, we have `back` is the result of calling `func_1`, `res` is True, `templis` contains one tuple, `subs` has at least 1 element, `y` is 0, and `audio[y][0]` is equal to `uniques[i][1]`.
Output State: **`back` is the result of calling `func_1`, `res` is True, `templis` contains one tuple, `subs` has at least 1 element, `y` is 0, `audio[y][0]` is equal to `uniques[i][1]`.**
