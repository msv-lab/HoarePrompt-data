Example Answer:
`anss` is assigned the value of `back`. If `back[0]` evaluates to True, `res` becomes True, `anss` becomes "back", and the program breaks out. Otherwise, there is no change in state. Therefore, the Output State is: If `back[0]` evaluates to True, `res` is True, `anss` is "back" and the program breaks out. Otherwise, no change in state.
Output State: **If `back[0]` evaluates to True, `res` is True, `anss` is "back" and the program breaks out. Otherwise, no change in state.**
