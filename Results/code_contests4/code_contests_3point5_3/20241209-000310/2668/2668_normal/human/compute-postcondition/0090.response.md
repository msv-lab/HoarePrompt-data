According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `z` and `uniques`. If `z` is less than the length of `uniques`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `back` is the result of calling `func_1` with parameters `uniques[1][1]`, `templis`, 0, and `len(templis) - 1`, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `templis` contains tuples `(subs[y], y + 1)` for each valid iteration of the loop, `uniques` has at least 1 element, `z` is 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. So for the loop to execute one more time, `z` needs to be 2 and `uniques` must have at least 2 elements.
State: **`back` is the result of calling `func_1` with parameters `uniques[1][1]`, `templis`, 0, and `len(templis) - 1`, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `templis` contains tuples `(subs[y], y + 1)` for each valid iteration of the loop, for the loop to execute the third time `uniques` has at least 2 elements, `z` is 2 and the most internal loop or if statement is exited**.
