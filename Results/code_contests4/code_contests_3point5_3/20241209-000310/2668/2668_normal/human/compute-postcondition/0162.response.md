Example Answer:
Since `back[0]` is not mentioned in the initial state, there is no change in the state. The value of `res` is already True. Therefore, the Output State is: If `back[0]` evaluates to True, `res` is True, `anss` is "back" and the program breaks out. Otherwise, no change in state.
Output State: **If `back[0]` evaluates to True, `res` is True, `anss` is "back" and the program breaks out. Otherwise, no change in state.**
