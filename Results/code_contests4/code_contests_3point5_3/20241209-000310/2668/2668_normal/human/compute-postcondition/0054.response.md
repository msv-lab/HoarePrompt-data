Example Answer:
`m` is assigned the value of the integer read from the input. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `uniques` is a sorted list in reverse order, `i` is the index of the last element in `counts`, `x` is the last element of `counts`, the loop has finished iterating over all elements in `counts`, and `m` is the integer read from the input.
Output State: **`uniques` is a sorted list in reverse order, `i` is the index of the last element in `counts`, `x` is the last element of `counts`, the loop has finished iterating over all elements in `counts`, `m` is the integer read from the input**
