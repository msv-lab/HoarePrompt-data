Example Answer:
`anss` is assigned the value of `back`, which is the result of calling `func_1(uniques[0][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`. The other variables remain the same as their previous values. Therefore, the Output State is: `back` is the result of calling `func_1(uniques[0][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`, `res` is True, `templis` contains tuples based on the conditions inside the loop, `y` is the last index of `subs` - 1, `audio[y][0]` is equal to `uniques[0][1]`, for the loop to execute the first time `uniques` has at least 1 element, z is 0, the first element of `back` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`.
Output State: **`back` is the result of calling `func_1(uniques[0][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`, `res` is True, `templis` contains tuples based on the conditions inside the loop, `y` is the last index of `subs` - 1, `audio[y][0]` is equal to `uniques[0][1]`, for the loop to execute the first time `uniques` has at least 1 element, z is 0, the first element of `back` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`**
