According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `uniques`. If the length of `uniques` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `anss`, `res`, `templis`, `y`, and `audio[y][0]` do not directly affect the execution of the loop. So, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **for the loop to execute the first time, `uniques` has a length of at least 1**
