Example Answer:
If `back[0]` evaluates to True, `res` becomes True, `anss` becomes "back", and the program breaks out. Otherwise, `z` is incremented by 1 to continue the loop execution. 
Output State: **If `back[0]` evaluates to True, `res` is True, `anss` is "back" and the program breaks out. Otherwise, `z` is incremented by 1 to continue the loop execution.**
