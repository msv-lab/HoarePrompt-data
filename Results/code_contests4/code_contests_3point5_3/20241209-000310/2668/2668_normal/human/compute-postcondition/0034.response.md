Example Answer: 
The value of `counts[i]` is appended to the `uniques` list. Since `i` is 0 and `x` is the first element in the `counts` list, `counts[i]` is equal to `x`. After appending `x` to `uniques`, the `uniques` list will now contain `x`. Therefore, the Output State is: `uniques` contains the value of `x`, `counts` remains the same, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element in the `counts` list, `i` plus 1 is equal to the length of `counts`.
Output State: **`uniques` contains the value of `x`, `counts` remains the same, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element in the `counts` list, `i` plus 1 is equal to the length of `counts`**
