Output State: **`n`, `m`, `ai`, `bj`, `cj`, `init`, `counts` are positive integers. If `input.txt` file exists, it is opened in read mode. If `input.txt` file does not exist, the program continues without opening the file. `init` is a list of integers obtained by mapping the input file read line and splitting, sorted in reverse order. `counts` is a list containing a tuple (1, init[0], (counts[len(counts) - 1][0] + 1, init[i])). For the loop to execute the second time, `init` is a list with at least 2 elements. `i` is 1 and `x` is the second element in the sorted `init` list in reverse order when `i` is equal to 1. Additionally, after entering the if condition, `init[i]` is equal to `init[i - 1] if that condition is true. If the condition is false, `init[i]` is not equal to `init[i - 1`. `counts` now contains an additional tuple (1, init[i]).**
