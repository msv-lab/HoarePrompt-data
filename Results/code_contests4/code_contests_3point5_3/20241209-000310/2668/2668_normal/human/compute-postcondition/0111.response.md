According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `subs` and `y`. If `y` is less than the length of `subs`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `subs` has at least 2 elements, `y` is 1. At the for loop, `y` is increased by 1, so for the loop to execute again, `y` must be less than the length of `subs`.
State: **`back` is the result of calling `func_1`, `res` is True, `templis` contains two tuples, for the loop to execute the fourth time `subs` has at least 2 elements, `y` is 2, `audio[y][0]` is equal to `uniques[i][1]` if the condition `audio[y][0] == uniques[i][1]` is met.**
