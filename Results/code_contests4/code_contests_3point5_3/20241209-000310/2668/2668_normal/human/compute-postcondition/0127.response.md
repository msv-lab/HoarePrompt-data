Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if block, `back` is the result of calling `func_1(uniques[1][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`, `res` is True, `templis` contains tuples based on the conditions inside the loop, `y` is the last index of `subs` - 1, `audio[y][0]` is equal to `uniques[1][1]`, for the loop to execute one more time `uniques` has at least 2 elements, `z` is 1, the first element of `back` is True, and `anss` is assigned the value of `back`.***
