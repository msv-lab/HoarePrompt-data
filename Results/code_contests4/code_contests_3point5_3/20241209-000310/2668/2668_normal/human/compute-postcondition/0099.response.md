According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `uniques` list. If the length of the list is greater than the current index `i`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `back` is the result of calling `func_1` with parameters `uniques[z][1]`, `templis`, 0, and `len(templis) - 1`. If `back[0]` is True, `res` is True if at least one call to `func_1` within the loop evaluates to True, `anss` is assigned the value of the last `back` that evaluated to True, `templis` contains tuples `(subs[y], y + 1)` for each valid iteration of the loop, and `uniques` has at least 1 element. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, the length of `uniques` must be greater than the current index `i + 1`.
State: **`back` is the result of calling `func_1` with parameters `uniques[z][1]`, `templis`, 0, and `len(templis) - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time the length of `uniques` must be greater than `i + 1`.**
