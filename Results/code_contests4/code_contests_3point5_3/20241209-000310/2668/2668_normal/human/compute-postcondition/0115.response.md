According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of uniques. If the length of uniques is at least 1, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, the condition `audio[y][0] == uniques[i][1]` is met. So for the loop to be executed the first time, uniques has at least 1 element and z is 0, audio[y][0] is equal to uniques[0][1].

State: **`back` is the result of calling `func_1`, `res` is True, `templis` contains tuples based on the conditions inside the loop, `y` is the last index of `subs` - 1, `audio[y][0]` is equal to `uniques[0][1]`, for the loop to execute the first time `uniques` has at least 1 element, z is 0**
