Output State: **After the loop completes, the variables `n`, `m`, `ai`, `bj`, `cj`, `init`, `counts` are positive integers. If the file `input.txt` exists, it is opened in read mode. If the file does not exist, the program continues without opening the file. `init` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order. `counts` contains tuples where the first element represents the count of consecutive elements in `init` and the second element represents the value of the element.**
