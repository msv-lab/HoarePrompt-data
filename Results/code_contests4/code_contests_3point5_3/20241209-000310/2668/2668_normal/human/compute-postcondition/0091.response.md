Example Answer:
`back` is assigned the value returned by calling `func_1` with parameters `uniques[z][1]`, `templis`, 0, and `len(templis) - 1`. The value of `z` is 2, so `uniques[z][1]` refers to the element at index 2 in `uniques`. The rest of the variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `back` is the result of calling `func_1` with parameters `uniques[2][1]`, `templis`, 0, `len(templis) - 1`; `res` is True; `anss` is assigned the value of `back`; `templis` contains tuples `(subs[y], y + 1)` for each valid iteration of the loop; for the loop to execute the third time `uniques` has at least 2 elements; `z` is 2; the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
Output State: **`back` is the result of calling `func_1` with parameters `uniques[2][1]`, `templis`, 0, `len(templis) - 1`; `res` is True; `anss` is assigned the value of `back`; `templis` contains tuples `(subs[y], y + 1)` for each valid iteration of the loop; for the loop to execute the third time `uniques` has at least 2 elements; `z` is 2; the most internal loop or if statement is exited**
