Postcondition: ***`back` is the result of calling `func_1` with parameters `uniques[i][1]`, `audio2`, 0, and `len(audio2) - 1`, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `templis` contains tuples `(subs[y], y + 1)`, a new tuple `(subs[y], y + 1)`, and an additional tuple `(subs[y], y + 1)`, for the loop to execute a second time `subs` has a length greater than y+2, and `audio[y+2][0]` is equal to `uniques[i][1`. This condition holds true after the execution of the program fragment.***
