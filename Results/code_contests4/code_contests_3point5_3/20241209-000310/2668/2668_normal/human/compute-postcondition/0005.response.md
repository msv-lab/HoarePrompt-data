Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input.readline())`, where `input` reads from a file. If the file 'input.txt' exists and contains a valid integer, `n` will be assigned that integer value. Otherwise, `n` will retain its previous value. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: *n and m are positive integers, ai, bj, cj are positive integers representing the index of languages known by scientists and used in movies. If 'input.txt' file exists, it is opened in read mode. If 'input.txt' file does not exist, the program continues without opening the file. `n` is a positive integer.
