According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `subs`, `y`, `audio`, and `uniques`. If `y` is less than the length of `subs`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `back` is the result of calling `func_1`, `res` is True, `templis` contains one tuple, `subs` has at least 1 element, `y` is 0, and `audio[y][0]` is equal to `uniques[i][1]`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the `y` should be incremented by 1 to move to the next element in `subs`. So, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:
State: **`back` is the result of calling `func_1`, `res` is True, `templis` contains one tuple, for the loop to execute the second time `subs` has at least 1 element, `y` is 1, `audio[y][0]` is equal to `uniques[i][1`]**
