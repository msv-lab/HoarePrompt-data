Postcondition: ***`uniques` is a list containing the value of the first element of `counts`, the new value of `x`, the value of `counts[i]`, and the appended value of `counts[i]`. `counts` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `x` is the second element in the `counts` list, and `i + 1` is less than the length of `counts`. If `i + 1` equals the length of `counts`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `counts[i][1] != counts[i + 1][1]`, `uniques` contains the value of the first element of `counts`, the new value of `x`, the value of `counts[i]`, and the appended value of `counts[i]`.***
