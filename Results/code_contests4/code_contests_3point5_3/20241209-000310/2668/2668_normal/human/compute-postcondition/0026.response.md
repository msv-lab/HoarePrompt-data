Postcondition: ***After the if-else block executes, the program state is as follows: `n`, `m`, `ai`, `bj`, `cj`, `init`, `counts` are positive integers. If `input.txt` file exists, it is opened in read mode. If `input.txt` file does not exist, the program continues without opening the file. `init` is a list of integers obtained by mapping the input file read line and splitting, sorted in reverse order with at least 3 elements. `counts` contains an additional tuple with the first element being the previous value of the last tuple's first element incremented by 1, and the second element being the 2nd element of the sorted `init` list in reverse order. `i` is 1, and `x` is the second element in the sorted `init` list in reverse order. Additionally, `init[i]` is equal to `init[i - 1] to satisfy the condition when entering the if statement.***
