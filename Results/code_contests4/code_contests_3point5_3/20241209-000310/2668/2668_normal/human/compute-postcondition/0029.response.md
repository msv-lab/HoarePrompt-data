Postcondition: ***After the if-else block executes, `n`, `m`, `ai`, `bj`, `cj`, `init`, `counts` are positive integers. If `input.txt` file exists, it is opened in read mode. If `input.txt` file does not exist, the program continues without opening the file. `init` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order with at least 3 elements. `counts` contains an additional tuple with the first element being the previous value of the last tuple's first element incremented by 1 and the second element being the 2nd element of the sorted `init` list in reverse order. `i` is 1, `x` is the second element in the sorted `init` list in reverse order, and `init[i]` is equal to `init[i - 1]` after the execution of the if-else block.***
