Postcondition: ***`uniques` is a list containing the value of the first element of `counts`, the new value of the third element in `counts`, the value of `counts[2]`, the appended value of `counts[2]`, the value of `counts[2]` where `i` is 2, and the value at index 2 of `counts`. `counts` remains unchanged. `i` is 2. `x` is the third element in the `counts` list. `i + 1` is less than the length of `counts`. If `counts[i][1]` is not equal to `counts[i + 1][1]`, then the state of the program variables remains the same as the precondition, with `uniques` containing the specified elements.***
