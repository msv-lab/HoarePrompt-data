According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `uniques` list. If the current value of `z` is less than the length of `uniques`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, if `back[0]` evaluates to True, `res` is True, `anss` is "back" and the program breaks out. Otherwise, no change in state. So for the loop to execute one more time, `z` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **If `back[0]` evaluates to True, `res` is True, `anss` is "back" and the program breaks out. Otherwise, no change in state, for the loop to execute one more time `z` is incremented by 1**
