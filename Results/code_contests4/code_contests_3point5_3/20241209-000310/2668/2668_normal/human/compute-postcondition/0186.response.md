According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of the `uniques` list. If `i` is less than the length of `uniques`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `back` is the result of calling `func_1` with parameters `uniques[i][1]`, `subs`, 0, and `len(subs) - 1`, where `back[0]` is True. `res` is True, `anss` contains the value of the last `back` that evaluated to True, `templis` contains tuples `(subs[y], y + 1)` based on the conditions inside the loop, `uniques` has at least 1 element, `subs` is a list of tuples `(subs[i], i + 1)` for all elements in `subs`, `subs` is sorted. The condition `(back[0])` is true, `res` is True, and `anss` contains the value of the last `back` that was True. At the end of the iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented and be less than the length of `uniques`.
State: **After the execution of the if block, `back` is the result of calling `func_1` with parameters `uniques[i][1]`, `subs`, 0, and `len(subs) - 1`, where `back[0]` is True. `res` is True, `anss` contains the value of the last `back` that evaluated to True, `templis` contains tuples `(subs[y], y + 1)` based on the conditions inside the loop, `uniques` has at least 1 element, `subs` is a list of tuples `(subs[i], i + 1)` for all elements in `subs`, `subs` is sorted. The condition `(back[0])` is true. `res` is True, and `anss` contains the value of the last `back` that was True. `i` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time, so `i` needs to be less than the length of `uniques**.
