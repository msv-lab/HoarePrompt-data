Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `ai`, `bj`, `cj`, `init`, `counts` are positive integers. If `input.txt` file exists, it is opened in read mode. If `input.txt` file does not exist, the program continues without opening the file. `init` is a list of integers obtained by mapping the input file read line and splitting, sorted in reverse order. `counts` is a list containing a tuple (1, init[0]). For the loop to execute the first time, `init` is a list with at least 1 element. `i` is 0 and `x` is the first element in the sorted `init` list in reverse order when `i` is equal to 0. Additionally, after entering the if condition, `init[i]` is equal to `init[i - 1]`.***
