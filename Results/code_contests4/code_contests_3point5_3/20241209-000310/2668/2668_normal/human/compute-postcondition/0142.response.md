According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `subs` list. If the `subs` list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the key variables to adjust are `y`, `anss`, `res`, `templis`, and `audio[y][0]`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `y` is set to 0 (assuming Python 2 is used), `anss` is the result of calling `func_1(uniques[0][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1)`, `res` is True, `templis` is an empty list, and `audio[y][0]` is equal to the value of `uniques[1][1]` for the next iteration of the loop.

State: **`anss` is the result of calling `func_1(uniques[0][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1)`, `res` is True, `templis` is an empty list, `y` is 0, `audio[y][0]` is equal to the value of `uniques[1][1]` for the next iteration of the loop, for the loop to execute the first time `subs` has at least 1 element**
