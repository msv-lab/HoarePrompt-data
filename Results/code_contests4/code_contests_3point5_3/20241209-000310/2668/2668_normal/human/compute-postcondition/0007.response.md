Example Answer:
`init` is sorted in reverse order. The previous values of `init` are unknown since they are obtained from reading a file. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `m` are positive integers, `ai`, `bj`, `cj` are positive integers representing the index of languages known by scientists and used in movies. If 'input.txt' file exists, it is opened in read mode. If 'input.txt' file does not exist, the program continues without opening the file. `n` is a positive integer, `init` is a list of integers obtained by mapping the input file read line and splitting, sorted in reverse order.
