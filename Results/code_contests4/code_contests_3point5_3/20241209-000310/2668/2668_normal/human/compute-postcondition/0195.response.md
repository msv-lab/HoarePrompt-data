Example Answer:
`anss` is assigned the value of `back`, and `back[0]` is already true, so `anss` will contain the value of the last `back` that was true. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: The conditions `(back[0])` is true, `res` is True, `anss` contains the value of the last `back` that was True, `i` is incremented by 1, `templis` contains tuples `(subs[y], y + 1)` based on the conditions inside the loop.
Output State: **The conditions `(back[0])` is true, `res` is True, `anss` contains the value of the last `back` that was True, `i` is incremented by 1, `templis` contains tuples `(subs[y], y + 1)` based on the conditions inside the loop.**
