Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if block, `back` is the result of calling `func_1` with parameters `uniques[i][1]`, `subs`, 0, and `len(subs) - 1`, where `back[0]` is True. `res` is True, `anss` contains the value of the last `back` that evaluated to True, `templis` contains tuples `(subs[y], y + 1)` based on the conditions inside the loop, `uniques` has at least 1 element, `subs` is a list of tuples `(subs[i], i + 1)` for all elements in `subs`, `subs` is sorted. The condition `(back[0])` is true. `res` is True, and `anss` contains the value of the last `back` that was True. `i` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time, so `i` needs to be less than the length of `uniques. `back` is updated with the result of the function call. If `back[0]` is True, then `anss` is the value of `back`, `res` is True, `i` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
