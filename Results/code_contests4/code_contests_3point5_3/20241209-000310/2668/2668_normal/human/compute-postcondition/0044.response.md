Example Answer:
The value of `counts[i]` is appended to the `uniques` list. The initial state states that `uniques` contains the value of the first element of `counts`, the new value of `x`, and the value of `counts[i]`. After appending `counts[i]`, the `uniques` list will now contain the value of the first element of `counts`, the new value of `x`, the value of `counts[i]`, and the appended value of `counts[i]`. The state of `counts` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, and `i + 1` is less than the length of `counts`. Therefore, the Output State is: `uniques` contains the value of the first element of `counts`, the new value of `x`, the value of `counts[i]`, and the appended value of `counts[i]`.
Output State: **`uniques` contains the value of the first element of `counts`, the new value of `x`, the value of `counts[i]`, and the appended value of `counts[i]**
