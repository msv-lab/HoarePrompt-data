Example Answer:
The file 'input.txt' is opened in read mode and stored in the variable 'input'. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: n and m are positive integers. ai, bj, cj are positive integers representing the index of languages known by scientists and used in movies. 'input.txt' file is opened in read mode.
Output State: **n and m are positive integers. ai, bj, cj are positive integers representing the index of languages known by scientists and used in movies. 'input.txt' file is opened in read mode.**
