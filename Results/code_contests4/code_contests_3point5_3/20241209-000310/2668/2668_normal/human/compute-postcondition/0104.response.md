According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `subs` list. If `subs` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `back` is the result of calling `func_1`, `res` is True, and `templis` is an empty list. So for the loop to execute the first time, `subs` must have at least 1 element, and `y` is 0.
State: **`back` is the result of calling `func_1`, `res` is True, `templis` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `subs` has at least 1 element, `y` is 0**
