According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `subs`. If `subs` has a length greater than 0, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the important states that need to be adjusted are:
- `back` is the result of calling `func_1` with parameters `uniques[i][1]`, `audio2`, 0, and `len(audio2) - 1` where the first element evaluates to True
- `res` is True
- `anss` is assigned the value of `back`
- `templis` is an empty list

So, for the loop to execute the first time:
State: **`back` is the result of calling `func_1` with parameters `uniques[i][1]`, `audio2`, 0, and `len(audio2) - 1` where the first element evaluates to True, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `templis` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `subs` has a length greater than 0**
