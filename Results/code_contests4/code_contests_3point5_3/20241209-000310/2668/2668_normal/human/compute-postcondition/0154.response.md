Example Answer:
The function `func_1` is called with parameters `uniques[z][1]`, `templis`, `0`, and `len(templis) - 1`. The outcome of the function call will depend on the specific implementation of `func_1` and the values of the parameters passed. The variables `back`, `uniques`, `templis`, and `z` are affected by this code snippet. 
Output State: **The state of the variables will depend on the execution of `func_1` and its impact on the variables.**
