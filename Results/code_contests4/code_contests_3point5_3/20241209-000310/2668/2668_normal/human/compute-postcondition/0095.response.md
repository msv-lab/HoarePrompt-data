Postcondition: ***`back` is the result of calling `func_1` with parameters `uniques[2][1]`, `templis`, 0, `len(templis) - 1`; `res` is True; `anss` is assigned the value of `back`; `templis` contains tuples `(subs[y], y + 1)` for each valid iteration of the loop; for the loop to execute the third time `uniques` has at least 2 elements; `z` is 2; the most internal loop or if statement is exited; `anss` is the result of calling `func_1` with parameters `uniques[2][1]`, `templis`, 0, `len(templis) - 1`. If `back[0]` is True, then the overall state is as described.***
