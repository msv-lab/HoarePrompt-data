Postcondition: ***`back` is the result of calling `func_1` with parameters `uniques[i][1]`, `audio2`, 0, and `len(audio2) - 1`, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `templis` contains a tuple `(subs[y], y + 1)`, for the loop to execute the first time `subs` has a length greater than 0, and `audio[y][0]` is equal to `uniques[i][1` if `audio[y][0]` equals `uniques[i][1`***
