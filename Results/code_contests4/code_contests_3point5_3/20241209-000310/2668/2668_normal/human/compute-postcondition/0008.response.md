Example Answer:
`counts` is assigned a list containing a tuple with values (1, init[0]). The value of `init` is derived from reading a line from an input file and splitting it into a list of integers in reverse order. The list `counts` contains one tuple with the first element being 1 and the second element being the first element of the sorted `init` list. 
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `ai`, `bj`, `cj` are positive integers representing the index of languages known by scientists and used in movies. If 'input.txt' file exists, it is opened in read mode. If 'input.txt' file does not exist, the program continues without opening the file. `n` is a positive integer, `init` is a list of integers obtained by mapping the input file read line and splitting, sorted in reverse order. `counts` is a list containing a tuple (1, init[0])**
