Example Answer:
`back` is assigned the result of calling `func_1` with parameters `uniques[i][1]`, `subs`, 0, and `len(subs) - 1`. The condition `(back[0])` is true. `res` is True, and `anss` contains the value of the last `back` that evaluated to True. `templis` contains tuples `(subs[y], y + 1)` based on the conditions inside the loop. `i` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time. If `back[0]` is True, then `anss` is the value of `back`, `res` is True, `i` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `i` is less than the length of `uniques`.
Output State: **The conditions `(back[0])` is true, `res` is True, `anss` contains the value of the last `back` that was True, `i` is incremented by 1, `templis` contains tuples `(subs[y], y + 1)` based on the conditions inside the loop.**
