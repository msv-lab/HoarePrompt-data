Output State: **If any of the `back[0]` evaluations is True during the loop iterations, `res` will be True, and `anss` will be the result of the corresponding `back` value. If none of the `back[0]` evaluations are True, `res` will remain True, and `anss` will retain its initial value. `templis` will not change, and `z` will be the last index of `uniques`.**
