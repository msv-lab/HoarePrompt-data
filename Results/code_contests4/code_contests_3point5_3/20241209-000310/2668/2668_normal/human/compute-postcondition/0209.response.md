Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, the content of 'output.txt' is equal to the value of `anss[1]` if `res` is True, or it is 1 if `res` is False. However, if the file 'output.txt' does not exist, then the value of `output` is set to 1 and printed to the standard output using `sys.stdout.write()`.***
