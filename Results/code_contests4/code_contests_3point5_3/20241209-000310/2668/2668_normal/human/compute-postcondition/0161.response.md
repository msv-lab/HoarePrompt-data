Example Answer:
If `back[0]` evaluates to True, `res` is assigned True, `anss` is assigned "back", and the program breaks out. Otherwise, there is no change in state. The function `func_1` is called with parameters `uniques[z][1]`, `templis`, 0, and `len(templis) - 1`.
Output State: **If `back[0]` evaluates to True, `res` is True, `anss` is "back" and the program breaks out. Otherwise, no change in state.**
