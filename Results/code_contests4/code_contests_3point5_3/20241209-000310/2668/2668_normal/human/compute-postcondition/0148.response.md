Postcondition: ***`anss` is the result of calling `func_1(uniques[0][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1)`, `res` is True, `templis` contains a tuple with the values `(subs[y], y + 1), (subs[y], y + 1)`, `y` is 1, `audio[y][0]` is equal to the value of `uniques[1][1]` for the next iteration of the loop, for the loop to execute the second time `subs` has at least 2 elements, and `audio[y][0]` is equal to `uniques[i][1]` if `audio[y][0] == uniques[i][1]***
