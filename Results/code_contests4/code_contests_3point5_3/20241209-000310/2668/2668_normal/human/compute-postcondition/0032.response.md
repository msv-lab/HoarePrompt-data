According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `counts` list. If the `counts` list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `uniques` is an empty list does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `counts` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, and `x` is the first element in the `counts` list.

State: **`uniques` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `counts` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element in the `counts` list**
