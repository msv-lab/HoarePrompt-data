Example Answer:
The variable `input` is assigned to `sys.stdin`, indicating that the program will read input from the standard input stream. The initial state variables `n`, `m`, `ai`, `bj`, `cj` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers, `ai`, `bj`, `cj` are positive integers representing the index of languages known by scientists and used in movies. 'input.txt' does not exist.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `ai`, `bj`, `cj` are positive integers representing the index of languages known by scientists and used in movies. 'input.txt' does not exist**
