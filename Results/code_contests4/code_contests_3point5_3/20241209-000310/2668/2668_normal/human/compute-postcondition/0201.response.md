Output State: **`back` is the result of calling `func_1` with parameters `uniques[-1][1]`, `subs`, 0, and `len(subs) - 1`, where `back[0]` is True. If any iteration of the loop resulted in `back[0]` being True, then `res` is True. The value of the last `back` that evaluated to True is stored in `anss`. `templis` contains tuples `(subs[y], y + 1)` based on the conditions inside the loop. `uniques` has at least 1 element. `subs` is a list of tuples `(subs[i], i + 1)` for all elements in `subs` and `subs` is sorted. After entering the if condition `(res)` is True. `output` is equal to `anss[1]`.**
