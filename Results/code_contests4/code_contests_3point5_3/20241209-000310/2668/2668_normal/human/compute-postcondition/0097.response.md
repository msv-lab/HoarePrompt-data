Output State: **`back` is the result of calling `func_1` with parameters `uniques[z][1]`, `templis`, 0, and `len(templis) - 1`, `res` is True if at least one call to `func_1` within the loop evaluates to True, `anss` is assigned the value of the last `back` that evaluated to True, `templis` contains tuples `(subs[y], y + 1)` for each valid iteration of the loop, for the loop to execute `uniques` has at least 1 element. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
