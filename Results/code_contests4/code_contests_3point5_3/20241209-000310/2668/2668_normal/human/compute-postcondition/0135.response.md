Output State: **`back` is the result of calling `func_1(uniques[z][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)` for the last iteration of the loop, `res` is True if `back[0]` is True for any iteration of the loop, `templis` contains tuples based on the conditions inside the loop, `y` is the last index of `subs` - 1, `audio[y][0]` is equal to the value of `uniques[z][1]` for the last iteration of the loop. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
