Example Answer:
The variable `templis` is assigned an empty list. The values of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `anss` is the result of calling `func_1(uniques[i][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1)`, `res` is True, `templis` is an empty list, `y` is the last index of `subs` - 1, `audio[y][0]` is equal to the value of `uniques[z+1][1]` for the next iteration of the loop.
Output State: **`anss` is the result of calling `func_1(uniques[i][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1)`, `res` is True, `templis` is an empty list, `y` is the last index of `subs` - 1, `audio[y][0]` is equal to the value of `uniques[z+1][1]` for the next iteration of the loop**
