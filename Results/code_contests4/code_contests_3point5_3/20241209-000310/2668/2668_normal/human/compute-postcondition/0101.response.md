Example Answer:
The variable `res` is assigned the boolean value `True`. The states of other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `back` is the result of calling `func_1` with parameters `uniques[i][1]`, `audio2`, 0, and `len(audio2) - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time the length of `uniques` must be greater than `i + 1`; `res` is True.
Output State: **`back` is the result of calling `func_1` with parameters `uniques[i][1]`, `audio2`, 0, and `len(audio2) - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time the length of `uniques` must be greater than `i + 1`; `res` is True**
