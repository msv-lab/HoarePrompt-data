Output State: **`back` remains the result of calling `func_1` with parameters `uniques[1][1]`, `templis`, 0, and `len(templis) - 1`, `res` remains True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `templis` still contains tuples `(subs[y], y + 1)` for each valid iteration of the loop, for the loop to execute the second time `uniques` still has at least 1 element, `z` remains 1**
