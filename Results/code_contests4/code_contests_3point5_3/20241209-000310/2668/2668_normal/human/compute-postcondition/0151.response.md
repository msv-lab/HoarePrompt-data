Postcondition: ***`anss` is the result of calling `func_1(uniques[0][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1)`, `res` is True, `templis` contains tuples with the values `(subs[y], y + 1), (subs[y], y + 1), (subs[2], 3)`, `y` is 2, `audio[y][0]` is equal to the value of `uniques[1][1]`, for the loop to execute the third time `subs` has at least 2 elements, and `audio[y][0]` is equal to `uniques[1][1]`.***
