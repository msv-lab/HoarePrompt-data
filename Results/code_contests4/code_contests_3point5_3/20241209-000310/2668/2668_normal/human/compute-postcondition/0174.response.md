Postcondition: ***`back` is the result of calling `func_1(uniques[i][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1)`, `res` is True if any of the evaluations of `back[0]` is True during the loop iterations, otherwise it remains True, `anss` will contain the result of the last evaluated `back` value. `templis` retains its state from the loop, `y` is the last index of `subs` - 1, and `audio[y][0]` is equal to the value of `uniques[z+1][1]` for the next iteration of the loop.***
