Example Answer: 
`back` is assigned the result of calling `func_1` with arguments `uniques[i][1]`, `audio2`, 0, and `len(audio2) - 1`. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `back` is the result of calling `func_1(uniques[i][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1)`, `res` is True if `back[0]` is True for any iteration of the loop, `templis` contains tuples based on the conditions inside the loop, `y` is the last index of `subs` - 1, `audio[y][0]` is equal to the value of `uniques[z+1][1]` for the next iteration of the loop.
Output State: **`back` is the result of calling `func_1(uniques[i][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1)`, `res` is True if `back[0]` is True for any iteration of the loop, `templis` contains tuples based on the conditions inside the loop, `y` is the last index of `subs` - 1, `audio[y][0]` is equal to the value of `uniques[z+1][1]` for the next iteration of the loop**
