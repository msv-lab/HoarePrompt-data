Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_2` lacks clarity in its purpose and the operations it performs are not clearly aligned with the requirements of the problem description. The code does not seem to accurately determine the movie to which scientists should go to maximize the number of very pleased scientists and almost satisfied scientists. The function `func_1` also lacks context on how it contributes to solving the main problem. Overall, the code does not seem to correctly address the requirements of the problem description.
