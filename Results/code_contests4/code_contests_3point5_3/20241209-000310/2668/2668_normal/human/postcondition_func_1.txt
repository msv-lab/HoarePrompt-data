The function `func_2` processes and analyzes data related to languages known by scientists and used in movies. It reads input from a file if it exists, sorts the data, calculates unique elements, performs specific operations based on the input, and writes the output to a file or standard output. However, the function lacks clarity on the exact purpose of the calculations and operations performed, leading to potential confusion for users. Additionally, the function does not accept any parameters as indicated by the annotations, which may limit its reusability and flexibility.
