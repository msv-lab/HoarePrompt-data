The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `num`, `lis1`, `low`, and `high`. It searches for the value `num` within the list `lis1` using binary search. If the value is found, it returns True along with the corresponding value from the sublist. If the value is not found, it returns False along with -1. The function correctly implements the binary search algorithm and handles scenarios where the value is found and where it is not found.
