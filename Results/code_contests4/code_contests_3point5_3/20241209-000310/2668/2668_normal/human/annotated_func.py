    return False, -1
    #The program returns False along with -1 as the loop has terminated successfully with 'low' greater than 'high'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `num`, `lis1`, `low`, and `high`. It searches for the value `num` within the list `lis1` using binary search. If the value is found, it returns True along with the corresponding value from the sublist. If the value is not found, it returns False along with -1. The function correctly implements the binary search algorithm and handles scenarios where the value is found and where it is not found.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` processes and analyzes data related to languages known by scientists and used in movies. It reads input from a file if it exists, sorts the data, calculates unique elements, performs specific operations based on the input, and writes the output to a file or standard output. However, the function lacks clarity on the exact purpose of the calculations and operations performed, leading to potential confusion for users. Additionally, the function does not accept any parameters as indicated by the annotations, which may limit its reusability and flexibility.
