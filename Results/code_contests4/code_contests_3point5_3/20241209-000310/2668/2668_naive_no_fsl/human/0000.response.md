Correctness: **False**

The program may not be correct as it is hard to determine the exact logic and correctness without understanding the complex implementation. It involves binary search, sorting, and multiple loops which can introduce potential errors. Without a clear understanding of the logic and without testing the program comprehensively, it is difficult to confirm its correctness.
