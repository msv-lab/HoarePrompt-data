Correctness: **False**

The given program does not seem to correctly solve the problem described. The logic of the program is quite complex and difficult to follow, making it hard to determine its correctness. Additionally, the code contains errors such as using `os` and `sys` libraries without importing them, and using `xrange` which is not a valid function in Python 3. These issues indicate that the program is not functioning as intended. 

In order to determine the correctness of the program, a thorough review and testing would be required, including examining edge cases and potential scenarios where the program might fail to provide the correct output.
