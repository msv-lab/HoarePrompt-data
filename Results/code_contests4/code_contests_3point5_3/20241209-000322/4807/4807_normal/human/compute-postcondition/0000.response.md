Example Answer: 
The lambda function `input` is defined to read input from the standard input with the help of `sys.stdin.readline().rstrip('\r\n')`. As no other variables are affected and `n` is an integer greater than 1, the Output State is: n is an integer greater than 1.
Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1**
