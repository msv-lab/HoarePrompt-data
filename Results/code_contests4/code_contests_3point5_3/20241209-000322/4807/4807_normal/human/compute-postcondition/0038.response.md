Example Answer:
The value of `s` is decremented by 1 (`s - 1`), and its new value is appended to the string representation of variable `g`. The values of `n`, `a`, `i`, and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is the next even integer, `s` is `s - 1`, `g` has the appended string representation and space character.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is the next even integer, `s` is `s - 1`, `g` has the appended string representation and space character**
