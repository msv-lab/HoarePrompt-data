Example Answer:
`s` is assigned the value of `b`, where `b` is an input integer. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is an input integer, `s` is the same as `b`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is an input integer, `s` is the same as `b`**
