Output State: **`n`, `a`, `b`, `i` are decreased by 3, `s` is 0, `g` is updated with the new string representation of `b` and `s` with four additional space characters appended to it. `s` is equal to half of `b`. `b` is still divisible by 2, `g` is updated with the string concatenation of the previous `g` value and the result of `s - 1`. For the loop to execute again `s` needs to be greater than 1 and `b` needs to be an odd number.**
