Example Answer:
`g` is assigned the value `g + ' '`, where `g` has the appended string representation and a space character. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is the next even integer, `s` is `s - 1`, `g` has the appended string representation and space character.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is the next even integer, `s` is `s - 1`, `g` has the appended string representation and space character**
