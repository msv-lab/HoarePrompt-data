Example Answer:
`g` is updated by concatenating the string representation of `s` at the end. As `s` is one less than the previous value, the new value of `g` will include the updated `s` at the end. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is greater than 1, `b` is the input integer which is even, `s` is one less than the previous value, `g` is the string representation of `b` with a space added at the end and updated to include the string representation of `s` at the end.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is greater than 1, `b` is the input integer which is even, `s` is one less than the previous value, `g` is the string representation of `b` with a space added at the end and updated to include the string representation of `s` at the end**
