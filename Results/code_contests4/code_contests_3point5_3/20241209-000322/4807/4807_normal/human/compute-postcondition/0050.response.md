Example Answer: 
The value of `s - 1` is appended to the string representation of `g`. The value of `s` is `s - 5`, so `s - 1` is `s - 6`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is the next odd integer, `s` is `s - 5`, `g` has the appended string representation and space character with `s - 6`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is the next odd integer, `s` is `s - 5`, `g` has the appended string representation and space character with `s - 6`**
