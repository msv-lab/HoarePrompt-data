Example Answer:
`g` is appended with a space character and the string representation of `s - 1`, where `s` is calculated as `b // 2 + 1`. The value of `s` depends on the value of `b`, which is an even integer. Since the initial state specifies that `b` is an input even integer, `s` can be calculated as `(b // 2) + 1`. After appending the space character and the string representation of `s - 1`, the final value of `g` is updated. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is an input even integer, `s` is decremented by 1 and calculated as `b // 2 + 1`, `g` is updated with appended string representation and space character.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is an input even integer, `s` is decremented by 1 and calculated as `b // 2 + 1`, `g` is updated with appended string representation and space character.**
