Postcondition: ***`n`, `a`, `i`, `b` remain the same. `s` is decremented by 1. `g` is added with the string representation of the decremented `s` if `s` is equal to `b // 2 + 1`. If `s` is not equal to 0, then the program continues without any change in the variables. If `s` is equal to 0, then the program exits the most internal loop or if statement.***
