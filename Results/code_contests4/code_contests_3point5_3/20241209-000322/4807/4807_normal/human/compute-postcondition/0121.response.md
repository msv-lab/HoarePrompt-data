According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `a`, the loop can execute one more time. In this case, `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, to execute the loop again, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than `a+1`. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`n`, `a`, `b`, `s`, `g` remain the same. `i` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute again `i` should be less than `a+1`**
