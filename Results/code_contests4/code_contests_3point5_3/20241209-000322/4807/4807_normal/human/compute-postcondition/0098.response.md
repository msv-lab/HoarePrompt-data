Example Answer:
`g` has a space character appended to it and added with the string representation of `s - 1`. Since `s` is decremented by 1 in the initial state, `g` will have a space character appended to it and added with the string representation of `s - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n`, `a`, `i`, `b` remain the same, `s` is decremented by 1, `g` has a space character appended to it and added with the string representation of `s - 1`**
