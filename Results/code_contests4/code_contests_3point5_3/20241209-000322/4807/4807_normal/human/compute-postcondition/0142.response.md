Example Answer:
The string variable `g` is updated by concatenating a space character to its current value. The previous value of `g` is the string representation of `b` and `s` with two additional space characters. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `a`, `b`, `i` are decreased by 3, `s` is decreased by 4, `g` is updated with the new string representation of `b` and `s` with two additional space characters appended to it, `b` is still divisible by 2, `s` is equal to half of `b` plus 1.
Output State: **`n`, `a`, `b`, `i` are decreased by 3, `s` is decreased by 4, `g` is updated with the new string representation of `b` and `s` with two additional space characters appended to it, `b` is still divisible by 2, `s` is equal to half of `b` plus 1**
