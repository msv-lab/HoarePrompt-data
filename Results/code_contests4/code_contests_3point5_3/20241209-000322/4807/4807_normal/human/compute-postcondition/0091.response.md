Postcondition: ***`n`, `a`, `i`, `b` are integers where `n` > 1, `a` > 0, `i` > 1, `b` is an even integer. `s` is 0, `g` is the string representation of `b` with spaces added at the end corresponding to the number of iterations of the loop with an additional space at the end. If `s` is equal to `b // 2 + 1`, the program completes successfully.***
