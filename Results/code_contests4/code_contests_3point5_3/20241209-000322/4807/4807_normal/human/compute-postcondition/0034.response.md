Example Answer:
`g` is assigned the value of `g` concatenated with the string representation of `s`. Since `s` is decremented by 1, the new value of `s` is decremented as well. The new value of `g` will be the previous value of `g` concatenated with the decremented value of `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is an input even integer, `s` is decremented by 1, `g` has the appended string representation and space character.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is an input even integer, `s` is decremented by 1, `g` has the appended string representation and space character**
