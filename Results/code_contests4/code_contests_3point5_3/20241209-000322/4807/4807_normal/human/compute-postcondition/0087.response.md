Example Answer:
The value of `s` is decremented by 2. However, since `s` is initially 0, after execution, `s` becomes -2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is greater than 1, `b` is the input integer which is even, `s` is -2, `g` is the string representation of `b` with spaces added at the end corresponding to the number of iterations of the loop with an additional space at the end.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is greater than 1, `b` is the input integer which is even, `s` is -2, `g` is the string representation of `b` with spaces added at the end corresponding to the number of iterations of the loop with an additional space at the end**
