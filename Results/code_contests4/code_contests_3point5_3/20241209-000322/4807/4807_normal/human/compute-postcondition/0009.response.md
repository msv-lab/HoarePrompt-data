Example Answer:
The value of `s` is decremented by 1. As `s` is greater than 1, after execution, `s` will be one less than its previous value. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is an input integer (even number), `s` is greater than 1 but one less than its previous value.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is an input integer (even number), `s` is greater than 1 but one less than its previous value**
