Example Answer:
`g` is assigned an empty string. The variables `n`, `a`, `i`, `b`, and `s` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is an input integer, `s` is the same as `b`, `g` is an empty string.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is an input integer, `s` is the same as `b`, `g` is an empty string**
