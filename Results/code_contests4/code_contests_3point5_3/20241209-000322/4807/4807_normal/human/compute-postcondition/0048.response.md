Example Answer: 
`s` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `s` is `s - 4`, so after execution, `s` is `s - 5`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is the next odd integer, `s` is `s - 5`, `g` has the appended string representation and space character.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is the next odd integer, `s` is `s - 5`, `g` has the appended string representation and space character**
