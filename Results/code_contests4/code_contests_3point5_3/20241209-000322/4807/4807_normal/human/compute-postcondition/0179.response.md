Example Answer:
`i` is increased by 1. The previous value of `i` is decreased by 3, so after execution, `i` is decreased by 2. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `a`, `b`, `i` are decreased by 3, `s` is 0, `g` is updated with the new string representation of `b` and `s` with six additional space characters appended to it, `b` is still divisible by 2.
Output State: **`n`, `a`, `b`, `i` are decreased by 3, `s` is 0, `g` is updated with the new string representation of `b` and `s` with six additional space characters appended to it, `b` is still divisible by 2, `i` is decreased by 2**
