Example Answer:
`s` is decremented by 2. The previous value of `s` is `s - 1`, so after execution, `s` becomes `s - 3`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is the next even integer, `s` is `s - 3`, `g` has the appended string representation and space character.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is the next even integer, `s` is `s - 3`, `g` has the appended string representation and space character**
