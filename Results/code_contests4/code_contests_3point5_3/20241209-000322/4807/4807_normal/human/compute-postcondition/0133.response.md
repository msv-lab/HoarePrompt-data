Example Answer:
`g` is updated by concatenating the string representation of `s` to it, which is decreased by 1. Additionally, a space character is appended to `g`. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `a`, `b`, `i` remain the same, `s` is decreased by 1, `g` is updated with the new string representation of `b` and `s`, `b` is still divisible by 2, `g` has an additional space character appended to it.
Output State: **`n`, `a`, `b`, `i` remain the same, `s` is decreased by 1, `g` is updated with the new string representation of `b` and `s`, `b` is still divisible by 2, `g` has an additional space character appended to it**
