Example Answer:
The variable `g` is assigned the value of `g` concatenated with a space character. Since `g` is the string representation of `b` and `b` is not changed in the provided code snippet, `g` will have a space character appended to its current value. All other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `a`, `b`, `i` remain the same, `s` is decremented by 1, `g` is the string representation of `b` with a space character added.
Output State: **`n`, `a`, `b`, `i` remain the same, `s` is decremented by 1, `g` is the string representation of `b` with a space character added**
