Example Answer: 
`g` has the space character appended to it and added with the string representation of `s - 1`, where `s` is decremented by 1. The previous values of `g` and `s` are unknown, so the output state is: `n`, `a`, `i`, `b` remain the same, `s` is decremented by 1, `g` has a space character appended to it and added with the string representation of `s - 1`.
Output State: **`n`, `a`, `i`, `b` remain the same, `s` is decremented by 1, `g` has a space character appended to it and added with the string representation of `s - 1`**
