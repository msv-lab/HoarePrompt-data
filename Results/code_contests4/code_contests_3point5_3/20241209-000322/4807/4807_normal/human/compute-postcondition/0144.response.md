Example Answer:
The value of `g` is updated by appending a space character to its current value. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `a`, `b`, `i` are decreased by 3, `s` is decreased by 4, `g` is updated with the new string representation of `b` and `s` with two additional space characters appended to it, `b` is still divisible by 2, `s` is equal to half of `b` plus 1, `g` is updated with the string concatenation of the previous `g` value and the result of `s - 1`.
Output State: **`n`, `a`, `b`, `i` are decreased by 3, `s` is decreased by 4, `g` is updated with the new string representation of `b` and `s` with four additional space characters appended to it, `b` is still divisible by 2, `s` is equal to half of `b` plus 1, `g` is updated with the string concatenation of the previous `g` value and the result of `s - 1.**
