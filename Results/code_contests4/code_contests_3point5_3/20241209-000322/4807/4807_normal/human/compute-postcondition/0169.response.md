Output State: **`n`, `a`, `b`, `i` are decreased by 3, `s` has four additional space characters appended to it and is equal to half of `b` with 2 subtracted, `b` is still divisible by 2, `g` is updated with the new string representation of `b` and concatenation of the previous `g` value and `s - 1`, for the loop to execute again `s - 1` is greater than 0 and `b` is an odd number, `s` is decreased by 1, `g` has one additional space character appended to it.**
