Example Answer:
The value of `g` is updated by concatenating the string representation of `s` at the end. Since `s` is decremented by 1, the new value of `s` is one less than the initial value. The string representation of `b` with a space character added is stored in `g`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `a`, `b`, `i` remain the same, `s` is one less than the initial value, `g` is updated with the new string representation of `b` and `s`.
Output State: **`n`, `a`, `b`, `i` remain the same, `s` is one less than the initial value, `g` is updated with the new string representation of `b` and `s`**
