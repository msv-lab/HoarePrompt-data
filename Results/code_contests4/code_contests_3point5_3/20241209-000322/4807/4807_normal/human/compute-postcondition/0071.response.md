According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `b`. If `s - 1` is greater than 0 and `b` is even, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is equal to `b - 1`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `s` needs to be updated to be greater than 1. Also, `b` is even, so `b` does not need to be adjusted. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is greater than 1, `b` is the input integer which is even, `s` is greater than 1, `g` is the string representation of `b` with a space added at the end, `g` is updated to include the string representation of `s` at the end**
