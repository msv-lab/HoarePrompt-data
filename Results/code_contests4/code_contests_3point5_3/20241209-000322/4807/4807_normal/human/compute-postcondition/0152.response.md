Example Answer:
`g` is updated with the string concatenation of the previous `g` value and the result of `s - 1`. The value of `s` is equal to half of `b` plus 1, so `s - 1` is calculated. The value of `b` is still divisible by 2 after being decreased by 3. The string representation of `b` is updated in variable `g`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `a`, `b`, `i` are decreased by 3, `s` is 0, `g` is updated with the new string representation of `b` and `s` with four additional space characters appended to it. `s` is equal to half of `b` plus 1. `b` is still divisible by 2, `g` is updated with the string concatenation of the previous `g` value and the result of `s - 1`.
