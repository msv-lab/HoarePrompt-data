Example Answer:
The string variable `g` is concatenated with a space ' '. The previous value of `g` is unknown, so after execution, `g` will have a space appended to it. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is an input integer (even number), `s` is greater than 1 but one less than its previous value, `g` has a space appended to it.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is an input integer (even number), `s` is greater than 1 but one less than its previous value, `g` has a space appended to it**
