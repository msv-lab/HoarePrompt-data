Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is an input even integer, `s` is decremented by 1. If `s` is equal to `b // 2 + 1`, then `s` is updated to `b // 2`, and `g` is updated with the appended string representation and space character. Additionally, after entering the if condition (s == 0), `s` is equal to 0 and `g` has the appended string representation and space character of the even integer `b` divided by 2.***
