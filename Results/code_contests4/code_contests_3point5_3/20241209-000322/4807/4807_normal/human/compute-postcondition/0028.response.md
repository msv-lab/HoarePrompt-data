Example Answer:
`s` is decremented by 2, where `s` was previously calculated as `b // 2 + 1`. The value of `b` is an even integer, so the updated value of `s` would be `b // 2 - 1 + 1 = b // 2`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is an input even integer, `s` is updated to `b // 2`, `g` is updated with appended string representation and space character.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is an input even integer, `s` is updated to `b // 2`, `g` is updated with appended string representation and space character**
