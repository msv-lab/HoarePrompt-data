Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is greater than 1, `b` is the input integer which is even. For the loop to execute the first time, `s` is 0 and `g` is the string representation of `b` with spaces added at the end corresponding to the number of iterations of the loop. After entering the if condition `s` is equal to `b // 2 + 1`***
