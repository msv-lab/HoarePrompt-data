Example Answer:
The value of `g` is updated by concatenating the string representation of `b`. Since `g` was initially an empty string and `b` remains the same, the new value of `g` will be the string representation of `b`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `a`, `b`, `s` remain the same, `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is assigned the value of `b`, `g` is the string representation of `b`.
Output State: **`n`, `a`, `b`, `s` remain the same, `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is assigned the value of `b`, `g` is the string representation of `b`**
