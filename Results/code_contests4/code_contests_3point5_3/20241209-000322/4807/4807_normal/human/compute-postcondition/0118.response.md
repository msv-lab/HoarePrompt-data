Output State: **`n`, `a`, `i`, `b` remain the same. `s` is 0, `g` is the string representation of `b` with spaces added at the end corresponding to the number of iterations of the loop with an additional space at the end. If `s` is equal to `b // 2 + 1`, the program completes successfully. `g` is updated by appending the string representation of `s`.**
