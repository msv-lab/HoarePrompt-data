Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `a`, `b`, `s`, `g` remain the same. `i` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute again `i` should be less than `a+1`, `b` is an input integer.
Output State: **`n`, `a`, `b`, `s`, `g` remain the same. `i` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute again `i` should be less than `a+1`, `b` is an input integer**
