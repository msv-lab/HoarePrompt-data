Output State: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is the next even integer, `s` is `s - 3`, `g` has the appended string representation and space character. If `s` equals 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `g` has been appended with a space character.
