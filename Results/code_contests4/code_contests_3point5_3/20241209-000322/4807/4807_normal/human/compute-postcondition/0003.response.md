According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `a`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, and `i` is 0. For the loop to execute the first time, `a` needs to be greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0**
