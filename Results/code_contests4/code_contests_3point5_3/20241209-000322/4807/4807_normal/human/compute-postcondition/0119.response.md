Example Answer:
The `print` function outputs the value of `g` which contains the string representation of `b` with spaces added at the end based on the number of iterations of the loop. No variables are modified by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `a`, `i`, `b` remain the same. `s` is 0, `g` is the string representation of `b` with spaces added at the end corresponding to the number of iterations of the loop with an additional space at the end.
Output State: **`n`, `a`, `i`, `b` remain the same. `s` is 0, `g` is the string representation of `b` with spaces added at the end corresponding to the number of iterations of the loop with an additional space at the end.**
