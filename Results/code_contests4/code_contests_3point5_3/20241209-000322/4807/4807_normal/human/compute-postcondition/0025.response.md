Example Answer:
The value of `s` is calculated as `b // 2 + 1`, where `b` is an even input integer. Then `s` is decremented by 1. The value of `g` is appended with the string representation of `s - 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is an input even integer, `s` is decremented by 1 and calculated as `b // 2 + 1`, `g` is appended with a space character and the string representation of `s - 1`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is an input even integer, `s` is decremented by 1 and calculated as `b // 2 + 1`, `g` is appended with a space character and the string representation of `s - 1`**
