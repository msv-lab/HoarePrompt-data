Example Answer:
`g` is concatenated with a space at the end. The previous value of `g` contains spaces corresponding to the iterations of the loop. After execution, `g` will have an additional space at the end. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is greater than 1, `b` is the input integer which is even, `s` is 0, `g` is the string representation of `b` with spaces added at the end corresponding to the number of iterations of the loop with an additional space at the end.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is greater than 1, `b` is the input integer which is even, `s` is 0, `g` is the string representation of `b` with spaces added at the end corresponding to the number of iterations of the loop with an additional space at the end**
