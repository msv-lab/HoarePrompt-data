Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the value `int(input())`. The value of `b` is changed to the input integer. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is greater than 1, `b` is the input integer, `s` is 0, `g` is a string containing spaces and numbers from `b` to 1 concatenated in descending order with additional spaces and numbers appended based on the conditions in the loop.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is greater than 1, `b` is the input integer, `s` is 0, `g` is a string containing spaces and numbers from `b` to 1 concatenated in descending order with additional spaces and numbers appended based on the conditions in the loop**
