Example Answer: 
`g` is updated by appending the string representation of `s` to it. The value of `s` is calculated as `b // 2 + 1`, where `b` is an even input integer. Therefore, `s` will be an integer value. The previous values of the other variables do not change. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is an input even integer, `s` is decremented by 1 and calculated as `b // 2 + 1`, `g` is updated with appended string representation and space character.**
