Example Answer:
The code appends the string representation of `s` to the variable `g`. Since the value of `s` is `s - 2`, the appended string will be the original `s - 2`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is the next odd integer, `s` is `s - 2`, `g` has the appended string representation and space character with `s - 6`, `g` is appended with a space character, `g` is appended with the string representation of `s`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is the next odd integer, `s` is `s - 2`, `g` has the appended string representation and space character with `s - 6`, `g` is appended with a space character, `g` is appended with the string representation of `s`**
