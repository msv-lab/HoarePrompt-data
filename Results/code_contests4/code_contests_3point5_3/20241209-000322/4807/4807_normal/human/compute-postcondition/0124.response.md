Example Answer:
`g` is assigned an empty string. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `s` remain the same. `i` is incremented by 1, and `s` is assigned the value of `b`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `a`, `b`, `s` remain the same, `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is assigned the value of `b`, `g` is an empty string.
Output State: **`n`, `a`, `b`, `s` remain the same, `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is assigned the value of `b`, `g` is an empty string**
