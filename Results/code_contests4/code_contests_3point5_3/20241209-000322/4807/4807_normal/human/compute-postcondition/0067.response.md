According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `b`. If `s - 1` is greater than 0 and `b` is divisible by 2, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `s` is equal to `b` and `b` is the input integer. So, for the loop to execute the first time, `b` must be an even number. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is greater than 1, `b` is the input integer which is even, `s` is equal to `b`, `g` is the string representation of `b`**
