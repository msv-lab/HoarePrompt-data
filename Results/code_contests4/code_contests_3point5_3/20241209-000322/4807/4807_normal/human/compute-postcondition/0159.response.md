The value of `s` is decreased by 2. The previous value of `s` had four additional space characters appended to it and was equal to half of `b`. Therefore, the new value of `s` will be half of the previous `b` value with 2 subtracted from it. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `i` remain decreased by 3. `b` is still divisible by 2. `g` is updated with the new string representation of `b` and the concatenation of the previous `g` value and `s - 1`.
Output State: **`n`, `a`, `b`, `i` are decreased by 3, `s` has four additional space characters appended to it and is equal to half of `b` with 2 subtracted, `b` is still divisible by 2, `g` is updated with the new string representation of `b` and concatenation of the previous `g` value and `s - 1`**
