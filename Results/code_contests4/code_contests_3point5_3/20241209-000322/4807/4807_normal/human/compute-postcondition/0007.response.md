Example Answer:
`g` is concatenated with the string representation of `b`, where `b` is the input integer. Therefore, the value of `g` will be the string representation of `b`. The other variables remain unaffected. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is an input integer, `s` is the same as `b`, `g` is the string representation of `b`**
