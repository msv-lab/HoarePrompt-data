Example Answer:
The value of `g` is updated by appending the result of `s - 1` converted to a string. The previous value of `g` has a space character appended to it, `s` is decremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `a`, `i`, `b` remain the same, `s` is decremented by 1, `g` has a space character appended to it and added with the string representation of `s - 1`.
Output State: **`n`, `a`, `i`, `b` remain the same, `s` is decremented by 1, `g` has a space character appended to it and added with the string representation of `s - 1`**
