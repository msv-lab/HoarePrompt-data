Example Answer: 
`g` is assigned the value `g + ' '`, where `' '` is a space character. The value of `g` remains the same, so after execution, `g` will have a space character appended to it. The values of `n`, `a`, `i`, `b` remain the same, `s` is decremented by 1, and the Output State is: `n`, `a`, `i`, `b` remain the same, `s` is decremented by 1, `g` has a space character appended to it.
Output State: **`n`, `a`, `i`, `b` remain the same, `s` is decremented by 1, `g` has a space character appended to it**
