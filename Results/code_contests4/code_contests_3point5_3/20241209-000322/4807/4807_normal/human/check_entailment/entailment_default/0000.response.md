Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The output hints mention that the code should print a permutation such that there is no index i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) such that p_i = i. However, the code does not seem to be generating such permutations. The logic in the code seems to be focused on generating a sequence of numbers based on some conditions related to the input number, but it does not guarantee a permutation where p_i ≠ i for all i from 1 to n. Therefore, the code is incorrect based on the problem description.
