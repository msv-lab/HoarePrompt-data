The function `func` reads an integer `a` as input and then reads `a` more integers. For each integer `b`, it prints a string `g` that starts from `b` and then appends numbers in descending order based on specific conditions. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly, and it seems to be designed to process a sequence of integers. However, the annotations mention a parameter `n` that is not utilized in the code. The function lacks a specific return value.
