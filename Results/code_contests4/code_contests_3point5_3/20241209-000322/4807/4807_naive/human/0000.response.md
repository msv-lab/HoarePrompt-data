Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program takes an integer `t` as the number of test cases, then for each test case it takes an integer `n`. The program then generates a permutation `p` of length `n` such that there is no index `i` such that `p_i = i`. The program generates the permutation correctly by following the conditions specified in the problem description. It handles both even and odd values of `n` and provides a valid permutation for each test case. Since the program generates the required output as per the problem description for all possible test cases, the correctness of the program is true.
