Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for n, k, and w_i.
2. It calculates the total sum of weights and the maximum weight among the packages.
3. It then uses binary search to find the minimum value of the maximum load P to load all packages onto k trucks.
4. The program iterates through different loadings and checks if the number of trucks required is less than or equal to k.
5. It updates the minimum value of P accordingly based on the binary search algorithm.
6. The program covers all potential cases where the weights of the packages need to be loaded onto k trucks while ensuring that the total weight does not exceed P.
