According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `left` is less than or equal to `right`. 

Right before the loop, `left` is assigned the value of `maxW` and `right` is 100000 * 10000. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `left` needs to be less than or equal to `right`. 

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `left` to be less than or equal to `right`.
State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers, `w` is a list with `n` elements, `maxW` is the maximum value in the list `w`, `sumW` is the sum of all elements in `w`, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `num` is the last input value entered, `minP` is 0, the condition (1 == k) is false, `n` is not equal to `k`, for the loop to execute the first time `left` is less than or equal to `right`, `right` is 100000 * 10000**
