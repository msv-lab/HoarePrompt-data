According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `k` are positive integers, `w` is a list with at least three elements (including the newly appended `num`), `maxW` is less than or equal to `num`, `sumW` is the value of `num` added to the previous value, `i` is 1, `num` is assigned the value of the input converted to an integer using `int(raw_input())`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers, `w` is a list with at least three elements (including the newly appended `num`), `maxW` is less than or equal to `num`, `sumW` is the value of `num` added to the previous value, `i` is 2, `num` is assigned the value of the input converted to an integer using `int(raw_input())`. If `maxW` < `num`, then `maxW` is updated to `num`, otherwise no change**.
