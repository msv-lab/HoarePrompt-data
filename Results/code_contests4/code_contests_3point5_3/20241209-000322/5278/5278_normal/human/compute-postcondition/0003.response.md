According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `maxW` and `sumW` being 0 indicates that the loop can execute. However, since `w` is an empty list, it needs to be adjusted such that there is at least one element in the list for the loop to execute. Additionally, `i` starts at 0 when the loop begins.
State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers, `w` is a list with at least one element, `maxW` and `sumW` are both 0, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
