Example Answer:
The value of `truckCnt` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `truckCnt` is unknown, so after execution, `truckCnt` is increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `loadings` is the previous value of `loadings` plus the value at index `i` in list `w`, the value of `middle` is less than `loadings`, `truckCnt` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`loadings` is the previous value of `loadings` plus the value at index `i` in list `w`, the value of `middle` is less than `loadings`, `truckCnt` is incremented by 1**
