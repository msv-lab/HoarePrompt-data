Postcondition: ***loadings, middle, truckCnt, k, i, w, minP, left, right are all updated variables. The loop continues to execute until i is equal to n. If middle is less than loadings, then loadings is assigned the value at index i in list w, middle is less than loadings, truckCnt is incremented by 1. If k is less than truckCnt + 1, the loop breaks out. If (k < truckCnt + 1) is true, left is assigned the value of middle + 1. If false, right is assigned the value of middle - 1. Additionally, truckCnt + 1 is less than or equal to k.***
