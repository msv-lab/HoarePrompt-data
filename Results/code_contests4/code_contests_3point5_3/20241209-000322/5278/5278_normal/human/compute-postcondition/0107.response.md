Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, the variables `loadings`, `middle`, `truckCnt`, `k`, `i`, `w`, `minP`, `left`, `right` are all updated. The loop will continue to execute until `i` is equal to `n`. If `middle` is less than `loadings`, then `loadings` is assigned the value at index `i` in list `w`, `middle` is less than `loadings`, `truckCnt` is incremented by 1. If `k` is less than `truckCnt + 1`, the loop breaks out. If `(k < truckCnt + 1)` is true, `left` is assigned the value of `middle + 1`. If false, `right` is assigned the value of `middle - 1`. Additionally, `truckCnt + 1` is less than or equal to `k`. `minP` is assigned the value of `middle`. If `k < truckCnt + 1`, then `left` is updated to `middle + 1`. If `k >= truckCnt + 1`, then `right` is updated to `middle - 1`.***
