Example Answer:
The value of `truckCnt` is incremented by 1. The previous values of the other variables are not provided, so the output state is: `loadings`, `middle`, `truckCnt`, `k`, `i`, `w` are all updated variables and `loadings` is incremented by the value of `w[i]`. `truckCnt` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`loadings`, `middle`, `truckCnt`, `k`, `i`, `w` are all updated variables and `loadings` is incremented by the value of `w[i]`. `truckCnt` is incremented by 1**
