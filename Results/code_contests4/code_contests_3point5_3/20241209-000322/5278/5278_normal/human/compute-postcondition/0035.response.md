According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer. Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented and set to 1.
State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers, `w` is a list with `n` elements, `maxW` is the maximum value in the list `w`, `sumW` is the sum of all elements in `w`, `i` is equal to 1, `num` is the last input value entered, `minP` is 0, the condition (1 == k) is false, `n` is not equal to `k`, for the loop to execute the first time `left` is less than or equal to `right`, `right` is 100000 * 10000, `middle` is calculated as the floor division of the sum of `left` and `right`, `truckCnt` is 0, `i` is 1, `loadings` is 0**
