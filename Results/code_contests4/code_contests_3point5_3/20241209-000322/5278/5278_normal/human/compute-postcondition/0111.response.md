According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is 0. `n` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact condition for the loop to execute. Therefore, we need to adjust `n` to be a specific integer value such that `i` being less than `n` allows the loop to execute at least once. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`truckCnt` is 0, `i` is 0, `loadings` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` needs to be a specific integer value**
