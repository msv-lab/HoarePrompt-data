According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `k` are positive integers, `w` is a list with at least two elements (including the newly appended `num`), `maxW` is less than or equal to `num`, `sumW` is the value of `num`, `i` is 0, `num` is assigned the value of the input converted to an integer using `int(raw_input())`, `maxW` is equal to `num`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers, `w` is a list with at least two elements (including the newly appended `num`), `maxW` is less than or equal to `num`, `sumW` is the value of `num`, `i` is 1, `num` is assigned the value of the input converted to an integer using `int(raw_input())`, `maxW` is equal to `num`**
