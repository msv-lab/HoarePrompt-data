Output State: **`n`, `k`, `w`, `maxW`, `sumW`, `i`, `num`, `minP`, `left`, `right`, `middle`, `truckCnt` are positive integers, `w` is a list with `n` elements. `loadings` is the sum of the elements at index 2 and all previous indices in list `w`. Initially, `loadings` is assigned the value at index 2 in list `w`, and it is increased by the value at index 2 in list `w`. If `middle` is less than `loadings`, then the program assigns `loadings` the value of `w[i]`. `i` is increased by 1.**
