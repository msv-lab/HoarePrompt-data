Example Answer:
`maxW` and `sumW` are both initialized to 0. The previous values of `n`, `k`, and `w` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are positive integers, `w` is an empty list, `maxW` and `sumW` are both 0.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers, `w` is an empty list, `maxW` and `sumW` are both 0**
