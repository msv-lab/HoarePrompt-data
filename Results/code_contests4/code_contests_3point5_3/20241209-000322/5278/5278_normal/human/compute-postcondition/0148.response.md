Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers, `w` is a list with `n` elements, `maxW` is the maximum value in the list `w`, `sumW` is the sum of all elements in `w`, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `num` is the last input value entered, `minP` will be equal to `sumW` if `k` is equal to 1. Otherwise, if `n` is not equal to `k`, `minP` is assigned the maximum value in the list `w`. If `k` is less than `truckCnt + 1`, then `left` is assigned `middle + 1`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `truckCnt + 1`, then `right` is assigned `middle - 1`.***
