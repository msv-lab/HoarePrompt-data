Postcondition: ***`truckCnt` is the number of trucks needed to carry the items, `i` is equal to `n`, `loadings` is the sum of all values in `w`, `n` is a specific integer value, `middle` is less than `loadings`, `k` is less than `truckCnt + 1`, `minP` is equal to `middle`. If `truckCnt + 1 <= k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Additionally, `k` is less than `truckCnt + 1`***
