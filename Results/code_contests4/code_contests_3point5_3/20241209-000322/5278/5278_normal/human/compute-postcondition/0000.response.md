Example Answer:
The values of `n` and `k` are assigned based on the input values obtained by splitting the raw_input. Since the values of `n` and `k` are not defined in the initial state, we can only say that `n` and `k` are positive integers. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are positive integers.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers**
