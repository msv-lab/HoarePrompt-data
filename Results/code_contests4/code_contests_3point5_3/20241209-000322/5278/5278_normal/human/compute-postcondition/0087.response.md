Postcondition: ***`loadings` is the updated value after adding the value at index `n` in list `w`, `middle` is less than the updated `loadings`, `truckCnt` is incremented by 1, `k` is greater than or equal to `truckCnt + 1`, `i` is less than `n`, `loadings` is further increased by the value at index `i` in list `w`, `truckCnt` is incremented by 1. If `k` is less than `truckCnt + 1`, the loop is broken out of.***
