Example Answer:
`truckCnt` is incremented by 1, so after execution, `truckCnt` becomes 2. The values of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `truckCnt` is 2, `i` is 1, `loadings` is the sum of values in `w` at index 0 plus the value of `w` at index 1, `n` is a specific integer value, `middle` is less than `loadings`, for the loop to execute again `n` is greater than 1.
Output State: **`truckCnt` is 2, `i` is 1, `loadings` is the sum of values in `w` at index 0 plus the value of `w` at index 1, `n` is a specific integer value, `middle` is less than `loadings`, for the loop to execute again `n` is greater than 1**
