The value of `minP` is assigned 0. The previous values of the affected variables are as follows: `n` and `k` are positive integers, `w` is a list with `n` elements, `maxW` is the maximum value in the list `w`, `sumW` is the sum of all elements in `w`, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `num` is the last input value entered. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are positive integers, `w` is a list with `n` elements, `maxW` is the maximum value in the list `w`, `sumW` is the sum of all elements in `w`, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `num` is the last input value entered, `minP` is 0.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers, `w` is a list with `n` elements, `maxW` is the maximum value in the list `w`, `sumW` is the sum of all elements in `w`, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `num` is the last input value entered, `minP` is 0**
