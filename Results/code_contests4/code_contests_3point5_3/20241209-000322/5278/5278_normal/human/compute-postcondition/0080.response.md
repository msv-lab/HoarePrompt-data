Example Answer:
The value at index `i` in list `w` is assigned to `loadings`. The previous value of `loadings` is added to the value at index `i` in list `w`. The value of `middle` being less than `loadings` remains the same. `truckCnt` is incremented by 1. If `k` is less than `truckCnt + 1`, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `loadings` is the value at index `i` in list `w` added to the previous `loadings`, `middle` is less than `loadings`, `truckCnt` is incremented by 1. If `k` is less than `truckCnt + 1`, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State: **`loadings` is the value at index `i` in list `w` added to the previous `loadings`, `middle` is less than `loadings`, `truckCnt` is incremented by 1. If `k` is less than `truckCnt + 1`, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
