Postcondition: ***`truckCnt` is 2, `i` is 1, `loadings` is the sum of values in `w` at index 0 plus the value of `w` at index 1, `n` is a specific integer value, `middle` is less than `loadings`, for the loop to execute again `n` is greater than 1. If `k` is less than `truckCnt + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
