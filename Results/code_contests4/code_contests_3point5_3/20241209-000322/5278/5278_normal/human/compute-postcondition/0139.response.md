Example Answer:
`minP` is assigned the value of `middle`. The value of `middle` is less than `loadings` and `loadings` is the sum of all values in `w`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `truckCnt` is the number of trucks needed to carry the items, `i` is equal to `n`, `loadings` is the sum of all values in `w`, `n` is a specific integer value, `middle` is less than `loadings`, `k` is less than `truckCnt + 1, `minP` is equal to `middle`.
Output State: **`truckCnt` is the number of trucks needed to carry the items, `i` is equal to `n`, `loadings` is the sum of all values in `w`, `n` is a specific integer value, `middle` is less than `loadings`, `k` is less than `truckCnt + 1, `minP` is equal to `middle`**
