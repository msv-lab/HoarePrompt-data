Example Answer:
`loadings` is incremented by the value of `w` at index 2. The previous value of `loadings` is the value of `w` at index 1. Therefore, after execution, `loadings` will be the sum of the previous value of `loadings` and the value of `w` at index 2. Other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`truckCnt` is 2, `i` is 2, `loadings` is the sum of the previous value of `loadings` and the value of `w` at index 2, `n` is a specific integer value, `middle` is less than `loadings`, for the loop to execute again `n` is greater than 2**
