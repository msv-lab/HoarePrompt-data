Example Answer:
The value of `loadings` is assigned the value of `w[i]`, where `i` represents the index of the weight array `w`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged unless specified otherwise. Therefore, the Output State is: *n, k, w, maxW, sumW, i, num, minP, left, right, middle, truckCnt have their initial values, and `loadings` is assigned the value of `w[i]`.
Output State: ***n, k, w, maxW, sumW, i, num, minP, left, right, middle, truckCnt have their initial values, and `loadings` is assigned the value of `w[i]***.
