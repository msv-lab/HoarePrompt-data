According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is a specific integer value. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` needs to be greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`truckCnt` is 1, `i` is 1, `loadings` is the sum of values in `w` at index 0, `n` is a specific integer value, `middle` is less than `loadings`, for the loop to execute again `n` is greater than 1**
