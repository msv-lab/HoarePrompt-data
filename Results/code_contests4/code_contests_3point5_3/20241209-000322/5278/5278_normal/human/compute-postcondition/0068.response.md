Output State: **`n`, `k`, `w`, `maxW`, `sumW`, `i`, `num`, `middle`, `truckCnt`, `loadings`, `minP` are positive integers, `w` is a list with `n` elements. `loadings` is the sum of the elements at index `n-1` and all previous indices in list `w`. If `middle` is less than `loadings`, then the program assigns `loadings` the value of `w[i]`. `i` is equal to `n`, and `truckCnt` contains the number of times the condition `middle < loadings` was true during the loop execution. Additionally, `truckCnt + 1` is less than or equal to `k`. `minP` is assigned the value of `middle`. The condition `(k < truckCnt + 1)` is false, therefore the program does not enter the if block and instead enters the else block. `right` is assigned the value of `middle - 1**.
