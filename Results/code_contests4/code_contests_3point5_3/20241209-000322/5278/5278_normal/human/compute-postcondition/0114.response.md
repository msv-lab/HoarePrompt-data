Example Answer:
`truckCnt` is incremented by 1, so after execution, `truckCnt` becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `truckCnt` is 1, `i` is 0, `loadings` is the sum of values in `w` at index 0, `n` is a specific integer value, `middle` is less than `loadings`.
Output State: **`truckCnt` is 1, `i` is 0, `loadings` is the sum of values in `w` at index 0, `n` is a specific integer value, `middle` is less than `loadings`**
