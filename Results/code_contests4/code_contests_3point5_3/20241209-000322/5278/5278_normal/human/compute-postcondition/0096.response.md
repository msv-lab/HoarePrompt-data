Output State: **`loadings` is updated with the value of `w[i]`, `middle`, `truckCnt`, `k`, `i`, `w` are all updated variables. If k < truckCnt + 1, `loadings` is incremented by the value of `w[i]`, `truckCnt` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes occur.**
