According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. Right before the loop, `i` is equal to `n` which means the loop has already executed at least once. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, no states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n`, `k`, `w`, `maxW`, `sumW`, `i`, `num`, `middle`, `truckCnt`, `loadings`, `minP` are positive integers, `w` is a list with `n` elements, `loadings` is the sum of the elements at index `n-1` and all previous indices in list `w`, `middle` is less than `loadings`, `truckCnt + 1` is less than or equal to `k`, `minP` is assigned the value of `middle`, if `(k < truckCnt + 1)` is true then `left` is assigned the value of `middle + 1`, if `(k < truckCnt + 1)` is false then `right` is assigned the value of `middle - 1**
