Postcondition: ***`truckCnt` is 3, `i` is 2, `loadings` is the sum of the previous value of `loadings` and the value of `w` at index 2, `n` is a specific integer value, `middle` is less than `loadings`, for the loop to execute again `n` is greater than 2. If k is less than `truckCnt + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
