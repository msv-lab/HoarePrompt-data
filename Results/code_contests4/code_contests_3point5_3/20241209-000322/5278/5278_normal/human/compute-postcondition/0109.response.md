Example Answer:
`middle` is assigned the value of the floor division of the sum of `left` and `right`. The values of `left` and `right` are updated from the previous iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: After the execution of the if-else block, the variables `loadings`, `middle`, `truckCnt`, `k`, `i`, `w`, `minP`, `left`, `right` are all updated, for the loop to execute again `left` <= `right`, and `middle` is calculated based on the updated values of `left` and `right`.
