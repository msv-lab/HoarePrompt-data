Example Answer:
`sumW` is incremented by the value of `num`, and `num` is the input integer. Therefore, after execution, `sumW` will have the value of `num` added to it. The other variables remain the same. 
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers, `w` is a list with at least two elements (including the newly appended `num`), `maxW` is less than or equal to `num`, `sumW` is the value of `num` added to the previous value, `i` is 1, `num` is assigned the value of the input converted to an integer using `int(raw_input())`, `maxW` is equal to `num`, `num` is the input integer**
