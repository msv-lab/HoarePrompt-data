Example Answer:
The value of `loadings` is incremented by the value at index `i` in list `w`. The previous values of `loadings` and `w[i]` are known, so after execution, the new value of `loadings` is the previous value of `loadings` plus the value at index `i` in list `w`. Therefore, the Output State is: `loadings` is the previous value of `loadings` plus the value at index `i` in list `w`.
Output State: **`loadings` is the previous value of `loadings` plus the value at index `i` in list `w**`.
