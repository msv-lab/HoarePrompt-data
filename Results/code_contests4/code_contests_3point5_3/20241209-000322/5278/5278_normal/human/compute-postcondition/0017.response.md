Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers, `w` is a list with at least three elements (including the newly appended `num`), `maxW` is less than or equal to `num`, `sumW` is the value of `num` added to the previous value, `i` is 2, `num` is assigned the value of the input converted to an integer using `int(raw_input())`. If `maxW` < `num`, then `maxW` is updated to `num`, otherwise no change**
