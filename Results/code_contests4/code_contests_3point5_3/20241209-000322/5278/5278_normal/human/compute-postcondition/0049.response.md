Postcondition: ***`n`, `k` are positive integers, `w` is a list with `n` elements, `maxW` is the maximum value in the list `w`, `sumW` is the sum of all elements in `w`, `i` is 2, `num` is the last input value entered, `minP` is 0, the condition (1 == k) is false, `n` is not equal to `k`, for the loop to execute the first time `left` is less than or equal to `right`, `right` is 100000 * 10000, `middle` is calculated as the floor division of the sum of `left` and `right`, `truckCnt` is 2, `i` is 2, `loadings` is the sum of the elements at index 2 and all previous indices in list `w, `loadings` is increased by the value at index 2 in list `w, if k < truckCnt + 1, then the program does not enter the if block.***
