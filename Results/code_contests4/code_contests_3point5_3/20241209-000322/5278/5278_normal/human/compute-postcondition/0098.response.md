Output State: **`loadings`, `middle`, `truckCnt`, `k`, `i`, `w` are all updated variables and `loadings` is incremented by the value of `w[i]`. If `middle` < `loadings` and `k` < `truckCnt` + 1, `loadings` is incremented by the value of `w[i]`, `truckCnt` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes occur. `i` is incremented by 1.**
