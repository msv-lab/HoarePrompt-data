Postcondition: ***`n`, `k` are positive integers, `w` is a list with `n` elements, `maxW` is the maximum value in the list `w`, `sumW` is the sum of all elements in `w`, `i` is equal to 1, `num` is the last input value entered, `minP` is 0, the condition (1 == k) is false, `n` is not equal to `k`, for the loop to execute the first time `left` is less than or equal to `right`, `right` is 100000 * 10000, `middle` is calculated as the floor division of the sum of `left` and `right`, `truckCnt` is 1, `i` is 1, `loadings` is the sum of the elements at index 1 and all previous indices in list `w`. If `middle` is less than `loadings`, then `middle` is updated to the floor division of the sum of `left` and `right`, `truckCnt` is increased by 1, and `loadings` is updated to the value of the element at index `i` in list `w`.***
