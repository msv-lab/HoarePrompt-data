Correctness: **True**

The program reads the input values for $n$, $k$, and $w_i$ correctly and calculates the minimum value of the maximum load $P$ to load all packages from the belt conveyor. It uses a binary search to efficiently find the minimum value of $P$.

The program ensures that each truck can load consecutive packages from the belt conveyor as long as the total weight of the packages in the sequence does not exceed the maximum load $P$. It handles all the constraints mentioned in the problem description and correctly calculates the minimum value of $P$ to satisfy the requirements.

Therefore, the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and is correct.
