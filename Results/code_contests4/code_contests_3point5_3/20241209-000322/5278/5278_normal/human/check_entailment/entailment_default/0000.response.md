Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The issue lies in the binary search logic implemented to determine the minimum value of the maximum load $P$ to load all packages from the belt conveyor. The binary search algorithm used in the code does not handle all edge cases correctly.

For example, if we consider the input:
```
4 2
1
2
2
6
```
The expected output should be 6, as the minimum value of $P$ to load all packages is 6. However, the code does not produce the correct output for this case.

Therefore, based on the provided example and the problem description, the code is incorrect.
