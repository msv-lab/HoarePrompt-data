Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It reads the input values, calculates the minimum value of the maximum load $P$ to load all packages from the belt conveyor, and uses binary search to efficiently determine this value. The program covers all possible scenarios based on the constraints provided and ensures that the minimum value of $P$ is calculated accurately. Overall, the program follows the problem description and provides the correct output for any valid input.
