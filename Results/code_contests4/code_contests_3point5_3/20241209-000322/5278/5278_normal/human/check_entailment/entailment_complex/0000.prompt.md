You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given $n$ packages of $w_i$ kg from a belt conveyor in order ($i = 0, 1, ... n-1$). You should load all packages onto $k$ trucks which have the common maximum load $P$. Each truck can load consecutive packages (more than or equals to zero) from the belt conveyor unless the total weights of the packages in the sequence does not exceed the maximum load $P$.

Write a program which reads $n$, $k$ and $w_i$, and reports the minimum value of the maximum load $P$ to load all packages from the belt conveyor.

Constraints

* $1 \leq n \leq 100,000$
* $1 \leq k \leq 100,000$
* $1 \leq w_i \leq 10,000$

Input

In the first line, two integers $n$ and $k$ are given separated by a space character. In the following $n$ lines, $w_i$ are given respectively.

Output

Print the minimum value of $P$ in a line.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100,000 and 1 <= k <= 100,000. Each w_i is a positive integer such that 1 <= w_i <= 10,000.**
def func():
    n, k = [int(val) for val in raw_input().split(' ')]
    w = []
    maxW = sumW = 0
    for i in range(n):
        num = int(raw_input())
        
        sumW += num
        
        w.append(num)
        
        if maxW < num:
            maxW = num
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` and `k` are positive integers, `w` is a list with `n` elements, `maxW` is the maximum value in the list `w`, `sumW` is the sum of all elements in `w`, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `num` is the last input value entered
    minP = 0
    if (1 == k) :
        minP = sumW
    else :
        if (n == k) :
            minP = maxW
        else :
            left = maxW
            right = 100000 * 10000
            while left <= right:
                middle = (left + right) // 2
                
                truckCnt = i = loadings = 0
                
                while i < n:
                    loadings += w[i]
                    if middle < loadings:
                        truckCnt += 1
                        if k < truckCnt + 1:
                            break
                        loadings = w[i]
                    i += 1
                
                if truckCnt + 1 <= k:
                    minP = middle
                
                if k < truckCnt + 1:
                    left = middle + 1
                else:
                    right = middle - 1
                
            #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `truckCnt`, `i`, `loadings`, `n`, `middle`, `k`, `minP` are positive integers. If `k` is less than `truckCnt + 1`, then `left` is assigned `middle + 1`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `truckCnt + 1`, then `right` is assigned `middle - 1`.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` and `k` are positive integers, `w` is a list with `n` elements, `maxW` is the maximum value in the list `w`, `sumW` is the sum of all elements in `w`, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `num` is the last input value entered, `minP` is 0. If `n` is not equal to `k`, `minP` is assigned the maximum value in the list `w`. If `k` is less than `truckCnt + 1`, then `left` is assigned `middle + 1`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `truckCnt + 1`, then `right` is assigned `middle - 1`.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` and `k` are positive integers, `w` is a list with `n` elements, `maxW` is the maximum value in the list `w`, `sumW` is the sum of all elements in `w`, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `num` is the last input value entered, `minP` will be equal to `sumW` if `k` is equal to 1. Otherwise, if `n` is not equal to `k`, `minP` is assigned the maximum value in the list `w`. If `k` is less than `truckCnt + 1`, then `left` is assigned `middle + 1`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `truckCnt + 1`, then `right` is assigned `middle - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads input values for `n` and `k`, then reads `n` integers into a list `w`. It calculates the minimum possible value `minP` based on certain conditions depending on the values of `n` and `k`. The function uses binary search to determine `minP` in specific scenarios. The function does not explicitly accept any parameters but operates on predefined or global variables.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
