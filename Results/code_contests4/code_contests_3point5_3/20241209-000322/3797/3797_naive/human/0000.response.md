Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the alternating turns between Alice and Bob, where Alice selects a substring of length 'a' and Bob selects a substring of length 'b'. The program then determines if Alice can win by checking the number of moves made by each player and outputs "YES" if the number of moves made by Alice is even, indicating that Alice can win, and "NO" otherwise. 

The program processes each query independently, ensuring that the game is played optimally for each scenario. The logic for updating the count of moves made by Alice and checking if she can win is correctly implemented. Overall, the program aligns with the problem description and provides the expected output for the given inputs.
