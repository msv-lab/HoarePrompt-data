The function func_1 does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It iterates based on the input value, updating variables `a` and `b` from `func_3()`, processing a list of characters `s` followed by 'X', counting consecutive occurrences of 'X' and '.' characters, and determining whether to print 'YES' or 'NO' based on specific conditions. If the count of 'X' followed by a non-zero number is odd, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.
