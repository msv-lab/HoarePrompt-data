You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Alice and Bob play a game. Initially they have a string s_1, s_2, ..., s_n, consisting of only characters . and X. They take alternating turns, and Alice is moving first. During each turn, the player has to select a contiguous substring consisting only of characters . and replaces each of them with X. Alice must select a substing of length a, and Bob must select a substring of length b. It is guaranteed that a > b.

For example, if s = ...X.. and a = 3, b = 2, then after Alice's move string can turn only into XXXX... And if it's Bob's turn and the string s = ...X.., then after Bob's move the string can turn into XX.X.., .XXX.. or ...XXX.

Whoever is unable to make a move, loses. You have to determine who wins if they both play optimally.

You have to answer q independent queries.

Input

The first line contains one integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of queries.

The first line of each query contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ b < a ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5).

The second line of each query contains the string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5), consisting of only characters . and X.

It is guaranteed that sum of all |s| over all queries not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each test case print YES if Alice can win and NO otherwise.

You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).

Example

Input


3
3 2
XX......XX...X
4 2
X...X.X..X
5 3
.......X..X


Output


YES
NO
YES

Note

In the first query Alice can select substring s_3 ... s_5. After that s turns into XXXXX...XX...X. After that, no matter what move Bob makes, Alice can make the move (this will be her second move), but Bob can't make his second move.

In the second query Alice can not win because she cannot even make one move.

In the third query Alice can choose substring s_2 ... s_6. After that s turns into .XXXXX.X..X, and Bob can't make a move after that.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_1():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a, b = func_3()
        
        s = list(input())
        
        s.append('X')
        
        cnt = 0
        
        this = 0
        
        flag = False
        
        try:
            for c in s:
                if c == 'X' and this > 0:
                    if b <= this < a or a + 4 * b - 1 <= this:
                        raise
                    if 2 * b <= this:
                        if flag:
                            raise
                        flag = True
                        if this < a:
                            raise
                    cnt += 1
                    this = 0
                elif c == '.':
                    this += 1
            print('NO' if cnt % 2 else 'YES')
        except:
            print('NO')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: The loop will iterate based on the input value. `s` will contain characters followed by 'X', `a` and `b` will be updated according to `func_3()`, `cnt` will represent the total count of 'X' followed by a non-zero number, `this` will store the count of consecutive '.' characters before 'X', `flag` will be True only if there's a sequence of at least two 'X' characters separated by '.' characters. The program will print 'NO' if `cnt` is even, otherwise 'YES'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It iterates based on the input value, updating variables `a` and `b` from `func_3()`, processing a list of characters `s` followed by 'X', counting consecutive occurrences of 'X' and '.' characters, and determining whether to print 'YES' or 'NO' based on specific conditions. If the count of 'X' followed by a non-zero number is odd, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_2(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: 'x' and 'y' have been swapped, and 'y' has been updated to the result of 'x % y'. The loop will continue to execute until 'y' becomes 0
    return x
    #The program returns the initial value of 'x' before the swapping and updating process
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`. It swaps the values of `x` and `y` iteratively until `y` becomes 0. Finally, it returns the last value of `x` before the swapping and updating process. The functionality of the function is to perform the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of the initial values of `x` and `y`.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: q is a positive integer. Each query consists of two integers a and b such that 1 ≤ b < a ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, and a string s of length at most 3 ⋅ 10^5 containing only characters . and X.**
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers that are obtained by splitting the input provided by the user
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_3 prompts the user to input a list of integers and then returns that list after splitting the input provided by the user. It does not specifically handle the case where the input is not in the correct format or if the input is empty.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_4(f):
    return [func_4(f, *dim[1:]) for _ in range(dim[0])] if dim else f()
    #The program returns a list of values obtained by calling function `func_4` with arguments `f` and unpacking the rest of the elements in the `dim` list. The function `func_4` is called iteratively for the number of times specified in the first element of the `dim` list. If the `dim` list is empty, function `f` is called directly.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts a parameter `f` and a list `dim`. It returns a list of values obtained by calling function `func_4` with arguments `f` and unpacking the rest of the elements in the `dim` list. The function `func_4` is called iteratively for the number of times specified in the first element of the `dim` list. If the `dim` list is empty, function `f` is called directly. The actual code iteratively calls `func_4` with `f` and unpacked `dim` elements, but the code does not align with the annotation where `dim` is not defined.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_5(start, step, count):
    return range(start, start + step * count, step)
    #The program returns a range starting from 'start' with a step size of 'step' and containing 'count' elements.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts three parameters: `start`, `step`, and `count`, all of which are integers. The function returns a range starting from the value of `start`, with a step size of `step`, and containing `count` elements. If `count` is 0 or negative, the function will return an empty range.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list of tuples, start and end are non-negative integers such that 0 <= start <= end < len(l).**
def func_6(l, start, end):
    return range(start, len(l) + end)
    #The program returns a range starting from index 'start' to the sum of the length of list 'l' and 'end'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_6 accepts a list of tuples 'l' and two non-negative integers 'start' and 'end', such that 0 <= start <= end < len(l). It then incorrectly returns a range starting from index 'start' up to the sum of the length of list 'l' and 'end', which might not align with the actual requirements based on the annotations. There is a discrepancy between what the annotations state and what the code actually does.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_7(n):
    return 2 ** (n - 1).bit_length()
    #The program returns the result of raising 2 to the power of n-1 and then finding the number of bits required to represent that number in binary
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` accepts an integer `n`. It calculates the result of raising 2 to the power of `n-1` and then determines the number of bits required to represent that result in binary. This function effectively calculates the number of bits needed to represent the result of 2 raised to the power of `n-1`. There are no specific edge cases or missing functionality as the code accurately reflects the annotations.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_8(x, r):
    return (x + r - 1) // r
    #The program returns the value of (x + r - 1) divided by r using integer division
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_8 accepts two integer parameters x and r, and returns the result of (x + r - 1) divided by r using integer division.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
