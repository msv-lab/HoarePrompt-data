Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It takes the input for each query, processes the string to determine if Alice can win, and prints the result accordingly. The program follows the rules of the game as specified in the problem description, ensuring that the players take alternating turns, selecting substrings of the specified lengths, and determining the winner based on the optimal moves.

The program handles all the edge cases mentioned in the problem description, such as checking if a player can make a move or not, and considering the conditions for Alice to win. Therefore, the program is correct and follows the problem description accurately.
