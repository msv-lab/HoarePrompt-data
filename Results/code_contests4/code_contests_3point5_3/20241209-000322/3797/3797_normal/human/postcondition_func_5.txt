The function func_6 accepts a list of tuples 'l' and two non-negative integers 'start' and 'end', such that 0 <= start <= end < len(l). It then incorrectly returns a range starting from index 'start' up to the sum of the length of list 'l' and 'end', which might not align with the actual requirements based on the annotations. There is a discrepancy between what the annotations state and what the code actually does.
