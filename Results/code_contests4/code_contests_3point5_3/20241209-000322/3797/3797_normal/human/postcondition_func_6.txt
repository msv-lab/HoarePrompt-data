The function `func_7` accepts an integer `n`. It calculates the result of raising 2 to the power of `n-1` and then determines the number of bits required to represent that result in binary. This function effectively calculates the number of bits needed to represent the result of 2 raised to the power of `n-1`. There are no specific edge cases or missing functionality as the code accurately reflects the annotations.
