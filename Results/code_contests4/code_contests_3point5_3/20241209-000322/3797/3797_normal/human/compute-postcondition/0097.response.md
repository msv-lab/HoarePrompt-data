Output State: **`s` is a list containing characters followed by 'X' with at least one character, `a` and `b` are dependent on the output of `func_3()`, `cnt` contains the updated number of occurrences of 'X' in `s` incremented by 1, `this` is either 0 or 1. If 2 * b <= this, an exception is raised halting the program execution. If `this` is less than `a`, an exception is raised halting the program execution due to the value of `flag` being set to True.**
