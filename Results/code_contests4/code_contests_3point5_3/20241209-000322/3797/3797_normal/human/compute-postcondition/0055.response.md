Postcondition: ***`s` has 'X' appended to it, values of `a` and `b` are dependent on `func_3()`, `cnt` is either incremented by 1 or set to 0, `this` can be 0, 1, or 3 depending on the execution path, `flag` can be True or False, an exception is raised if `this` is less than `a`, an exception is raised if `flag` is True. For the loop to execute again, `s` must have more characters other than 'X'.***
