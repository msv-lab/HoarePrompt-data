Postcondition: ***The list `s` has 'X' appended to it, values of `a` and `b` are dependent on `func_3()`, `cnt` is 0, `this` is greater than 0, `flag` is False, for the loop to execute the first time `c` is the first element in `s`. Additionally, the first element of `s` is 'X'. After entering the if condition (2 * b <= this) and `flag` is True, the program raises an exception and stops execution, with no changes occurring to the initial state.***
