Postcondition: ***`s` is a list containing characters followed by 'X', `a` and `b` are updated based on the output of `func_3()`, `cnt` is either 1 or 0, `this` is 1, `flag` is True, for the loop to execute one more time `c` is not 'X'. If 2 * `b` <= `this`, then `a` is updated based on the output of `func_3()`, `b` is updated based on the output of `func_3()`, and the program continues execution without raising an exception.***
