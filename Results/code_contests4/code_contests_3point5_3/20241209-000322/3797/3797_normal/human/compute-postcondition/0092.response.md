Postcondition: ***`s` is a list containing characters followed by 'X' with at least one character, `a` and `b` are dependent on the output of `func_3()`, `cnt` contains the updated number of occurrences of 'X' in `s`, `this` is either 0 or 1, `flag` is either True or False based on the condition, and `cnt` is either 0 or greater than 0. If b <= this < a or a + 4 * b - 1 <= this, an exception is raised halting the program execution. If flag is True, an exception is raised halting the program execution.***
