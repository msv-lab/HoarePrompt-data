Output State: **`s` is a list containing characters followed by 'X', `a` and `b` are updated based on the output of `func_3()`, `cnt` is either 2 or 1, `this` is 0, `flag` is True. If 2 * `b` is less than or equal to `this`, the program is in a specific state where `this` is less than `a`, triggering an exception "raise".**
