Postcondition: ***`s` is a list containing characters followed by 'X' with at least one character, `a` and `b` are dependent on the output of `func_3()`, `cnt` contains the updated number of occurrences of 'X' in `s`, `this` is either 0 or 1, `flag` is either True or False based on the condition, and `cnt` is either 0 or greater than 0. If `c` is 'X' and `this` is greater than 0, `flag` is True and `cnt` is greater than 0. If `c` is not 'X' or `this` is less than or equal to 0, `this` is set to 1, `flag` is False, and `cnt` is 0. If `c` is '.', the program state remains the same as the precondition.***
