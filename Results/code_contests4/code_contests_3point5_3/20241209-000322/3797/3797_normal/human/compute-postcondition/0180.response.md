Output State: **The loop will iterate based on the input value. `s` will contain characters followed by 'X', `a` and `b` will be updated according to `func_3()`, `cnt` will represent the total count of 'X' followed by a non-zero number, `this` will store the count of consecutive '.' characters before 'X', `flag` will be True only if there's a sequence of at least two 'X' characters separated by '.' characters. The program will print 'NO' if `cnt` is even, otherwise 'YES'.**
