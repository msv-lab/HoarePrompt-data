Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`. It swaps the values of `x` and `y` iteratively until `y` becomes 0. Finally, it returns the last value of `x` before the swapping and updating process. The functionality of the function is to perform the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of the initial values of `x` and `y`.**
