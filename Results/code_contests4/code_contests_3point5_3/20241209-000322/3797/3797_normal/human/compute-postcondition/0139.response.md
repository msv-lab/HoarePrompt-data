Postcondition: ***`s` is a list containing characters followed by 'X', `a` and `b` are updated based on the output of `func_3()`, `cnt` is 0, `this` is greater than 0, `flag` is True, an exception 'raise' is called, the conditions for the loop to execute one more time remain the same, `c` is 'X', `b` is less than or equal to `this`, `this` is less than `a`, or `a + 4 * b - 1` is less than or equal to `this, `this` is greater than 0, and `2 * b <= this`. After the execution of the if else block, the state of the program variables remains the same as the precondition since there is no else part to modify the variables.***
