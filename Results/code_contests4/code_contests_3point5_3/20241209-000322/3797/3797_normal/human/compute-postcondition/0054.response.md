Postcondition: ***`s` has 'X' appended to it, values of `a` and `b` are dependent on `func_3()`, `cnt` is either incremented by 1 or set to 0, `this` is either 1 or 3 depending on the execution path, `flag` is either True or False, an exception is raised if `this` is less than `a`, and for the loop to execute again `s` must have more characters other than 'X'.***
