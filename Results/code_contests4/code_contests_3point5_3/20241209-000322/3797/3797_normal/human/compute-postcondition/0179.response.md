An exception could occur at the points where the `raise` statement is used in the code block. The first `raise` is triggered when specific conditions are met for the variables `a`, `b`, and `this`. The second `raise` is triggered when other specific conditions are met for the variables `b`, `this`, and `flag`. The third `raise` is triggered when `this` is less than `a`. 

The try except statement in the code block handles these exceptions by catching any raised exceptions and printing 'NO' to the console. 

Therefore, the output state after the execution of the try statement is:
Output State: **`s` is a list containing characters followed by 'X', `a` and `b` are updated based on the output of `func_3()`, `cnt` is the number of occurrences where 'X' is followed by a number greater than 0, `this` is the count of consecutive '.' characters before 'X', `flag` is True if there exists a sequence of at least two 'X' characters separated by '.' characters, else False. For the loop to execute one more time, the input value must be greater than 0. The output will be 'NO' if cnt is even, otherwise 'YES'.**
