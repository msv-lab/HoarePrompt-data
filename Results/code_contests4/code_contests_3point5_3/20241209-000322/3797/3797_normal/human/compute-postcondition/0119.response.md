The program could raise an exception at any point within the `for` loop if the conditions are not met. The `try` block iterates over the characters in `s`, updating `this` based on the consecutive occurrences of '.', and updating `cnt` based on the occurrences of 'X' meeting certain conditions. The program prints 'NO' if `cnt` is even, otherwise 'YES'. If an exception is raised, 'NO' is printed.

Therefore, the output state after the execution of the try statement is: `s` is a list containing characters followed by 'X', `a` and `b` are dependent on the output of `func_3()`, `cnt` contains the total number of occurrences of 'X' in `s`, `this` is either 0 or the count of consecutive periods before 'X', `flag` is True if there is a consecutive sequence where `this` is less than `a`, otherwise False. The program prints 'NO' if `cnt` is even, otherwise 'YES'.
