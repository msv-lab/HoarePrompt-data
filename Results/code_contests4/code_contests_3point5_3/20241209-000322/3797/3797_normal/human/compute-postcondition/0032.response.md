Postcondition: ***The list `s` has 'X' appended to it, values of `a` and `b` are dependent on `func_3()`, `cnt` is 0, `this` is 1, `flag` is False, for the loop to execute the second time `c` is the next element after '.' in `s'. If `b <= this < a` or `a + 4 * b - 1 <= this`, the program raises an exception and stops execution abruptly.***
