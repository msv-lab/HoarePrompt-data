Example Answer: 
The `raise` statement raises an exception, so the program will terminate abruptly without affecting any of the variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` contains characters to iterate over, `a`, `b`, `cnt`, `this`, `flag` remain unchanged as the program terminates abruptly due to the exception raised.
