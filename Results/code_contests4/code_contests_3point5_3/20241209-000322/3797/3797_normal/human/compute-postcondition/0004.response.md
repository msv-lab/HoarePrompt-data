According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `y`. If `y` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the previous iteration, the values of `x` and `y` are dependent on their initial values, and the new values will be assigned after the swap and modulo operation. Therefore, in order for the loop to execute one more time, the new values of `x` and `y` after the swap and modulo operation should be such that `y` is not equal to 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **Dependent on the initial values of `x` and `y`, after the swap and modulo operation, for the loop to execute again, `y` should not be equal to 0**
