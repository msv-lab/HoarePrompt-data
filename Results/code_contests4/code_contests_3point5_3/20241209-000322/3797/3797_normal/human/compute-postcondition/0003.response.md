Example Answer:
The values of `x` and `y` are swapped, and `x` is assigned the remainder of `x` divided by `y`. The specific initial values of `x` and `y` are not provided, so the output state will depend on those initial values.
Output State: **Dependent on the initial values of `x` and `y`, the new values will be assigned to `x` and `y` after the swap and modulo operation.**
