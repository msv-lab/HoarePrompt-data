According to the code, the loop will iterate over each character in the list `s`. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as there are characters in `s` to iterate over. Since `s` is a list containing characters followed by 'X', the loop will execute if there is at least one character in the list.

For the loop to execute, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`s` is a list containing characters followed by 'X' with at least one character, `a` and `b` are dependent on the output of `func_3()`, `cnt` contains the updated number of occurrences of 'X' in `s`, `this` is 0, `flag` is False, `cnt` is 0**
