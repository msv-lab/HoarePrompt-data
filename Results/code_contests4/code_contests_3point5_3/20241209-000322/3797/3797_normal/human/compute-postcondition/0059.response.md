The program could raise an exception at any point where the `raise` statement is encountered, which is when certain conditions are met in the if statements. The `try` block iterates over the elements of list `s`, incrementing `this` by 1 for each '.' and resetting it to 0 when 'X' is encountered. If specific conditions are met for 'X', exceptions are raised and handled. At the end, the program prints 'NO' if the count of 'X' occurrences is even, otherwise 'YES'.

Therefore, the output state after the execution of the try statement is: `s` has 'X' appended to it, values of `a` and `b` are dependent on `func_3()`, `cnt` contains the number of occurrences of 'X' in `s`, `this` is 0, `flag` is False.
