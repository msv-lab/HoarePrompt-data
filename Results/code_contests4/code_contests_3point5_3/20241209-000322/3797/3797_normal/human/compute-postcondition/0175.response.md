Postcondition: ***`s` is a list containing characters followed by 'X', `a` and `b` are updated based on the output of `func_3()`, `cnt` is either 1 or 0, `this` is either 0 or 2, `flag` is either True or False, `c` is not 'X' for the loop to execute one more time. If c == 'X' and this > 0, `cnt` is increased by 1, `this` is 0, `flag` is True, conditions are met for updating `a` and `b` based on the output of `func_3()`. If c != 'X' or this <= 0, `cnt` remains the same, `this` is 2, `flag` can be either True or False.***
