Example Answer: 
The code prints 'NO' if the number of occurrences of 'X' in `s` is even, otherwise it prints 'YES'. The value of `cnt` contains the number of occurrences of 'X' in `s`, so if `cnt` is even, 'NO' is printed, and if `cnt` is odd, 'YES' is printed. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` has 'X' appended to it, values of `a` and `b` are dependent on `func_3()`, `cnt` contains the number of occurrences of 'X' in `s`, `this` is 0, `flag` is False.
Output State: **`s` has 'X' appended to it, values of `a` and `b` are dependent on `func_3()`, `cnt` contains the number of occurrences of 'X' in `s`, `this` is 0, `flag` is False**
