Example Answer:
This code snippet raises an exception and stops the execution of the program abruptly. The values of the variables remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: The list `s` has 'X' appended to it, values of `a` and `b` are dependent on `func_3()`, `cnt` is 0, `this` is 1, `flag` is False, and for the loop to execute the second time `c` is the next element after '.' in `s'.
