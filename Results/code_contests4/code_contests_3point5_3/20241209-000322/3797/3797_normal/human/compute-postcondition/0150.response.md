Postcondition: ***`s` is a list containing characters followed by 'X', `a` and `b` are updated based on the output of `func_3()`, `cnt` is either 1 or 0, `this` is either 0 or 1, `flag` is either True or False. An exception 'raise' is called in the if part, input value is greater than 0. If `c` is 'X' and `this` > 0, `cnt` is 1, `flag` is True, and specific conditions for `a`, `b`, and `this` are satisfied. The program is in a particular state based on the conditions of `b`, `a`, and `this` defined in the if statement.***
