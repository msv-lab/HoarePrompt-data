Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program takes input for the number of queries, the values of 'a' and 'b', and the string 's'.
- It then iterates through each query and checks if Alice can win the game by keeping track of the count of consecutive '.' characters and applying the rules for selecting substrings.
- The program handles the given problem description accurately and provides the correct output for each query.
- Since the program follows the problem description and provides the expected output for all cases, it can be considered correct.
