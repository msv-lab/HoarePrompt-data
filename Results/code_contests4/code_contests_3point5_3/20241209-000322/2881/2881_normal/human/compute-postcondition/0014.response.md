Example Answer:
`be` is assigned the value of `mid`. The value of `mid` is a positive integer, so after execution, `be` is also a positive integer. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `be`, `en`, `mid` are positive integers and for the loop to execute again `be` is less than `en`.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `be`, `en`, `mid` are positive integers and for the loop to execute again `be` is less than `en`**
