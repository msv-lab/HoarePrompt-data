Example Answer:
Initially, `mid` is calculated as the floor division of the sum of `be`, `en`, and 1 divided by 2. The values of `be`, `en`, and `mid` are affected by this calculation. Since `be` is less than `en`, `mid` is assigned a new positive integer value based on the formula provided. 
Output State: **`a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `be`, `en` are positive integers, `mid` is a new positive integer value**
