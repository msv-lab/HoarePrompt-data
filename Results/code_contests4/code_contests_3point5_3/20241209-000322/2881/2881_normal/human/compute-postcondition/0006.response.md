Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `be`, `en`, `mid` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b`, `x`, `y` ≤ 2·10^9. For the loop to execute the first time, `be` is less than `en`, `mid` is a positive integer value. If `x * mid` is less than or equal to `a` and `y * mid` is less than or equal to `b`, then `be` is assigned the value of `mid`. Otherwise, if either `x * mid > a` or `y * mid > b` or both, `en` is one less than `mid`.***
