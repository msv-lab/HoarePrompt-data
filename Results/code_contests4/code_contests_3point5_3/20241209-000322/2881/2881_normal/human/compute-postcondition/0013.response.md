Example Answer:
`mid` is assigned the value of `(be + en + 1) // 2`. The values of `be` and `en` are positive integers, so the value of `mid` will also be a positive integer. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `be`, `en`, `mid` are positive integers and for the loop to execute again `be` is less than `en`.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `be`, `en`, `mid` are positive integers and for the loop to execute again `be` is less than `en`**
