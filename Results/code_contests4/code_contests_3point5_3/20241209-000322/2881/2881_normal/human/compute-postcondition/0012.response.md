According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `be` and `en`. If `be` is less than `en`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `be` and `en` were adjusted based on the condition `x * mid <= a` and `y * mid <= b`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `be` needs to be less than `en`. 
State: **`a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `be`, `en`, `mid` are positive integers and for the loop to execute again `be` is less than `en`**
