Example Answer:
`en` is assigned the value `mid - 1`, where `mid` is a positive integer. The value of `en` will be one less than `mid`. Since `mid` is a new positive integer value, the value of `en` will be `mid - 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `be`, `en` are positive integers, `mid` is a new positive integer value, `en` is `mid - 1`.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `be`, `en` are positive integers, `mid` is a new positive integer value, `en` is `mid - 1`**
