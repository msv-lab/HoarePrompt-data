Output State: **`a`, `b`, `x`, `y` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b`, `x`, `y` ≤ 2·10^9. For the loop to execute the first time, `be` is less than `en`, `mid` is a positive integer value. Furthermore, `x * mid` is less than or equal to `a` and `y * mid` is less than or equal to `b`, `be` is assigned the value of `mid`**
