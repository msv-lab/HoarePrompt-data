According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `be` and `en`. If `be` is less than `en`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `a`, `b`, `x`, and `y` are positive integers. So, for the loop to execute the first time, `be` must be less than `en`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **a, b, x, and y are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, x, y ≤ 2·10^9. For the loop to execute the first time, be is less than en**
