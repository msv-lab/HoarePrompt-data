Example Answer:
Since the loop finishes with `be` being the largest possible value such that `x * be` is less than or equal to `a` and `y * be` is less than or equal to `b`, the final values of `be` are correct. Therefore, the output state is: `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `be`, `en`, `mid` are positive integers; `be * x`, `be * y` are calculated values.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `be`, `en`, `mid` are positive integers; `be * x`, `be * y` are calculated values**
