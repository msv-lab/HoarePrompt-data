Output State: **`a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `be`, `en`, `mid` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b`, `x`, `y` ≤ 2·10^9. The loop finishes with `be` being the largest possible value such that `x * be` is less than or equal to `a` and `y * be` is less than or equal to `b`, `en` is equal to `be` or `be + 1` depending on the final iteration.**
