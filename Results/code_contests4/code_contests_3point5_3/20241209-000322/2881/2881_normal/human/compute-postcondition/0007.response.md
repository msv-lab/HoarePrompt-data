According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `be` and `en`. If `be` is less than `en`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `be` is either equal to `mid` or `mid - 1`. To ensure the loop executes one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- If `be` is equal to `mid`, then `be` should be assigned `mid - 1`.
- If `be` is equal to `mid - 1`, then `en` should be assigned `mid - 1`.
- Additionally, `mid` should be adjusted to a new positive integer value to continue the loop execution.
State: **`a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `be`, `en`, `mid` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b`, `x`, `y` ≤ 2·10^9. For the loop to execute the first time, `be` is less than `en`, `mid` is a positive integer value. For the loop to execute again, either `be` should be assigned `mid - 1` or `en` should be assigned `mid - 1`, and `mid` should be a new positive integer value.**
