Example Answer:
`en` is assigned the value of `mid - 1`. The value of `mid` is a positive integer, so `en` will be one less than `mid`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `be`, `en`, `mid` are positive integers and for the loop to execute again `be` is less than `en`, `en` is one less than `mid`.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `be`, `en`, `mid` are positive integers and for the loop to execute again `be` is less than `en`, `en` is one less than `mid`**
