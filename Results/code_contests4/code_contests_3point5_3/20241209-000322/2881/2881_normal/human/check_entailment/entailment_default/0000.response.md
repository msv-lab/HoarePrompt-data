Correctness: **False**

The code seems to have duplicate input reading and variable initialization. The `func_1` function is defined but never actually called. Additionally, the code does not seem to accurately follow the problem description for all potential cases.

The output hints mention the `func_1` function, but it is not utilized in the main program logic. The hints also describe the function's behavior of finding the largest possible value of `be` where `x * be` is less than or equal to `a` and `y * be` is less than or equal to `b`. However, since this function is not called, it does not contribute to the correctness of the program.

Overall, the code structure and execution deviate from the problem description, indicating that the program is incorrect.
