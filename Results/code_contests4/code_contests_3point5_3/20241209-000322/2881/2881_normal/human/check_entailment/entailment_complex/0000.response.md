Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes two positive integer parameters `be` and `en`. The function iterates through a while loop to find the largest possible value of `be` such that `x * be` is less than or equal to `a` and `y * be` is less than or equal to `b`. This satisfies the requirement of reducing the monitor size so that its screen sides ratio becomes x: y while maximizing the total area.

At the end of the loop, the function prints the screen parameters of the reduced size model, which are `be * x` and `be * y`, as required by the problem description.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the problem description for all potential cases.
