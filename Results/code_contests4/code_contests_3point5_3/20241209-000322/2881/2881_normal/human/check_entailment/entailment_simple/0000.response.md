Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It uses a binary search algorithm to find the largest possible value `be` such that `x * be` is less than or equal to `a` and `y * be` is less than or equal to `b`, which ensures that the reduced size model has the desired screen sides ratio. The program then prints out the screen parameters of the reduced size model. This approach guarantees that the total area of the reduced size model is maximized while satisfying the given constraints. The program covers all potential cases and provides the correct output as described in the problem description.
