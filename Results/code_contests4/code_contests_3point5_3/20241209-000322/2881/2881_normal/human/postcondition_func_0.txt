The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `be` and `en` such that 1 ≤ `be`, `en` ≤ 2·10^9. Within the function, it iterates through a while loop to find the largest possible value of `be` where `x * be` is less than or equal to `a` and `y * be` is less than or equal to `b`. The loop updates `be` and `en` accordingly. At the end of the loop, it prints the values `be * x` and `be * y`. The function does not have a return value.
