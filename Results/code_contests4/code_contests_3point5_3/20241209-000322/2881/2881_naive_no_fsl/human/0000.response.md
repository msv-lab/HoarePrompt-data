Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program takes input values for a, b, x, and y.
2. It then calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of x and y and reduces x and y accordingly.
3. The program then calculates the minimum possible value for a reduced model by dividing a by x and b by y, and taking the minimum of those values.
4. It then prints the reduced model size by multiplying the minimum value with x and y.
5. The program seems to correctly handle the problem description by finding the maximum possible reduced model size while maintaining the screen ratio x:y. 

Overall, the program appears to be correct and follows the problem description for all potential cases.
