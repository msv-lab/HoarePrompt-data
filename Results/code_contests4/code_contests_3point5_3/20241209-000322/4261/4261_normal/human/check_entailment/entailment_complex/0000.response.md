Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program contains two functions `func_1` and `func_2` which work together to determine if a given array can be achieved after some step in the described algorithm. 

- `func_1` iterates through the input array `li`, calculates values based on `n` and `k`, and updates variables `req`, `r`, `i`, and `j` accordingly. It checks specific conditions and calls `func_2` with the argument 'NO' if necessary. After the loop execution, it prints 'YES' if the array can be achieved, considering the collected unique values of `j` in the set `req`.

- `func_2` prints values to the standard output stream with the provided separator ('sep') and end character ('end'). It handles the case where the output stream needs to be flushed based on the 'flush' key in the kwargs.

Based on the problem description and the annotations in the code, the program appears to correctly implement the algorithm for determining if the given array can be achieved after some step. The annotations also provide insights into the state of the program before and after function calls, aligning with the problem requirements. Therefore, the code seems to follow the problem description for every potential case.
