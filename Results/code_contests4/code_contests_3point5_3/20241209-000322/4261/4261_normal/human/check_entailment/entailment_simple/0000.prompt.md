You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Suppose you are performing the following algorithm. There is an array v_1, v_2, ..., v_n filled with zeroes at start. The following operation is applied to the array several times — at i-th step (0-indexed) you can: 

  * either choose position pos (1 ≤ pos ≤ n) and increase v_{pos} by k^i; 
  * or not choose any position and skip this step. 



You can choose how the algorithm would behave on each step and when to stop it. The question is: can you make array v equal to the given array a (v_j = a_j for each j) after some step?

Input

The first line contains one integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. Next 2T lines contain test cases — two lines per test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 30, 2 ≤ k ≤ 100) — the size of arrays v and a and value k used in the algorithm.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^{16}) — the array you'd like to achieve.

Output

For each test case print YES (case insensitive) if you can achieve the array a after some step or NO (case insensitive) otherwise.

Example

Input


5
4 100
0 0 0 0
1 2
1
3 4
1 4 1
3 2
0 1 3
3 9
0 59049 810


Output


YES
YES
NO
NO
YES

Note

In the first test case, you can stop the algorithm before the 0-th step, or don't choose any position several times and stop the algorithm.

In the second test case, you can add k^0 to v_1 and stop the algorithm.

In the third test case, you can't make two 1 in the array v.

In the fifth test case, you can skip 9^0 and 9^1, then add 9^2 and 9^3 to v_3, skip 9^4 and finally, add 9^5 to v_2.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_1():
    n, k = get_list()
    li = get_list()
    req = set()
    for i in li:
        r = 0
        
        while i > 0:
            j = 0
            while i % k ** (j + 1) == 0:
                j += 1
            i //= k ** j
            j += r
            if j in req:
                func_2('NO')
                return
            req.add(j)
            r = j
            i -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `req` is a set containing unique values of `j` obtained during the entire loop execution, `n` and `k` retain their assigned valid values from `get_list()`, `li` still contains at least 1 element, `r` is the maximum value of `j` obtained during the loop, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, loop control variables have reached their final values
    func_2('YES')

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_2():
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        
        file.write(str(x))
        
        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sep` is assigned the value ' ' if not provided, `file` is assigned the value sys.stdout if not provided, `kwargs` is modified to remove 'sep' and 'file', `args` is an empty iterable, `at_start` is False
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *'sep' is assigned the value ' ' if not provided, 'file' is assigned the value sys.stdout, 'kwargs' is modified to remove 'sep', 'file', and 'flush', 'args' is an empty iterable, 'at_start' is False, and the value of 'end' key from 'kwargs' is written to the file.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
