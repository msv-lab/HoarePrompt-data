According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and `j`. If `i % k ** (j + 1)` equals 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `req` contains the value of `j`, `r` contains the same value as `req`, `i` is decreased by 1, `i` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute again, and `j` is assigned the value 0. To execute the loop one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 1, and the value of `j` needs to be adjusted to be greater or equal to 0.
State: **`req` contains the value of `j`, `r` contains the same value as `req`, `i` is greater than 1, `j` is equal to 0 for the loop to execute one more time**
