According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and `j`. If `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `req` is a set containing unique values of `j` obtained during the loop execution, `n` and `k` are assigned valid values from `get_list()`, `li` contains at least 2 elements, `r` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is greater than 0, and `j` is assigned the value 0. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. `j` in the set `req` should be incremented to include the next unique value obtained during the loop execution.
2. `i` should be modified to be divisible by `k ** (j + 1)` to satisfy the loop condition.

State: **`req` is a set containing unique values of `j` obtained during the loop execution, `n` and `k` are assigned valid values from `get_list()`, `li` contains at least 2 elements, `r` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is greater than 0, and `j` is assigned the value 0. To execute the loop one more time `j` should be incremented to include the next unique value, and `i` should be divisible by `k ** (j + 1)`**
