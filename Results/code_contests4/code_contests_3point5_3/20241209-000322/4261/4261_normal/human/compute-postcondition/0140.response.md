Example Answer:
`j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is unknown, so the output state is: `req` contains unique values of 0; `r` is 0; `j` is incremented by 1; `i` is decreased by 1, for the loop to execute the first time `i % k`.
Output State: **`req` contains unique values of 0; `r` is 0; `j` is incremented by 1; `i` is decreased by 1, for the loop to execute the first time `i % k`**
