According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and `j`. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must satisfy the loop condition, which means `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` was incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the new value of `j` must satisfy the loop condition for the next iteration.

State: **Output State: `req` is a set containing unique values of `j` obtained during the loop execution, `n` and `k` are assigned valid values from `get_list()`, `li` contains at least 2 elements, `r` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is greater than 0, `j` is assigned the value 0, and for the loop to execute one more time the new value of `j` must satisfy the loop condition**
