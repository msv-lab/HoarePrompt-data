Functionality: ** The function func_2 does not accept any parameters. It reads the values from 'args' and writes them to the standard output stream with 'sep' as the separator between values. If the 'end' key is present in 'kwargs', its value is written at the end. If the 'flush' key is True in 'kwargs', the output stream is flushed. The function does not return any value, but the annotations incorrectly state that it returns the string "Hello, World!".**
