According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and `j`. If `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `req` contains the value of `j+1`, `r` contains the same value as `req`, `i` is greater than 1, and `j` is equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, the values of `i`, `k`, and `j` need to be adjusted such that the condition `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0` is still satisfied.
State: **`req` contains the value of `j+1`, `r` contains the same value as `req`, `i` is greater than 1, `j` is equal to 1, and for the loop to execute again `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`**
