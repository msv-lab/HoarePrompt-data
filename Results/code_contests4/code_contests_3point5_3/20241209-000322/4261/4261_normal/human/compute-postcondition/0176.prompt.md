You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initializedâ€”only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: **
```
def func_1():
```
Output: Case_1: The program returns the value of `i` divided by `k` raised to the power of `j`, where `j` is the maximum value that satisfies the loop condition and `j` is in the set `req`.

Case_2: The program returns the updated value of 'j' which is now incremented by the value of 'r'

Case_3: The program returns the updated values of variables `req`, `r`, `i`, and `j` after the operations described

Case_4: The program returns the final value of `j` after the loop execution, which is added to the set `req` containing unique values of `j` during the loop. The value of `i` is updated by the floor division of `i` by `k` raised to the power of `j`, where `n` and `k` are assigned valid values from `get_list()`. `li` contains at least 1 element, `r` is 0, `i` is greater than 0, and `j` is the maximum value satisfying the loop condition.

Case_5: The program returns nothing

Case_6: The program does not return any specific value, it just executes the code as described

Case_7: The program returns the result of calling the function `func_2` with the argument 'NO'

Case_8: The program returns the value of 'i' after performing integer division with 'k' raised to the power of the total number of times the loop executed. 'j' is in 'req'

Case_9: The program returns the updated values of 'req', 'r', 'i', and 'j' after the loop execution

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
