Example Answer:
`j` is incremented by 1 and added to the set `req` which contains unique values. Since `req` already contains unique values of `j`, the set will be updated with the new incremented value of `j`. The values of `n`, `k`, `li`, `r`, and `i` remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`req` is a set containing unique values of `j` obtained during the loop execution with the incremented value of `j`, `n` and `k` are assigned valid values from `get_list()`, `li` contains at least 1 element, `r` is 0, `i` is greater than 0**
