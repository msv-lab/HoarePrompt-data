Example Answer:
The value of `i` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is unknown, but since it is updated by performing integer division with `k` raised to the power of `j` and becomes less than or equal to 0, decrementing it by 1 may change its value accordingly. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `req` contains unique values of 0, `j` is the total number of times the loop executed, `r` is equal to `j`, `i` is updated by performing integer division with `k` raised to the power of `j` and becomes less than or equal to 0, and then decremented by 1.
Output State: **`req` contains unique values of 0, `j` is the total number of times the loop executed, `r` is equal to `j`, `i` is updated by performing integer division with `k` raised to the power of `j` and becomes less than or equal to 0, and then decremented by 1**
