Functionality: ** The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It iterates through a list `li`, calculates certain values based on `n` and `k`, and performs different operations based on various conditions. It updates variables such as `req`, `r`, `i`, and `j` during the loop execution. It may call another function `func_2` with the argument 'NO' under specific circumstances. The final state includes the set `req` containing unique values of `j`, `n` and `k` retaining their assigned valid values, and `li` still containing at least one element. **
