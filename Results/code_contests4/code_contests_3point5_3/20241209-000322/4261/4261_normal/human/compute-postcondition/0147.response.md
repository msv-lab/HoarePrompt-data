Example Answer:
`j` is incremented by the value of `r`, and `r` is 0, so after execution, `j` remains 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `req` contains unique values of 0; `r` is 0; `j` is 0; `i` is updated by performing integer division with `k` raised to the power of the total number of times the loop executed.
Output State: **`req` contains unique values of 0; `r` is 0; `j` is 0; `i` is updated by performing integer division with `k` raised to the power of the total number of times the loop executed**
