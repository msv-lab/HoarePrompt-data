According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the conditions `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`. At the end of the last iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` needs to be greater than 0.
- `j` needs to be 1 or greater.
- `j` must not be in `req`.
State: **`req` is a set containing unique values of `j` obtained during the loop execution, `n` and `k` are assigned valid values from `get_list()`, `li` contains at least 1 element, `r` is equal to the final value of `j`, `i` is updated by floor division of `i` by `k` raised to the power of `j` and decreased by 1, `j` is the final value after the loop and is added to `req`, `i` is not divisible by `k`, `j` is increased by `r+1`, `i` is decreased by 1, for the loop to execute again `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 1**
