According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than 0. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes once more, no adjustment is needed for the variable `i`. 

However, the variable `j` needs to be modified to contain a unique value obtained during the loop execution after adding the current value of `j`. Additionally, `r` needs to be adjusted to the value of `j`. Since `j` is not currently in `req`, it must be added to `req`. Lastly, `i` needs to be decreased by 1 to allow the loop to proceed. 

State: **Output State: `req` contains unique values of `j`, `r` is assigned the value of `j`, `j` is added to `req`, `i` is decreased by 1 to allow the loop to execute one more time**
