The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. 

Case 1: The function returns the value of `i` divided by `k` raised to the power of `j`, where `j` is the maximum value that satisfies the loop condition and `j` is in the set `req`.

Case 2: The function returns the updated value of 'j' which is now incremented by the value of 'r'.

Case 3: The function returns the updated values of variables `req`, `r`, `i`, and `j` after the operations described.

Case 4: The function returns the final value of `j` after the loop execution, which is added to the set `req` containing unique values of `j` during the loop. The value of `i` is updated by the floor division of `i` by `k` raised to the power of `j`, where `n` and `k` are assigned valid values from `get_list()`. `li` contains at least 1 element, `r` is 0, `i` is greater than 0, and `j` is the maximum value satisfying the loop condition.

Case 5: The function returns nothing.

Case 6: The function does not return any specific value, it just executes the code as described.

Case 7: The function returns the result of calling the function `func_2` with the argument 'NO'.

Case 8: The function returns the value of 'i' after performing integer division with 'k' raised to the power of the total number of times the loop executed. 'j' is in 'req'.

Case 9: The function returns the updated values of 'req', 'r', 'i', and 'j' after the loop execution.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to execute multiple cases based on different scenarios and return specific values or execute specific operations as described in each case.
