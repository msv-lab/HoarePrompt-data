Example Answer:
`j` is incremented by `r`, where `r` is `j + 1`. The value of `r` is dependent on the current value of `j`. The updated value of `j` after incrementing by `r` will vary based on the previous values of `j`. Therefore, the Output State is: `req` contains unique values of 0 and `j`, `r` is `j + 1`, `i` is updated by performing integer division with `k` raised to the power of `j` and becomes less than or equal to 0, `j` is the total number of times the loop executed, and `j` is incremented by `j + 1`.
Output State: **`req` contains unique values of 0 and `j`, `r` is `j + 1`, `i` is updated by performing integer division with `k` raised to the power of `j` and becomes less than or equal to 0, `j` is the total number of times the loop executed, and `j` is incremented by `j + 1`**
