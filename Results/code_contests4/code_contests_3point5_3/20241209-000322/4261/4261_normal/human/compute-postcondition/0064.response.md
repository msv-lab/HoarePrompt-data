According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and `j`. If `i % k ** (j + 1)` equals 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is the maximum value that satisfies the loop condition and has been added to `req`, `k` is a valid value from `get_list()`, `li` contains at least 1 element, `r` is 0, and all values of `j` have been added to `req`. To execute the loop one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1 and added to `req` if it is not already there.
State: **`req` is a set containing unique values of `j` obtained during the loop execution and `j` is incremented by 1 and added to `req`, `n` and `k` are assigned valid values from `get_list()`, `li` contains at least 1 element, `r` is 0, `i` is greater than 0**
