Example Answer:
`j` is incremented by 1, and the initial value of `j` is 1. After execution, the value of `j` becomes 2. The values of `req` and `r` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `req` contains the value of `j+1`, `r` contains the same value as `req`, `i` is greater than 1, `j` is 2.
Output State: **`req` contains the value of `j+1`, `r` contains the same value as `req`, `i` is greater than 1, `j` is 2**
