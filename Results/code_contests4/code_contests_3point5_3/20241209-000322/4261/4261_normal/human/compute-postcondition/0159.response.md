According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be greater than 0 and `j` needs to be 1. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `req` contains unique values of 0 and `j`, `r` is now the same as `j` incremented by 1, `i` is updated by performing integer division with `k` raised to the power of the total number of times the loop executed and `i` is decreased by 1. 

Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`req` contains unique values of 0 and `j`, `r` is now the same as `j` incremented by 1, `i` is updated by performing integer division with `k` raised to the power of the total number of times the loop executed and `i` is decreased by 1; for the loop to execute again `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 1**
