Example Answer:
`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file. Since `sep` is assigned the value ' ' by default, it will write a space to the file. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is assigned the value ' ', `file` is assigned the value sys.stdout, `kwargs` is modified to remove 'sep' and 'file', `args` is a non-empty iterable, `at_start` is false.
Output State: **`sep` is assigned the value ' ', `file` is assigned the value sys.stdout, `kwargs` is modified to remove 'sep' and 'file', `args` is a non-empty iterable, `at_start` is false**
