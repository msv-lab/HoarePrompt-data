According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is updated by floor division of `i` by `k` raised to the power of `j` and then decreased by 1. So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the current value of `i` after the updates should be greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`req` is a set containing unique values of `j` obtained during the loop execution with the final incremented value of `j`, `n` and `k` are assigned valid values from `get_list()`, `li` contains at least 1 element, `r` is equal to the final value of `j`, `i` is updated by floor division of `i` by `k` raised to the power of `j` and decreased by 1, `j` is the final value after the loop, `j` is not in `req`, for the loop to execute again `i` is greater than 0**
