Example Answer:
`j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is unknown, so the new value of `j` is incremented by 1. The variable `req` should include the final value of `j`, and `i` should be updated based on the new value of `j`. 
Output State: **`j` is incremented by 1. `req` includes the final value of `j`, `i` is updated based on the new value of `j`**
