Example Answer:
`r` is assigned the value of `j`, where `j` contains unique values obtained during loop execution. The latest value added to `j` is also included in `r`. Therefore, the Output State is: `req` contains unique values of `j` obtained during the loop execution including the latest value added by the code; `r` contains the latest value of `j`.
Output State: **`req` contains unique values of `j` obtained during the loop execution including the latest value added by the code; `r` contains the latest value of `j`**
