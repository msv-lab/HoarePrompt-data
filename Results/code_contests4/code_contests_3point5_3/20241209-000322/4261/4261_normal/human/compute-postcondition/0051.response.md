Example Answer:
After the code execution, `j` is incremented by the value of `r`, which is the same as the value of `req`. The value of `req` remains the same as `j+1`, so after execution, `j` increases by `j+1`. The value of `i` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `req` contains the value of `j+1`, `r` contains the same value as `req`, `i` is the integer division of previous `i` by `k` raised to the power of `j`, `j` is incremented by the value of `r`.
Output State: **`req` contains the value of `j+1`, `r` contains the same value as `req`, `i` is the integer division of previous `i` by `k` raised to the power of `j`, `j` is incremented by the value of `r`**
