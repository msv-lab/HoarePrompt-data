Example Answer:
`req` now contains the value of `j` added to it. Since `j` is the final value after the loop and `j` is not in `req`, the only change is the addition of `j` to `req`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `req` contains unique values of `j` obtained during the loop execution including the latest value added by the code.
Output State: **`req` contains unique values of `j` obtained during the loop execution including the latest value added by the code**
