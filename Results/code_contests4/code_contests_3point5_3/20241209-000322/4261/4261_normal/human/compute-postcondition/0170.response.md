Example Answer:
`req` is updated by adding the value of `j`. Since `j` is not in `req` and `j` is unique, the value of `j` is added to `req`. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `req` contains unique values of 0, `j`; `r` is `j + 1`, `i` is updated by performing integer division with `k` raised to the power of `j` and becomes less than or equal to 0, `j` is the total number of times the loop executed, and `j` is incremented by `j + 1`.
