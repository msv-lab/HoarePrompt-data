Postcondition: ***`req` is a set containing unique values of `j` obtained during the loop execution with the final incremented value of `j`, `n` and `k` are assigned valid values from `get_list()`, `li` contains at least 1 element, `r` is 0, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is the maximum value that satisfies the loop condition and added to `req`, `j` is the final value after the loop, `i` is updated by floor division of `i` by `k` raised to the power of `j`. Additionally, `j` is not in `req`***
