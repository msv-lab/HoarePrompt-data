Example Answer:
`i` is updated by performing integer division with `k` raised to the power of `j`, where `j` is the total number of times the loop executed. The value of `i` becomes less than or equal to 0. The value of `r` is `j+1`. The values of `req` and other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `req` contains unique values of 0 and `j`, `r` is `j+1`, `i` is updated by performing integer division with `k` raised to the power of `j` and becomes less than or equal to 0, `j` is the total number of times the loop executed.
Output State: **`req` contains unique values of 0 and `j`, `r` is `j+1`, `i` is updated by performing integer division with `k` raised to the power of `j` and becomes less than or equal to 0, `j` is the total number of times the loop executed**
