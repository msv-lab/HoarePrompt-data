According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and `j`. If `i` modulo `k` raised to the power of `j + 1` is equal to 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `req` contains unique values of 0 and `j`, `r` is now the same as `j`, `i` is updated by performing integer division with `k` raised to the power of the total number of times the loop executed and `i` is decreased by 1; for the loop to execute again `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 0. So, in order for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be greater than 0 and `j` needs to be 0.
State: **`req` contains unique values of 0 and `j`, `r` is now the same as `j`, `i` is updated by performing integer division with `k` raised to the power of the total number of times the loop executed and `i` is decreased by 1; for the loop to execute again `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 0**
