Example Answer:
`r` is assigned the value of `j`, which means `r` now holds the same value as `j`. The values of `req`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `req` contains unique values of 0 and `j`; `r` is now the same as `j`; `i` is updated by performing integer division with `k` raised to the power of the total number of times the loop executed.
Output State: **`req` contains unique values of 0 and `j`; `r` is now the same as `j`; `i` is updated by performing integer division with `k` raised to the power of the total number of times the loop executed**
