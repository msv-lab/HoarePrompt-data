Example Answer:
`sep` and `file` are assigned values based on the keyword arguments `kwargs`. If `'sep'` is not present in `kwargs`, `sep` is assigned the value `' '`. If `'file'` is not present in `kwargs`, `file` is assigned the value `sys.stdout`. The variables `kwargs`, `sep`, and `file` are affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **`sep` is assigned the value ' ' if not provided, `file` is assigned the value sys.stdout if not provided, `kwargs` is modified to remove 'sep' and 'file'**
