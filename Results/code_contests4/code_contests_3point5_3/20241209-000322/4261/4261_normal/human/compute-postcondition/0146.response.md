Example Answer: 
`i` is updated by performing integer division with `k` raised to the power of `j`. The value of `k` is not provided, but `j` is incremented by the total number of times the loop executed. As a result, the new value of `i` will be the integer division of the previous value of `i` and `k` raised to the power of the total number of times the loop executed. The values of `req` and `r` remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`req` contains unique values of 0; `r` is 0; `j` is incremented by the total number of times the loop executed; `i` is updated by performing integer division with `k` raised to the power of the total number of times the loop executed**
