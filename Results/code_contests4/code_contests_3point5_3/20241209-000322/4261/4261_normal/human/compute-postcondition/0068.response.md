According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`. At the end of the previous iteration, `req` is a set containing unique values of `j` obtained during the loop execution with the incremented value of `j`, `n` and `k` are assigned valid values from `get_list()`, `li` contains at least 1 element, `r` is 0, `i` is greater than 0, `i % k`, and `j` is incremented by 1. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
1. `j` needs to be incremented by 1 again.
2. There should be valid values assigned to `n` and `k` from the `get_list()` function.
3. The condition `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0` needs to evaluate to true for the loop to continue, so the values of `i`, `k`, and `j` should be such that the condition holds true.
4. The set `req` should include the new value of `j` obtained during the loop execution.

State: **`req` is a set containing unique values of `j` obtained during the loop execution with the incremented value of `j`, `n` and `k` are assigned valid values from `get_list()`, `li` contains at least 1 element, `r` is 0, `i` is greater than 0, `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0` for the loop to execute again**
