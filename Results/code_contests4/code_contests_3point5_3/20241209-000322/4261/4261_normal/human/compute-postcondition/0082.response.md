According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and `j`. If `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `req` is a set containing unique values of `j` obtained during the loop execution with the final incremented value of `j`, `n` and `k` are assigned valid values from `get_list()`, `li` contains at least 1 element, `r` is equal to the final value of `j`, `i` is updated by floor division of `i` by `k` raised to the power of `j` and decreased by 1, `j` is the final value after the loop, `j` is not in `req`, for the loop to execute again `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 0. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` needs to be greater than 0 for the loop to execute the first time.
- `j` needs to be 0 for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`req` is a set containing unique values of `j` obtained during the loop execution with the final incremented value of `j`, `n` and `k` are assigned valid values from `get_list()`, `li` contains at least 1 element, `r` is equal to the final value of `j`, `i` is updated by floor division of `i` by `k` raised to the power of `j` and decreased by 1, `j` is the final value after the loop, `j` is not in `req`, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is 0**.
