According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and `j`. If `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than 0 after decreasing by 1, `j` is 2. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `i` needs to be greater than 0 (after decreasing by 1 again)
- `k` and `j` can remain the same as they are not involved in the condition check.

State: **`req` is a set containing the value of `j`, `n` and `k` are assigned valid values from `get_list()`, `li` contains at least 1 element, `r` is assigned the value of `j`, `i` is greater than 0 after decreasing by 2, `j` is 2**
