Output State: **The program returns the final value of `j` after the loop execution, which is added to the set `req` containing unique values of `j` during the loop. The value of `i` is updated by the floor division of `i` by `k` raised to the power of `j`, where `n` and `k` are assigned valid values from `get_list()`. `li` contains at least 1 element, `r` is 0, `i` is greater than 0, and `j` is the maximum value satisfying the loop condition.**
