According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. Since `i` is 0 right before the loop, the loop will not execute unless `i` is adjusted to be greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`req` is a set containing unique values of `j` obtained during the loop execution, `n` and `k` are assigned valid values from `get_list()`, `li` contains at least 1 element, `r` contains the last value of `j` reached during the loop, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is the maximum value that satisfies the loop condition, all values of `j` added to `req`, `r` is 0**
