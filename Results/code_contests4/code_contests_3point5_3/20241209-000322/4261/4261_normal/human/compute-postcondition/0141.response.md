According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and `j`. If `i % k ** (j + 1)` is equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `req` contains unique values of 0, `r` is 0, `j` is incremented by 1, and `i` is decreased by 1. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be such that `i % k ** (j + 2)` is equal to 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`req` contains unique values of 0; `r` is 0; `j` is incremented by 1; `i` is decreased by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `i % k ** (j + 2) == 0`**
