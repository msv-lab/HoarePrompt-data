Example Answer:
`j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is unknown, so the new value of `j` will be the incremented value. The variables `req` and `i` are dependent on the new value of `j` for the loop to execute again, but their specific values are not provided. Therefore, the Output State is: For the loop to execute again, the next value of `j` should be considered, `req` includes the updated final value of `j`, and `i` should be adjusted based on the new value of `j`.
Output State: **For the loop to execute again, the next value of `j` should be considered, `req` includes the updated final value of `j`, and `i` should be adjusted based on the new value of `j`**
