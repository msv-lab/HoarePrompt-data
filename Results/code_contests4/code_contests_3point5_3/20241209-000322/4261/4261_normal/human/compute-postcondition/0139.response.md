According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and `j`. If `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `req` contains unique values of 0, `r` is 0, `j` is added to `req`, and `i` is decreased by 1. In order for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to satisfy the condition `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`. Hence, the adjustment needed is for `i` to be such that `i % k ** (j + 2) == 0`.
State: **`req` contains unique values of 0; `r` is 0; `j` is added to `req`; `i` is decreased by 1, for the loop to execute the first time `i % k ** (j + 2) == 0`**
