According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `k`. The condition `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0` needs to be satisfied for the loop to execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `req` contains unique values of 0, `r` is 0, `j` is incremented by 1, and `i` is decreased by 1. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be such that `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0` after the adjustments.

State: **`req` contains unique values of 0, `r` is 0, `j` is incremented by 1, `i` is decreased by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`**
