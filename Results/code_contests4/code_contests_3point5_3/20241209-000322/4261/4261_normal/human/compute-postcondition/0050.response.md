Example Answer:
The value of `i` is integer divided by `k` raised to the power of `j`. The previous value of `i` is greater than 1, `req` contains the value of `j+1`, `r` contains the same value as `req`, and `j` is equal to the number of iterations the loop executed. Since `req` and `r` are dependent on `j`, and `i` is altered by the operation, the new values of `req`, `r`, and `i` will be affected. 
Output State: **`req` contains the value of `j+1`, `r` contains the same value as `req`, `i` is the integer division of previous `i` by `k` raised to the power of `j`**
