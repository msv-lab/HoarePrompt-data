According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are elements left in the list `li`. At the end of the last iteration, `req` is a set containing unique values of `j` obtained during the loop execution, `n` and `k` are assigned valid values from `get_list()`, `li` contains at least 1 element, `r` contains the last value of `j` reached during the loop, `i` is 0, `j` is the maximum value that satisfies the loop condition. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the list `li` must still have elements left.
State: **`req` is a set containing unique values of `j` obtained during the loop execution, `n` and `k` are assigned valid values from `get_list()`, `li` contains at least 1 element, `r` contains the last value of `j` reached during the loop, `i` is 0, `j` is the maximum value that satisfies the loop condition, all values of `j` added to `req`**.
