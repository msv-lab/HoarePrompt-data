According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute one more time. 
At the end of the last iteration, `req` contains unique values of 0 and `j`, `r` is now the same as `j`, `i` is updated by performing integer division with `k` raised to the power of the total number of times the loop executed, and `i` is decreased by 1.
For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 0.
State: **`req` contains unique values of 0 and `j`, `r` is now the same as `j`, `i` is updated by performing integer division with `k` raised to the power of the total number of times the loop executed and `i` is decreased by 1; for the loop to execute again `i` is greater than 0**
