Example Answer:
`at_start` is assigned the boolean value `True`. The variables `sep`, `file`, and `kwargs` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is assigned the value ' ' if not provided, `file` is assigned the value sys.stdout if not provided, `kwargs` is modified to remove 'sep' and 'file'.
Output State: **`sep` is assigned the value ' ' if not provided, `file` is assigned the value sys.stdout if not provided, `kwargs` is modified to remove 'sep' and 'file'**
