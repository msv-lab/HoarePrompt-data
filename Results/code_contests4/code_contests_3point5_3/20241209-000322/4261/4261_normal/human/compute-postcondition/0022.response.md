Example Answer: 
The `flush()` method is called on the `file` object, which causes the contents of the buffer to be written to the file. Since `file` is assigned the value `sys.stdout`, the buffer of the standard output is flushed. The value of `sep`, `kwargs`, `args`, `at_start`, and the 'end' key remain unchanged. However, the 'flush' key is removed from `kwargs`. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is assigned the value ' ' if not provided, `file` is assigned the value sys.stdout, `kwargs` is modified to remove 'sep' and 'file', `args` is an empty iterable, `at_start` is False, the value of 'end' key from `kwargs` is written to the file, and kwargs has 'flush' key removed.
Output State: **`sep` is assigned the value ' ' if not provided, `file` is assigned the value sys.stdout, `kwargs` is modified to remove 'sep' and 'file', `args` is an empty iterable, `at_start` is False, the value of 'end' key from `kwargs` is written to the file, and kwargs has 'flush' key removed**
