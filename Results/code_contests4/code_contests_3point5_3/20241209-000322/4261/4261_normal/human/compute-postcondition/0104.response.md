According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the conditions `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`. At the end of the last iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:

1. `j`: Since `j` is the final value after the loop and is added to `req`, it needs to be increased by 1 for the next iteration.
2. `i`: As `i` is updated by floor division of `i` by `k` raised to the power of `j` and decreased by 1, it needs to be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again. Therefore, it should be adjusted such that `i` is greater than 0.
3. `j`: Since `j` is increased by `r+1`, it should be adjusted to `j` is 1 for the next iteration.

State: **Output State: `req` is a set containing unique values of `j` obtained during the loop execution, `n` and `k` are assigned valid values from `get_list()`, `li` contains at least 1 element, `r` is equal to the final value of `j`, `i` is updated by floor division of `i` by `k` raised to the power of `j` and decreased by 1, `j` is the final value after the loop and is added to `req`, `i` is not divisible by `k`, `j` is increased by `r+1`, `i` is decreased by 1, for the loop to execute again `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `j` is increased by 1**
