According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, the following adjustments need to be made for the loop to execute one more time:
1. `i` should be greater than 0.
2. `j` should not be in `req`.
3. `i` should be decreased by 1.
4. `j` should be increased by `r`.

State: **`req` is a set containing unique values of `j` obtained during the loop execution, `n` and `k` are assigned valid values from `get_list()`, `li` contains at least 1 element, `r` is equal to the final value of `j`, `i` is updated by floor division of `i` by `k` raised to the power of `j` and decreased by 1, `j` is the final value after the loop and is added to `req`, `i` is not divisible by `k`, `j` is increased by `r`. Additionally, `j` is not in `req`, `i` is decreased by 1, for the loop to execute again `i` is greater than 0**
