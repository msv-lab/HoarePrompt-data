According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are more elements in the `args` iterable. At the end of the last iteration, `sep` is assigned the value ' ', `file` is assigned the value sys.stdout, `kwargs` is modified to remove 'sep' and 'file', `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, `at_start` is False. 

To execute the loop one more time, the next element in `args` will be processed. Therefore, `args` must still be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element after the last iteration.
State: **`sep` is assigned the value ' ', `file` is assigned the value sys.stdout, `kwargs` is modified to remove 'sep' and 'file', `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least one more element after the last iteration, `at_start` is False**
