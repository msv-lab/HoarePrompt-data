According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are elements in the iterable `args`. At the end of the previous iteration, `sep` is assigned the value ' ' if not provided, `file` is assigned the value sys.stdout if not provided, `kwargs` is modified to remove 'sep' and 'file', `args` is a non-empty iterable, and `at_start` is false after the execution of the if-else block. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`sep` is assigned the value ' ' if not provided, `file` is assigned the value sys.stdout if not provided, `kwargs` is modified to remove 'sep' and 'file', `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, `at_start` is false after the execution of the if-else block**
