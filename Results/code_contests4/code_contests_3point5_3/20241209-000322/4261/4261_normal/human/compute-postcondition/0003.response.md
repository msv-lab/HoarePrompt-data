According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `args`. If args is a non-empty iterable, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `sep` is assigned the value ' ' if not provided, `file` is assigned the value sys.stdout if not provided, and `kwargs` is modified to remove 'sep' and 'file'. So, for the loop to execute, `args` must be a non-empty iterable.
State: **`sep` is assigned the value ' ' if not provided, `file` is assigned the value sys.stdout if not provided, `kwargs` is modified to remove 'sep' and 'file', for the loop to execute `args` is a non-empty iterable**
