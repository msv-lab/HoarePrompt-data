According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and `j`. If `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `req` is a set containing unique values of `j` obtained during the loop execution with the incremented value of `j`, `n` and `k` are assigned valid values from `get_list()`, `li` contains at least 1 element, `r` is 0, `i` is greater than 0. In order for the loop to execute one more time, the values of `i`, `k`, and `j` need to be adjusted so that `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0` is still satisfied. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`req` is a set containing unique values of `j` obtained during the loop execution with the incremented value of `j`, `n` and `k` are assigned valid values from `get_list()`, `li` contains at least 1 element, `r` is 0, `i` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute again `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`**
