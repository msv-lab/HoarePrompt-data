Example Answer:
`r` is assigned the value of `j`, and `j` is the initial value of `req`, so after execution, `r` contains the same value as `req`. Therefore, the Output State is: `req` now contains the value of `j`, `r` contains the same value as `req`.
Output State: **`req` now contains the value of `j`, `r` contains the same value as `req`**
