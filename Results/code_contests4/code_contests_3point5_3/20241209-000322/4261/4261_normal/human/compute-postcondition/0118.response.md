Example Answer:
`r` is assigned the value 0. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `req` is a set containing unique values of `j` obtained during the loop execution, `n` and `k` are assigned valid values from `get_list()`, `li` contains at least 2 elements, `r` is 0, `i` is the next element in `li` after the last iteration, `j` is updated to the next value for the next iteration.
Output State: **`req` is a set containing unique values of `j` obtained during the loop execution, `n` and `k` are assigned valid values from `get_list()`, `li` contains at least 2 elements, `r` is 0, `i` is the next element in `li` after the last iteration, `j` is updated to the next value for the next iteration**
