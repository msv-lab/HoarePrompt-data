According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `r` is 0 and `i` is the next element in `li` after the last iteration. For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`req` is a set containing unique values of `j` obtained during the loop execution, `n` and `k` are assigned valid values from `get_list()`, `li` contains at least 2 elements, `r` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is greater than 0**
