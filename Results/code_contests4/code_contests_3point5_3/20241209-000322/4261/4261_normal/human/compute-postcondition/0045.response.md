According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and `j`. If `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, and `req` contains the value of j+1, and `r` contains the same value as `req`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the value of `j` needs to be adjusted to 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **Output State: req contains the value of j+1, r contains the same value as req, i is greater than 1, j is equal to 0**
