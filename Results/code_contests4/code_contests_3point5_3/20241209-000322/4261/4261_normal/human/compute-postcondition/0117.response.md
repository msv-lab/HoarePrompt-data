According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `li`. If there are more elements in `li` to iterate through, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `req` is a set containing unique values of `j`, `n` and `k` have valid values from `get_list()`, `li` contains at least 1 element, `r` is equal to the final value of `j`, `i` is the last element in `li`, `j` has been updated to the final value after the last iteration. So for the loop to execute one more time, there must be more elements in `li` to iterate through, and `i` should be the next element in `li` after the last iteration.
State: **`req` is a set containing unique values of `j` obtained during the loop execution, `n` and `k` are assigned valid values from `get_list()`, `li` contains at least 2 elements, `r` is equal to the final value of `j`, `i` is the next element in `li` after the last iteration, `j` is updated to the next value for the next iteration**
