According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `req` contains the value of `j`, `r` contains the same value as `req`, and `i` is decreased by 1. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be greater than 1.
State: **`req` now contains the value of `j`, `r` contains the same value as `req`, `i` is decreased by 1, for the loop to execute again `i` is greater than 1**
