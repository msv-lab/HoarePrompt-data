Example Answer:
`at_start` is directly assigned the value `False`, which indicates that `at_start` is set to `False` after the execution. The other variables mentioned in the initial state are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is assigned the value ' ' if not provided, `file` is assigned the value sys.stdout if not provided, `kwargs` is modified to remove 'sep' and 'file', `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, `at_start` is False.
Output State: **`sep` is assigned the value ' ' if not provided, `file` is assigned the value sys.stdout if not provided, `kwargs` is modified to remove 'sep' and 'file', `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, `at_start` is False**
