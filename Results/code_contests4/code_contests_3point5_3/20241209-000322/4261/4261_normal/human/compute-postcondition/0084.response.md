According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the conditions `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`. At the end of the last iteration, the states are as follows:
- `req` is a set containing unique values of `j` obtained during the loop execution with the final incremented value of `j`
- `n` and `k` are assigned valid values from `get_list()`
- `li` contains at least 1 element
- `r` is equal to the final value of `j`
- `i` is updated by floor division of `i` by `k` raised to the power of `j` and decreased by 1
- `j` is the final value after the loop
- `j` is not in `req`
- For the loop to execute the first time, `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is 0
- `j` is incremented by 1

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- `j` needs to be added to the `req` set
- `i` needs to be updated based on the new value of `j` and the conditions specified
- `j` needs to be incremented by 1

State: **Adjust `req` to include the final value of `j`, update `i` based on new value of `j`, increment `j` by 1**
