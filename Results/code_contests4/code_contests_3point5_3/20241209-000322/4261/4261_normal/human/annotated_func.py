    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `req` is a set containing unique values of `j` obtained during the entire loop execution, `n` and `k` retain their assigned valid values from `get_list()`, `li` still contains at least 1 element, `r` is the maximum value of `j` obtained during the loop, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, loop control variables have reached their final values
    func_2('YES')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It iterates through a list `li`, calculates certain values based on `n` and `k`, and performs different operations based on various conditions. It updates variables such as `req`, `r`, `i`, and `j` during the loop execution. It may call another function `func_2` with the argument 'NO' under specific circumstances. The final state includes the set `req` containing unique values of `j`, `n` and `k` retaining their assigned valid values, and `li` still containing at least one element.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sep` is assigned the value ' ' if not provided, `file` is assigned the value sys.stdout if not provided, `kwargs` is modified to remove 'sep' and 'file', `args` is an empty iterable, `at_start` is False
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *'sep' is assigned the value ' ' if not provided, 'file' is assigned the value sys.stdout, 'kwargs' is modified to remove 'sep', 'file', and 'flush', 'args' is an empty iterable, 'at_start' is False, and the value of 'end' key from 'kwargs' is written to the file.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_2 does not accept any parameters. It reads the values from 'args' and writes them to the standard output stream with 'sep' as the separator between values. If the 'end' key is present in 'kwargs', its value is written at the end. If the 'flush' key is True in 'kwargs', the output stream is flushed. The function does not return any value, but the annotations incorrectly state that it returns the string "Hello, World!".
