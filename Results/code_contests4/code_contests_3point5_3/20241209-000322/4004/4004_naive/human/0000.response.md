Correctness: **False**

The given program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. It checks for the input character to be in the list `['a', 'i', 'u', 'e', 'o']`, which is incorrect as the problem description specifies that the vowels are `a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, and `u`. Therefore, the program will not correctly identify all vowels.
