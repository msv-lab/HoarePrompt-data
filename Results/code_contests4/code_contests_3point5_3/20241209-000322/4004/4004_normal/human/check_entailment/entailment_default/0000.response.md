Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
The code provided does not match the problem description. The problem requires determining whether a given lowercase English letter is a vowel or a consonant, while the code checks if the input matches a specific set of vowels ('a', 'i', 'u', 'e', 'o') and prints 'YES' if it does and 'NO' if it doesn't. This means that for consonants other than the ones listed in the code, the output will be 'NO' which is incorrect according to the problem description. The code is not handling the case for consonants that are not 'a', 'i', 'u', 'e', or 'o'. 

For example, if the input is 's', the code will output 'NO' according to the code logic, but the correct output should be 'consonant' as per the problem description. Therefore, the code does not handle all potential cases as required by the problem description, making the correctness **False**.
