Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not exactly follow the problem description. The problem description states that if the input lowercase English letter is a vowel, the program should print `vowel`, otherwise `consonant`. However, the program prints `YES` if the input is a vowel and `NO` if it is a consonant, which is not the expected output.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
