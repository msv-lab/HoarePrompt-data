Correctness: **True**

The annotated program provided correctly implements the problem description. It takes a lowercase English letter as input and checks if it is a vowel ('a', 'i', 'u', 'e', 'o'). If the input is a vowel, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The program handles all cases as described in the problem description and therefore, it is correct.
