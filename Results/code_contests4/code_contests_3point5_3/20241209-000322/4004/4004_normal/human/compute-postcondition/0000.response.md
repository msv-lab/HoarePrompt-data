Example Answer:
The code checks if the input received from `raw_input()` is in the list ['a', 'i', 'u', 'e', 'o']. If the input is one of these vowels, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'. Since the initial state is that `c` is a lowercase English letter, the output will be 'YES' if `c` is one of the vowels mentioned in the list, and 'NO' otherwise.
Output State: **c is a lowercase English letter, the output will be 'YES' if c is a vowel ('a', 'i', 'u', 'e', 'o'), and 'NO' if c is not in the list of vowels.**
