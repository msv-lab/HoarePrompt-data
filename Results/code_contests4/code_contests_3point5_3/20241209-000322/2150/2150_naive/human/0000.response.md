Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly determine the maximum number of edges that can be removed in such a way that all the remaining connected components will have even size. The issue lies in the implementation of the function `func_2(node)`. The function calculates the size of each subtree rooted at a particular node, but it does not account for the case when a subtree contains an odd number of vertices.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
1 2
1 3
```
The correct output should be -1, as it is impossible to remove edges in such a way that all components have an even number of vertices. However, the given program will output an incorrect value because it does not consider the scenario where a subtree has an odd number of vertices.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
