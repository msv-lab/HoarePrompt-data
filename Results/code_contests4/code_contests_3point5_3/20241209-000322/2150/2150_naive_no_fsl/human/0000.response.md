Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of edges that can be removed in such a way that all remaining connected components will have even size. It traverses the tree using depth-first search and keeps track of the sizes of each subtree. The program then checks if the size of each edge is even and increments the count accordingly. The program covers all potential cases and provides the correct output for the given problem description.
