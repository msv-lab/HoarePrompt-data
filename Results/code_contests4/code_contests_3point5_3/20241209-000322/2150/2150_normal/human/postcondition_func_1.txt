The function `func_2` accepts an integer `node` representing a vertex in a tree. The tree is defined by `n` vertices and `n-1` edges connecting these vertices. The function checks if the `node` is already in the `seen` set. If it is, the function returns 0. If the `node` has neighbors, the function recursively calculates the sum of return values of `func_2` for all neighbors in `E[node]` and stores it in `sz[node]`. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to either return 0 if the node is already seen or return the sum of return values of all neighbors in the tree.
