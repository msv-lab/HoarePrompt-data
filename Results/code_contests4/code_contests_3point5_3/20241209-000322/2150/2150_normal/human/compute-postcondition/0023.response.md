Example Answer:
`a` is added to the set `seen`. If `a` is already in `seen`, then the set remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `seen` is a set containing elements in E[a], `cnt` is 2, `Q` is a non-empty list with all elements in E[a] appended for the loop to execute again.
Output State: **`seen` is a set containing elements in E[a], `cnt` is 2, `Q` is a non-empty list with all elements in E[a] appended for the loop to execute again**
