Example Answer:
`node` is added to the set `seen`. Since `node` was not in `seen` previously, it is now added to the set. Therefore, the output state is: `The code prints the value of the variable `node`. `node` is not in the list `seen`, `node` has been added to `seen`.
Output State: **The code prints the value of the variable `node`. `node` is not in the list `seen`, `node` has been added to `seen`**
