Example Answer:
The element `b` is appended to the list `Q`. The list `Q` already contains all elements in `E[a] and `a`, so after appending `b`, the list `Q` will have all elements in `E[a] and `a` along with `b`. Therefore, the Output State is: `seen` contains elements in `E[a] with the additional element `a` added, `cnt` is 3, `Q` is a non-empty list with all elements in `E[a] and `a` along with `b`, `b` is the next element in `E[a]` after the last iteration.
Output State: **`seen` contains elements in `E[a] with the additional element `a` added, `cnt` is 3, `Q` is a non-empty list with all elements in `E[a] and `a` along with `b`, `b` is the next element in `E[a]` after the last iteration.**
