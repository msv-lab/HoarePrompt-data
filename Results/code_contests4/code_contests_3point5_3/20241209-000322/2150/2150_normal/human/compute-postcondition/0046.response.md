The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers. The input tree is represented as a list of edges where each edge is a tuple of two integers `u, v` representing the vertices connected by the edge. The program returns the total number of unique elements in list `E`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, where `a` represents the input tree as a list of edges. It returns the total number of unique elements in the list `E`.**
