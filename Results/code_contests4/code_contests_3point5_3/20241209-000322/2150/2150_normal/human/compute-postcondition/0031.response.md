According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the list `Q` is non-empty. At the end of the last iteration, `Q` is non-empty. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, no adjustments are needed to the states.
State: **`seen` is a set containing elements in `E[a]`, `cnt` is 2, `Q` is a non-empty list with all elements in `E[a]` appended for each iteration of the loop**
