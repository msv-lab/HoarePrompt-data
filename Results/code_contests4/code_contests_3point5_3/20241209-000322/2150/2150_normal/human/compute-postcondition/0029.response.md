Example Answer:
`b` is appended to the end of list `Q`, so the next element in `E[a]` is added to the end of `Q`. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `seen` is a set containing elements in `E[a]`, `cnt` is 3, `Q` is a non-empty list with all elements in `E[a]` and the next two elements in `E[a]` appended to it.
Output State: **`seen` is a set containing elements in `E[a]`, `cnt` is 3, `Q` is a non-empty list with all elements in `E[a]` and the next two elements in `E[a]` appended to it**
