According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the neighbors in E[node]. If there are more neighbors in E[node] to iterate over, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the value of the first neighbor in E[node] is printed, sz[node] is incremented by the return value of func_2(neigh) for each neighbor in E[node]. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more neighbor in E[node] to iterate over and the state should reflect that sz[node] has been updated accordingly.
State: **The value of the first neighbor in E[node] is printed, sz[node] is updated, there are more neighbors in E[node] to iterate over**
