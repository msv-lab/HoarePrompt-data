Example Answer:
The code `continue` will skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified within the loop, the values of `seen`, `cnt`, and `Q` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `seen` is a set containing elements in `E[a]`, `cnt` is 2, `Q` is a non-empty list with all elements in `E[a]` appended for each iteration of the loop.
Output State: **`seen` is a set containing elements in `E[a]`, `cnt` is 2, `Q` is a non-empty list with all elements in `E[a]` appended for each iteration of the loop**
