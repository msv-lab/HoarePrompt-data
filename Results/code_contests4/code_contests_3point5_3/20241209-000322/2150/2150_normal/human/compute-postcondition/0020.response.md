Example Answer: 
The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it skips the current iteration of the loop and continues with the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State remains the same: `seen` is a set containing elements in E[a], `cnt` is 1, `Q` is a non-empty list with all elements in E[a] appended for the loop to execute again.
Output State: **`seen` is a set containing elements in E[a], `cnt` is 1, `Q` is a non-empty list with all elements in E[a] appended for the loop to execute again**
