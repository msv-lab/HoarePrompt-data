According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list E[node]. If there are more neighbors to iterate over, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the previous iteration, the value of the first neighbor in E[node] is printed, and sz[node] is incremented by the return value of func_2(neigh). 

To execute the loop one more time, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **The value of the first neighbor in E[node] is printed, sz[node] is incremented by the return value of func_2(neigh), there are more neighbors in E[node] to iterate over**
