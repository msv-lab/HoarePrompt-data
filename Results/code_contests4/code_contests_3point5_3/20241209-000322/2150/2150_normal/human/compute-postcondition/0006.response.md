According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `E[node]`. If `E[node]` has at least one neighbor, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `node` has been added to `seen` and `sz[node]` is assigned the value 1. So for the loop to execute the first time, `E[node]` must have at least one neighbor, `neigh` is the first neighbor in `E[node]`.
State: **`node` is not in the list `seen`, `node` has been added to `seen`, `sz[node]` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `E[node]` has at least one neighbor, `neigh` is the first neighbor in `E[node]`**
