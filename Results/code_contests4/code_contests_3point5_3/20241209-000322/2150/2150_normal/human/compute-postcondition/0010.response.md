Example Answer:
The value of the first neighbor in E[node] is printed using `print(neigh)`. The variable `sz[node]` is then incremented by the return value of `func_2(neigh)`. Since there are more neighbors in E[node] to iterate over, the program continues to the next iteration. 
Output State: **The value of the first neighbor in E[node] is printed, sz[node] is incremented by the return value of func_2(neigh), there are more neighbors in E[node] to iterate over**
