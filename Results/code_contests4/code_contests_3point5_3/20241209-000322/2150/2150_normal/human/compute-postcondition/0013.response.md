Example Answer:
The code prints the value of the first neighbor in E[node] without modifying the variables. Therefore, the Output State is: The value of the first neighbor in E[node] is printed, sz[node] is updated, there are more neighbors in E[node] to iterate over.
Output State: **The value of the first neighbor in E[node] is printed, sz[node] is updated, there are more neighbors in E[node] to iterate over**
