Example Answer:
The value of the first neighbor in E[node] is printed, then sz[node] is incremented by the return value of func_2(neigh) for each neighbor in E[node]. There are more neighbors in E[node] to iterate over.
Output State: **The value of the first neighbor in E[node] is printed, sz[node] is incremented by the return value of func_2(neigh) for each neighbor in E[node], there are more neighbors in E[node] to iterate over**
