Example Answer:
`sz[node]` is incremented by the return value of `func_2(neigh)`. Since we know the value of the first neighbor in `E[node]`, we can calculate the result based on that value and the specific behavior of `func_2(neigh)`. 
Output State: **The value of the first neighbor in E[node] is printed, sz[node] is incremented by the return value of func_2(neigh)**
