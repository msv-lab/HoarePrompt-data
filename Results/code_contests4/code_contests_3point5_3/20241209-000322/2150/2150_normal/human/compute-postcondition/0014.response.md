Example Answer: 
`sz[node]` is updated by adding the return value of `func_2(neigh)`. The value of `sz[node]` prior to this operation is unknown. Assuming `func_2(neigh)` returns a specific value, let's say 5, then `sz[node]` will be updated by adding 5. The first neighbor in E[node] is printed, and there are more neighbors in E[node] to iterate over. Therefore, the Output State is: The value of the first neighbor in E[node] is printed, `sz[node]` is updated by adding 5, there are more neighbors in E[node] to iterate over.
Output State: **The value of the first neighbor in E[node] is printed, `sz[node]` is updated by adding 5, there are more neighbors in E[node] to iterate over**
