Example Answer:
`b` is appended to the list `Q`. The previous values of the variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `seen` contains elements in `E[a] with the additional element `a` added, `cnt` is 3, `Q` is a non-empty list with all elements in `E[a] and `a`, `b` is the next element in `E[a]` after the last iteration, `b` is appended to the list `Q`.
Output State: **`seen` contains elements in `E[a] with the additional element `a` added, `cnt` is 3, `Q` is a non-empty list with all elements in `E[a] and `a`, `b` is the next element in `E[a]` after the last iteration, `b` is appended to the list `Q`**
