Example Answer:
The value of `a` is assigned the value popped from the left of the list `Q`. The set `seen` contains elements from `E[a]`, `cnt` remains 2, and `Q` is a non-empty list with elements from `E[a]` appended for each iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `seen` is a set containing elements in `E[a]`, `cnt` is 2, `Q` is a non-empty list with all elements in `E[a]` appended for each iteration of the loop.
Output State: **`seen` is a set containing elements in `E[a]`, `cnt` is 2, `Q` is a non-empty list with all elements in `E[a]` appended for each iteration of the loop**
