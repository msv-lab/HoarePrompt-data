The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `node`. `node` is an integer representing a vertex in a tree. The tree is represented by n vertices and n-1 edges connecting these vertices. The parameter constraints are such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. 

The functionality of the function `func_2` has two cases:
Case 1: If the input `node` does not have any neighbors, the function returns 0.
Case 2: If the input `node` has neighbors, the function returns the sum of the return values of `func_2` for all neighbors in `E[node]`, where `E[node]` represents the neighbors of the current node stored in `sz[node]`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept an integer `node` representing a vertex in a tree, and based on the presence of neighbors, either return 0 or the sum of return values of `func_2` for all neighbors.
