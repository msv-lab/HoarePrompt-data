Example Answer: 
The element `b` is appended to the list `Q`. The set `seen` remains the same as before, containing elements in `E[a]`. The value of `cnt` remains 2 as before. Since `b` iterates over elements in `E[a]`, the loop will execute again. Therefore, the Output State is: `seen` is a set containing elements in `E[a]`, `cnt` is 2, `Q` is a non-empty list with all elements in `E[a]` and `b` appended.
Output State: **`seen` is a set containing elements in `E[a]`, `cnt` is 2, `Q` is a non-empty list with all elements in `E[a]` and `b` appended**
