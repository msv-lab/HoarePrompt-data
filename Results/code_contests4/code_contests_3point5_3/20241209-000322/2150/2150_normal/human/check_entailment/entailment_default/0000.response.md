Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_2` calculates the number of cuts that need to be made in order to leave all connected components with even size, but it does not always return the correct output.

One potential case where the code does not work as expected is when the input tree has a single vertex (i.e., `n = 1`). In this case, the code should output `-1` since it is impossible to remove any edges to satisfy the property of all connected components having even size. However, the code does not handle this case explicitly and will proceed with the calculations, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, making the correctness **False**.
