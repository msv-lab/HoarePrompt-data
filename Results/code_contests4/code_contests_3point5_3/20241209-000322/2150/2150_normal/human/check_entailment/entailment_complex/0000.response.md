Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not fully adhere to the problem description. The function `func_2` seems to be calculating the size of each subtree rooted at a particular node, but it is not directly calculating the maximum number of edges that can be removed to leave all connected components with even size. The code annotations do not provide an example of how the program would handle this specific requirement. Therefore, the code does not completely follow the problem description for every potential case.
