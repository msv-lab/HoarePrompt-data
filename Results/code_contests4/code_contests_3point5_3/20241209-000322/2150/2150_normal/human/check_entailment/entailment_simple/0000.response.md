Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
1. The provided annotated program consists of two functions `func_1` and `func_2` but does not include the main logic to solve the given problem. The problem requires determining the maximum number of edges that can be removed to leave all connected components with even size, which is not implemented in the provided code.
2. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` appear to be incomplete and do not directly address the problem of finding the maximum number of edges to be removed.
3. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not utilized to calculate the maximum number of edges that can be removed to satisfy the conditions mentioned in the problem description.
4. The provided code does not output the desired result as specified in the problem description for any input case.
5. Overall, the annotated program is not correct as it does not fulfill the requirements of the given problem.
