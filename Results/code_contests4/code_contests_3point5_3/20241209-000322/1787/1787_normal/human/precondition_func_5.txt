**Precondition**: **t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the length of the password, followed by n positive integers a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) representing the initial contents of the password.**
