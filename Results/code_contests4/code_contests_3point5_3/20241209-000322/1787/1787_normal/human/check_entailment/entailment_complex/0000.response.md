Correctness: **True**

Explanation: After reviewing the code and the annotations provided, it seems that the code correctly implements the problem description. The functions are designed to handle the calculations required for finding the shortest possible length of the password after some number of operations. The main function `func_12` processes the test cases by checking if all elements in the password are equal and printing the appropriate output. The annotations provide insights into the functionality of each function, and from the code itself, there are no obvious discrepancies that would cause the program to deviate from the problem description. Additionally, all examples provided in the problem description seem to be handled correctly by the code. Hence, based on the code and annotations, the correctness of the program is deemed to be true.
