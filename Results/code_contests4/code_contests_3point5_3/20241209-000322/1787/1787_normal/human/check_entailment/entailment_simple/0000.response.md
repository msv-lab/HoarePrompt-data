Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the solution to the problem described. It consists of functions that calculate factorials, modular inverses, greatest common divisor, and other mathematical operations required to determine the shortest possible length of the password after applying the defined operation.

The main function `func_12` reads the input for each test case, checks if all elements of the array except the first one are equal, and prints the appropriate output based on the condition mentioned in the problem description. The logic within the `func_12` function correctly follows the problem requirements and produces the expected output.

Overall, the program adheres to the problem description and provides the correct solution for determining the shortest possible length of the password after some number of operations.
