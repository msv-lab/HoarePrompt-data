You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Lord Omkar has permitted you to enter the Holy Church of Omkar! To test your worthiness, Omkar gives you a password which you must interpret!

A password is an array a of n positive integers. You apply the following operation to the array: pick any two adjacent numbers that are not equal to each other and replace them with their sum. Formally, choose an index i such that 1 ≤ i < n and a_{i} ≠ a_{i+1}, delete both a_i and a_{i+1} from the array and put a_{i}+a_{i+1} in their place. 

For example, for array [7, 4, 3, 7] you can choose i = 2 and the array will become [7, 4+3, 7] = [7, 7, 7]. Note that in this array you can't apply this operation anymore.

Notice that one operation will decrease the size of the password by 1. What is the shortest possible length of the password after some number (possibly 0) of operations?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the length of the password.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the initial contents of your password.

The sum of n over all test cases will not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each password, print one integer: the shortest possible length of the password after some number of operations.

Example

Input


2
4
2 1 3 1
2
420 420


Output


1
2

Note

In the first test case, you can do the following to achieve a length of 1:

Pick i=2 to get [2, 4, 1]

Pick i=1 to get [6, 1]

Pick i=1 to get [7]

In the second test case, you can't perform any operations because there is no valid i that satisfies the requirements mentioned above.

def func_2(n, p):
    return pow(n, p - 2, p)
    #The program returns the value of n raised to the power of p minus 2, modulo p.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two integer parameters, `n` and `p`, and returns the value of `n` raised to the power of `p` minus 2, modulo `p`. The function performs modular exponentiation with an exponent of `p - 2`.

    #The program returns the value of 't' which is calculated based on the unknown values of 'n', 'r', 'fact', 'ifact', and 'mod'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts four parameters: `n`, `r`, `fact`, and `ifact`, along with an assumed parameter `mod`. It calculates the value of `t` based on these parameters and returns it. The specific calculation method is not provided in the annotations, but the function is designed to perform some computation using the given parameters and return the result as `t`. The actual calculation logic is not explicitly stated, so the exact functionality may vary depending on the implementation.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_4():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing integers after converting the input read from the standard input using sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()

def func_5():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers after converting input from standard input using the map function
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` reads input from the standard input, splits it by spaces, converts each element to an integer, and returns a list of those integers.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the length of the password, followed by n positive integers a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) representing the initial contents of the password.**
def func_6():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    #The program returns the input from the standard input after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from the standard input and returns it after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces. The function does not explicitly mention handling the case when no input is provided or when the input is empty.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_7(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is the greatest common divisor of the original `x` and `y`, `y` is 0
    return x
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor of the original 'x' and 0, which is 'x' itself.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, calculates the greatest common divisor of the original `x` and `y`, and returns `x`, which is the greatest common divisor when `y` is 0. The function uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_8(x, y):
    return x * y // func_7(x, y)
    #The program returns the result of multiplying variables x and y, then dividing the result by the return value of the function func_7 with arguments x and y.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_8 accepts two variables x and y, multiplies them, divides the result by the return value of the function func_7 with arguments x and y, and returns the final result.

#Function 9:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the password, and a is a list of n positive integers representing the initial contents of the password.**
def func_9(n):
    return [n, 1, n + 1, 0][n % 4]
    #The program returns one of the following values based on the value of n:
    #- If n is divisible by 4, the program returns n
    #- If n leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 4, the program returns 1
    #- If n leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 4, the program returns n+1
    #- If n leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 4, the program returns 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_9` accepts a positive integer `n` representing the length of a password and returns a value based on the remainder of `n` when divided by 4. Specifically:
- If `n` is divisible by 4, the function returns `n`.
- If `n` leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 4, the function returns 1.
- If `n` leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 4, the function returns `n + 1`.
- If `n` leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 4, the function returns 0.
The code accurately implements these conditions based on the value of `n`.

#Function 10:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_10(a, b):
    res = 1
    while b:
        if b & 1:
            res = res * a
            res %= MOD
            b -= 1
        else:
            a = a * a
            a %= MOD
            b >>= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `res`, `a`, and `b` are integers. If `b` is True, then `res` is the result of `a` raised to the power of the original value of `b`, `a` is updated to the remainder of `a` divided by `MOD`. If `b` is False, then `res` remains the same as the initial value of 1, `a` is the result of `a` raised to the power of the original value of `b` if `b` was True, and `b` is False.
    res %= MOD
    return res
    #The program returns the remainder of 'res' divided by 'MOD'. The values of 'a' and 'b' remain the same as the initial state.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_10` accepts two parameters `a` and `b` and calculates the remainder of `a` raised to the power of `b` divided by `MOD`. It updates the value of `a` and `b` during the process. The function then returns the final result after taking the remainder. If `b` is 0, the function will return 1 as the result.

#Function 11:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_11(P):
    ans = (-1 + sqrt(1 + 8 * P)) // 2
    return ans
    #The program returns the value of 'ans' which is calculated based on the unknown value of 'P'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_11` accepts a parameter `P`, calculates the value of a variable `ans` using a mathematical formula involving `P`, and returns this calculated value. The function does not handle potential errors like division by zero or negative values of `P`, which could lead to incorrect results or exceptions. It solely focuses on calculating `ans` based on the provided `P`.

#Function 12:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_12():
    T = int(func_6())
    while T:
        n = int(func_6())
        
        Arr = func_5()
        
        p = Arr[0]
        
        flag = 0
        
        for i in Arr[1:]:
            if i != p:
                flag = 1
                break
        
        if flag == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n)
        
        T -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: After the loop has executed, `T` is 0, `n`, `Arr`, `p`, `i`, and `flag` are non-zero integers. If any element in `Arr` after the first element is not equal to `p`, `flag` is set to 1. Otherwise, `flag` remains 0 after all iterations. If flag is equal to 1, then the flag remains 1. If flag is not equal to 1, it indicates that all elements in `Arr` after the first element are equal to `p` and `n` is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` does not accept any parameters and executes a loop controlled by the value of `T`. Within the loop, it initializes `n` by calling `func_6()` and creates a list `Arr` by calling `func_5()`. It then checks if all elements in `Arr` after the first element are equal to the first element `p`. If any element is different, it sets `flag` to 1; otherwise, `flag` remains 0. If `flag` is 1, it prints 1; otherwise, it prints `n`. The function iterates until `T` becomes 0. The function does not return any value.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
