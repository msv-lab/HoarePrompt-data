Output State: **`T`, `n`, `p`, `Arr`, `i`, and `flag` are non-zero integers. If any element in `Arr` after the first element is not equal to `p`, `flag` is set to 1. Otherwise, `flag` remains 0 after the loop has executed all iterations. The flag is not equal to 1, indicating that all elements in `Arr` after the first element are equal to `p`. `n` is printed.**
