Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value returned by `func_6()` after converting it to an integer. Since T is non-zero, the value of `n` will be non-zero as well. Therefore, the Output State is: T is an integer value returned by func_6() where T is non-zero, `n` is a non-zero integer.
Output State: **T is an integer value returned by func_6() where T is non-zero, `n` is a non-zero integer**
