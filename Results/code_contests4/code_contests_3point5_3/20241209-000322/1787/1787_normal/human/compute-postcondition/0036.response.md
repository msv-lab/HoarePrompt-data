According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are elements left in `Arr` after the current element `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `T`, `n`, `Arr`, `p`, `flag` are non-zero integers, `Arr` has more than 1 element, `p` is the first element of `Arr`, `flag` is 1, and `i` is the last element that was iterated. To execute the loop one more time, `i` should now be the element after the current `i` in `Arr`.
State: **`T`, `n` are non-zero integers returned by `func_6()`, `Arr` has more than 1 element, `p` is the first element of `Arr`, `flag` is 1, `i` is the next element after the current `i` in `Arr**.
