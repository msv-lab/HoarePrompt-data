Example Answer:
`p` is assigned the first element of the list `Arr`. The value of `Arr` is the return value of `func_5()`, but the specific elements are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: T is an integer value returned by `func_6()` where T is non-zero, `n` is a non-zero integer, `Arr` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`, `p` is the first element of `Arr`.
Output State: **T is an integer value returned by `func_6()` where T is non-zero, `n` is a non-zero integer, `Arr` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`, `p` is the first element of `Arr`**
