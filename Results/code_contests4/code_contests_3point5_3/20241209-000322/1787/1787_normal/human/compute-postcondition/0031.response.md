According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the array `Arr`. If `Arr` has more than 1 element, the loop will execute. At the start of the loop, `i` will be the second element of `Arr`. So, for the loop to execute, the following adjustments need to be made:
State: **`T`, `n` are non-zero integers returned by `func_6()`, `Arr` has more than 1 element, `p` is the first element of `Arr`, `flag` is 0, for the loop to execute `i` is the second element of `Arr`**
