Output State: **`T`, `n`, `Arr`, `p` are non-zero integers returned by `func_6()`. `Arr` has more than 1 element. `p` is the first element of `Arr`. If all elements in `Arr` are equal to `p`, then `flag` remains 0. If there is at least one element in `Arr` that is not equal to `p`, then `flag` is 1. Additionally, if `flag` is 1, the program executes the if part where `flag` remains 1. If `flag` is 0, the program executes the else part where `flag` is updated to 0 and `n` is printed.**
