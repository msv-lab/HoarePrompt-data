According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the list `Arr`. If there are more elements in the list, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `T`, `n`, `p`, `Arr`, `i` are non-zero integers. If `i` is not equal to `p`, `flag` is set to 1, `Arr` contains elements from `func_5()`, with the next element in the list being the value of `i` for the next iteration, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. 

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the next element in the list `Arr` should be the value of `i` for the next iteration.
State: **`T`, `n`, `p`, `Arr`, `i` are non-zero integers. If `i` is not equal to `p`, `flag` is set to 1, `Arr` contains elements from `func_5()`, with the next element in the list being the value of `i` for the next iteration**
