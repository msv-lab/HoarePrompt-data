Example Answer:
`Arr` is assigned the value returned by `func_5()`. The values of `T` and `n` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: T is an integer value returned by `func_6()` where T is non-zero, `n` is a non-zero integer, `Arr` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`.
Output State: **T is an integer value returned by `func_6()` where T is non-zero, `n` is a non-zero integer, `Arr` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`**
