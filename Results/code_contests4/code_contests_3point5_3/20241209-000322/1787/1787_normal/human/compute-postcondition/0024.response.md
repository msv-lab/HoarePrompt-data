Postcondition: ***`T`, `n` are non-zero integers returned by `func_6()`, `Arr` has more than 1 element, `p` is the first element of `Arr`, `flag` is 1 if any element in `Arr` is different from `p` otherwise `flag` remains 0. If flag is equal to 1, the program executes certain actions. Otherwise, if flag is not equal to 1, n is a non-zero integer.***
