Postcondition: ***`T`, `n` are non-zero integers returned by `func_6()`, `Arr` has more than 1 element, `p` is the first element of `Arr`, `flag` is 1, for the loop to execute `i` is the second element of `Arr`. If `i` is not equal to `p`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
