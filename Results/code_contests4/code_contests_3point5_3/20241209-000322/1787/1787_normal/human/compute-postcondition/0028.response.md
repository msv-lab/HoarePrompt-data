Example Answer: 
`Arr` is assigned the value returned by `func_5()`. The previous states of variables `T`, `n`, `p`, and `flag` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `T`, `n` are non-zero integers returned by `func_6()`, `Arr` has more than 1 element, `p` is the first element of `Arr`, `flag` is 1 if any element in `Arr` is different from `p` otherwise `flag` remains 0.
Output State: **`T`, `n` are non-zero integers returned by `func_6()`, `Arr` has more than 1 element, `p` is the first element of `Arr`, `flag` is 1 if any element in `Arr` is different from `p` otherwise `flag` remains 0**
