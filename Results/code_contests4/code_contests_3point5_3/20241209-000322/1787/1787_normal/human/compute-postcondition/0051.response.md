According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. If `T` is true (non-zero), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `T`, `n`, `Arr`, `p` are non-zero integers returned by `func_6()`, and `Arr` has more than 1 element. If all elements in `Arr` are equal to `p`, then `flag` remains 0, and if there is at least one element in `Arr` that is not equal to `p`, then `flag` is 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `T` needs to remain true. No other states need to be adjusted.
