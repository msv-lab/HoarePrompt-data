Output State: **After the loop has executed, `T` is 0, `n`, `Arr`, `p`, `i`, and `flag` are non-zero integers. If any element in `Arr` after the first element is not equal to `p`, `flag` is set to 1. Otherwise, `flag` remains 0 after all iterations. If flag is equal to 1, then the flag remains 1. If flag is not equal to 1, it indicates that all elements in `Arr` after the first element are equal to `p` and `n` is printed.**
