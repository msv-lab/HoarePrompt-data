Functionality: **The function `func_12` does not accept any parameters and executes a loop controlled by the value of `T`. Within the loop, it initializes `n` by calling `func_6()` and creates a list `Arr` by calling `func_5()`. It then checks if all elements in `Arr` after the first element are equal to the first element `p`. If any element is different, it sets `flag` to 1; otherwise, `flag` remains 0. If `flag` is 1, it prints 1; otherwise, it prints `n`. The function iterates until `T` becomes 0. The function does not return any value.**
