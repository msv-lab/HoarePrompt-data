Example Answer:
The value of `flag` is set to 0. Since no calculations or comparisons are performed, the values of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `T`, `n` are non-zero integers returned by `func_6()`, `Arr` has more than 1 element, `p` is the first element of `Arr`, `flag` is 1 if any element in `Arr` is different from `p` otherwise `flag` remains 0.
Output State: **`T`, `n` are non-zero integers returned by `func_6()`, `Arr` has more than 1 element, `p` is the first element of `Arr`, `flag` is 0**
