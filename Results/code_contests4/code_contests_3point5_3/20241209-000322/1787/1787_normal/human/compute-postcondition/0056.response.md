According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `Arr`. If `Arr` has more than 1 element, the loop executes. At the start of the loop, `p` is the first element of `Arr`, so it needs to be adjusted to `Arr` has more than 1 element and `p` is the first element of `Arr` and `i` is the second element of `Arr`.
State: **`T`, `n`, `p` are non-zero integers returned by `func_6()`, `Arr` has more than 1 element, `flag` is 0, `Arr` is assigned the result of `func_5()`, `p` is the first element of `Arr`, `i` is the second element of `Arr` for the loop to execute**
