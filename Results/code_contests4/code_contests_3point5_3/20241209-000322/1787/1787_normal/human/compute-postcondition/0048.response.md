Output State: **`T`, `n`, `Arr`, `p`, `flag` are non-zero integers returned by `func_6()`. `Arr` has more than 1 element. `p` is the first element of `Arr`. If all elements in `Arr` are equal to `p`, then `flag` remains 0. If there is at least one element in `Arr` that is not equal to `p`, then `flag` is 0. `n` is printed.**
