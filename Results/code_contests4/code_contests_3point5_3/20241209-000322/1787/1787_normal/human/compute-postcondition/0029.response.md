Example Answer:
`p` is assigned the value of the first element in `Arr`, which means `p` now holds the value of the element at index 0 in the list `Arr`. The other variables remain the same as before. Therefore, the Output State is: `T`, `n` are non-zero integers returned by `func_6()`, `Arr` has more than 1 element, `p` is the first element of `Arr`, `flag` is 1 if any element in `Arr` is different from `p` otherwise `flag` remains 0.
Output State: **`T`, `n` are non-zero integers returned by `func_6()`, `Arr` has more than 1 element, `p` is the first element of `Arr`, `flag` is 1 if any element in `Arr` is different from `p` otherwise `flag` remains 0**
