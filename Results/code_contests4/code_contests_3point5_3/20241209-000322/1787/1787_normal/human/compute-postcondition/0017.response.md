Example Answer:
The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is a non-zero integer returned by `func_6()`, `n` is a non-zero integer, `Arr` has at least 3 elements, `p` is the first element of `Arr`, `i` is the fourth element of `Arr` for the loop to execute one more time, `flag` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
