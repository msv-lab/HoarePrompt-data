Postcondition: ***`T`, `n` are non-zero integers returned by `func_6()`. `Arr` has at least 3 elements with `p` being the first element and `i` being the fourth element of `Arr`. The loop executes one more time with `flag` equal to 1. If `i` is not equal to `p`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
