Postcondition: ***`T`, `n`, `Arr`, `p`, `flag`, `i` are non-zero integers returned by `func_6()`. `Arr` has more than 1 element. `p` is the first element of `Arr`. `flag` is 1. `i` is the next element after the current `i` in `Arr`. If `i` is not equal to `p`, then `T`, `n`, `Arr`, `p`, `flag`, `i` remain unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
