Postcondition: ***`T`, `n`, `p`, `Arr`, `i` are non-zero integers. If `i` is not equal to `p`, `flag` is set to 1, `Arr` contains elements from `func_5()`, with the next element in the list being the value of `i` for the next iteration. If `i` is not equal to `p`, the `flag` is set to 1 and the loop or if statement is exited.***
