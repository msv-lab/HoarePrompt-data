Postcondition: ***`T`, `n`, `p`, `Arr`, `i`, and `flag` are non-zero integers. If any element in `Arr` after the first element is not equal to `p`, `flag` is set to 1. Otherwise, `flag` remains 0 after the loop has executed all iterations. If flag is equal to 1, then the flag is set to 1. Otherwise, if flag is not equal to 1, it indicates that all elements in `Arr` after the first element are equal to `p` and `n` is printed.***
