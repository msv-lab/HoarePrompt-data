According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements remaining in `Arr` after the current `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `T`, `n`, `Arr`, `p`, `flag`, `i` are non-zero integers returned by `func_6()`, `Arr` has more than 1 element, `p` is the first element of `Arr`, `flag` is 1, and `i` is the next element after the current `i` in `Arr`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the next element `i` should not be equal to `p`. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:
State: **`T`, `n`, `Arr`, `p`, `flag`, `i` are non-zero integers returned by `func_6()`, `Arr` has more than 1 element, `p` is the first element of `Arr`, `flag` is 1, `i` is the next element after the current `i` in `Arr` and `i` is not equal to `p`.**
