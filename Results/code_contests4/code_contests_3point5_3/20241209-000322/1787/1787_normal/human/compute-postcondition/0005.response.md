Example Answer:
The variable `flag` is initialized to 0. This initialization does not affect the other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: T is an integer value returned by `func_6()` where T is non-zero, `n` is a non-zero integer, `Arr` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`, `p` is the first element of `Arr`, `flag` is 0.
Output State: **T is an integer value returned by `func_6()` where T is non-zero, `n` is a non-zero integer, `Arr` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`, `p` is the first element of `Arr`, `flag` is 0**
