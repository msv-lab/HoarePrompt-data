According to the code, the loop can execute if the value of T is considered truthy, meaning it is not 0. Right before the loop, T is an integer value returned by func_6(). To ensure the loop executes at least once, the value of T returned by func_6() must be a non-zero integer.
State: **T is an integer value returned by func_6() where T is non-zero**
