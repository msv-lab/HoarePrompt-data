The function `func_9` accepts a positive integer `n` representing the length of a password and returns a value based on the remainder of `n` when divided by 4. Specifically:
- If `n` is divisible by 4, the function returns `n`.
- If `n` leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 4, the function returns 1.
- If `n` leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 4, the function returns `n + 1`.
- If `n` leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 4, the function returns 0.
The code accurately implements these conditions based on the value of `n`.
