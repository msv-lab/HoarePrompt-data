The function `func_10` accepts two parameters `a` and `b` and calculates the remainder of `a` raised to the power of `b` divided by `MOD`. It updates the value of `a` and `b` during the process. The function then returns the final result after taking the remainder. If `b` is 0, the function will return 1 as the result.
