The function `func_3` accepts four parameters: `n`, `r`, `fact`, and `ifact`, along with an assumed parameter `mod`. It calculates the value of `t` based on these parameters and returns it. The specific calculation method is not provided in the annotations, but the function is designed to perform some computation using the given parameters and return the result as `t`. The actual calculation logic is not explicitly stated, so the exact functionality may vary depending on the implementation.
