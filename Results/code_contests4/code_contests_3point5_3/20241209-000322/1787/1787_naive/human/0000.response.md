Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates through the test cases, checks if there are adjacent numbers that are not equal, and then prints the length of the password after performing the specified operation. The logic seems to handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
