Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It calculates the greatest common divisor of 'a' and 'b' using the Euclidean algorithm in the `func_1` function. Then it calculates the least common multiple of 'a' and 'b' and checks if Vasya will go to Dasha more frequently, Masha more frequently, or equally to both based on this calculation. The code covers all the cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for each scenario. The output hints also agree with the code and there are no edge cases identified that the code does not handle correctly. Therefore, the code is correct.
