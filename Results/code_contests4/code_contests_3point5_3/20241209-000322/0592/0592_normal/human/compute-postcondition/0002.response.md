Functionality: ** The function func_1 accepts two integers 'a' and 'b', where a ≠ b and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^6, and recursively calculates the greatest common divisor of 'a' and 'b' using the Euclidean algorithm. The function returns the greatest common divisor of 'a' and 'b'. **

Note: The function uses recursion to find the greatest common divisor of the given integers 'a' and 'b' by applying the Euclidean algorithm. The implementation seems correct based on the code provided and the annotations.
