The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are integers such that a ≠ b and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^6. The function returns the greatest common divisor of integers 'a' and 'b'. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two integers 'a' and 'b', where a ≠ b and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^6, and return the greatest common divisor of 'a' and 'b'.
