Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum and maximum beauty of the array after performing operations. The logic used in the program is incorrect as it does not handle the replacement of adjacent elements by their sum to optimize the beauty of the array.

An example where the program fails:
Input:
1
3 3
6 4 11

Expected Output:
6 6

Actual Output:
6 8

In this case, the program does not consider replacing 4 and 11 with their sum to achieve the minimum beauty of 6.
