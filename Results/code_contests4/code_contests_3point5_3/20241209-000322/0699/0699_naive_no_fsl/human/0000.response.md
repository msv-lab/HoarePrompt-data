Correctness: False

The provided code is incorrect because it is missing the necessary import statements for the `reduce` and `math` functions. Additionally, the code is not reading input from `sys.stdin` as mentioned in the problem description. This means that the program will not work correctly for all potential cases as it is not implementing the operations described in the problem statement.

Furthermore, the `reduce` function is not imported in the code and not used correctly. So, the code will not produce the correct output as expected in the problem description.
