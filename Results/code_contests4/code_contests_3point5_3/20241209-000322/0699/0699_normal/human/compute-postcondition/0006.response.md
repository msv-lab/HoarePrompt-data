Example Answer:
`mx` is incremented by the ceiling value of the ratio of `a[i]` to `x`, where `i` is currently 1. The loop will execute a second time when `n` is greater than 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is a float, `mx` is updated, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1.
Output State: **`x` is a float, `mx` is updated, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
