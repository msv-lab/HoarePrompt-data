Example Answer:
The code snippet calculates the integer division of `somme` by `x` and assigns it to the first part of the formatted string. It also calculates the integer value of `mx` and assigns it to the second part of the formatted string. The output state after running the code will be: `x` is a float, `mx` is the sum of ceiling values of all elements in a divided by x, `i` is the value of n-1, `n` is the total number of elements in a, for the loop to execute `n` must be greater than 0, and `somme / x` is the integer division result, `mx` is the integer value of mx calculated.
Output State: **`x` is a float, `mx` is the sum of ceiling values of all elements in a divided by x, `i` is the value of n-1, `n` is the total number of elements in a, `somme / x` is the integer division result, `mx` is the integer value of mx calculated**
