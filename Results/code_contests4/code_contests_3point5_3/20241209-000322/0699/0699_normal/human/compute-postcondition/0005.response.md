According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is a float, `mx` is the ceiling value of the ratio of a[i] to x, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`x` is a float, `mx` is the ceiling value of the ratio of a[1] to x, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
