Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully implement the problem description. The function `func_1` calculates the sum of ceiling values of all elements in the array `a` divided by `x`, which is correct for calculating the maximal possible beauty. However, it does not calculate the minimal possible beauty by performing the required operations on the array. This means that the program does not provide both the minimum and maximum beauty as required by the problem description.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description.
