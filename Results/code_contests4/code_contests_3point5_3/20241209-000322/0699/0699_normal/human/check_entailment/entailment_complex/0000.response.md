Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. The program is supposed to determine the minimum and maximum beauty of an array by performing operations as described in the problem description. However, the program only calculates the sum of the ceiling values of elements in the array divided by x and the sum of all elements in the array divided by x. It does not perform the necessary operations to find the minimum and maximum beauty values. 

Therefore, the program does not do what the problem description asks for in this case.
