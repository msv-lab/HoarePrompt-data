Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes the input for the number of test cases, `n`, and `x`, and the array `a`.
- It then iterates through each test case, calculates the sum of all elements in the array `a`, and the sum of ceiling values of elements in `a` divided by `x`.
- The code correctly calculates and prints the minimal and maximal possible beauty for each test case.
- The code handles multiple test cases and performs the required operations on the array to determine the beauty values.
- There are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description that the code does not handle.
- The output hints agree with the code's functionality, confirming that the code is correct.
