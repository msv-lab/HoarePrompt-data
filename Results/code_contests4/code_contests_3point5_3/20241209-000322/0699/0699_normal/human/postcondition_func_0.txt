The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `x`, and `a`. The function converts `x` to a float, calculates the sum of all elements in `a`, and then iterates through a loop to calculate the sum of ceiling values of elements in `a` divided by `x`. The function prints the integer division result of the sum of `a` divided by `x` and the total sum of ceiling values. The function does not have a specific return value. Potential edge cases include ensuring `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute correctly.
