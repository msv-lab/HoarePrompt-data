Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program reads in the #define constructions and the expression to be checked, then it performs macro substitution using the provided rules. The program defines a custom class `macro` to handle arithmetic operations and checks if the expression after substitution is correct or suspicious based on the given criteria. The program also handles cases with brackets and multiple macros correctly. Overall, the program follows the problem description and should work correctly for all cases.
