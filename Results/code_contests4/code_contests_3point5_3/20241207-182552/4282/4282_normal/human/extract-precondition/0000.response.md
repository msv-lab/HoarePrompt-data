**Precondition:**

n is a non-negative integer representing the number of #define constructions in the program.

Each #define construction has the syntax "#define name expression" where name is a string representing the macro name, and expression is a correct arithmetic expression.

The expressions in #define constructions and the final expression to check are non-empty strings containing digits, names of variables, names of previously declared macros, round brackets, and operational signs +-*/. 

All names (macro names and variable names) are strings of case-sensitive Latin characters.

The expressions are guaranteed to be correct arithmetic expressions before and after macro substitution, having no unary operations, and containing only non-negative integers not exceeding 10^9.
