    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`f` is a list with elements updated according to the conditions in the loop, `s` is a non-empty string that has been fully iterated, `c` is the last character in `s`, `n` is not an empty string. If `n` is not an empty string, then the program will update the elements in `f` based on the loop conditions. Otherwise, `f` will remain as a list with one empty string element and `n` will remain an empty string.
    return eval(f[0]).level
    #The program returns the level attribute of the object that is evaluated from the first element of list 'f'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` processes a string `s` character by character, updating a list `f` based on certain conditions. It then evaluates the first element of `f` and returns the level attribute of the resulting object. If `n` is not empty after the loop, it includes it in the evaluation. Missing functionality includes details on the object `v` and the function `func_1`.
