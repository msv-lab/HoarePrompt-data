Example Answer:
The value of `f[-1]` is updated by adding the result of `func_1(v.get(n, '1'))`. The function `func_1` is called with the value returned by `v.get(n, '1')`, where `n` is not defined in the initial state provided. Therefore, it is considered as '1' by default. The new value of `f[-1]` is the result of adding the returned value of `func_1` to the current value of `f[-1]`. 
Output State: **`f` is a list with at least one element that is not an empty string, `s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character to iterate over, `c` is the next character in `s`, `f[-1]` is updated with the result of `func_1('1')`**
