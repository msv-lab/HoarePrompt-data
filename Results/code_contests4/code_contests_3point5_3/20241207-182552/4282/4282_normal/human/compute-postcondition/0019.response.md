Postcondition: ***`f` is a list with at least one element that is not an empty string, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` can be any character. If c == '(', an empty string is appended to the list `f`. If c == ')', the last element of `f` is incremented by the value of `m`. If c is in '+-*/()', the last element of `f` remains unchanged. If c is not in the set '+-*/()', `n` has been updated by an unknown value `c`.***
