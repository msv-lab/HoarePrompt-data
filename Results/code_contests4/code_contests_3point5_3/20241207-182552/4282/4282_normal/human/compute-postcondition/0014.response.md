Example Answer:
The last element of list `f` is incremented by the value of `c`. Since `c` is not equal to '(' or ')', it will concatenate `c` to the last element of list `f`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `f` is a list with at least one element that is not an empty string, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is in the set '+-*/()', `n` is an empty string, and `c` is not equal to '(' and c is not equal to ')'.
Output State: **`f` is a list with at least one element that is not an empty string, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is in the set '+-*/()', `n` is an empty string, and `c` is not equal to '(' and c is not equal to ')'**
