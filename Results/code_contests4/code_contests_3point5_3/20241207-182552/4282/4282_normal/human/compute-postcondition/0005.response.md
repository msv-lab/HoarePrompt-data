Example Answer:
`n` is assigned an empty string ''. The previous value of `n` is not provided, so after execution, `n` is an empty string ''. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `f` is a list with at least one element that is not an empty string, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is in the set '+-*/()', and `n` is an empty string.
Output State: **`f` is a list with at least one element that is not an empty string, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is in the set '+-*/()', and `n` is an empty string**
