Postcondition: ***`f` is a list with at least one element that is not an empty string. `s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character to iterate over. `c` is the next character in `s`. `f[-1]` is updated with the result of `func_1('1')` or `func_1('1' + c')`. `n` is an empty string. If c == '(', `f[-1]` is updated with the result of `func_1('1')`. Otherwise, `f[-1]` is updated with the result of `func_1('1' + c')`. Additionally, `m` is the result of `func_1('1')`.***
