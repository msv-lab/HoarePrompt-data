Example Answer:
`n` is concatenated with the value of `c`, where `c` is the next character in `s`. The previous value of `n` is unknown, but `c` is the next character in `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `f` is a list with at least one element that is not an empty string, `s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character to iterate over, `c` is the next character in `s`, `n` is concatenated with the next character in `s`.
Output State: **`f` is a list with at least one element that is not an empty string, `s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character to iterate over, `c` is the next character in `s`, `n` is concatenated with the next character in `s`**
