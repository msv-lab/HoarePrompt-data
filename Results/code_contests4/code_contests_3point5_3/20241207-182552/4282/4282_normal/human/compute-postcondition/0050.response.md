Functionality: **The function `func_2` processes a string `s` character by character, updating a list `f` based on certain conditions. It then evaluates the first element of `f` and returns the level attribute of the resulting object. If `n` is not empty after the loop, it includes it in the evaluation. Missing functionality includes details on the object `v` and the function `func_1`.**
