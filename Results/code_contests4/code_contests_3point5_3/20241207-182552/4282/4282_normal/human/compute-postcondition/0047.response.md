Postcondition: ***`f` is a list with elements updated according to the conditions in the loop, `s` is a non-empty string that has been fully iterated, `c` is the last character in `s`, `n` is not an empty string. If `n` is not an empty string, then the program will update the elements in `f` based on the loop conditions. Otherwise, `f` will remain as a list with one empty string element and `n` will remain an empty string.***
