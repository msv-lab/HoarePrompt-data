Example Answer:
The value of `n` is determined based on the value of `c`. If `c` is '(', then `n` becomes an empty string. If `c` is not '(', then the next character in `s` is concatenated to `n`. The value of `f[-1]` is updated by adding the result of `func_1('1')` or `func_1('1' + c')`, depending on the value of `n`. The value of `m` is set to the result of `func_1('1')`. The dictionary `v` is used to get a value based on `n`. Finally, `f[-1]` is updated by adding the value obtained from `func_1` and `v` based on the value of `n`.

Output State: **`f`, `s`, `c`, `f[-1]`, `n`, `m` are updated based on the operations performed in the code snippet**
