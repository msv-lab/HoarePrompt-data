Example Answer: 
`f.pop()` removes the last element from list `f`, and it is assumed to be a string that can be evaluated.  `'10'[eval(f.pop()).level == '0']` evaluates to either `'1'` or `'0'` based on the condition. Then `func_1` is called with the result as an argument. The result of `func_1` is assigned to `m`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `f` is a list with at least one element that is not an empty string, `s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character to iterate over, `c` is the next character in `s`, `f[-1]` is updated with the result of `func_1('1')`, `n` is an empty string, `m` is the result of `func_1('1')`.
Output State: **`f` is a list with at least one element that is not an empty string, `s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character to iterate over, `c` is the next character in `s`, `f[-1]` is updated with the result of `func_1('1')`, `n` is an empty string, `m` is the result of `func_1('1')`**
