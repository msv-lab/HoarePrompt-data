Postcondition: ***`f` is a list with at least one element that is not an empty string, `s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character to iterate over, `c` is the next character in `s`, `f[-1]` is updated with the result of `func_1('1')` or `func_1('1' + c')`, `n` is an empty string if c == '(', if c != '(', `n` is concatenated with the next character in `s`, `m` is the result of `func_1('1')`. If c is in '+-*/()', the program updates `f`, `s`, `c`, `f[-1]`, `n`, and `m` based on the operations performed in the code snippet. If c == '(', an empty string element is appended to `f`. If c == ')', the last element of `f` is increased by the value of `m`. If c is not in '+-*/()', `f[-1]` is updated with the addition of `c`. If the else part executes, `f`, `s`, `c`, `f[-1]`, `n`, and `m` are updated according to the operations in the code snippet.***
