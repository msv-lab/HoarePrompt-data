Example Answer: 
`n` is assigned an empty string. This operation resets the value of `n` to an empty string. The values of other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `f`, `s`, `c`, `f[-1]`, `n` is an empty string, `m` are updated based on the operations performed in the code snippet.
Output State: **`f`, `s`, `c`, `f[-1]`, `n` is an empty string, `m` are updated based on the operations performed in the code snippet**
