Correctness: **False**

The annotated program provided does not fully implement the problem description. The program consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, but there is no clear indication of how these functions are related to the problem of determining if an expression is correct or suspicious based on the given #define constructions.

The functions `func_1` and `func_2` seem to be related to some form of parsing and evaluation of arithmetic expressions, but they do not directly address the problem of checking if an expression is suspicious based on macro substitutions.

Therefore, the provided program does not follow the problem description and is incorrect.
