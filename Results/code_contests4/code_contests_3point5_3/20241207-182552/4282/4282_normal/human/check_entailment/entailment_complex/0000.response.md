Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code includes two functions `func_1` and `func_2` that are designed to process and evaluate arithmetic expressions with macros. The functions handle the substitution of macros in the expressions, ensuring that the order of calculations remains correct. The annotations provide a clear explanation of what each function does, and the logic within the functions aligns with the problem description. Overall, the code appears to correctly handle the given problem description for all potential cases.
