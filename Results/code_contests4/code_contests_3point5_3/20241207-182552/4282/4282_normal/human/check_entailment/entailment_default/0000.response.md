Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not seem to handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. The function `func_2` processes a string `s` character by character, updating a list `f` based on certain conditions. It then evaluates the first element of `f` and returns the level attribute of the resulting object. However, there are missing details on the object `v` and the function `func_1`, which are crucial for the correct functionality of the program.

Moreover, the output hints provide an example that might not be valid. The output hint mentions the use of a `macro` class with overridden arithmetic operations, but the code does not explicitly define this class. This discrepancy between the output hint and the actual code raises suspicions about the correctness of the program.

Overall, due to the missing details and discrepancy between the output hint and the code, the correctness of the program cannot be guaranteed.
