Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to check if the given expression is "OK" or "Suspicious" based on the rules of macro substitution as described in the problem description. The program defines a class `macro` with methods to handle arithmetic operations and substitution. It then uses functions `func_1` and `func_2` to parse the input expressions and perform the necessary substitutions. The program correctly checks if the final expression is "OK" or "Suspicious" and outputs the result accordingly. 

Additionally, the program iterates over all the input #define constructions, stores the macro definitions, and then processes the final expression to determine correctness. The program seems to handle all edge cases and potential scenarios as per the problem description. Since no specific case has been provided where the program does not work correctly, we can conclude that the program is correct.
