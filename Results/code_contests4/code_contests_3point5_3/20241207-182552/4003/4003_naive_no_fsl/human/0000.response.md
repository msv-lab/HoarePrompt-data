Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not match the problem description. It is attempting to read input using `raw_input()` which is not valid in Python 3. Also, the logic inside the for loop is incorrect. The program is attempting to iterate over the range of `testSNs[0]`, but `testSNs[0]` is a string and cannot be used as the range value. Additionally, the condition `if not testSNs[x] % 10 is 0:` is incorrect as it is trying to check if the element is not divisible by 10, but it should be checking if the sum of A and B is 10 or greater.

Therefore, the program is incorrect based on the provided problem description.
