Correctness: **False**

The program provided does not match the problem description. The program reads input as a string and tries to split it, but it should read integers directly. It then attempts to loop through the input, but the loop is incorrectly set up. Additionally, the condition `if not testSNs[x] % 10 is 0` is not correct and doesn't check if A + B is 10 or greater. 

Overall, the program does not output the correct result based on the problem description.
