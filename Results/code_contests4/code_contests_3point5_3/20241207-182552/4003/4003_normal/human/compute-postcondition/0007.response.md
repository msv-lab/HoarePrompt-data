Postcondition: ***A and B are integers such that 1 ≤ A, B ≤ 9; `testSNs` is a list of strings, `SCORE` is an integer. If the element at index `x` in `testSNs` is not divisible by 10, then `SCORE` is updated by adding the element at index `x` from `testSNs`, and `x` is increased by 1. If the element at index `x` in `testSNs` is divisible by 10, `SCORE` remains 0 and `x` is increased by 1.***
