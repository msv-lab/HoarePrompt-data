Example Answer:
`SCORE` is assigned the value `int(0)`, which converts 0 to an integer. The variables A, B, and `testSNs` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: A and B are integers such that 1 ≤ A, B ≤ 9; `testSNs` is a list of strings, `SCORE` is an integer 0.
Output State: **A and B are integers such that 1 ≤ A, B ≤ 9; `testSNs` is a list of strings, `SCORE` is an integer 0**
