Example Answer:
`testSNs` is assigned the list of inputs split by spaces. Since the input is taken as a string, the values in the list will also be strings. The initial state is A and B are integers such that 1 ≤ A, B ≤ 9, so the output state is A and B are integers such that 1 ≤ A, B ≤ 9; `testSNs` is a list of strings.
Output State: **A and B are integers such that 1 ≤ A, B ≤ 9; `testSNs` is a list of strings**
