The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function calculates the product of integers A and B where A and B are integers such that 1 ≤ A, B ≤ 9. The function then returns the result of the multiplication of A and B. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to calculate the product of two integers A and B where 1 ≤ A, B ≤ 9 and return the result. 
Functionality: **The function calculates the product of two integers A and B where 1 ≤ A, B ≤ 9 and returns the result.**
