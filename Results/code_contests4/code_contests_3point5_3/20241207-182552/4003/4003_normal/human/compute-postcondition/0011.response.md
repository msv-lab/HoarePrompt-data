Postcondition: ***A and B are integers such that 1 ≤ A, B ≤ 9; `testSNs` is a list of strings, `SCORE` is an integer, `x` is less than the first element in `testSNs`. If the last digit of `testSNs[x]` is not 0, then `SCORE` is incremented by the value of `testSNs[x]`. Otherwise, no change occurs to `SCORE` and the state remains the same.***
