Output State: **A and B are integers such that 1 ≤ A, B ≤ 9; `testSNs` is a list of strings, `SCORE` is an integer with an updated value based on adding the element at index `x` from `testSNs`, for the loop to execute the first time `testSNs[0]` is greater than 0, `x` is 0. The element at index `x` in `testSNs` is not divisible by 10**
