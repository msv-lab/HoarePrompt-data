Output State: **A and B are integers such that 1 ≤ A, B ≤ 9; `testSNs` is a list of strings, `SCORE` is an integer. If any element in `testSNs` is not divisible by 10, then `SCORE` is updated by adding that element from `testSNs`. If all elements in `testSNs` are divisible by 10, `SCORE` remains 0.**
