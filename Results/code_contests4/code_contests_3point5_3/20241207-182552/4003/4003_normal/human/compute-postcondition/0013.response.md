Example Answer:
The value of SCORE is incremented by the value of testSNs[x]. Since testSNs[x] is a string, it will be concatenated to SCORE. The value of A, B, and x are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: A and B are integers such that 1 ≤ A, B ≤ 9; testSNs is a list of strings, SCORE is an integer with the updated value.
Output State: **A and B are integers such that 1 ≤ A, B ≤ 9; testSNs is a list of strings; SCORE is an updated integer value**
