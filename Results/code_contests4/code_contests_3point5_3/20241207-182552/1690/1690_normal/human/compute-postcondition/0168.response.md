Postcondition: ***`en`, `cur`, `i`, `j`, `s`, `word` are all variables. If cur is equal to i, then en is decremented by 1 if cur is not equal to i and s[j] is equal to word[cur]. Otherwise, en is only decremented by 1. j is updated based on the loop range, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If cur is not equal to i, en is decremented by 1 if s[j] is equal to word[cur]. If the condition is not met, en is only decremented by 1. j is updated based on the loop range.***
