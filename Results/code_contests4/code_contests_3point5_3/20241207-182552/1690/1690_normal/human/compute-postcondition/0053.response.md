Example Answer: 
`tem` is incremented by the value of `a[j]`. The previous state of `tem` is unknown, so the new value of `tem` depends on the value of `a[j]`. Therefore, the Output State is:  `be` is less than `en`, `be` is equal to the number of times `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]` before `cur` becomes equal to `i`, `en` is decremented by the total number of times the loop executed, `tem` is incremented by the value of `a[j]`, `cur`, `n`, `j` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`be` is less than `en`, `be` is equal to the number of times `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]` before `cur` becomes equal to `i`, `en` is decremented by the total number of times the loop executed, `tem` is incremented by the value of `a[j]`, `cur`, `n`, `j` remain unchanged.**
