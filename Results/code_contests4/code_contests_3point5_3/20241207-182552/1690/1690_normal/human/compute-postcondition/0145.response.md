Postcondition: ***`ans`, `be`, `cur`, `j` are updated integers. If `cur` is equal to `i`, then `ans` holds the updated minimum value, `be` is incremented by 1, `cur` is updated to a value not equal to `i`, `j` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute again `s[j]` must be equal to `word[cur]`. If `cur` is not equal to `i`, then `ans` holds the updated minimum value, `be` is incremented by 1, `cur` is updated to a value not equal to `i`, `j` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute again `s[j]` must be equal to `word[cur] and `cur` is incremented by 1 after the execution of the if part.***
