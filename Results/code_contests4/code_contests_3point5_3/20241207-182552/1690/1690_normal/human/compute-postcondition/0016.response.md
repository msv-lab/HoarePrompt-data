Example Answer: 
The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `be` is increased by 1, `en`, `tem`, `cur`, `n`, `j` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State: **`be` is increased by 1, `en`, `tem`, `cur`, `n`, `j` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
