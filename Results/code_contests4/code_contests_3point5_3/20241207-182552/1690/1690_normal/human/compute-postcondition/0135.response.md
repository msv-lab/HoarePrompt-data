According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `s[j]`, `word[4]`, `cur`, and `i`. If `j` is within the range of `n` and `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `ans` holds the minimum value between the previous `ans` and the sum of all `a[j]` where `s[j]` is equal to `word[4]`, `be` is incremented by 1, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0. If `cur` is equal to `i`, then the loop breaks out. 

To adjust the states for the next iteration:
- `ans` should be updated based on the sum of `a[j]` where `s[j]` is equal to `word[4]`.
- `be` should be incremented by 1.
- `cur` needs to be updated to a value not equal to `i`.
- `j` should be increased by 1 to move to the next iteration.
- `s[j]` should be checked to be equal to `word[cur]` to determine if the loop should continue executing.

State: **`ans` holds the updated minimum value, `be` is incremented by 1, `cur` is updated to a value not equal to `i`, `j` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute again `s[j]` must be equal to `word[cur]`**
