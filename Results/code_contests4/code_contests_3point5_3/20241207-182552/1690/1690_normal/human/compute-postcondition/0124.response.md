Example Answer:
The variables `be`, `en`, and `tem` are assigned the values 0, `n`, and 0 respectively. The value of `ans` is updated to hold the minimum value between the previous `ans` and the sum of all `a[j]` where `s[j]` is equal to `word[4]`. Other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`ans` holds the minimum value between the previous `ans` and the sum of all `a[j]` where `s[j]` is equal to `word[4]`, `be` is 0, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0.**
