According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `be` and `en`. If `be` is less than `en`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `be` is less than `en`. To adjust the states for the next iteration, `en` needs to be decremented by 1 as the loop will execute one more time. Additionally, `be` should remain less than the new value of `en` for the loop to continue. 
State: **`be` is less than `en - 1`, `be` is equal to the number of times `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]` before `cur` becomes equal to `i`, `en` is decremented by the total number of times the loop executed so far + 1, `tem` is incremented by the value of `a[j]`, `cur`, `n`, `j` remain unchanged.**
