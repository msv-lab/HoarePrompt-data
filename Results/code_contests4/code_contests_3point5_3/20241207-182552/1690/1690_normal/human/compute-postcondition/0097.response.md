Output State: **`be`, `en`, `tem`, `cur`, `n`, `j`, `s`, `word` are as described in the precondition. If `cur` is equal to `i`, then `be` is incremented by the number of times the loop executes when `cur` is not equal to `i`. If `cur` is not equal to `i`, then `be` is incremented by the number of times the loop executes when `cur` is not equal to `i`, and the element at index `j` in list `s` is equal to the character at index `cur` in string `word`. `en` is decremented by 1.**
