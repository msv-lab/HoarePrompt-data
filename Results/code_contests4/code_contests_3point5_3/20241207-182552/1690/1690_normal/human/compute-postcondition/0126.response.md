According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is within the range of `n`. Before the loop starts, `ans`, `be`, `en`, `tem`, and `cur` need to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes. 

State: **`ans` holds the minimum value between the previous `ans` and the sum of all `a[j]` where `s[j]` is equal to `word[4]`, `be` is 0, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is 0, for the loop to execute `j` is within the range of `n`**
