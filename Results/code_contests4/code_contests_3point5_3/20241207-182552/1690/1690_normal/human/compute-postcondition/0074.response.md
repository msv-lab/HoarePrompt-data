Output State: **`be` is incremented by 1, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is either updated to 1 or remains 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is 0. If `cur` is equal to `i`, the loop breaks out. If `cur` is not equal to `i`, `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]`.**
