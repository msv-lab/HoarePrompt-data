According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `be` is increased by 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `be` must be increased by 1 again.
State: **`be` is increased by 2**
