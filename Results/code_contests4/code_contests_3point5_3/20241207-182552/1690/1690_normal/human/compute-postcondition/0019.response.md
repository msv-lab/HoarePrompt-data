Postcondition: ***`be`, `en`, `tem`, `cur`, `n`, `j` are all integers. If `cur` is equal to `i`, then `be`, `en`, `tem`, `cur`, `n`, `j` are all increased by 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `cur` is not equal to `i`, then `be`, `en`, `tem`, `cur`, `n`, `j` are all increased by 1. The function checks if the character at index `j` in string `s` is equal to the character at index `cur` in string `word`. The values of the variables are updated based on this condition.***
