Example Answer: 
The value of `en` is decremented by 1, but the specific value of `en` is not provided. The code encounters a `break` statement, which breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `en` is decremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State: **`en` is decremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement**
