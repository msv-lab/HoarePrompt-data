According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `be` is equal to the number of times `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]` before `cur` becomes equal to `i`, `en` is decremented by 2, `tem`, `n`, `j` remain unchanged. So for the loop to be executed one more time `j` must be greater than or equal to 0.
State: **`be` is equal to the number of times `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]` before `cur` becomes equal to `i`, `en` is decremented by 2, `tem`, `n`, `j` remain unchanged, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be greater than or equal to 0**
