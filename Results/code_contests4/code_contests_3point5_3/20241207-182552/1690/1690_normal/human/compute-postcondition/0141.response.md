According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j`, `s[j]`, `word`, `cur`, and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ans` holds the updated minimum value, `be` is incremented by 1, `cur` is updated to a value not equal to `i`, `j` is increased by 1, and `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]`. So, for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` should be less than `n`, `s[j]` must be equal to `word[cur]` in both if and else parts of the block.
State: **`ans` holds the updated minimum value, `be` is incremented by 1, `cur` is updated to a value not equal to `i`, `j` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute again `s[j]` must be equal to `word[cur] in both if and else parts of the block**
