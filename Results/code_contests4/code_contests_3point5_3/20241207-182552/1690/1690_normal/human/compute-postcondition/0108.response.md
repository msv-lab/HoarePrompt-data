Postcondition: ***Output State: `be`, `en` is decremented by 1, `en-1`, `tem`, `n`, `j-1`, `s`, `word` remain unchanged. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be greater than or equal to 0. If `cur == i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` is decremented by 1.***
