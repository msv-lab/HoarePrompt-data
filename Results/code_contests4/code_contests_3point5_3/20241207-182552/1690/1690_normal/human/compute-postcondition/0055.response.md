According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `be` and `en`. If `be` is less than `en`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `be` is less than `en` and `en` is decremented by the total number of times the loop executed. Additionally, `tem` is incremented by the value of `a[j]`. 
So, for the loop to execute one more time, the condition `be` < `en` needs to be satisfied, `en` should be decremented by the total number of times the loop executed, and `tem` should be updated by incrementing it by the value of `a[j]`.
State: **`be` is less than `en`, `be` is equal to the number of times `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]` before `cur` becomes equal to `i`, `en` is decremented by the total number of times the loop executed, `tem` is incremented by the value of `a[j]`, `cur`, `n`, `j` remain unchanged**
