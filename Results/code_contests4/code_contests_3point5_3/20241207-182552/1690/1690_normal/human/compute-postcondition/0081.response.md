According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `n`, `cur`, `j`, `s`, and `word`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `be` is incremented by 1, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is updated based on the conditions in the loop body, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, and `j` is incremented by 1. If `s[j] == word[cur]`, then `cur` is also incremented by 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`be` is incremented by 1, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is updated based on the conditions in the loop body, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is incremented by 2**
