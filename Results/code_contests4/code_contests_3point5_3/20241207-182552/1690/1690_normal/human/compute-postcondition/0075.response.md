According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n`, `cur`, `i`, and `j`. At the end of the last iteration, `be` is incremented by 1, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is either updated to 1 or remains 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is 0. If `cur` is equal to `i`, the loop breaks out. If `cur` is not equal to `i`, `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, `cur` must be updated accordingly based on the conditions in the loop body.
State: **`be` is incremented by 1, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is updated based on the conditions in the loop body, for the loop to execute again `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is incremented by 1**
