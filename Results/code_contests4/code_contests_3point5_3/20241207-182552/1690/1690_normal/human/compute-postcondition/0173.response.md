Example Answer:
`tem` is incremented by the value of `a[j]`. The previous value of `tem` is 0. Therefore, after execution, `tem` will be the sum of all `a[j]` where `s[j]` is equal to `word[4]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` holds the minimum value between the previous `ans` and the sum of all `a[j]` where `s[j]` is equal to `word[4]`, `be` is equal to `n`, `en` is decremented by the number of times the condition in the loop is met, `tem` is the sum of all `a[j]` where `s[j]` is equal to `word[4]`, `cur` is 3, for the loop to execute `be` is less than `en`, `s[j]` is equal to `word[i]`.
Output State: **`ans` holds the minimum value between the previous `ans` and the sum of all `a[j]` where `s[j]` is equal to `word[4]`, `be` is equal to `n`, `en` is decremented by the number of times the condition in the loop is met, `tem` is the sum of all `a[j]` where `s[j]` is equal to `word[4]`, `cur` is 3, for the loop to execute `be` is less than `en`, `s[j]` is equal to `word[i]`.**
