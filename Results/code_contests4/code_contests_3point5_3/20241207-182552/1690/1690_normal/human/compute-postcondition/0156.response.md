Postcondition: ***`ans` holds the minimum value between the previous `ans` and the sum of all `a[j]` where `s[j]` is equal to `word[4]`, `be` is `n`, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is 3, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `n - 1`. If `cur` is equal to `i`, then the loop breaks. Otherwise, `ans` holds the minimum value between the previous `ans` and the sum of all `a[j]` where `s[j]` is equal to `word[4]`, `be` is `n`, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is 3, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `n - 1`, `cur` is not equal to `i`, `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]`, and `cur` is decremented by 1.***
