Example Answer:
The variable `cur` is assigned the value 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` holds the minimum value between the previous `ans` and the sum of all `a[j]` where `s[j]` is equal to `word[4]`, `be` is 0, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is 0.
Output State: **`ans` holds the minimum value between the previous `ans` and the sum of all `a[j]` where `s[j]` is equal to `word[4]`, `be` is 0, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is 0**
