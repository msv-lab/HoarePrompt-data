According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. The loop will iterate in reverse order from `n - 1` to 0. Since `be` is the number of times `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]` before `cur` becomes equal to `i`, it should be adjusted to reflect the initial state of the program before the loop starts. 
State: **`be` is equal to the number of times `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]` before `cur` becomes equal to `i`, `en`, `tem`, `cur`, `n`, `j` remain unchanged, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0**
