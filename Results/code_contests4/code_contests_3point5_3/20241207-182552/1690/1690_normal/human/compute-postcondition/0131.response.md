Example Answer:
`cur` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cur` is unknown, so the output state is: `ans` holds the minimum value between the previous `ans` and the sum of all `a[j]` where `s[j]` is equal to `word[4]`, `be` is 0, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is unknown, for the loop to execute `j` is within the range of `n`, additionally `cur` is not equal to `i`, and `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]`.
Output State: **`ans` holds the minimum value between the previous `ans` and the sum of all `a[j]` where `s[j]` is equal to `word[4]`, `be` is 0, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is unknown, for the loop to execute `j` is within the range of `n`, additionally `cur` is not equal to `i`, and `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]`.**
