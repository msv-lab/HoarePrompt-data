Example Answer:
`rints` is assigned a lambda function that reads a line from standard input, splits it by whitespace, converts each element to an integer, and returns a list of integers. The lambda function uses `stdin` which is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `rstr` is a lambda function to read a line from standard input and strip any leading or trailing whitespace; `rints` is a lambda function to convert input line to a list of integers.
Output State: **`rstr` is a lambda function to read a line from standard input and strip any leading or trailing whitespace; `rints` is a lambda function to convert input line to a list of integers**
