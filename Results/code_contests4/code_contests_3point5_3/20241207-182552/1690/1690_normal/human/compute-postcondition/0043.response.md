Output State: **`be` is equal to the number of times `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]` before `cur` becomes equal to `i`, `en` is decremented by 2, `tem`, `n`, `j` remain unchanged, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be greater than or equal to 0. In the if part, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. In the else part, `be` remains the same, `en` is decremented by 1, `tem`, `n`, `j` remain unchanged, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be greater than or equal to 0, and `cur` is decremented by 1 if `s[j] == word[cur]`.**
