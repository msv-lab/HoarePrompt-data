According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `be`, and `en`. If `j` is less than `en`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the values of `be`, `en`, `tem`, `cur`, `n`, `j`, `s`, and `word` are not specified. However, based on the condition `s[j]` is equal to `word[i]`, `tem` is updated by adding `a[j]`, we can say that for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 and `j` must be less than `en`.
State: **`be`, `en`, `tem`, `cur`, `n`, `j+1`, `s`, and `word` are variables. If `s[j+1]` is equal to `word[i]`, `tem` is updated by adding `a[j+1]` for the loop to execute again, `j+1` must be less than `en`**
