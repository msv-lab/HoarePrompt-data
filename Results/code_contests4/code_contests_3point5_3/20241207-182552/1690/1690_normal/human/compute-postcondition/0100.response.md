Example Answer:
`cur` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `cur` is unknown, so the new value of `cur` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `be`, `en-1`, `tem`, `cur`, `n`, `j-1`, `s`, `word` remain unchanged and `cur` is decremented by 1.
Output State: **`be`, `en-1`, `tem`, `cur`, `n`, `j-1`, `s`, `word` remain unchanged and `cur` is decremented by 1**
