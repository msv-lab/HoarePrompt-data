According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `be`, `en`, `s[j]`, and `word[i]`. If `be` is less than `en`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ans` holds the minimum value between the previous `ans` and the sum of all `a[j]` where `s[j]` is equal to `word[4]`, `be` is less than `en`, `en` is decremented by the number of times the condition in the loop is met, `tem` is the sum of all `a[j]` where `s[j]` is equal to `word[4]`, `cur` is 3, `s[j]` is equal to `word[i]`, and `tem` is incremented by `a[j]`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `be` needs to be less than `en`.
State: **`ans` holds the minimum value between the previous `ans` and the sum of all `a[j]` where `s[j]` is equal to `word[4]`, `be` is less than `en`, `en` is decremented by the number of times the condition in the loop is met, `tem` is the sum of all `a[j]` where `s[j]` is equal to `word[4]`, `cur` is 3, `s[j]` is equal to `word[i]` for the loop to execute another time, `tem` is incremented by `a[j]`, for the loop to execute another time `be` needs to be less than `en**`.
