Postcondition: ***`be`, `en`, `tem`, `cur`, `n`, `j` are integers. If `cur == i`, `be` is incremented by 1, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is updated based on the conditions in the loop body, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, and `j` is incremented by 1. If `s[j] == word[cur]`, then `cur` is also incremented by 1.***
