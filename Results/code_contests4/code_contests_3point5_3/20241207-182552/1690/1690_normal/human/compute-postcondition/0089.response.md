According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 0. Before the loop starts, the initial values of `be`, `tem`, and `cur` are given, which need to be adjusted for the loop to execute successfully. 
State: **`be` is incremented by the number of times the loop executes when `cur` is not equal to `i`, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is `n-1`**
