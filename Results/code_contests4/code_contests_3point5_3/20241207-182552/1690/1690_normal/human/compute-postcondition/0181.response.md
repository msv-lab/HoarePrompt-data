Output State: **`ans` holds the minimum value between the previous `ans` and the sum of all `a[j]` where `s[j]` is equal to `word[4]`. `be` is equal to `n`, `en` is decremented by the number of times the condition in the loop is met. `tem` is the sum of all `a[j]` where `s[j]` is equal to `word[4]`. `cur` is 3. `s[j]` is equal to `word[i]` for the loop to execute.**
