Postcondition: ***`be` is less than `en - 1`, `be` is equal to the number of times `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]` before `cur` becomes equal to `i`, `en` is decremented by the total number of times the loop executed so far + 1, `tem` is updated based on the value of `a[j]`, `cur`, `n`, `j` remain unchanged after the if statement executes.***
