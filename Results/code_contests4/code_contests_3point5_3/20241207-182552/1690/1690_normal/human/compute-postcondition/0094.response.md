Output State: **`be` is incremented by the number of times the loop executes when `cur` is not equal to `i`, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is `n-1`, `cur` is not equal to `i`, `s` is a list, `word` is a string, `j` is an integer, `n` is greater than or equal to 0. The element at index `j` in list `s` is equal to the character at index `cur` in string `word`.**
