According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `be`, `en` is decremented by 1, `en-1`, `tem`, `cur`, `n`, `j-1`, `s`, `word` remain unchanged. If `cur` is equal to `i`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]`, then `cur` is decremented by 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be greater than or equal to 0.
