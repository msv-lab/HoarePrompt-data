Example Answer:
`tem` is incremented by the value at index `j` in array `a`. The values of `tem`, `a`, `j`, and other variables remain the same as before. Therefore, the Output State is: `be` is incremented by the number of times the loop executes when `cur` is not equal to `i`, `en` is decremented by the total number of times the loop executes, `tem` is incremented by the value at index `j` in array `a`, `cur` is decremented by the number of times the loop executes when `cur` is not equal to `i`, `n` remains unchanged, `j` is equal to `be`, `s` and `word` remain unchanged, and `s[j]` is equal to `word[i]`.
Output State: **`be` is incremented by the number of times the loop executes when `cur` is not equal to `i`, `en` is decremented by the total number of times the loop executes, `tem` is incremented by the value at index `j` in array `a`, `cur` is decremented by the number of times the loop executes when `cur` is not equal to `i`, `n` remains unchanged, `j` is equal to `be`, `s` and `word` remain unchanged, and `s[j]` is equal to `word[i]`**
