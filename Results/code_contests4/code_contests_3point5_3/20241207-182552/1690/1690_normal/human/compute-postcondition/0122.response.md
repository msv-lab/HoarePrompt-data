Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`. The value of `tem` is the sum of all `a[j]` where `s[j]` is equal to `word[i]`. Therefore, after execution, `ans` will hold the minimum value between the current `ans` and the sum of all `a[j]` where `s[j]` is equal to `word[i]`. The states of other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`ans` holds the minimum value between the previous `ans` and the sum of all `a[j]` where `s[j]` is equal to `word[i]`, other variables remain unchanged**
