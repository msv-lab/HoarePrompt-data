Example Answer: 
The value of `be` is increased by 2, but there are no specific initial values given for `be`. As we encounter a `break` statement, we exit the loop or the most internal if statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `be` is increased by 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State: **`be` is increased by 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement**
