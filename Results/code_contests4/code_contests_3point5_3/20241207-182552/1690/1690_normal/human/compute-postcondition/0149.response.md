According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `ans` should be updated to hold the minimum value between the previous `ans` and the sum of all `a[j]` where `s[j]` is equal to `word[4]`
- `be` should be set to `n`
- `en` should be set to `n`
- `tem` should be set to 0
- `cur` should be set to 3
- `j` should be set to `n - 1` for the loop to start from the correct index

State: **`ans` holds the minimum value between the previous `ans` and the sum of all `a[j]` where `s[j]` is equal to `word[4]`, `be` is `n`, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is 3, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `n - 1`**
