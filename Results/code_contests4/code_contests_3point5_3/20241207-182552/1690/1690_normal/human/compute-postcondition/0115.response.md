According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `be`, `en`, and `j`. 

At the end of the last iteration, the following states are as follows:
- `be` is incremented based on the number of times the loop executed when `cur` was not equal to `i`
- `en` is decremented by the total number of times the loop executed
- `tem` is incremented by the value at index `j` in array `a`
- `cur` is decremented based on the number of times the loop executed when `cur` was not equal to `i`
- `n` remains unchanged
- `j` is equal to `be`
- `s` and `word` remain unchanged
- `s[j]` is equal to `word[i]`

For the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- `be` needs to be incremented or adjusted based on the conditions inside the loop body
- `en` needs to be decremented
- `j` needs to be incremented

State: **`be`, `en`, `tem`, `cur`, `n`, `j`, `s`, and `word` are variables. After the execution of the if statement, adjust the states accordingly to meet the loop conditions for the next iteration.**
