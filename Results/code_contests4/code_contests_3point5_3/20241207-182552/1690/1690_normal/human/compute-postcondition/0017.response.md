Example Answer:
`cur` is increased by 1. The previous value of `cur` is unknown, so after execution, `cur` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `be` is increased by 1, `en` is increased by 1, `tem` is increased by 1, `cur` is increased by 1, `n` is increased by 1, `j` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`be` is increased by 1, `en` is increased by 1, `tem` is increased by 1, `cur` is increased by 1, `n` is increased by 1, `j` is increased by 1**
