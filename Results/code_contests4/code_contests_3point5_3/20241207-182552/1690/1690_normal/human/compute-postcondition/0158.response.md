According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range from `n - 1` down to 0. Since `en` is decremented by 1 at the end of the last iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `en` needs to be decremented by 1 again to ensure that `j` falls within the specified range.
State: **`en` is decremented by 1**
