Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum of the current value of `ans` and `tem`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `be` is less than `en - 1`, `be` is equal to the number of times `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]` before `cur` becomes equal to `i`, `en` is decremented by the total number of times the loop executed, `tem` is the sum of all `a[j]` where `s[j]` is equal to `word[i]`, `cur`, `n`, `j` remain unchanged, and `ans` is updated to the minimum of the current value and `tem`.
Output State: **`be` is less than `en - 1`, `be` is equal to the number of times `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]` before `cur` becomes equal to `i`, `en` is decremented by the total number of times the loop executed, `tem` is the sum of all `a[j]` where `s[j]` is equal to `word[i]`, `cur`, `n`, `j` remain unchanged, `ans` is updated to the minimum of the current value and `tem`**
