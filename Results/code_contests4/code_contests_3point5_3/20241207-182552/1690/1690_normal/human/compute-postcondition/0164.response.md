According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `n`, `en`, `cur`, `i`, `s`, and `word`. At the end of the last iteration, `en` is further decremented by 1 if `cur` is not equal to `i` and `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]`, otherwise `en` is only decremented by 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- If `en` was decremented further by 1 in the last iteration, it will continue to be decremented by 1 in the next iteration.
- If `en` was only decremented by 1 in the last iteration, it will continue to be decremented by 1 in the next iteration.
- The value of `j` will change based on the loop range.
- Other variables such as `n`, `cur`, `i`, `s`, and `word` remain the same unless specified otherwise by the loop body.

State: **`en` is further decremented by 1 if `cur` is not equal to `i` and `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]`, otherwise `en` is only decremented by 1, `j` is updated based on the loop range**
