Postcondition: ***`ans` holds the minimum value between the previous `ans` and the sum of all `a[j]` where `s[j]` is equal to `word[4]`, `be` is 0, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is unknown but not equal to `i`, for the loop to execute `j` is within the range of `n`, and `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]` after the if-else block executes.***
