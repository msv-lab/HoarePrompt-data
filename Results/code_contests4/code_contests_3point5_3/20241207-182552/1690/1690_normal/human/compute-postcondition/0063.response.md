According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 4, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than 3. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`be` is less than `en - 1`, `be` is equal to the number of times `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]` before `cur` becomes equal to `i`, `en` is decremented by the total number of times the loop executed, `tem` is the sum of all `a[j]` where `s[j]` is equal to `word[i]`, `cur`, `n`, `j` remain unchanged, `ans` is updated to the minimum of the current value and `tem`, for the loop to execute a second time `i` needs to be incremented by 1**
