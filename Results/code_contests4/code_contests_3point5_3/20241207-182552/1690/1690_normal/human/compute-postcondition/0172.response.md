Postcondition: ***`ans` holds the minimum value between the previous `ans` and the sum of all `a[j]` where `s[j]` is equal to `word[4]`, `be` is equal to `n`, `en` is decremented by the number of times the condition in the loop is met, `tem` is 0, `cur` is 3, for the loop to execute `be` is less than `en`. Additionally, `s[j]` is equal to `word[i]`***
