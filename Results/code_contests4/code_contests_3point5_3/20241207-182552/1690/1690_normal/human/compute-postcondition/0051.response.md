According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `be`, and `en`. If `en` is greater than `be`, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the values of `be` and `en` need to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute. Specifically, `be` should be less than `en` for the loop to execute.
State: **`be` is less than `en`, `be` is equal to the number of times `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]` before `cur` becomes equal to `i`, `en` is decremented by the total number of times the loop executed, `tem`, `cur`, `n`, `j` remain unchanged**
