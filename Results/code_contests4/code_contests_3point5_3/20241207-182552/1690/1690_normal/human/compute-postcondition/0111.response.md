According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `be`, and `en`. The loop will execute as long as `be` is less than `en`. Before the loop starts, `be` is incremented by the number of times the loop executes when `cur` is not equal to `i` and `en` is decremented by the total number of times the loop executes. To adjust the state for the loop to execute, `be` should be incremented by the number of times the loop executes when `cur` is not equal to `i`, `en` should be decremented by the total number of times the loop executes, `tem` should remain 0, `cur` should be decremented by the number of times the loop executes when `cur` is not equal to `i`, `n` should remain unchanged, `j` should be set to the value of `be` to start the loop execution, and `s` and `word` should remain unchanged.

State: **`be` is incremented by the number of times the loop executes when `cur` is not equal to `i`, `en` is decremented by the total number of times the loop executes, `tem` is 0, `cur` is decremented by the number of times the loop executes when `cur` is not equal to `i`, `n` remains unchanged, `j` is equal to `be`, `s` and `word` remain unchanged**
