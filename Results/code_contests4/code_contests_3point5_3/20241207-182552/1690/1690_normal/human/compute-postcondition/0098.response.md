According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is within the range from `n - 1` to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `en` is decremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `en` should still be greater than 0.
State: **`be`, `en-1`, `tem`, `cur`, `n`, `j-1`, `s`, `word` are as described in the precondition.**
