Postcondition: ***`be` is incremented by the number of times the loop executes when `cur` is not equal to `i`, `en` is decremented by the total number of times the loop executes, `tem` is 0, `cur` is decremented by the number of times the loop executes when `cur` is not equal to `i`, `n` remains unchanged, `j` is equal to `be`, `s` and `word` remain unchanged. Additionally, `s[j]` is equal to `word[i]`***
