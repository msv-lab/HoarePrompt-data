According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `be` is 0, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, and `cur` is 0. In order for the loop to execute, `n` needs to be greater than or equal to 0 and `j` is now 0.
State: **`be` is 0, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is 0**
