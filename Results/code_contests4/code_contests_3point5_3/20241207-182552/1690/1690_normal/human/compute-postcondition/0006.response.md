According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `be` is 0 and `en` is the value of `n`, `tem` is 0, and `cur` is 0. In order for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 0, and `cur` is also 0.

State: **`be` is 0, `en` is the value of `n`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is 0, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 0**
