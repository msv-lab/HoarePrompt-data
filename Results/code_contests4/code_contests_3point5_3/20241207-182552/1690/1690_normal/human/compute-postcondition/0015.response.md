According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `be` is increased by 1, `en`, `tem`, `cur`, `n`, `j` remain unchanged. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **`be` is increased by 1, `en`, `tem`, `cur`, `n`, `j` is increased by 1**
