Postcondition: ***`be` is equal to the number of times `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]` before `cur` becomes equal to `i`, `en`, `tem`, `n`, `j` remain unchanged, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0. If `cur` is equal to `i`, then the loop or if statement breaks. If `cur` is not equal to `i`, then `cur` is decremented by 1 and `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]`***
