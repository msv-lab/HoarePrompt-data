Example Answer:
`cur` is incremented by 1. The previous values of the affected variables are: `be` is incremented by 1, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `cur` has been updated, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is incremented by 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `be` is incremented by 1, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is updated, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is incremented by 2.
Output State: **`be` is incremented by 1, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is updated, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is incremented by 2**
