According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. Since the loop iterates over `range(4)`, the loop will execute for 4 iterations in total. At the end of the last iteration, `ans` holds the minimum value between the previous `ans` and the sum of all `a[j]` where `s[j]` is equal to `word[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged. So for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` should be updated to 4.
State: **`ans` holds the minimum value between the previous `ans` and the sum of all `a[j]` where `s[j]` is equal to `word[4]`, other variables remain unchanged**
