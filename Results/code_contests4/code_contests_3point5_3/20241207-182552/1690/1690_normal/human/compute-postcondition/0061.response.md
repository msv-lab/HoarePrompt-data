Output State: **`be` is less than `en - 1`, `be` is equal to the number of times `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]` before `cur` becomes equal to `i`, `en` is decremented by the total number of times the loop executed, `tem` is the sum of all `a[j]` where `s[j]` is equal to `word[i]`, `cur`, `n`, `j` remain unchanged.**
