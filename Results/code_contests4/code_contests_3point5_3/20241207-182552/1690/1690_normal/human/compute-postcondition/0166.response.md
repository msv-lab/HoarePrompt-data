Example Answer:
The value of `cur` is decremented by 1. The previous state of `cur` is unknown, so the output state is: `en` is further decremented by 1 if `cur` is not equal to `i` and `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]`, otherwise `en` is only decremented by 1; `j` is updated based on the loop range.
Output State: **`en` is further decremented by 1 if `cur` is not equal to `i` and `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]`, otherwise `en` is only decremented by 1; `j` is updated based on the loop range**
