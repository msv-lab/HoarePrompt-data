Example Answer:
The value of `cur` is incremented by 1. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` holds the updated minimum value, `be` is incremented by 1, `cur` is updated to a value not equal to `i`, `j` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute again `s[j]` must be equal to `word[cur]`.
Output State: **`ans` holds the updated minimum value, `be` is incremented by 1, `cur` is updated to a value not equal to `i`, `j` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute again `s[j]` must be equal to `word[cur]`**
