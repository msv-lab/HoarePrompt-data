Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the integer value obtained from input, `s` is assigned the string value obtained from `rstr()` lambda function, `a` is assigned the list of integers obtained from `rints()` lambda function, `ans` is assigned `float('inf')` which represents positive infinity, and `word` is assigned the string value 'hard'. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is a string from input after stripping whitespace, `a` is a list of integers from input line, `ans` is positive infinity, `word` is 'hard'**
