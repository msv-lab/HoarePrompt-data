Postcondition: ***`be`, `en`, `tem`, `cur`, `n`, `j` are integers. If `cur` is equal to `i`, then `be` is incremented by 1, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is updated based on the conditions in the loop body, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is incremented by 2, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `cur` is not equal to `i` and `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]`, then the state of the variables remains the same.***
