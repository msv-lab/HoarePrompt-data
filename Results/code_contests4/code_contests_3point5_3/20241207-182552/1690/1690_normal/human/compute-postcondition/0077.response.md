Example Answer:
`cur` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cur` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `be` is incremented by 1, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is updated based on the conditions in the loop body, for the loop to execute again `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is incremented by 1, `cur` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`be` is incremented by 1, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is updated based on the conditions in the loop body, for the loop to execute again `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is incremented by 1, `cur` is incremented by 1**
