Correctness: **True**

The program follows the problem description as it correctly calculates the minimum ambiguity of the statement after removing some characters so that the resulting statement is easy. The program iterates through all possible subsequences of "hard" and calculates the sum of corresponding ambiguity values for each subsequence. It then keeps track of the minimum ambiguity value found. Finally, it prints the minimum ambiguity value.

The program correctly handles all possible cases as described in the problem description, ensuring that the resulting statement is easy by deleting characters from the original statement.
