Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It reads the input values, iterates through the string to find the minimum sum of elements in the list `a` based on specific conditions, and then prints the calculated minimum sum. The program follows the logic described in the problem statement and provides the expected output based on the given input.
