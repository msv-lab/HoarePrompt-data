Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program iterates through the characters of the input string 's' and calculates the minimum possible ambiguity of the statement after Vasya deletes some characters so that the resulting statement is easy. It correctly handles the conditions where the subsequence 'hard' needs to be preserved by checking for the characters in the correct sequence and summing up the corresponding ambiguity values. The program then calculates the minimum ambiguity and prints the result. The logic implemented in the program aligns with the problem description for all potential cases, ensuring that the minimum ambiguity is calculated accurately. Hence, the program is correct.
