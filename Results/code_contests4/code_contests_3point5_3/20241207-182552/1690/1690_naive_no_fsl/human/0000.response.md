Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input, processes the given string to find the minimum ambiguity by removing characters to make the statement easy. It iterates through different positions to find the subsequences 'hard' and calculates the ambiguity in each case, keeping track of the minimum ambiguity found. The logic implemented in the code aligns with the problem description and covers all potential cases to determine the minimum ambiguity accurately.
