You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Rng is going to a festival.

The name of the festival is given to you as a string S, which ends with `FESTIVAL`, from input. Answer the question: "Rng is going to a festival of what?" Output the answer.

Here, assume that the name of "a festival of s" is a string obtained by appending `FESTIVAL` to the end of s. For example, `CODEFESTIVAL` is a festival of `CODE`.

Constraints

* 9 \leq |S| \leq 50
* S consists of uppercase English letters.
* S ends with `FESTIVAL`.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


S


Output

Print the answer to the question: "Rng is going to a festival of what?"

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with a length between 9 and 50 inclusive, and S ends with the word "FESTIVAL".**
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    res = []
    count = 0
    if (s[0] == '1') :
        one = 1
    else :
        one = 0
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with a length between 9 and 50 inclusive, and S ends with the word "FESTIVAL"; n is an input integer; res is an empty list; count is 0.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After the loop finishes executing, `count` will contain the sum of all the `temp` values calculated during each iteration of the loop. All other variables will retain their initial values as specified in the initial state.
    print(count)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` takes user input for an integer `n` and a string `s`, then processes the string based on certain conditions. It extracts specific sequences from the input string `s`, calculates values based on these sequences, and ultimately prints the sum of these calculated values. The function assumes that the input string `s` consists of uppercase English letters with a length between 9 and 50 inclusive, and ends with the word "FESTIVAL". The processing of the string involves identifying patterns and updating values accordingly to derive the final sum printed at the end.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
