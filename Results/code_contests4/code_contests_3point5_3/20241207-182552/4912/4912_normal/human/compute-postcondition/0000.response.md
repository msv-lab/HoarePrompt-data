Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state mentions that `S` is a string ending with "FESTIVAL", and the length of `S` is between 9 and 50 inclusive. The code snippet provided does not affect the string `S` in any way. Therefore, the Output State is: S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with a length between 9 and 50 inclusive, and S ends with the word "FESTIVAL"; `n` is an input integer.
Output State: **S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with a length between 9 and 50 inclusive, and S ends with the word "FESTIVAL"; `n` is an input integer**
