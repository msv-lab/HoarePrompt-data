Postcondition: ***S is a string ending with "FESTIVAL" of length between 9 and 50, n is an integer greater than or equal to 4, res is a list containing a copy of temp, count is 0, one is either 2, 1, or 0 based on the first character of S (incremented by 1), temp is a list containing the updated value of one after appending, tar is 0, the subsequence of S starting at index i+1 and ending at index i+4 is not equal to '101'. If s[i+1] == '0' and tar == 1, then the function performs a specific action. If s[i+1] == '1', the value of one is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the value of one is set to 0.***
