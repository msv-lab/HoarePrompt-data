Functionality: **The function `func` takes user input for an integer `n` and a string `s`, then processes the string based on certain conditions. It extracts specific sequences from the input string `s`, calculates values based on these sequences, and ultimately prints the sum of these calculated values. The function assumes that the input string `s` consists of uppercase English letters with a length between 9 and 50 inclusive, and ends with the word "FESTIVAL". The processing of the string involves identifying patterns and updating values accordingly to derive the final sum printed at the end.**
