Example Answer:
`temp` is appended to the `res` list. The value of `temp` is not provided, but it is mentioned that it contains the value of `one`. Since the value of `one` is based on the first character of `S`, which is not given, the exact value of `temp` cannot be determined. Therefore, the output state is: S is a string ending with "FESTIVAL" of length between 9 and 50, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `res` is a list with elements containing the value of `one`, `count` is 0, `one` is either 2, 1, or 0 based on the first character of S, `temp` contains the value of `one`, `tar` is 0, the subsequence of S starting at index i and ending at index i+3 is not equal to '101'.
Output State: **S is a string ending with "FESTIVAL" of length between 9 and 50, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `res` is a list with elements containing the value of `one`, `count` is 0, `one` is either 2, 1, or 0 based on the first character of S, `temp` contains the value of `one`, `tar` is 0, the subsequence of S starting at index i and ending at index i+3 is not equal to '101'.**
