Output State: **S is a string ending with "FESTIVAL", n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, res is a list with elements containing the updated value of one, count is increased by the value of temp, one is either 1 or a positive integer based on the occurrences of '101' and '0' in the string S, temp is the maximum value between the last element of f and the second to last element of f, tar is 0, the last character of S is '1', m is at least 6, f will have new elements appended, temp is the maximum value between the last element of f and the second to last element of f, m is the length of x, f is a list containing [x[0], x[1]], temp is assigned the maximum value between x[0], x[1], and x[2]. If m is equal to 3, temp is assigned the maximum value between x[0], x[1], and x[2], f will have new elements appended, for the loop to execute a second time i is 4, f is updated with a new element calculated based on the values of x, f, and i.**
