Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `S` is a string ending with "FESTIVAL", `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `res` is a list with more elements, `count` is increased by the value of `temp`, `one` is either 1 or a positive integer based on the occurrences of '101' and '0' in the string `S`, `tar` is 0, the last character of `S` is '1', `m` is at least 6, `f` will have new elements appended based on the calculations within the loop, `temp` is assigned the maximum value between the last element of `f` and the second to last element of `f`, `m` is the length of `x`, `temp` is assigned the maximum value between `x[0]`, `x[1]`, and `x[2]`, `temp` is assigned the maximum value between `x[0]`, `x[1]`, and `max(x[0], x[1], x[2])`, `temp` is assigned the maximum value between `x[0] + x[2]`, `x[3] + max(x[0], x[1])`, `f` contains the list `[x[0], x[1]]`, `f` contains the list `[x[1], max(x[2], x[0])]`, `f` will have multiple new elements appended based on the loop iterations, `f` will have new elements appended based on the calculations within the loop, `temp` is assigned the maximum value between `f[-1][0], f[-1][1], f[-2][0])`**
