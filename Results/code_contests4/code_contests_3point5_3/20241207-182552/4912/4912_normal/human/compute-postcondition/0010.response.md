Example Answer:
The variable `tar` is assigned the value 0. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with a length between 9 and 50 inclusive, and S ends with the word "FESTIVAL"; n is an input integer; res is an empty list; count is 0. If the first character of S is '1', then one is assigned the value 1. If the first character of S is not '1', then one is assigned the value 0; temp is an empty list.
