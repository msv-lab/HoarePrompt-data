Example Answer:
`tar` is assigned the value 1. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with a length between 9 and 50 inclusive, ending with "FESTIVAL"; n is an integer greater than or equal to 2; res is an empty list; count is 0; one is either 1 or 0 depending on the first character of S; temp is an empty list; tar is 1.
