Example Answer:
The list `res` appends a copy of the list `temp`. The values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: S is a string ending with "FESTIVAL" of length between 9 and 50, n is an integer greater than or equal to 4, res is a list containing a copy of temp, count is 0, one is either 2, 1, or 0 based on the first character of S (incremented by 1), temp is a list containing the value of one, tar is 0, the subsequence of S starting at index i+1 and ending at index i+4 is not equal to '101', temp contains the updated value of one after appending.
Output State: **S is a string ending with "FESTIVAL" of length between 9 and 50, n is an integer greater than or equal to 4, res is a list containing a copy of temp, count is 0, one is either 2, 1, or 0 based on the first character of S (incremented by 1), temp is a list containing the value of one, tar is 0, the subsequence of S starting at index i+1 and ending at index i+4 is not equal to '101', temp contains the updated value of one after appending**
