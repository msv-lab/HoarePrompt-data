According to the code, the loop will only execute if the value of n is greater than or equal to 2. Before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with a length between 9 and 50 inclusive, ending with "FESTIVAL"; n is an integer greater than or equal to 2; res is an empty list; count is 0; if the first character of S is '1', one is assigned the value 1, otherwise one is assigned the value 0; temp is an empty list; tar is 0**
