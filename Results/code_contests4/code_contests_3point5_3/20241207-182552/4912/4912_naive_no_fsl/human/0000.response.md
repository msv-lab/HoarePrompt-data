Correctness: **False**

The given program is not related to the problem description at all. It seems to be a dynamic programming solution for a completely different problem that involves calculating the maximum sum of non-adjacent elements in a list. The program does not address the problem of determining the festival that Rng is going to based on the input string.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
