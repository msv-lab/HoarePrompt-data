According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `la`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 4. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of binary representation of integers in list `a`, `cnt` is a list of integers with a length of `mxlba + 5`, `axor` is the binary representation of the result of XOR operation between all elements in list `a`, `la` is the length of `axor`, `ans` is either 0 or 1 based on the condition, for the loop to execute again `i` is 4, `cnt[i]` may be decremented by 1, `tmp` is calculated as the integer value of a binary string of length (la - i - 1) filled with '1's, `axor` is converted to a binary string and stored in itself, and if `axor[i]` is '1', then the specified operations are executed**
