According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `lb`. If `lb` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of binary representation of integers in list `a`, `cnt` is a list of integers with a length of `mxlba + 5` where the `j`-th element has been incremented by 1, `bit` is the binary representation of the integer at index `i`, `lb` is the length of `bit`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `lb` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of binary representation of integers in list `a`, `cnt` is a list of integers with a length of `mxlba + 5` where the `j`-th element has been incremented by 1, `bit` is the binary representation of the integer at index `i`, `lb` is the length of `bit`, for the loop to execute one more time `lb` must be greater than 1**
