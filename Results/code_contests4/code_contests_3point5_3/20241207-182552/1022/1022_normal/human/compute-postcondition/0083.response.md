Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of binary representation of integers in list `a`, `cnt` is a list of integers with a length of `mxlba + 5`, `axor` is the binary representation of the result of XOR operation between all elements in list `a`, `la` is the length of `axor`, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1, `axor` at index `i` is equal to '1', `cnt[i]` is equal to 0.**

Note: The code snippet provided only prints -1 and does not affect the initial state variables.
