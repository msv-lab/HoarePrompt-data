According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. The variables `i` and `n` are the key factors for the loop execution. Before the loop starts, `a` is a list of integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of binary representation of integers in list `a`, and `cnt` is a list of zeros with a length of `mxlba + 5`. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, the variables `i` and `n` need to be updated. 
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of binary representation of integers in list `a`, `cnt` is a list of zeros with a length of `mxlba + 5` for the loop to execute the first time**
