Example Answer:
The value of the element at index `lb - 1 - j` in the list `cnt` is incremented by 1. The initial state mentions that `j` is between `lb - 2` and -1, so the affected index is valid. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is between `lb - 2` and -1, `n` is greater than the updated `i`, `cnt` has been updated with the count of '1's at specific positions in the binary representation of integers in list `a` for the next iteration.
Output State: **`j` is between `lb - 2` and -1, `n` is greater than the updated `i`, `cnt` has been updated with the count of '1's at specific positions in the binary representation of integers in list `a` for the next iteration**
