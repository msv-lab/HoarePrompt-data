Example Answer:
The code snippet simply prints the value of `ans`. Since the code does not modify any variables and only prints the current value of `ans`, the Output State remains the same.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of binary representation of integers in list `a`, `cnt` is a list of integers with a length of `mxlba + 5`, `axor` is the binary representation of the result of XOR operation between all elements in list `a`, `la` is the length of `axor`, `ans` is the number of '1's in the binary representation of `axor` for which `cnt` was greater than 0, `i` is equal to `la` after the loop completes**
