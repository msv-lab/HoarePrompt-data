Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of binary representation of integers in list `a`, `i` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time, `mxlba` is updated to be the maximum value between its current value and the length of the binary representation of the integer at index `i` in list `a`**
