Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of binary representation of integers in list `a`, `cnt` is a list of integers with a length of `mxlba + 5` where the j-th element has been incremented by 1, `bit` is the binary representation of the integer at index `i`, `lb` is the length of `bit` and `lb >= 1`, for the loop to execute the second time `j` is `lb - 2`, `cnt[lb - 1 - j]` has been incremented by 1. We break out of the loop or if statement.**
