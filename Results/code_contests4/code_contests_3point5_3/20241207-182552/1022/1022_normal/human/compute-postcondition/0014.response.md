According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `lb`. If lb is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is greater than 0 and i is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `lb` is greater than or equal to 1. 
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of binary representation of integers in list `a`, `cnt` is a list of zeros with a length of `mxlba + 5`, `bit` is the binary representation of the integer at index `i`, `lb` is the length of `bit`, for the loop to execute the first time `lb` is greater than or equal to 1**
