Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of binary representation of integers in list `a`, `cnt` is a list of integers with a length of `mxlba + 5`, `axor` is the result of bitwise XOR operation between all elements in list `a`. If the bitwise XOR of all elements in list `a` is 0, then the overall state of the program remains unchanged.***
