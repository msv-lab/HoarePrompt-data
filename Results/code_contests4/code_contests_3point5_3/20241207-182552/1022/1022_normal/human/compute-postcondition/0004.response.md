Example Answer:
The code calculates the length of the binary representation of the integer at index `i` in list `a` and compares it with the current value of `mxlba`. The maximum of these two values is then assigned to `mxlba`. Since the initial value of `mxlba` is 0 and `i` is initialized to 0 for the first loop iteration, the length of the binary representation of the first integer in list `a` will become the new value of `mxlba`. 
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of binary representation of integers in list `a`, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
