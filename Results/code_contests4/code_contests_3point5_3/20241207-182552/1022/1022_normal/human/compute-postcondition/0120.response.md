Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of binary representation of integers in list `a`, `cnt` is a list of integers with a length of `mxlba + 5`, `axor` is the binary representation of the result of XOR operation between all elements in list `a`, `la` is the length of `axor`, `ans` is either 0 or 1 based on the condition, `i` is 5, `cnt[i]` is decremented by 1, `tmp` is calculated as the integer value of a binary string of length (la - i - 1) filled with '1's. If `cnt[i]` equals 0, then the program exits. Otherwise, the program continues with an updated state where `axor` is the updated binary representation after XOR operation.***
