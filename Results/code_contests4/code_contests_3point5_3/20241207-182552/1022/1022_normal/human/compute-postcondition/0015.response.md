Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of binary representation of integers in list `a`, `cnt` is a list of zeros with a length of `mxlba + 5`, `bit` is the binary representation of the integer at index `i`, `lb` is the length of `bit`, for the loop to execute the first time `lb` is greater than or equal to 1. The `j`-th element of `bit` is '1'***
