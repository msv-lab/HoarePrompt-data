Example Answer:
The value of `cnt[lb - 1 - j]` is incremented by 1. The previous values of variables are known, so after execution, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of binary representation of integers in list `a`, `cnt` is a list of integers with a length of `mxlba + 5` where the j-th element has been incremented by 1, `bit` is the binary representation of the integer at index `i`, `lb` is the length of `bit`, for the loop to execute the second time `lb` is greater than or equal to 1, and `j` is `lb - 2.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of binary representation of integers in list `a`, `cnt` is a list of integers with a length of `mxlba + 5` where the j-th element has been incremented by 1, `bit` is the binary representation of the integer at index `i`, `lb` is the length of `bit`, for the loop to execute the second time `lb` is greater than or equal to 1, and `j` is `lb - 2**.
