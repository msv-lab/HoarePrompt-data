Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of binary representation of integers in list `a`, `cnt` is a list of integers with a length of `mxlba + 5` where each element represents the count of '1's at a specific position in the binary representation of integers in list `a`.**
