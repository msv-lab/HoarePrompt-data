Example Answer:
`bit` is assigned the binary representation of the integer at index `i` in list `a`. The previous values of variables `a`, `i`, `cnt`, and `n` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: After all iterations of the loop, `cnt` will have been updated with the count of '1's at specific positions in the binary representation of integers in list `a`, `i` is updated, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than the updated `i`.
Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `cnt` will have been updated with the count of '1's at specific positions in the binary representation of integers in list `a`, `i` is updated, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than the updated `i`**
