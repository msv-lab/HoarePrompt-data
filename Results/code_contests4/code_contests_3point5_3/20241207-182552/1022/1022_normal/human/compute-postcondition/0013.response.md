Example Answer:
The length of the binary representation of the integer at index `i` in list `a` is calculated and assigned to variable `lb`. The variables `n`, `i`, `a`, `mxlba`, `cnt`, and `bit` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of binary representation of integers in list `a`, `cnt` is a list of zeros with a length of `mxlba + 5` for the loop to execute the first time, `bit` is the binary representation of the integer at index `i`, `lb` is the length of `bit`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of binary representation of integers in list `a`, `cnt` is a list of zeros with a length of `mxlba + 5` for the loop to execute the first time, `bit` is the binary representation of the integer at index `i`, `lb` is the length of `bit`**
