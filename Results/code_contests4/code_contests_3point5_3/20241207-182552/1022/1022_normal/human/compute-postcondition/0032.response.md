Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of binary representation of integers in list `a`, `cnt` is a list of integers with a length of `mxlba + 5`, `bit` is the binary representation of the integer at index `i`, `lb` is the length of `bit`, for the loop to execute the first time `lb` is greater than or equal to 1 and `j` is `lb - 1. Additionally, when entering the if condition, the j-th element of the binary representation `bit` is '1'***
