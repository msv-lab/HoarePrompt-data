According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is within the range from `lb - 1` to `0`. Therefore, before the loop starts, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `j` should be between `lb - 1` and `0`
- `n` should be greater than the updated `i`
- `cnt` should have been updated with the count of '1's at specific positions in the binary representation of integers in list `a`
State: **`j` is between `lb - 1` and `0`, `n` is greater than the updated `i`, `cnt` has been updated with the count of '1's at specific positions in the binary representation of integers in list `a`**
