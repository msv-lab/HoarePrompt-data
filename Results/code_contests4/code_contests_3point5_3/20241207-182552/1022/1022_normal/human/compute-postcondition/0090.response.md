Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of binary representation of integers in list `a`, `cnt` is a list of integers with a length of `mxlba + 5`, `axor` is the binary representation of the result of XOR operation between all elements in list `a`, `la` is the length of `axor`, `ans` is 1, `i` is 1. The `axor` at index `i` is equal to '1'. Additionally, `cnt[i]` is not equal to 0. After execution, `cnt[i]` is decremented by 1. Since the condition `la - i - 1 == 0` holds true, the program will decrement `cnt[i]` by 1.***
