According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `la`. If `i` is less than `la`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is -1 and `la` is the length of `axor`. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 so that it becomes greater than or equal to 0.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of binary representation of integers in list `a`, `cnt` is a list of integers with a length of `mxlba + 5`, `axor` is the binary representation of the result of XOR operation between all elements in list `a`, `la` is the length of `axor`, `ans` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0**
