Output State: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of binary representation of integers in list `a`, `cnt` is a list of integers with a length of `mxlba + 5` where the `j`-th element has been incremented by 1, `bit` is the binary representation of the integer at index `i`, `lb` is the length of `bit`, for the loop to execute one more time `lb` must be greater than 1, `cnt[lb - 2 - j]` is incremented by 1, and the element at index `lb - 1 - j` in list `cnt` is incremented by 1. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
