Example Answer:
`cnt[lb - 1 - j]` is incremented by 1. The previous values of variables are known as described. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is between `lb - 1` and `0`, `n` is greater than the updated `i`, `cnt` has been updated with the count of '1's at specific positions in the binary representation of integers in list `a`, and the `j`th bit in the `bit` list is '1'.
Output State: **`j` is between `lb - 1` and `0`, `n` is greater than the updated `i`, `cnt` has been updated with the count of '1's at specific positions in the binary representation of integers in list `a`, and the `j`th bit in the `bit` list is '1'**
