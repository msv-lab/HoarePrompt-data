According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of binary representation of integers in list `a`, `i` is 0. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and `i` must be less than `n`.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of binary representation of integers in list `a`, `i` is 1 for the loop to execute a second time**
