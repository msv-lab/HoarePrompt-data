According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `la`. If `i` is less than `la`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `la` is the length of `axor`. To ensure the loop executes again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of binary representation of integers in list `a`, `cnt` is a list of integers with a length of `mxlba + 5`, `axor` is the binary representation of the result of XOR operation between all elements in list `a`, `la` is the length of `axor`, `ans` is 0, `i` is 2 for the loop to execute again**
