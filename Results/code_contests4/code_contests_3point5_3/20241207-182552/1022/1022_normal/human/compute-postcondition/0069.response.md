Example Answer:
`axor` is updated by performing a bitwise XOR operation with the element at index `i+1` of list `a`, and `i` is increased by 1. The loop will execute one more time if `n` is greater than the updated `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `axor` is updated by XOR operation with the element at index `i+1` of list `a`, `i` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`axor` is updated by XOR operation with the element at index `i+1` of list `a`, `i` is increased by 1**
