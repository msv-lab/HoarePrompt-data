Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of binary representation of integers in list `a`, `cnt` is a list of integers with a length of `mxlba + 5`, `axor` is the binary representation of the result of XOR operation between all elements in list `a`, `la` is the length of `axor`, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1. If `cnt[i]` is 0, then `ans` remains 0 and there is no change in any other variables. If `cnt[i]` is not 0, then `ans` becomes 1, `cnt[i]` is decremented by 2, and `axor` is updated to exclude the '0b' prefix.***
