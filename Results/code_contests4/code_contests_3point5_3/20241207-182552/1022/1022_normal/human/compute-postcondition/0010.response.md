Example Answer:
`cnt` is assigned a list of zeros with a length of `mxlba + 5`, where `mxlba` is the maximum length of the binary representation of integers in list `a`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of binary representation of integers in list `a`, `cnt` is a list of zeros with a length of `mxlba + 5`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of binary representation of integers in list `a`, `cnt` is a list of zeros with a length of `mxlba + 5`**
