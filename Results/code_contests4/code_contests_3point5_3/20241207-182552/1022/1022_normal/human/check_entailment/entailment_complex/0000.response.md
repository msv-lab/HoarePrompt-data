Correctness: **True**

The annotated program reads the input, calculates the maximum length of the binary representation of integers in the list, counts the occurrences of '1' bits at different positions in the binary representations, performs a bitwise XOR operation on all elements in the list, and then calculates the number of '1' bits in the XOR result to determine the number of stones the cheater will eat. The program handles the case where the cheater cannot win by returning -1.

The program always follows the problem description and correctly computes the number of stones the cheater will eat to guarantee a win or returns -1 if the cheater cannot win.
