Correctness: **True**

The program correctly computes the number of stones the cheater will eat in order to guarantee a win in the game of Nim. It follows the problem description by first calculating the bitwise XOR of all the elements in the list `a` to determine the initial state of the game. If the XOR result is 0, the cheater can't guarantee a win and the program outputs -1. Otherwise, it iterates through the binary representation of the XOR result, checking for positions where there are '1's and adjusting the count of stones to eat accordingly.

The program handles all possible cases as described in the problem, ensuring that the cheater eats the minimum number of stones to guarantee a win or outputs -1 if a win is not possible.
