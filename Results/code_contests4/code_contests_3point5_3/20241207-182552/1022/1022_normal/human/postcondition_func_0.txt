The function reads an integer input, then reads a list of integers. It calculates the maximum length of the binary representation of integers in the list. It then iterates through the list to count the occurrences of '1' bits at different positions in the binary representations. After that, it performs a bitwise XOR operation on all elements in the list. If the result is 0, it prints 0 and exits. Otherwise, it calculates the number of '1' bits at different positions in the XOR result while ensuring that each position has non-zero count in the previous calculation. The function finally prints the total count of '1' bits in the XOR result. The function does not accept any parameters and outputs specific values based on the calculations.
