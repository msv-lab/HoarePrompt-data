Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the Nim game problem as described in the problem description. It calculates the number of stones the cheater will eat in order to guarantee a win, or outputs -1 if there is no way for the cheater to win even with cheating.

The program efficiently calculates the number of stones to eat by first finding the maximum length of the binary representation of the numbers in the piles. It then calculates the number of set bits at each position in the binary representation of the XOR of all pile numbers. Based on this information, it determines the optimal strategy for the cheater to win the game.

The program handles all possible cases and edge cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, based on the provided code and the problem description, the correctness of the program can be considered True.
