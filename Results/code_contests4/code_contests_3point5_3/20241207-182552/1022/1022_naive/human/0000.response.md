Correctness: **False**

The given Python program does not correctly solve the problem described. One potential case where the program fails is when all the piles have the same number of stones and that number is odd. In this case, the cheater cannot win by eating stones from any pile because the total number of stones will still be odd, and the cheetah can always make a move to leave an even number of stones which the cheater cannot match. However, the program will output a non-negative number as the answer instead of -1 in this case.
