Example Answer:
The code prints the sorted list of page numbers associated with the word. There is no direct impact on the initial state variables, but it is implied that the loop will execute one more time if there are unsorted page numbers left in the index. Therefore, the Output State is: The sorted list of page numbers associated with the word is printed, the loop may execute one more time if there are unsorted page numbers left in the index.
Output State: **The sorted list of page numbers associated with the word is printed, the loop may execute one more time if there are unsorted page numbers left in the index**
