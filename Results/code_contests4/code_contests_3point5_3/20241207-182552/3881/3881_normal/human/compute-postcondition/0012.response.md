Example Answer:
The code prints the value of `word`, which is the first word in the sorted list of keys of the dictionary `index`. The value of `word` is the first word in the sorted list of keys of `index`. Therefore, the Output State is: `index` is a dictionary where each key is a word and the corresponding value is a list of page numbers associated with that word; `word` is the first word in the sorted list of keys.
Output State: **`index` is a dictionary where each key is a word and the corresponding value is a list of page numbers associated with that word; `word` is the first word in the sorted list of keys**.
