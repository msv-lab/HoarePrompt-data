Since the previous values of `word` and `page` are unknown, we cannot determine the exact state at the end of the previous iteration. However, based on the given for loop statement, we can infer that the loop will execute as long as there are more lines to read from the stdin. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we can adjust the state as follows:

State: **The loop will execute one more time as long as there are more lines to read from stdin**
