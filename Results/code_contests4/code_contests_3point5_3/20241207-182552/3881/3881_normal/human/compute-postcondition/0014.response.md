According to the code, the loop will iterate through the keys of the dictionary `index` in sorted order. If there are more keys left to iterate, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `index` is a dictionary where each key is a word and the corresponding value is a list of page numbers associated with that word; `word` is the first word in the sorted list of keys.

To execute the loop one more time, the next word in the sorted list of keys needs to be considered. So, the word variable should be updated to the next word in the sorted list of keys. This means the next word in the sorted list of keys should be assigned to the word variable.

State: **`index` is a dictionary where each key is a word and the corresponding value is a list of page numbers associated with that word; `word` is the next word in the sorted list of keys**
