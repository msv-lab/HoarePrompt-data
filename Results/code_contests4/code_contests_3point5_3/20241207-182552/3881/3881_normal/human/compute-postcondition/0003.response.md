Example Answer:
The value of `page` is converted to an integer using `int(page)` and then appended to the list `index[word]`. The previous values of `word` and `page` are unknown, so we cannot determine the exact output state.
Output State: **The output state cannot be determined as the previous values of `word` and `page` are unknown.**
