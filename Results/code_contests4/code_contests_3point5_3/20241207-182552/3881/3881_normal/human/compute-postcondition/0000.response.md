Example Answer:
`index` is assigned a defaultdict where the keys are words and the values are lists of page numbers. Since no pairs have been added yet, the defaultdict is empty. Therefore, the Output State is: Each pair consists of a word and a page number. The number of pairs is less than or equal to 100. Each word appears in the pairs at most once.
Output State: **Each pair consists of a word and a page number. The number of pairs is less than or equal to 100. Each word appears in the pairs at most once.**
