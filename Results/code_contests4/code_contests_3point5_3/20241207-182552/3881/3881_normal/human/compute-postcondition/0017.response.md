According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the sorting of the `index` which is a list of page numbers associated with the word. If the list is not fully iterated, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the sorted list of page numbers associated with the word is printed. So for the loop to be executed one more time, there must be unsorted page numbers remaining to iterate over.
State: **The sorted list of page numbers associated with the word is printed, for the loop to execute one more time, there must be unsorted page numbers left in the index**
