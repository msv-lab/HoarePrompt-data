Example Answer:
The code simply prints the value of the variable `word`, which is the next word in the sorted list of keys in the dictionary. There is no change in the initial state of the variables `index` and `word`. Therefore, the Output State is: `index` is a dictionary where each key is a word and the corresponding value is a list of page numbers associated with that word; `word` is the next word in the sorted list of keys.
Output State: **`index` is a dictionary where each key is a word and the corresponding value is a list of page numbers associated with that word; `word` is the next word in the sorted list of keys**
