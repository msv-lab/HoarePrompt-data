Example Answer:
The variables `word` and `page` are assigned values by splitting the input line. The values are extracted based on the whitespace separator. The initial state does not provide the specific values of `word` and `page`, so the output state will be the assigned values after splitting the input line.
Output State: **`word` is assigned a value, `page` is assigned a value**
