Example Answer: 
The code simply prints the value of the variable `word`. There is no change in the state of the variables as the loop does not iterate further. Therefore, the Output State is: The sorted list of page numbers associated with the word is printed, for the loop to execute one more time, there must be unsorted page numbers left in the index.
Output State: **The sorted list of page numbers associated with the word is printed, for the loop to execute one more time, there must be unsorted page numbers left in the index**
