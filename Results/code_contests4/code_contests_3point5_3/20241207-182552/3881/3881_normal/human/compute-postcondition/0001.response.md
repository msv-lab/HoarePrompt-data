According to the code, the loop will execute for each line in the standard input (stdin). Since the number of pairs is less than or equal to 100, the loop will execute for each pair until the end. Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted so that the loop can execute successfully. Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be:
State: **Each pair consists of a word and a page number, the number of pairs is less than or equal to 100, for the loop to execute the first time line is the first line in stdin**
