Example Answer:
`word` and `page` are assigned values from `line.split()`, where `line` is a string that is split based on whitespace. The exact values of `word` and `page` cannot be determined without knowing the input values of `line`. Therefore, the Output State is: Cannot determine the exact output state without initial values of `index`, `word`, and `page`.
Output State: **Cannot determine the exact output state without initial values of `index`, `word`, and `page`.**
