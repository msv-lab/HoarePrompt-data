According to the code, the loop can execute if the `index` dictionary has at least one word. Before the loop starts, `index` is a dictionary where each key is a word and the corresponding value is a list of page numbers associated with that word, so it already meets the requirement for the loop to execute. However, since the loop is iterating over the sorted keys of the dictionary, the state needs to be adjusted so that `word` is the first word in the sorted list of keys.
State: **`index` is a dictionary where each key is a word and the corresponding value is a list of page numbers associated with that word, for the loop to execute the first time `word` is the first word in the sorted list of keys**
