Example Answer:
The code appends the integer value of `page` to the list stored in the `index` dictionary under the key `word`. However, since the initial state does not provide the values of `index`, `word`, or `page`, we cannot determine the exact output state.
Output State: **Cannot determine the exact output state without initial values of `index`, `word`, and `page`.**
