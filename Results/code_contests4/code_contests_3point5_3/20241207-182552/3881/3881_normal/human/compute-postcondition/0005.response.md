Example Answer:
The variables `word` and `page` are assigned values by splitting the `line` variable. The `line` variable is not mentioned in the initial state, so we cannot determine the values of `word` and `page` at this point. Therefore, the Output State is: The values of `word` and `page` are assigned by splitting an undefined `line` variable.
Output State: **The values of `word` and `page` are assigned by splitting an undefined `line` variable**
