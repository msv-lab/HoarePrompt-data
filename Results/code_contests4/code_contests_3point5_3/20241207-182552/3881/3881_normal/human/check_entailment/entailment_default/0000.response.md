Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads pairs of words and page numbers from the standard input, creates a dictionary where each word is a key with a corresponding list of page numbers, and prints each word followed by its sorted list of page numbers.
- The code handles the case where a word never appears on a page more than once.
- The words are printed in alphabetical order and the page numbers are printed in ascending order, as required by the problem description.
- The code also correctly exits without returning any value after printing the word and corresponding page numbers. 
- The output hints also agree with the code, confirming that the code is correct.
