You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Books are indexed. Write a program which reads a list of pairs of a word and a page number, and prints the word and a list of the corresponding page numbers.

You can assume that a word consists of at most 30 characters, and the page number is less than or equal to 1000. The number of pairs of a word and a page number is less than or equal to 100. A word never appear in a page more than once.

The words should be printed in alphabetical order and the page numbers should be printed in ascending order.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each pair consists of a word (string of at most 30 characters) and a page number (integer less than or equal to 1000). The number of pairs is less than or equal to 100. Each word appears in the pairs at most once.**
def func_1():
    index = defaultdict(list)
    for line in stdin:
        word, page = line.split()
        
        index[word].append(int(page))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `index` is a dictionary where each key is a word and the corresponding value is a list of page numbers associated with that word. Each word from the input pairs will have its page number appended to its list in the `index` dictionary.
    for word in sorted(index):
        print(word)
        
        print(*sorted(index[word]))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `index` is a dictionary where each key is a word and the corresponding value is a list of page numbers associated with that word; `word` is the last word in the sorted list of keys. The sorted list of page numbers associated with the last word in the sorted list of keys is printed. The loop has executed for all words in the `index` dictionary.
    exit()

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
