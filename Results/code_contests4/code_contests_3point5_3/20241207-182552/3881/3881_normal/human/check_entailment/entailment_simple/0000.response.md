Correctness: **True**

The program reads pairs of words and page numbers, then stores them in a dictionary where each word is a key and the corresponding value is a list of page numbers associated with that word. The program then prints the words in alphabetical order and their corresponding page numbers in ascending order, as requested in the problem description. The use of `sorted()` ensures the words are printed in alphabetical order and the page numbers are printed in ascending order. The program also ensures that each word only appears once in the output. Hence, the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description.
