Correctness: **True**

The provided program reads pairs of words and page numbers, creates a dictionary where each word is a key with a corresponding list of page numbers, and then prints each word followed by its sorted list of page numbers. The output is in alphabetical order for words and in ascending order for page numbers. This matches the requirements specified in the problem description. Additionally, the program handles the constraints mentioned in the problem description such as the maximum number of characters for a word, the maximum page number, and the maximum number of pairs. Therefore, the program is correct and follows the problem description for all potential cases.
