Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program reads a list of pairs of a word and a page number and stores them in a dictionary where the key is the word and the value is a list of corresponding page numbers. This matches the problem description.
2. The program then sorts the words in alphabetical order and prints the word followed by the sorted list of page numbers. This also matches the problem description.
3. The program handles the condition where a word never appears on a page more than once, as it appends the page numbers to the list corresponding to the word.
4. The program correctly prints the output in the specified format, with words in alphabetical order and page numbers in ascending order.
5. Overall, the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and produces the correct output.
