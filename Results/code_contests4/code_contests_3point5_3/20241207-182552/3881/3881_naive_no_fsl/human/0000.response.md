Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The given Python program reads a list of pairs of a word and a page number, and prints the word and a list of the corresponding page numbers. The program uses a defaultdict to store the words as keys and a list of corresponding page numbers as values. It then iterates over the sorted keys of the dictionary and prints the word followed by the sorted list of page numbers.

The program correctly handles the input format specified in the problem description, ensuring that each word is associated with a list of page numbers in ascending order. The output is also formatted correctly with words in alphabetical order and page numbers in ascending order.

Since the program follows the problem description for all potential cases and provides the expected output, it can be considered correct.
