Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly maps the input string to integers representing 'R', 'P', and 'S'. It then counts the occurrences of each choice and determines the choice that maximizes the number of wins. Finally, it prints the correct choices for each round to maximize the average number of wins. The logic in the program follows the problem description and works correctly for all potential cases.
