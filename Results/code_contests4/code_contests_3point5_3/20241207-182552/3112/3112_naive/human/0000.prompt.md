You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Recently, you found a bot to play "Rock paper scissors" with. Unfortunately, the bot uses quite a simple algorithm to play: he has a string s = s_1 s_2 ... s_{n} of length n where each letter is either R, S or P.

While initializing, the bot is choosing a starting index pos (1 ≤ pos ≤ n), and then it can play any number of rounds. In the first round, he chooses "Rock", "Scissors" or "Paper" based on the value of s_{pos}: 

  * if s_{pos} is equal to R the bot chooses "Rock"; 
  * if s_{pos} is equal to S the bot chooses "Scissors"; 
  * if s_{pos} is equal to P the bot chooses "Paper"; 



In the second round, the bot's choice is based on the value of s_{pos + 1}. In the third round — on s_{pos + 2} and so on. After s_n the bot returns to s_1 and continues his game.

You plan to play n rounds and you've already figured out the string s but still don't know what is the starting index pos. But since the bot's tactic is so boring, you've decided to find n choices to each round to maximize the average number of wins.

In other words, let's suggest your choices are c_1 c_2 ... c_n and if the bot starts from index pos then you'll win in win(pos) rounds. Find c_1 c_2 ... c_n such that (win(1) + win(2) + ... + win(n))/(n) is maximum possible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases.

Next t lines contain test cases — one per line. The first and only line of each test case contains string s = s_1 s_2 ... s_{n} (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; s_i ∈ \{R, S, P\}) — the string of the bot.

It's guaranteed that the total length of all strings in one test doesn't exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each test case, print n choices c_1 c_2 ... c_n to maximize the average number of wins. Print them in the same manner as the string s.

If there are multiple optimal answers, print any of them.

Example

Input


3
RRRR
RSP
S


Output


PPPP
RSP
R

Note

In the first test case, the bot (wherever it starts) will always choose "Rock", so we can always choose "Paper". So, in any case, we will win all n = 4 rounds, so the average is also equal to 4.

In the second test case: 

  * if bot will start from pos = 1, then (s_1, c_1) is draw, (s_2, c_2) is draw and (s_3, c_3) is draw, so win(1) = 0; 
  * if bot will start from pos = 2, then (s_2, c_1) is win, (s_3, c_2) is win and (s_1, c_3) is win, so win(2) = 3; 
  * if bot will start from pos = 3, then (s_3, c_1) is lose, (s_1, c_2) is lose and (s_2, c_3) is lose, so win(3) = 0; 

The average is equal to (0 + 3 + 0)/(3) = 1 and it can be proven that it's the maximum possible average.

A picture from Wikipedia explaining "Rock paper scissors" game: 

<image>
Program:
```
range = xrange
input = raw_input
mapper = {'R': 0, 'P': 1, 'S': 2}
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    S = [mapper[c] for c in input()]
    count = [0] * 3
    for s in S:
        count[s] += 1
    maxi = max(range(3), key=count.__getitem__)
    maxi -= 2
    print('RPS'[maxi]) * len(S)
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
