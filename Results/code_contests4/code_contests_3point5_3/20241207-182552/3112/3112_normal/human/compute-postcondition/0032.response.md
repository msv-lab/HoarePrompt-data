Example Answer:
The variable `count` is assigned a list of three zeros. This means that the count variable will now contain [0, 0, 0]. Other variables remain unaffected. 
Output State: **`t` is an input integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, range is equivalent to xrange, input is assigned the value of raw_input, mapper is a dictionary mapping 'R' to 0, 'P' to 1, and 'S' to 2, `count` is [0, 0, 0], `maxi` is assigned the maximum value based on the updated counts of 'R', 'P', and 'S' minus 4, S is a list created by mapping characters from input to their corresponding values in mapper**
