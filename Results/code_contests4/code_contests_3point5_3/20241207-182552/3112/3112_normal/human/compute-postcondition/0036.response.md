Example Answer:
`count[s]` is incremented by 1, where the value of `s` is the second element in the list S. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, range is equivalent to xrange, input is assigned the value of raw_input, mapper is a dictionary mapping 'R' to 0, 'P' to 1, and 'S' to 2, `count` is updated based on the value of `s`, `maxi` is assigned the maximum value based on the updated counts of 'R', 'P', and 'S' minus 4, S is a list with at least 2 elements, `s` is the second element in the list S.
Output State: **`t` is an input integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, range is equivalent to xrange, input is assigned the value of raw_input, mapper is a dictionary mapping 'R' to 0, 'P' to 1, and 'S' to 2, `count` is updated based on the value of `s`, `maxi` is assigned the maximum value based on the updated counts of 'R', 'P', and 'S' minus 4, S is a list with at least 2 elements, `s` is the second element in the list S**
