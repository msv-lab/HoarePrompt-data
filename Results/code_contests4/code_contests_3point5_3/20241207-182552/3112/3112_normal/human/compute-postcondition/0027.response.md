Example Answer: 
`maxi` is assigned the value of the maximum key in the range(3) based on the counts dictionary. The key is determined by the value obtained from the count dictionary. The updated counts of 'R', 'P', and 'S' are reflected in the dictionary. The previous states of other variables are maintained. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer, `_` is 1, range is equivalent to xrange, input is assigned the value of raw_input, mapper is a dictionary mapping 'R' to 0, 'P' to 1, and 'S' to 2, count is a list containing the updated counts of 'R', 'P', and 'S' based on their occurrences in S, `maxi` is assigned the maximum value based on the updated counts of 'R', 'P', and 'S' minus 2.
Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `_` is 1, range is equivalent to xrange, input is assigned the value of raw_input, mapper is a dictionary mapping 'R' to 0, 'P' to 1, and 'S' to 2, count is a list containing the updated counts of 'R', 'P', and 'S' based on their occurrences in S, `maxi` is assigned the maximum value based on the updated counts of 'R', 'P', and 'S' minus 2**
