Example Answer:
t is assigned the value of int(input()), where input accepts an input and int converts it to an integer. The range, input, and mapper variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: range is now equivalent to xrange, input is assigned the value of raw_input, mapper is a dictionary mapping 'R' to 0, 'P' to 1, and 'S' to 2, t is an input integer.
Output State: **range is now equivalent to xrange, input is assigned the value of raw_input, mapper is a dictionary mapping 'R' to 0, 'P' to 1, and 'S' to 2, t is an input integer**
