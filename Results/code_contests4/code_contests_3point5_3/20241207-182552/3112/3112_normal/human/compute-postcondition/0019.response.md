Example Answer: 
Initially, `count` is a list containing [0, 0, 0]. After executing the code `count = [0] * 3`, the `count` list is updated to [0, 0, 0], where each element represents the count of 'R', 'P', and 'S' respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `_` is 1, range is equivalent to xrange, input is assigned the value of raw_input, mapper is a dictionary mapping 'R' to 0, 'P' to 1, and 'S' to 2, S is a list created by mapping the characters in the input to their corresponding values in the mapper dictionary, count is a list containing [0, 0, 0], `maxi` is assigned the maximum value based on the counts of 'R', 'P', and 'S' minus 2.**
