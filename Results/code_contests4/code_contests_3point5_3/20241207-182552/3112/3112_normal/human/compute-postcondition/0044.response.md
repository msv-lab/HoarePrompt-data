The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function is expected to process a series of test cases, where each test case consists of a string `s` that contains characters R, S, or P. The length of the string `s` is denoted by `n`, where 1 <= n <= 2*10^5. The function should handle a total of `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. The function is expected to perform some processing or calculations based on the input test cases.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It processes multiple test cases, each containing a string `s` with characters R, S, or P. The length of each string is denoted by `n`, where 1 <= n <= 2*10^5. The function handles a total of `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000.**
