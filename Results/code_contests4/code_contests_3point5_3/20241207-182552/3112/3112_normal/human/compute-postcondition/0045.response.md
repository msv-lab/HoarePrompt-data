Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of a string `s` containing characters R, S, or P. The length of each string is denoted by `n`, where 1 <= n <= 2*10^5. The function handles `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000. It maps the characters in the input string to corresponding values, calculates the count of occurrences of 'R', 'P', and 'S', determines the maximum count, subtracts 2 from it, and prints the corresponding character 'R', 'P', or 'S' multiplied by the length of the input string. The function does not accept any parameters.**
