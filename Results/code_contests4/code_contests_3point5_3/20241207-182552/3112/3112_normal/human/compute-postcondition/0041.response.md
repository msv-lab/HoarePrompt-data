Example Answer:
`maxi` is decremented by 2. The previous value of `maxi` is unknown, so after execution, `maxi` is decreased by 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, range is equivalent to xrange, input is assigned the value of raw_input, mapper is a dictionary mapping 'R' to 0, 'P' to 1, and 'S' to 2, `count` is updated based on the values of `s` in S, `maxi` is assigned the maximum value based on the updated counts of 'R', 'P', and 'S' minus 4, S is a list with all elements processed, `s` is the last element in the list S, and `maxi` is the maximum value based on the counts of 'R', 'P', and 'S' where the value of `maxi` is decremented by 2.
Output State: **`t` is an input integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, range is equivalent to xrange, input is assigned the value of raw_input, mapper is a dictionary mapping 'R' to 0, 'P' to 1, and 'S' to 2, `count` is updated based on the values of `s` in S, `maxi` is assigned the maximum value based on the updated counts of 'R', 'P', and 'S' minus 4, S is a list with all elements processed, `s` is the last element in the list S, and `maxi` is the maximum value based on the counts of 'R', 'P', and 'S' where the value of `maxi` is decremented by 2**
