Example Answer: 
The value of `count[s]` is incremented by 1. The value of `s` is the first element in the list `S`, which is mapped from the input using the `mapper` dictionary. The value of `s` can be 0, 1, or 2 based on the input. Therefore, after execution, the value of `count` will be updated accordingly. The states of other variables remain the same. 
Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `_` is 0, range is equivalent to xrange, input is assigned the value of raw_input, mapper is a dictionary mapping 'R' to 0, 'P' to 1, and 'S' to 2, for the loop to execute the first time, S is a list created by mapping the characters in the input to their corresponding values in the mapper dictionary, count is a list containing the updated count values, s is the first element in the list S**
