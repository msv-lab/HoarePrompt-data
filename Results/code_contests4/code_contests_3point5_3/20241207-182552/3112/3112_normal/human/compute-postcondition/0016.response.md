Example Answer:
The value of `maxi` is determined by finding the maximum count of 'R', 'P', and 'S' in the input and subtracting 2. The characters in the list `S` are then mapped to their corresponding values in the `mapper` dictionary. The character at index `maxi` in the string 'RPS' is then printed `len(S)` number of times. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer, `_` is 0, range is equivalent to xrange, input is assigned the value of raw_input, mapper is a dictionary mapping 'R' to 0, 'P' to 1, and 'S' to 2, S is a list created by mapping the characters in the input to their corresponding values in the mapper dictionary, count is a list containing the total count of occurrences of 'R', 'P', and 'S' in the input, `maxi` is assigned the maximum value based on the counts of 'R', 'P', and 'S' minus 2.
Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `_` is 0, range is equivalent to xrange, input is assigned the value of raw_input, mapper is a dictionary mapping 'R' to 0, 'P' to 1, and 'S' to 2, S is a list created by mapping the characters in the input to their corresponding values in the mapper dictionary, count is a list containing the total count of occurrences of 'R', 'P', and 'S' in the input, `maxi` is assigned the maximum value based on the counts of 'R', 'P', and 'S' minus 2**
