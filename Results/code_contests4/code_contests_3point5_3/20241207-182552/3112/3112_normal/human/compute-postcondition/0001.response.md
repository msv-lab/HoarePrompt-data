Example Answer:
`input` is now assigned the value of `raw_input`, which means the built-in function `raw_input` is now accessible using the variable `input`. The state of other variables remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `range` is now equivalent to `xrange`, `input` is assigned the value of `raw_input`.
Output State: **`range` is now equivalent to `xrange`, `input` is assigned the value of `raw_input`**
