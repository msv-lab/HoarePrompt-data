Example Answer:
The code creates a list `S` by mapping each character `c` from the input to its corresponding value in the dictionary `mapper`. The dictionary `mapper` maps 'R' to 0, 'P' to 1, and 'S' to 2. The values of other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`t` is an input integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, range is equivalent to xrange, input is assigned the value of raw_input, mapper is a dictionary mapping 'R' to 0, 'P' to 1, and 'S' to 2, count is a list containing the updated counts of 'R', 'P', and 'S' based on their occurrences in S, `maxi` is assigned the maximum value based on the updated counts of 'R', 'P', and 'S' minus 4, S is a list created by mapping characters from input to their corresponding values in mapper**
