According to the code, the loop can execute t times where t is an integer input. Before the loop starts, the range function is now equivalent to xrange. The input function is assigned the value of raw_input, and mapper is a dictionary mapping 'R' to 0, 'P' to 1, and 'S' to 2. So, we need to adjust the state to `t` is an input integer, `_` is 0, range is equivalent to xrange, input is assigned the value of raw_input, and mapper is a dictionary mapping 'R' to 0, 'P' to 1, and 'S' to 2.
State: **`t` is an input integer, `_` is 0, range is equivalent to xrange, input is assigned the value of raw_input, mapper is a dictionary mapping 'R' to 0, 'P' to 1, and 'S' to 2, for the loop to execute the first time**
