Example Answer:
`count[s]` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is unknown, but it is updated based on the value of `s`. The value of `s` is the third element in the list S. Therefore, after execution, the count of the specific element in `count` corresponding to `s` is increased by 1. The other variables remain unaffected. 
Output State: **`t` is an input integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, range is equivalent to xrange, input is assigned the value of raw_input, mapper is a dictionary mapping 'R' to 0, 'P' to 1, and 'S' to 2, `count` is updated based on the value of `s`, `maxi` is assigned the maximum value based on the updated counts of 'R', 'P', and 'S' minus 4, S is a list with at least 3 elements, `s` is the third element in the list S**
