Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input sequence and separates the even and odd indices into two separate lists.
2. It then uses Counter to count the occurrences of each number in the even and odd lists.
3. The program then finds the most common elements in both lists and calculates the minimum number of elements that need to be replaced to make the sequence /\/\/\/.
4. The logic of the program seems correct and covers all possible cases as per the problem description.
5. The program has been tested with multiple examples and appears to be working as expected.
