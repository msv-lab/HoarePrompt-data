Example Answer:
The code snippet `v = map(int, raw_input().split())` takes input from the user, splits it based on spaces, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `v`. Since `n` is an even integer greater than or equal to 2, the number of elements in the input should be equal to `n`. The values of `v_1, v_2, ..., v_n` are integers in the range [1, 10^5]. Therefore, after execution, the list `v` contains `n` integers in the range [1, 10^5].
Output State: **The list `v` contains `n` integers in the range [1, 10^5]**
