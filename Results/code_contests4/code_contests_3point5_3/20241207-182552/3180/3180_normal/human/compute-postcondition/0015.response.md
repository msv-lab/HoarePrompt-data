Postcondition: ***`oddc_most_common` contains the most common elements from `odd` along with their counts and possibly `None, 0`, `m` contains the result of the addition of `a` and `b`, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `j` is less than 2. If the element at index `i` of `evenc_most_common` is not equal to the element at index `j` of `oddc_most_common`, then `a` is assigned the value of the length of `even` minus the count of the most common element at index `i` in `evenc_most_common`, and `b` is assigned the value of the length of `odd` minus the count of the most common element at index `j` in `oddc_most_common`.***
