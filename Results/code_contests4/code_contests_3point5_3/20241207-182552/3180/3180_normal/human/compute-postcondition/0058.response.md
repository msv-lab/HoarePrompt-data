Output State: **`oddc_most_common` contains the most common elements from `odd` along with their counts, `m` contains the sum of differences between the lengths of `even` and the counts of the most common elements in `evenc_most_common` and the lengths of `odd` and the counts of the most common elements in `oddc_most_common` for all possible combinations of `i` and `j` with the new calculated value appended, `a` is calculated as described above where `a` is the length of `even` - the count of the most common element in `evenc_most_common` at index `i`, `b` is updated based on the calculation, `j` is 1**
