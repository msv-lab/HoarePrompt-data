Output State: **`oddc_most_common` contains the most common elements from `odd` along with their counts, `m` contains the sum of the differences between the lengths of `even` and the counts of the most common elements in `evenc_most_common` and the lengths of `odd` and the counts of the most common elements in `oddc_most_common` for all possible combinations of `i` and `j` where `i` is less than the length of `evenc_most_common` and `j` is less than 2. If the condition `evenc_most_common[i][0] != oddc_most_common[j][0]` is satisfied, the difference between the lengths of `even` and `odd` minus the counts of the most common elements in `evenc_most_common` and `oddc_most_common` respectively will be calculated and added to `m`.**
