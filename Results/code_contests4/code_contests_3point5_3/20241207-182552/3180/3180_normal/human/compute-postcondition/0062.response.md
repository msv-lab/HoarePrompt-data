Output State: **`oddc_most_common` contains the most common elements from `odd` along with their counts, `m` contains the sum of differences between the lengths of `even` and the counts of the most common elements in `evenc_most_common` and the lengths of `odd` and the counts of the most common elements in `oddc_most_common` for all possible combinations of `i` and `j` where `i` is less than the length of `evenc_most_common` and `j` is less than 2. If `evenc_most_common[i][0]` is not equal to `oddc_most_common[j][0]`, then `a` is assigned the value of the difference between the length of `even` and the count of the most common element at index `i` of `evenc_most_common`, `b` is assigned the difference between the length of `odd` and the count of the most common element at index `j` of `oddc_most_common`, `m` has been appended with the sum of `a` and `b` for all iterations of the loop.**
