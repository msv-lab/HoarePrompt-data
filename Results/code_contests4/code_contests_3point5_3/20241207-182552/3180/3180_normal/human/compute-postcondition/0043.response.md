Postcondition: ***`oddc_most_common` contains the next most common elements from `odd` along with their counts, `m` contains the adjusted sum based on the updated `oddc_most_common` for all possible combinations of `i` and `j` where `i` is less than the length of `evenc_most_common` and `j` is 2. The value of `a` is appended to `m` after adding it to `b`. If `evenc_most_common[i][0]` is not equal to `oddc_most_common[j][0]`, then the new value of `a + b` is appended to `m`.***
