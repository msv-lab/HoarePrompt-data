Example Answer:
The list `even` is created by taking every even-indexed element from the list `v` and storing it in the list `even`. Since indexing starts at 0, the elements at index 0, 2, 4, ... will be selected. Therefore, the Output State is: The list `v` contains `n` integers in the range [1, 10^5]; `even` contains every even-indexed element from `v`.
Output State: **The list `v` contains `n` integers in the range [1, 10^5]; `even` contains every even-indexed element from `v`**
