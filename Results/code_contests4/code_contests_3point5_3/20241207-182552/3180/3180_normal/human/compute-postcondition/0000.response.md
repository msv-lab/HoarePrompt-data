Example Answer: 
`n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` is an even integer greater than or equal to 2. There are no changes to other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an even integer greater than or equal to 2. `v_1, v_2, ..., v_n` are integers in the range [1, 10^5].
Output State: **n is an even integer greater than or equal to 2. v_1, v_2, ..., v_n are integers in the range [1, 10^5]**
