Example Answer:
`evenc_most_common` is assigned the most common elements in `even` along with their counts. The length of the set of `even` determines the number of most common elements to be included. If `even` has unique elements, then the count of the least common element is 0. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: The list `v` contains `n` integers in the range [1, 10^5]; `even` contains every even-indexed element from `v`; `odd` contains every odd-indexed element from `v`; `evenc` is a Counter object containing the counts of elements in `even`; `oddc` is a Counter object containing the counts of elements in `odd`; `evenc_most_common` contains the most common elements from `even` along with their counts.
Output State: **The list `v` contains `n` integers in the range [1, 10^5]; `even` contains every even-indexed element from `v`; `odd` contains every odd-indexed element from `v`; `evenc` is a Counter object containing the counts of elements in `even`; `oddc` is a Counter object containing the counts of elements in `odd`; `evenc_most_common` contains the most common elements from `even` along with their counts**
