Output State: **`oddc_most_common` contains the most common elements from `odd` along with their counts, `m` contains the sum of differences between the lengths of `even` and the counts of the most common elements in `evenc_most_common` and the lengths of `odd` and the counts of the most common elements in `oddc_most_common` for all possible combinations of `i` and `j`, `j` is 0 or 1, `i` is less than the length of `evenc_most_common`, `a` is assigned the value of the difference between the length of `even` and the count of the most common element at index `i` of `evenc_most_common`.**
