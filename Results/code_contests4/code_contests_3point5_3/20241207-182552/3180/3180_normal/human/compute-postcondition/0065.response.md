The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it relies on the parameter constraints mentioned. The parameter constraints are that `n` is an even integer greater than or equal to 2, and `v_1, v_2, ..., v_n` are integers in the range [1, 10^5]. Based on these constraints, the function is designed to perform a specific task or computation using the values of `v_1, v_2, ..., v_n`. However, since the function does not have any parameters, the return value or output of the function is not specified in this context. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to perform a specific task or computation using the integers `v_1, v_2, ..., v_n` based on the given parameter constraints.
