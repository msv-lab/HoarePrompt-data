The function `func` reads an even integer `n` followed by a list of integers `v` and processes the list to find the minimum sum of differences between the lengths of even and odd elements that are not the most common elements in their respective categories. The function then prints this minimum sum. However, the function lacks a proper return value, and its purpose seems to be focused on this specific computation without explicitly returning a result.
