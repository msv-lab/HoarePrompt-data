Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not fully follow the problem description. The code tries to find the minimum number of elements that need to be replaced in order to make the sequence /\/\/\/. However, there is a flaw in the logic of the code. 

An edge case that the code does not handle correctly is when all the elements in the sequence are the same. For example, if the input sequence is [1, 1, 1, 1], the code should output 2 as the minimum number of elements that need to be replaced to make it /\/\/\/. However, the code does not handle this case correctly and will output 0. This violates the problem description.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
