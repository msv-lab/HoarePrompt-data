The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters. It returns the input value of `t`, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case should consist of a positive integer `n` ranging from 1 to 10^9. However, the code does not seem to read the value of `t` or `n` explicitly, so there might be missing functionality in the actual implementation.
