The function `func_4` reads input values, converts them to integers, and returns a map object containing the integer values split by spaces. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly, and the annotations mention a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a positive integer `n` for each test case. However, the actual code does not utilize these parameters. It simply reads the input and converts it to integers without handling multiple test cases as described in the annotations. Therefore, the function primarily reads input values and returns a map object with integer values split by spaces.
