Correctness: **False**

The annotated program provided does not implement the logic required to solve the problem described in the problem statement. The functions defined in the program do not handle the specific task of counting the number of beautiful numbers between 1 and n as described in the problem.

The program needs to be modified to include a function that calculates the number of beautiful numbers between 1 and n based on the conditions provided in the problem description. As the current program does not implement this logic, the correctness is marked as False.
