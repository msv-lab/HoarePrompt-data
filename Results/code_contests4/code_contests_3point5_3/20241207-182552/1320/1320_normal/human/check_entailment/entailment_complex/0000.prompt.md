You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Hooray! Polycarp turned n years old! The Technocup Team sincerely congratulates Polycarp!

Polycarp celebrated all of his n birthdays: from the 1-th to the n-th. At the moment, he is wondering: how many times he turned beautiful number of years?

According to Polycarp, a positive integer is beautiful if it consists of only one digit repeated one or more times. For example, the following numbers are beautiful: 1, 77, 777, 44 and 999999. The following numbers are not beautiful: 12, 11110, 6969 and 987654321.

Of course, Polycarpus uses the decimal numeral system (i.e. radix is 10).

Help Polycarpus to find the number of numbers from 1 to n (inclusive) that are beautiful.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases in the input. Then t test cases follow.

Each test case consists of one line, which contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — how many years Polycarp has turned.

Output

Print t integers — the answers to the given test cases in the order they are written in the test. Each answer is an integer: the number of beautiful years between 1 and n, inclusive.

Note

In the first test case of the example beautiful years are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 11.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_1(s):
    sys.stdout.write(str(s))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s` and writes the string representation of `s` to the standard output. The provided annotations do not specify any additional functionality or edge cases.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_2(s):
    sys.stdout.write(str(s))
    sys.stdout.write('\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `s` and writes the value of `s` to the standard output followed by a new line character.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case consists of a positive integer n where 1 <= n <= 10^9.**
def func_3():
    return int(readln())
    #The program returns the integer value of n that is read from input
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters. It reads a positive integer `n` from the input and returns the integer value of `n`.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: # Precondition

**t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a positive integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.**
def func_4():
    return map(int, readln().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing integer values converted from the input read as a list of strings, split by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` reads input values, converts them to integers, and returns a map object containing the integer values split by spaces. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly, and the annotations mention a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a positive integer `n` for each test case. However, the actual code does not utilize these parameters. It simply reads the input and converts it to integers without handling multiple test cases as described in the annotations. Therefore, the function primarily reads input values and returns a map object with integer values split by spaces.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: # Precondition

**t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9).**
def func_5():
    return readln()
    #The program returns the input value of t, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters. It returns the input value of `t`, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case should consist of a positive integer `n` ranging from 1 to 10^9. However, the code does not seem to read the value of `t` or `n` explicitly, so there might be missing functionality in the actual implementation.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: 
- The input consists of t test cases, where 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- Each test case contains a positive integer n, where 1 <= n <= 10^9.
def func_6():
    return readln().split()
    #The program returns a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string read from the console.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_6 reads input from the console, which consists of t test cases, each containing a positive integer n. It then returns a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string read from the console. The function does not explicitly mention handling the constraints of test cases or positive integers, so it is assumed to work correctly within those bounds.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_7():
    if debug :
        print(' '.join(map(str, args)))
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *If the program is in debug mode, the function executes in debug mode. Otherwise, the function executes normally.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_7 does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. If the debug mode is enabled, it prints the arguments passed to the function. Otherwise, it executes normally without any output.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: # Precondition
**X is a positive integer.**
def func_8(X):
    minX = min(X)
    maxX = max(X)
    return max(0, (maxX - minX - 2) * 2)
    #The program returns the result of the calculation (maxX - minX - 2) multiplied by 2, with a minimum value of 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_8 accepts a list X of positive integers. It calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values of X, subtracts 2 from this difference, and then doubles the result. The function returns this calculated value, ensuring that the minimum value returned is 0.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
