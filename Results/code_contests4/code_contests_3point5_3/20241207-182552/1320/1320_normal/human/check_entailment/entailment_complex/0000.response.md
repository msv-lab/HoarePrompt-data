Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
The code does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The functions in the code do not handle multiple test cases as described in the problem description. The actual implementation reads a single input value and calculates the number of beautiful years for that input, but it does not iterate over multiple test cases as required by the problem description. Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not cover all potential cases specified in the problem description.
