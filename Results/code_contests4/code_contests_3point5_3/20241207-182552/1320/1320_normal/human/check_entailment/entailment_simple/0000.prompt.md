You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Hooray! Polycarp turned n years old! The Technocup Team sincerely congratulates Polycarp!

Polycarp celebrated all of his n birthdays: from the 1-th to the n-th. At the moment, he is wondering: how many times he turned beautiful number of years?

According to Polycarp, a positive integer is beautiful if it consists of only one digit repeated one or more times. For example, the following numbers are beautiful: 1, 77, 777, 44 and 999999. The following numbers are not beautiful: 12, 11110, 6969 and 987654321.

Of course, Polycarpus uses the decimal numeral system (i.e. radix is 10).

Help Polycarpus to find the number of numbers from 1 to n (inclusive) that are beautiful.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases in the input. Then t test cases follow.

Each test case consists of one line, which contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — how many years Polycarp has turned.

Output

Print t integers — the answers to the given test cases in the order they are written in the test. Each answer is an integer: the number of beautiful years between 1 and n, inclusive.

Example

Input


6
18
1
9
100500
33
1000000000


Output


10
1
9
45
12
81

Note

In the first test case of the example beautiful years are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 11.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_1(s):
    sys.stdout.write(str(s))

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_2(s):
    sys.stdout.write(str(s))
    sys.stdout.write('\n')

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case consists of a positive integer n where 1 <= n <= 10^9.**
def func_3():
    return int(readln())
    #The program returns the integer value of n that is read from input

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: # Precondition

**t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a positive integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.**
def func_4():
    return map(int, readln().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing integer values converted from the input read as a list of strings, split by spaces.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: # Precondition

**t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9).**
def func_5():
    return readln()
    #The program returns the input value of t, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9).

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: 
- The input consists of t test cases, where 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- Each test case contains a positive integer n, where 1 <= n <= 10^9.
def func_6():
    return readln().split()
    #The program returns a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string read from the console.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_7():
    if debug :
        print(' '.join(map(str, args)))
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *If the program is in debug mode, the function executes in debug mode. Otherwise, the function executes normally.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: # Precondition
**X is a positive integer.**
def func_8(X):
    minX = min(X)
    maxX = max(X)
    return max(0, (maxX - minX - 2) * 2)
    #The program returns the result of the calculation (maxX - minX - 2) multiplied by 2, with a minimum value of 0


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
