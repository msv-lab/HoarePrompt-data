#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_1(s):
    sys.stdout.write(str(s))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s` and writes the string representation of `s` to the standard output. The provided annotations do not specify any additional functionality or edge cases.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_2(s):
    sys.stdout.write(str(s))
    sys.stdout.write('\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `s` and writes the value of `s` to the standard output followed by a new line character.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case consists of a positive integer n where 1 <= n <= 10^9.**
def func_3():
    return int(readln())
    #The program returns the integer value of n that is read from input
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters. It reads a positive integer `n` from the input and returns the integer value of `n`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: # Precondition

**t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a positive integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.**
def func_4():
    return map(int, readln().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing integer values converted from the input read as a list of strings, split by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` reads input values, converts them to integers, and returns a map object containing the integer values split by spaces. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly, and the annotations mention a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a positive integer `n` for each test case. However, the actual code does not utilize these parameters. It simply reads the input and converts it to integers without handling multiple test cases as described in the annotations. Therefore, the function primarily reads input values and returns a map object with integer values split by spaces.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: # Precondition

**t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9).**
def func_5():
    return readln()
    #The program returns the input value of t, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters. It returns the input value of `t`, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case should consist of a positive integer `n` ranging from 1 to 10^9. However, the code does not seem to read the value of `t` or `n` explicitly, so there might be missing functionality in the actual implementation.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: 
- The input consists of t test cases, where 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- Each test case contains a positive integer n, where 1 <= n <= 10^9.
def func_6():
    return readln().split()
    #The program returns a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string read from the console.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_6 reads input from the console, which consists of t test cases, each containing a positive integer n. It then returns a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string read from the console. The function does not explicitly mention handling the constraints of test cases or positive integers, so it is assumed to work correctly within those bounds.

def func_7():
    if debug :
        print(' '.join(map(str, args)))
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *If the program is in debug mode, the function executes in debug mode. Otherwise, the function executes normally.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_7 does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. If the debug mode is enabled, it prints the arguments passed to the function. Otherwise, it executes normally without any output.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: # Precondition
**X is a positive integer.**
def func_8(X):
    minX = min(X)
    maxX = max(X)
    return max(0, (maxX - minX - 2) * 2)
    #The program returns the result of the calculation (maxX - minX - 2) multiplied by 2, with a minimum value of 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_8 accepts a list X of positive integers. It calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values of X, subtracts 2 from this difference, and then doubles the result. The function returns this calculated value, ensuring that the minimum value returned is 0.
