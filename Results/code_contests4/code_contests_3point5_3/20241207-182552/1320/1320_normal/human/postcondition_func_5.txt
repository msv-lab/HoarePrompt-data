The function func_6 reads input from the console, which consists of t test cases, each containing a positive integer n. It then returns a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string read from the console. The function does not explicitly mention handling the constraints of test cases or positive integers, so it is assumed to work correctly within those bounds.
