Example Answer:
The code attempts to find the maximum value in the list `X` using the `max()` function. However, the initial state indicates an error stating that the argument for `min()` is an integer, not a list. Since `X` is not defined or provided in the initial state, it is not possible to determine the exact output state. Therefore, the output state is an error: min() arg is an int.
Output State: **Error: min() arg is an int**
