Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is incremented by the sum of four values taken from the lists `r` and `c`. The value of `n` is greater than 2, so it is used in the calculations. The specific values of `r` and `c` lists are unknown, so the output state is: `n` is greater than 2, `ans` is incremented by the sum of specific values from lists `r` and `c`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `ans` is incremented by the sum of specific values from lists `r` and `c**.
