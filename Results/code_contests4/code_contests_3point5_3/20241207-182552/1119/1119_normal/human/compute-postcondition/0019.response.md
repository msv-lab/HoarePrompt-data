Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `m` is as given, `ban` is a list of pairs, `r` and `c` are lists of length n and m respectively with certain values being 0 based on the pairs in `ban`, `ans` is incremented by the sum of specific values from lists `r` and `c` at indices `i`, `n - i + 1` for all i from 0 to (n - 2) // 2. If n is odd and there is a non-zero value at the center of lists `r` or `c`, then `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no change occurs to the program state.***
