According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the condition `i` in range(2, 2 + (n - 2) // 2) is met. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2. To execute the loop one more time, `n` must still be greater than 2. 
Since `i` is defined as in the range(2, 2 + (n - 2) // 2), and the loop increments `i` by 1 in every iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` should be such that it is still within the range and the loop can continue.

State: **`n` is greater than 2**
