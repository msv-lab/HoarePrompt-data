According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the range specified by `range(2, 2 + (n - 2) // 2)` is non-empty. This means that the loop will execute if `(n - 2) // 2` is greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute, you need to adjust the state such that `n` is greater than 2. 

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `m` is as given, `ban` is a list of pairs, `r` and `c` are lists of length n and m respectively with certain values being 0 based on the pairs in `ban`**
