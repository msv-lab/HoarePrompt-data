According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `ban`. If the list `ban` has at least 1 pair of values, the loop executes. At the start of the loop, `n` and `m` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 1000, 0 <= m <= 105. To adjust the state for the loop to execute, `ban` must contain at least 1 pair of values `(x, y)`, and for the first iteration, `x` and `y` should be the first pair in the list `ban`.
State: **n and m are integers such that 2 <= n <= 1000, 0 <= m <= 105, `ban` is a list of pairs of values with at least 1 pair, `(x, y)` is the first pair in `ban` list**
