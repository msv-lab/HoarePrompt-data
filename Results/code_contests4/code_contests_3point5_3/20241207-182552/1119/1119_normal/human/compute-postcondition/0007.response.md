According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ban` list. If the list has at least 4 pairs, the loop executes again for the fourth time. 
At the end of the last iteration, n and m are integers such that 2 <= n <= 1000, 0 <= m <= 105, `ban` is a list of pairs of values with at least 3 pairs, `(x, y)` is the second pair in `ban` list, `r[x]` and `c[y]` are both assigned the value 0. 
So for the loop to be executed one more time, the `ban` list must have at least 4 pairs, and `(x, y)` is the third pair in the list, and `r[x]` and `c[y]` are both assigned the value 0.
State: **n and m are integers such that 2 <= n <= 1000, 0 <= m <= 105, `ban` is a list of pairs of values with at least 4 pairs, `(x, y)` is the third pair in `ban` list, `r[x]` and `c[y]` are both assigned the value 0**
