According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the value of `i` is less than the upper bound specified in the range statement. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is greater than 2 and `ans` is incremented by the sum of specific values from lists `r` and `c`. In the for loop, `i` is increased by 1 for each iteration. So for the loop to execute one more time, the upper bound of the range must be greater than the current value of `i`.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `ans` is incremented by the sum of specific values from lists `r` and `c`, for the loop to execute one more time, the upper bound of the range must be greater than the current value of `i`**
