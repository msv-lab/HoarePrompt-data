Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `m` is as given, `ban` is a list of pairs, `r` and `c` are lists of length n and m respectively with certain values being 0 based on the pairs in `ban`, `ans` is incremented by the sum of specific values from lists `r` and `c` at indices `i`, `n - i + 1` for all i from 0 to (n - 2) // 2. Additionally, the condition `n % 2 and (r[(n + 1) // 2] or c[(n + 1) // 2])` is true, indicating that either the middle element of list `r` or list `c` is non-zero.***
