Example Answer:
`n` and `m` are assigned the values returned by the function `rints()`. The values of `n` and `m` are within the specified ranges. Therefore, the Output State is: n and m are integers such that 2 <= n <= 1000, 0 <= m <= 105.
Output State: **n and m are integers such that 2 <= n <= 1000, 0 <= m <= 105**
