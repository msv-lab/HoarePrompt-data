Example Answer:
The lambda function `rints` is defined to take input from the standard input and convert it to a list of integers. The function does not directly affect the variables `n` and `m`, and the initial state remains the same.
Output State: **n and m are integers such that 2 <= n <= 1000, 0 <= m <= 105. The banned cells are represented as xi and yi where 1 <= xi, yi <= n.**
