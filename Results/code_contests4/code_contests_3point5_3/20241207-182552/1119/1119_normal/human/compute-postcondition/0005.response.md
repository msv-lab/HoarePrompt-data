According to the code, the loop execution depends on the `ban` list. If the list has at least 2 pairs, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `m` must remain within the specified ranges, `ban` is a list of pairs of values with at least 2 pairs, and `(x, y)` is the first pair in the `ban` list. The values of `r[x]` and `c[y]` are both assigned the value 0. To execute the loop one more time, the `ban` list must have at least 3 pairs, and the loop will consider the second pair.
State: **n and m are integers such that 2 <= n <= 1000, 0 <= m <= 105, `ban` is a list of pairs of values with at least 3 pairs, `(x, y)` is the second pair in `ban` list, `r[x]` and `c[y]` are both assigned the value 0**
