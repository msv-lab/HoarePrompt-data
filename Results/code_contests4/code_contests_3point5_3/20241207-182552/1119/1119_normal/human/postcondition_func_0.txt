The function `func` reads input values for n, m, and banned cells from stdin. It initializes lists `r` and `c` based on the banned cells. Then, it iterates through specified pairs of indices to calculate the sum of specific values from lists `r` and `c`. If n is odd and there is a non-zero value at the center of lists `r` or `c`, the sum is incremented by 1. Finally, the function prints the calculated sum `ans`.
