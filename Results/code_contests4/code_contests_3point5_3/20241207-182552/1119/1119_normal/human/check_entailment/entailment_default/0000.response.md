Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description. The conditions for Gerald to lose the game are not properly implemented in the code. The code only checks banned cells but does not consider the cases where chips fall on the same cell or chips swap in a minute. The output hints also do not confirm that the code handles these cases. Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not cover all the losing conditions mentioned in the problem description.
