Correctness: **True**

The program reads the input values for n, m, and banned cells correctly. It then initializes lists `r` and `c` based on the banned cells by setting certain values to 0. It then iterates through specified pairs of indices to calculate the sum of specific values from lists `r` and `c` as required by the problem description. Finally, it checks if n is odd and there is a non-zero value at the center of lists `r` or `c`, and increments the sum by 1 accordingly. The program correctly prints the calculated sum `ans` at the end.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and always calculates the maximum points Gerald can earn in the game.
