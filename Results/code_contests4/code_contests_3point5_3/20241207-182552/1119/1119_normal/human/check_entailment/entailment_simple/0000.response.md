Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It initializes the rows and columns with 1s and then sets the values to 0 for banned cells. It then iterates through the board to calculate the maximum points Gerald can earn based on the conditions provided. Finally, it checks for the case when the board size is odd and increments the points if there is a chip in the center. The program outputs the correct maximum points Gerald can earn.
