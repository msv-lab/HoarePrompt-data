Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the maximum number of points Gerald can earn in the game by following the rules described in the problem statement. It checks for banned cells, places chips on the border cells, and then calculates the maximum number of chips Gerald can place without losing the game. The logic used in the program is consistent with the problem description and covers all possible scenarios. It correctly handles the conditions where Gerald loses the game as specified in the problem statement. Thus, the program is correct.
