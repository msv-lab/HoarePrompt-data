Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem description. The program seems to be attempting to find the minimum necessary number of operations to make all characters in the string the same by counting the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of each character. However, this approach is incorrect as it does not follow the rules provided in the problem description for changing the string.

In the problem description, Snuke can only change a string of length N into a string of length N - 1 by selecting either the i-th or (i + 1)-th character for each i (1 ≤ i ≤ N - 1). The program, on the other hand, does not perform any such operation to reduce the length of the string.

Therefore, the program does not adhere to the rules specified in the problem description and does not provide the correct output for the given task.
