You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Snuke can change a string t of length N into a string t' of length N - 1 under the following rule:

* For each i (1 ≤ i ≤ N - 1), the i-th character of t' must be either the i-th or (i + 1)-th character of t.



There is a string s consisting of lowercase English letters. Snuke's objective is to apply the above operation to s repeatedly so that all the characters in s are the same. Find the minimum necessary number of operations.

Constraints

* 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 100
* s consists of lowercase English letters.

Input

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters.**
def func():
    a = raw_input()
    b = []
    for k in range(len(a)):
        b.append(a[k])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` contains all characters of string `a` in order, `k` is equal to the length of string `a`
    b = np.array(b)
    alp = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    al = []
    for k in range(len(alp)):
        al.append(alp[k])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` contains all characters of string `a` in order, `k` is 25, `b` is a numpy array, `alp` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `al` contains all lowercase English letters from 'a' to 'z'
    res = []
    for aa in al:
        if aa in b:
            res.append(np.where(b == aa))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` contains all characters of string `a` in order, `k` is 25, `b` is a numpy array, `alp` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `al` is a list of lowercase English letters, `res` is a list containing the indices where the elements in array `b` are equal to each character in `al`, `aa` is the last element in the list `al`.
    m = []
    for k in range(len(res)):
        zz = np.hstack([np.array([0]), res[k][0], np.array([len(a)])])
        
        z = np.diff(zz)
        
        if len(z) > 0:
            m.append(np.max(z))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` contains all characters of string `a` in order, `k` is 25, `b` is a numpy array, `alp` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `al` is a list of lowercase English letters, `res` is a list containing the indices where the elements in array `b` are equal to each character in `al`, `aa` is the last element in the list `al`, `m` is a list containing the maximum values of the arrays `z` calculated in each iteration of the loop. If the length of array `z` is greater than 0 in any iteration, its maximum value is appended to `m`.
    if (len(m) > 0) :
        ans = np.min(m)
    else :
        ans = len(a)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` contains all characters of string `a` in order, `k` is 25, `b` is a numpy array, `alp` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `al` is a list of lowercase English letters, `res` is a list containing the indices where the elements in array `b` are equal to each character in `al`, `aa` is the last element in the list `al`, `m` is a list containing the maximum values of the arrays `z` calculated in each iteration of the loop. If the length of array `z` is greater than 0 in any iteration, its maximum value is appended to `m`. If the length of `m` is greater than 0, `ans` is assigned the minimum value in the list `m`. If the length of `m` is not greater than 0, `ans` is assigned the length of string `a`.
    ans -= 1
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a string of lowercase English letters, converts it into a numpy array, and performs calculations on it. It then finds the minimum value from the maximum values of arrays calculated in each iteration. Lastly, it prints the result after subtracting 1 from this minimum value. The function does not return any specific value.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
