Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The output hints also agree with this assessment. The code does not accurately implement the rule that for each i (1 ≤ i ≤ N - 1), the i-th character of t' must be either the i-th or (i + 1)-th character of t. The code seems to be performing unnecessary calculations and does not directly address the objective stated in the problem description. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
