Example Answer:
The value at index `k` of string `a` is appended to list `b`. Since `k` is initially 0, the first character of string `a` is appended to list `b`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` contains the first character of string `a`, `k` is 0.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` contains the first character of string `a`, `k` is 0**
