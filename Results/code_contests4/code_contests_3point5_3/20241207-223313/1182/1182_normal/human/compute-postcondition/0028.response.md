Example Answer:
`np.where(b == aa)` returns the indices where the elements in array `b` are equal to the value of `aa`. The result is then appended to the list `res`. The previous values of the variables are as follows: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` contains all characters of string `a` in order, `k` is 25, `b` is a numpy array, `alp` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `al` is a list of lowercase English letters, `res` is a list containing the indices where the elements in array `b` are equal to `aa`, and `aa` is the next element in the list `al`. 
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` contains all characters of string `a` in order, `k` is 25, `b` is a numpy array, `alp` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `al` is a list of lowercase English letters, `res` is a list containing the indices where the elements in array `b` are equal to `aa`, `aa` is the next element in the list `al` and the indices where the elements in array `b` are equal to `aa` are appended to `res`.**
