According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the value of `k` is less than the length of `alp`. At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` contains all characters of string `a` in order, `k` is 1, `b` is a numpy array, `alp` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `al` contains the character at index 1 of `alp`, which is 'b'**
