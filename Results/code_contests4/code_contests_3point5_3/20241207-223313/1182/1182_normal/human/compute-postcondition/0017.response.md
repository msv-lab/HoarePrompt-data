Example Answer:
`al` is a list that contains the character 'c'. The code appends the character at index 2 of `alp` to `al`, which is 'c'. Therefore, after execution, `al` will contain ['c', 'c']. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` contains all characters of string `a` in order, `k` is 2, `b` is a numpy array, `alp` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `al` contains ['c', 'c']**
