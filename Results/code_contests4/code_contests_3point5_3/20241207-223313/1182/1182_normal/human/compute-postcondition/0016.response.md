According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than the length of `alp`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1. To execute the loop one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` contains all characters of string `a` in order, `k` is 2, `b` is a numpy array, `alp` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `al` contains the character at index 2 of `alp`, which is 'c', `al` contains 'c'**
