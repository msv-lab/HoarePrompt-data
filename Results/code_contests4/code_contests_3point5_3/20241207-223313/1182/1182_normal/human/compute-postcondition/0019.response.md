Example Answer:
The code snippet `res = []` initializes an empty list `res`. This statement does not affect the values of other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` contains all characters of string `a` in order, `k` is 25, `b` is a numpy array, `alp` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `al` contains all lowercase English letters from 'a' to 'z', `res` is an empty list.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` contains all characters of string `a` in order, `k` is 25, `b` is a numpy array, `alp` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `al` contains all lowercase English letters from 'a' to 'z', `res` is an empty list**
