Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` contains all characters of string `a` in order, `k` is 25, `b` is a numpy array, `alp` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `al` is a list of lowercase English letters, `res` is a list containing the indices where the elements in array `b` are equal to each character in `al`, `aa` is the last element in the list `al`, `m` is a list containing the maximum values of the arrays `z` calculated in each iteration of the loop. If the length of array `z` is greater than 0 in any iteration, its maximum value is appended to `m`. If the length of `m` is greater than 0, `ans` is assigned the minimum value in the list `m`. If the length of `m` is not greater than 0, `ans` is assigned the length of string `a`. `ans` is decreased by 1.**
