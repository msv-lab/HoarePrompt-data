According to the code, the loop execution depends on the length of string `a`. If `k` is less than the length of string `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` contains the first character of string `a`, `k` is the length of string `a`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` contains the first character of string `a`, `k` is the length of string `a` + 1**
