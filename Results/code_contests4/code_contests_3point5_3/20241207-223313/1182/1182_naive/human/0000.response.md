Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The logic used in the program is convoluted and does not correctly implement the objective of finding the minimum necessary number of operations to make all characters in the string the same.

An example where the program does not work as expected:
Input:
s = "serval"

Expected Output: 3

The program does not output the correct result for the above input. The incorrect logic used in the program fails to correctly determine the minimum necessary number of operations to achieve the objective.
