Example Answer:
`cont` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cont` is unknown, so the output state is: `cont` is incremented by 1. Other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `p` and `h` contain all the integer values from the input split with a length equal to `n`, `i` is incremented by 1, `cont` is incremented by 1, `pivout` and `p` are adjusted based on the conditions for the next iteration of the loop**
