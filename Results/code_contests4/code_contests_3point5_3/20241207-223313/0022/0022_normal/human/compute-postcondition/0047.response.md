Example Answer: 
`pivout` is assigned the value of `p[i]`, where `i` is the current `i` value + 1. The value of `p[i]` is determined by the input values stored in `p`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `p` and `h` contain all the integer values from the input split with a length equal to `n`, `i` is the current `i` value + 1, `cont` and `pivout` are adjusted based on the conditions for the next iteration of the loop, and `pivout` is equal to the value of `p[i]`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `p` and `h` contain all the integer values from the input split with a length equal to `n`, `i` is the current `i` value + 1, `cont` and `pivout` are adjusted based on the conditions for the next iteration of the loop, and `pivout` is equal to the value of `p[i]`**
