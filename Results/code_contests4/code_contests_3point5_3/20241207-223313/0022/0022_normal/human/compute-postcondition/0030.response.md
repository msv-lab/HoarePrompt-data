Postcondition: ***n is greater than 0, p and h contain all the integer values from the input split with a length equal to n, pivout is the first integer value of p, if n is equal to 1, cont is equal to 1. If n is not equal to 1, cont is equal to 2, i is 1 for the loop to execute the first time, and the condition (p[i] - h[i] <= pivout) is true. Additionally, (p[i] + h[i] is not less than p[i + 1])***
