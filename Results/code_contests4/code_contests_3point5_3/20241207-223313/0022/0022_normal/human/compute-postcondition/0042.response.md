According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variables `i`, `p`, `h`, `pivout`, and `cont`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `p` and `h` contain all the integer values from the input split with a length equal to `n`, `i` is incremented by 1. 

To prepare for the next iteration of the loop:
1. `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes the current `i` value + 1.
2. If `p[i] - h[i] > pivout`, `cont` needs to be incremented by 1 and `pivout` should be updated to the value at the next index of `p`.
3. If `p[i] - h[i] <= pivout`, `cont` and `pivout` should be adjusted based on the conditions for the next iteration of the loop. If the condition is not met, `pivout` should be equal to `p[i]`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `p` and `h` contain all the integer values from the input split with a length equal to `n`, `i` is the current `i` value + 1, `cont` and `pivout` are adjusted based on the conditions for the next iteration of the loop, and `pivout` is equal to `p[i]`.**
