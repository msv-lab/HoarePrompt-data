Example Answer:
`e[0]` is the first integer value from the input split stored in the map object `e`. The value of `e` is unknown, but `p` is an empty list. After executing the code, `e[0]` is appended to list `p`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `p` contains the first integer value from the input split, `h` is an empty list, `e` is a map object containing integer values from the input split.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `p` contains the first integer value from the input split, `h` is an empty list, `e` is a map object containing integer values from the input split**
