According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `p` contains the first integer value from the input split along with the value at index 0 of map object `e`, `h` contains the second integer value from the input split and the value at index 1 of map object `e`, `e` is a map object containing integer values from the input split. So for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than `n+1`.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `p` contains the first integer value from the input split along with the value at index 0 of map object `e`, `h` contains the second integer value from the input split and the value at index 1 of map object `e`, `e` is a map object containing integer values from the input split, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than `n+1`**
