Example Answer:
`pivout` is assigned the value at index `i` of list `p`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `pivout` will now hold the value at the next index of `p`. The values of `n`, `p`, `h`, `cont` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `p` and `h` contain all the integer values from the input split with a length equal to `n`, `i` is incremented by 1, `cont` is incremented by 1, `pivout` is the value at the next index of `p`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `p` and `h` contain all the integer values from the input split with a length equal to `n`, `i` is incremented by 1, `cont` is incremented by 1, `pivout` is the value at the next index of `p`**
