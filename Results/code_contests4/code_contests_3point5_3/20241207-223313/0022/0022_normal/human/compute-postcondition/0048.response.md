Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `p` and `h` contain all the integer values from the input split with a length equal to `n`, `i` is the current `i` value + 1, `cont` and `pivout` are adjusted based on the conditions for the next iteration of the loop. If `p[i] + h[i] < p[i + 1]`, `cont` is incremented by 1 and `pivout` is equal to `p[i] + h[i]`. Otherwise, `cont` and `pivout` are adjusted based on the conditions for the next iteration of the loop and `pivout` is equal to the value of `p[i]`.***
