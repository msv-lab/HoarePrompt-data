Postcondition: ***n is greater than 0, p and h contain all the integer values from the input split with a length equal to n. If the condition (p[i] - h[i] <= pivout) is true, then the program will execute the if part. In the if part, cont will be equal to 3, i will be 1, and pivout will be the value of p[i] + h[i]. If the condition (p[i] + h[i] < p[i + 1]) is true, the program will execute the else part where cont will be equal to 1 if n is equal to 1, and cont will be equal to 2 if n is not equal to 1. The value of pivout will be assigned the first integer value of p if n is equal to 1, otherwise, it will be the value of p[i].***
