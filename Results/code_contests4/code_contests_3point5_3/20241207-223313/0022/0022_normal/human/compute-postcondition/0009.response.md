Example Answer:
The value at index 0 of map object `e` is appended to the list `p`. The previous values of `p`, `h`, `e`, and `n` are known, but the value of `i` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `p` contains the first integer value from the input split along with the value at index 0 of map object `e`, `h` contains the second integer value from the input split, `e` is a map object containing integer values from the input split, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than `n`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `p` contains the first integer value from the input split along with the value at index 0 of map object `e`, `h` contains the second integer value from the input split, `e` is a map object containing integer values from the input split, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than `n`**
