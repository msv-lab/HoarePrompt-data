Example Answer:
`pivout` is assigned the value of the first element of list `p`, which is `p[0]`. The value of `p` contains all the integer values from the input split, so `pivout` will be the first integer value of `p`. The values of `n`, `p`, and `h` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `p` contains all the integer values from the input split, `h` contains all the corresponding integer values from the input split, and both lists have a length equal to `n`, `pivout` is the first integer value of `p`**
