Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `p` and `h` contain all the integer values from the input split with a length equal to `n`, `i` is incremented by 1. If `p[i] - h[i] > pivout`, `cont` is incremented by 1 and `pivout` is the value at the next index of `p`. If `p[i] - h[i] <= pivout`, `cont` and `pivout` are adjusted based on the conditions for the next iteration of the loop, and `pivout` is equal to `p[i]`.***
