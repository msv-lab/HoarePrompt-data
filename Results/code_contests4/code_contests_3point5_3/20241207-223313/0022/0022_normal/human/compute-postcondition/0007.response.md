According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new `i` value.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `p` contains the first integer value from the input split, `h` contains the second integer value from the input split, `e` is a map object containing integer values from the input split, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than `n`**
