Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `p` and `h` contain all the integer values from the input split with a length equal to `n`, `pivout` is the first integer value of `p`, if `n` is equal to 1, `cont` is equal to 1. If `n` is not equal to 1, `cont` is equal to 2, `i` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `cont` is incremented by 1.**
