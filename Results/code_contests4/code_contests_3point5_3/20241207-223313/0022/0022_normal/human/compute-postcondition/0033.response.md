Postcondition: ***n is greater than 0, p and h contain all the integer values from the input split with a length equal to n. If p[i] - h[i] > pivout, cont is incremented by 1, i remains the same for the loop, pivout is assigned the value of p[i]. If p[i] - h[i] <= pivout, cont will be equal to 3, i will be 1, and pivout will be the value of p[i] + h[i]. If p[i] + h[i] < p[i + 1], cont will be equal to 1 if n is equal to 1, and cont will be equal to 2 if n is not equal to 1.***
