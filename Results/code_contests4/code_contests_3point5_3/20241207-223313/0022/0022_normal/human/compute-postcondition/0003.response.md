According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `p` and `h` being empty lists does not affect the loop execution. So, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `p` is an empty list, `h` is an empty list**
