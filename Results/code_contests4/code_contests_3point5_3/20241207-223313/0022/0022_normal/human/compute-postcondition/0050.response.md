Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `p` and `h` contain all the integer values from the input split with a length equal to `n`, `i` is equal to len(p) - 1, `cont` is the total number of times either p[i] - h[i] > pivout or p[i] + h[i] < p[i + 1] was true, `pivout` contains the maximum value from the conditions in the loop.**
