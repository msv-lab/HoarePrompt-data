Example Answer:
`pivout` is assigned the value `p[i] + h[i]`. The value of `p[i]` and `h[i]` are taken from the initial state. After execution, the value of `pivout` is `p[i] + h[i]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `p` and `h` contain all the integer values from the input split with a length equal to `n`, `i` is the current `i` value + 1, `cont` is incremented by 1, `pivout` is equal to `p[i] + h[i]` and `cont` and `pivout` are adjusted based on the conditions for the next iteration of the loop.
