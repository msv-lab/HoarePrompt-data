**Precondition:**

The input consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the number of trees.

This is followed by n lines, each containing two integers xi and hi (1 ≤ xi, hi ≤ 10^9) representing the coordinate and height of the i-th tree.

The pairs are given in the order of ascending xi, and no two trees are located at the same coordinate.
