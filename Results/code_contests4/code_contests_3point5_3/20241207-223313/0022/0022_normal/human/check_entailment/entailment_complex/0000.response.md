Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly follows the problem description. It reads the input values, calculates the maximum number of trees that can be cut down based on the given rules, and prints the result. The logic in the program is aligned with the requirements of the problem description as it iterates through the trees and correctly determines whether a tree can be cut down to maximize the number of trees cut. The program handles all the cases mentioned in the problem description and produces the correct output.
