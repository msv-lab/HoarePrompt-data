Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It reads the input, processes the trees according to the given rules, and outputs the maximum number of trees that can be cut down. The algorithm used in the program iterates through the trees and makes decisions based on whether a tree can be cut down to the left or right without overlapping with previously felled trees. This approach ensures that the woodcutters maximize the number of trees they can process, which aligns with the problem description. Hence, the program is correct.
