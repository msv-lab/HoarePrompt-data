Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not completely follow the problem description. The program is intended to find the maximum number of trees that can be cut down based on certain conditions. However, the code fails to handle all possible cases as described in the problem.

One scenario where the code fails is when there are only two trees and the second tree is not within the range of the first tree to be cut down. In this case, the code does not correctly identify that the second tree can also be cut down. This can lead to an incorrect output in such situations.

Therefore, the code needs to be modified to consider all possible cases and accurately determine the maximum number of trees that can be cut down.
