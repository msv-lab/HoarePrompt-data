Correctness: False

The given program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem description. Here are some issues with the program:

1. The program does not correctly handle the last tree in the list. The loop `for i in range(1, len(p) - 1):` should be `for i in range(1, len(p) - 1):` to include the last tree in the calculations.

2. The program incorrectly calculates the number of trees that can be cut down. It only considers the case when a tree can be cut down to the left or right based on the current tree's position and height. However, the program does not consider the possibility of leaving a tree uncut to maximize the number of trees cut down.

3. The program does not consider the possibility of cutting down the last tree in the list in the optimal way. It always assumes that the last tree will be left uncut.

Overall, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and hence, it is incorrect.
