Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program correctly reads the input, stores the coordinates and heights of the trees, and initializes the variable `pivout` with the coordinate of the first tree.
- It then checks the conditions for each tree to decide whether to cut it down or not.
- The program increments the count `cont` based on the conditions given in the problem description.
- The program prints the maximum number of trees that can be cut down as expected.
- The logic in the program aligns with the problem description for all potential cases, ensuring the correctness of the code.
