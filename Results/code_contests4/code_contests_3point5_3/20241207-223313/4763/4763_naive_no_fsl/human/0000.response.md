Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program takes input for multiple test cases and processes each test case correctly.
2. The `func_3` function correctly determines if a given string can be transformed into a k-balanced bitstring by replacing '?' characters with either 0 or 1.
3. The program handles all possible scenarios as per the problem description, where it checks if the resulting bitstring after replacing '?' characters is k-balanced or not.
4. The output format is also correct, printing "YES" if a k-balanced bitstring can be formed, and "NO" if it is not possible.
