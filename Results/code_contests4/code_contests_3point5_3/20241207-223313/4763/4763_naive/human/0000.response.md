Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program correctly reads the input for multiple test cases.
- The `func_3` function iterates through the string and handles cases where the character is already fixed or needs to be replaced.
- It checks if the resulting bitstring is k-balanced by counting the number of 0s, 1s, and ?s in each substring of size k.
- The program outputs "YES" if the resulting bitstring is k-balanced and "NO" otherwise.
