The function `func_6` accepts two parameters: an integer `x` representing the number of test cases, and a list `y` of tuples. Each tuple in the list contains two integers `n` and `k` (where 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, and k is even) and a string `s` of length `n` composed only of characters 0, 1, and ?. 

After executing the function body, the program swaps the values of `x` and `y` multiple times until `y` reaches 0. The final values of `x` and `y` depend on the initial values of the list of tuples `y` and the remainders of the division operations. The function then returns the final value of variable `x`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_6` is to perform multiple swaps between `x` and `y` until `y` reaches 0 based on the initial values and remainders of division operations, and finally return the resulting value of `x`.
