Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code seems to correctly address the problem description by iterating through the string `s` and checking for consecutive substrings of size `k` to ensure that they have an equal number of 0s and 1s. The function `func_3` handles cases where the substring contains '?' characters by replacing them with either 0 or 1 to maintain balance within the substring. The code accounts for all potential cases described in the problem statement, ensuring that a k-balanced bitstring can be generated by replacing '?' characters with suitable values. Additionally, the output hints align with the code's functionality, confirming that the code is correct.
