Correctness: **True**

Explanation: After reviewing the code and the problem description, as well as the annotations provided, it appears that the code does indeed follow the problem description for every potential case. The functions are designed to handle the input constraints specified in the problem and ensure that the resulting bitstring is k-balanced by replacing '?' characters with either 0 or 1. The logic implemented in the functions covers all necessary cases and edge scenarios mentioned in the annotations, ensuring the correctness of the program. Therefore, based on the analysis, the code is considered correct.
