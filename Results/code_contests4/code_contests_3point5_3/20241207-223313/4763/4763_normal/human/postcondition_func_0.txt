The function func_1 accepts a non-negative integer n and returns a set containing all the factors of n. The function uses a set comprehension with a conditional statement to generate the set of factors. However, it is important to note that the current implementation does not handle the case when n is 0, which should ideally return an empty set since 0 has no factors.
