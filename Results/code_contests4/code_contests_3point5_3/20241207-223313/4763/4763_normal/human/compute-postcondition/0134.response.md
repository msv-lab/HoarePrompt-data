According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and the length of `arr`. If `j` is less than the length of `arr`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, all elements in the array `arr` are equal to `arr[i]`, `vis` contains a single unique non-'?' element in `arr`, `i`, `k`, and `put` remain the same, `j` is equal to the last value based on `k`, the length of `arr` is greater than or equal to `j + k`, and the value at index `j` in array `arr` is updated to `put`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be updated to the next value based on `k` and should be less than the length of `arr`.
