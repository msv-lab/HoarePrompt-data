Example Answer:
The element at index `j` in `arr` is added to the set `vis`. The loop will execute one more time as long as `j` is less than the length of `arr`. The values of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements in the array `arr` are equal to `arr[i]`, `vis` contains the element at index `j`, `i` is a valid starting index, `k` is a valid step size, and the element at index `j` in `arr` is not equal to '?'.
Output State: **All elements in the array `arr` are equal to `arr[i]`, `vis` contains the element at index `j`, `i` is a valid starting index, `k` is a valid step size, and the element at index `j` in `arr` is not equal to '?'**
