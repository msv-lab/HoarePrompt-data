Example Answer:
`arr[j]` is assigned the value of `arr[i]`. If `arr[j]` is not equal to `arr[i]` and `arr[j]` is not equal to '?', then the program returns False. If the conditions are met, `arr[j]` is updated to the value of `arr[i]`. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements in the array `arr` are equal to `arr[i+k]`.
Output State: **All elements in the array `arr` are equal to `arr[i+k]`**
