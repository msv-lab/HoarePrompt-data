Example Answer:
`vis` is a set containing the elements `arr[j_next]`, and `arr[j_next]` is replaced with `arr[j]`, where `arr[j]` is added to `vis`. If `arr[j]` is not equal to '?', then `j_next` is updated by incrementing it by `k`. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `vis` is a set containing the elements `arr[j]`, `i` is a valid starting index, `arr` is a non-empty array, `k` is a valid step size, `j_next` is updated based on the conditions mentioned above.
Output State: **`vis` is a set containing the elements `arr[j]`, `i` is a valid starting index, `arr` is a non-empty array, `k` is a valid step size, `j_next` is updated based on the conditions mentioned above**
