Postcondition: ***All elements in the array `arr` are equal to `arr[i]`, `vis`, `i`, `k`, and `put` remain the same. For the loop to execute `i` is less than the length of `arr` and `j` is equal to `i`. Additionally, the value at index `j` in `arr` is not equal to the value at index `i` and not equal to '?'.***
