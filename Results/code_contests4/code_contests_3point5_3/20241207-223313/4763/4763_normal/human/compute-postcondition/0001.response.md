Example Answer:
x and y are swapped where x takes the value of the list of tuples y, and y takes the remainder of x divided by y. The new values of x and y depend on the initial values of x and the first tuple in the list y. 
Output State: **x and y have been swapped, x takes the value of the list of tuples y, and y takes the remainder of x divided by y**
