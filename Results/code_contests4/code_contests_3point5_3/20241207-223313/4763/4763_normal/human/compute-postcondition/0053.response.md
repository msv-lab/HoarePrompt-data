Example Answer:
The value at index `j` in the array `arr` is assigned the value of the element at index `i`. After execution, the element at index `j` will be equal to the same value as the element at index `i`. All other elements remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements in the array `arr` are equal to `arr[i]`.
Output State: **All elements in the array `arr` are equal to `arr[i]`**
