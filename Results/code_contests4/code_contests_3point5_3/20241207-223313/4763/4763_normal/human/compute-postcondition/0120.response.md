Postcondition: ***All elements in the array `arr` are equal to `arr[i]`, `vis` contains the element at index `j` in `arr`, `i`, `k`, and `put` remain the same, `j` is equal to `i + k`, length of `arr` is greater than or equal to `i`, `k` is a valid step size. If `arr[j]` is not equal to '?', then all the initial conditions remain unchanged.***
