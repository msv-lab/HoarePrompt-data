Postcondition: ***All elements in the array `arr` are equal to `arr[i]`, `i` is a valid starting index, `k` is a valid step size, for the loop to execute the next time the length of `arr` must be greater than the current value of `i`. Additionally, `arr[j]` is not equal to `arr[i]` and `arr[j]` is not equal to '?'***
