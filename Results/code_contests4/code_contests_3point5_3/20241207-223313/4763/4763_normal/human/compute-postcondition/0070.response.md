Example Answer:
The code adds the element at index `j` in the array `arr` to the set `vis`. Since the element at index `j` is not equal to '?', it will be added to the set `vis`. The state of other variables remains the same. 
Output State: **All elements in the array `arr` are equal to `arr[i]`, `vis` contains the element at index `j`, `i` is a valid starting index, `k` is a valid step size, and the element at index `j` in `arr` is not equal to '?'**
