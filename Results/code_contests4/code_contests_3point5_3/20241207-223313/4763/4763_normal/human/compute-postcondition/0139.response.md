Output State: **All elements in the array `arr` will be either equal to a non-'?' element or '?'. The loop will update the array `arr` such that each group of `k` consecutive elements will either contain the same non-'?' element or be filled with '?' characters. If the loop does not execute, the initial state will remain unchanged.**
