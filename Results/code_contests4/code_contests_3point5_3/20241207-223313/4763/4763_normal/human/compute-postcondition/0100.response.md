Postcondition: ***All elements in the array `arr` are equal to `arr[i]`, `vis`, `i`, `k`, and `put` remain the same. For the loop to execute `i` is less than the length of `arr` and `j` is equal to `i. If the condition (arr[j] != arr[i] and arr[j] != '?') is false, then arr[j] is equal to arr[i] or arr[j] is equal to '?'. If the condition (arr[j] == '?') is true, then arr[j] is equal to '?'***
