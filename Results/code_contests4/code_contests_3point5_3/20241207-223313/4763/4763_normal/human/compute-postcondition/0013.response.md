According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are more elements in the `args` list to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `sep` is assigned the value popped from kwargs with a default of ' ', `file` is assigned the value popped from kwargs with a default of `sys.stdout`, `args` has at least 2 elements, `sep` value is written to the `file`, `at_start` is False. 

To prepare for the next iteration, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`sep` is assigned the value popped from kwargs with a default of ' ', `file` is assigned the value popped from kwargs with a default of `sys.stdout`, `args` has at least 3 elements, `sep` value is written to the `file`, `at_start` is True**
