Functionality: **The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It executes a sequence of operations where elements in `args` are written to a file separated by `sep`. It also writes an end character specified in the `kwargs`. Additionally, if the `flush` key is set to True in `kwargs`, it flushes the file.**
