According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `y` is not equal to 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `x` has the value of the list of tuples `y`, and `y` has the remainder of `x` divided by `y`. For the loop to execute again, `y` should be adjusted so that it is not equal to 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`x` has the value of the list of tuples `y`, `y` has the remainder of `x` divided by `y`, for the loop to execute again `y` is not equal to 0**
