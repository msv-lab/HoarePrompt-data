Postcondition: ***`vis` is a set containing the elements `arr[j]`, `i` is a valid starting index, `arr` is a non-empty array, `k` is a valid step size, `j` is less than the length of `arr` and incremented by `k` after adding `arr[j]` to `vis` if `arr[j]` is not equal to '?'. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables.***
