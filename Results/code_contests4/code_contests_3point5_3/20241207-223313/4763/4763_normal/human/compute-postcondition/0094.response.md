According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and the length of `arr`. If the length of `arr` is at least 1 and `i` is less than the length of `arr`, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, all elements in the array `arr` being equal to `arr[i]` does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is less than the length of `arr` and `j` is equal to `i`.
State: **All elements in the array `arr` are equal to `arr[i]`, `vis`, `i`, `k`, and `put` remain the same, for the loop to execute `i` is less than the length of `arr` and `j` is equal to `i**.
