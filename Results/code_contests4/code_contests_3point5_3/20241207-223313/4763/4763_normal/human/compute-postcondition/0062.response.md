Postcondition: ***All elements in the array `arr` are equal to `arr[i+k]`, `i` is incremented by `k` and is less than the length of `arr`. If `arr[j]` is not equal to `arr[i]` and `arr[j]` is not equal to '?', then the program returns False. If the conditions are not met, the program doesn't make any changes.***
