Postcondition: ***All elements in the array `arr` are equal to `put`, `vis` contains at least one non-'?' element, `i` is a valid starting index, `k` is a valid step size, `put` is the first element in `vis`. If the length of `vis` is 1, then after the execution, the array `arr` will have all elements equal to `put`, `vis` will contain at least one non-'?' element, `i` will remain a valid starting index, and `k` will remain a valid step size.***
