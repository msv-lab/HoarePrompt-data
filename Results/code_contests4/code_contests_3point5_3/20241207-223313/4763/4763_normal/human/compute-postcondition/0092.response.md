Postcondition: ***All elements in the array `arr` are equal to `arr[i]`. If the loop executes, the values of `vis`, `i`, `k`, and `put` will remain the same as in the initial state. If the loop doesn't execute, all elements in the array `arr` will be equal to `put`, `vis` contains at least one non-'?' element, `i` is a valid starting index, `k` is a valid step size, and `put` is the first element in `vis`.***
