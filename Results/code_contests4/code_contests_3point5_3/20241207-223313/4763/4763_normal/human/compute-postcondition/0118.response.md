According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and the length of the array `arr`. If `j` is less than the length of `arr`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, all elements in the array `arr` are equal to `arr[i]`, `vis` contains the element at index `j` in `arr`, `i`, `k`, and `put` remain the same, `j` is equal to `i`, length of `arr` is greater than or equal to `i`, and `k` is a valid step size. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by `k`.
State: **All elements in the array `arr` are equal to `arr[i]`, `vis` contains the element at index `j` in `arr`, `i`, `k`, and `put` remain the same, `j` is equal to `i + k`, length of `arr` is greater than or equal to `i`, `k` is a valid step size**
