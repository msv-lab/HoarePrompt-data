Example Answer:
The set `vis` is initialized as an empty set. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements in the array `arr` are equal to `arr[i]`, `vis` is an empty set, `i`, `k`, and `put` remain the same.
Output State: **All elements in the array `arr` are equal to `arr[i]`, `vis` is an empty set, `i`, `k`, and `put` remain the same.**
