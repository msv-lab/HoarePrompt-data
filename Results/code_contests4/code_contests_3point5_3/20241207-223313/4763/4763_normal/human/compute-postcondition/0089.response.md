Example Answer:
`arr[j]` is assigned the value of `put`, where `j` is the index in the array. The initial state mentions that the element at the new index after adding step size `k` in `arr` is now the first element of `vis`, so `put` is the first element of `vis`. Therefore, after execution, the output state is: All elements in the array `arr` are equal to `arr[i]`, `vis` contains at least one non-'?' element, `i` is a valid starting index, `k` is a valid step size, `put` is the first element in `vis` and `arr[j]` is equal to `put`.
Output State: **All elements in the array `arr` are equal to `arr[i]`, `vis` contains at least one non-'?' element, `i` is a valid starting index, `k` is a valid step size, `put` is the first element in `vis` and `arr[j]` is equal to `put`**
