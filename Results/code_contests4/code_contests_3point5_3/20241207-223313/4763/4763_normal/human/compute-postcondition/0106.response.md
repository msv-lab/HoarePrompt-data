At the end of the last iteration, all elements in the array `arr` are equal to `arr[i]`, `vis`, `i`, `k`, and `put` remain the same. For the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:

1. `i` needs to be incremented by the value of `k`.
2. `j` needs to be updated to the next value of `i` based on the increment `k`.
3. The conditions for updating `arr[j]` need to be met, which means `arr[j]` is not equal to `arr[i]` and `arr[j]` is not equal to '?' for the loop to continue.

State: **All elements in the array `arr` are equal to `arr[i]`, `vis`, `i` is updated based on the increment `k`, `k`, and `put` remain the same. For the loop to execute one more time, the conditions for updating `arr[j]` are met where `j` is equal to the next value of `i` based on the increment `k` and `arr[j]` is not equal to `arr[i]` and `arr[j]` is not equal to '?'**
