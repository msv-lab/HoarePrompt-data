Output State: **All elements in the array `arr` are equal to `arr[i]`, `vis`, `i`, `k`, and `put` remain the same. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` is less than the length of `arr`, `j` is equal to the next value of `i` based on the increment `k`, and the conditions for updating `arr[j]` are met. If `arr[j]` is not equal to `arr[i]` and `arr[j]` is not equal to '?', the function returns False. Otherwise, `arr[j]` is assigned the value of `arr[i']`.**
