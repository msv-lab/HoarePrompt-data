Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value of `y` and `y` is assigned the remainder of `x` divided by `y`. The loop will execute again as long as `y` is not equal to 0. The values of `x` and `y` will change based on the previous values of the list of tuples `x` and the remainder of `x` divided by `y`. 
Output State: **`x` has the new value based on the previous values of `y` and the remainder of `x` divided by `y`, `y` has the new remainder value based on the previous values of the list of tuples `x` and `y`**
