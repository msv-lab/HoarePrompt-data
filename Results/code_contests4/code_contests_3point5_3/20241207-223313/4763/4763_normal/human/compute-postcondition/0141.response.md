According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If k is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, dic = {'1': 0, '0': 0, '?': 0} does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `k` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.

State: **`dic` is {'1': 0, '0': 0, '?': 0}, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is greater than 0**
