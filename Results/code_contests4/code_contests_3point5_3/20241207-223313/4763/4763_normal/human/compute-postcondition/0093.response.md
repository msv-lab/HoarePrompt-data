According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the array `arr`. If `i` is less than the length of `arr`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, all elements in the array `arr` are equal to `arr[i]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than the length of `arr`.
State: **All elements in the array `arr` are equal to `arr[i]`, `vis`, `i`, `k`, and `put` remain the same as in the initial state, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than the length of `arr`**
