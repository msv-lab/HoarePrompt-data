According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and the length of the array `arr`. Since the loop starts at index `i` and increments by `k` until the end of the array, there are multiple conditions that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

1. The length of the array `arr` must be greater than or equal to `i`.
2. The value of `k` must be a valid step size.
3. The initial value of `j` should be equal to `i`.

Adjustments needed for the loop to execute:
State: **All elements in the array `arr` are equal to `arr[i]`, `vis` is an empty set, `i`, `k`, and `put` remain the same, `j` is equal to `i`, length of `arr` is greater than or equal to `i`, `k` is a valid step size**
