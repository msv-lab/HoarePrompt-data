According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and the length of the array `arr`. If `i` is less than the length of `arr`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, all elements in the array `arr` are equal to `arr[i]`. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by `k` and must be less than the length of the array `arr`.
State: **All elements in the array `arr` are equal to `arr[i+k]`, for the loop to execute another time `i` must be incremented by `k` and be less than the length of `arr`**
