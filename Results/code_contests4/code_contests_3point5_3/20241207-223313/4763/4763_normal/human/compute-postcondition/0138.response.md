Postcondition: ***All elements in the array `arr` are either equal to `arr[i]` or `put`, `vis` contains a single unique non-'?' element in `arr`, `i`, `k`, and `put` remain the same. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than the length of `arr`. If the conditions for updating `arr[j]` are met, the value of `arr[j]` will be updated accordingly. If the loop does not execute, the initial state will remain unchanged. If the loop executes and the length of `vis` is 1, all elements in the array `arr` will be updated to `put`.***
