According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j`, `i`, `arr`, and `k`. If `j` is less than the length of `arr`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `vis` is a set containing the element `arr[j]`, `i` is a valid starting index, `arr` is a non-empty array, and `k` is a valid step size. The element at index `j` in `arr` is not equal to '?'. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than the length of `arr` and incremented by `k`.
State: **`vis` is a set containing the element `arr[j]`, `i` is a valid starting index, `arr` is a non-empty array, `k` is a valid step size, `j` is less than the length of `arr` and incremented by `k`**
