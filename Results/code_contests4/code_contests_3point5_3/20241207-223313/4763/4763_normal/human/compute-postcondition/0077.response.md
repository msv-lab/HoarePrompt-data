Postcondition: ***All elements in the array `arr` are equal to `arr[i]`, `vis` contains the element at index `j + k`, `i` is a valid starting index, `k` is a valid step size, and the element at index `j + k` in `arr` is not equal to '?'. If `arr[j]` is not equal to '?', then `vis` contains the element `arr[j]`.***
