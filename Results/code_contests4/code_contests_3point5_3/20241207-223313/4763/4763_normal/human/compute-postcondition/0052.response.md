Postcondition: ***All elements in the array `arr` are equal to `arr[i]`, `i` is a valid starting index, `k` is a valid step size, for the loop to execute the next time the length of `arr` must be greater than the current value of `i`. Additionally, either `arr[j]` is equal to `arr[i]` or `arr[j]` is equal to '?' for any index `j` different from `i`. Moreover, the element at index `j` is equal to '?'***
