According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will increase by 1 so `i` will be 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be greater than 1.
State: **`dic` is {'1': 1, '0': 0, '?': 0}, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be greater than 1**
