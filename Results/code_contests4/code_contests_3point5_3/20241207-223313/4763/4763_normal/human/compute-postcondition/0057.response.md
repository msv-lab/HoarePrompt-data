Postcondition: ***All elements in the array `arr` are equal to `arr[i+k]`, for the loop to execute another time `i` must be incremented by `k` and be less than the length of `arr`. If `arr[j]` is not equal to `arr[i]` and `arr[j]` is not equal to '?', then the program returns False. Otherwise, no change occurs in the state of the program.***
