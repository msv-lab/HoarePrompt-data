The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `k`. 

- `arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `k` (2 <= k <= n <= 3 * 10^5, k is even), and a string `s` of length `n` composed of characters 0, 1, and ?. 
- `k` is an even integer.

After executing the function body, the program returns False in 13 cases and True in 1 case. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept a list of tuples `arr` and an even integer `k`, and based on some conditions, return either True or False.
