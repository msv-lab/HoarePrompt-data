According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and the length of the array `arr`. If the next iteration of the loop is to be executed, then the index `j` must be within the bounds of the array `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, all elements in the array `arr` are equal to `arr[i]`, `vis` contains the element at index `j`, `i` is a valid starting index, `k` is a valid step size, and the element at index `j` in `arr` is not equal to '?'. 

To execute the loop one more time, the index `j` needs to be updated based on the step size `k`. Therefore, the next value of `j` should be calculated as `j + k`. Additionally, the new value of `j` should still be within the bounds of the array `arr`. 

State: **All elements in the array `arr` are equal to `arr[i]`, `vis` contains the element at index `j + k`, `i` is a valid starting index, `k` is a valid step size, and the element at index `j + k` in `arr` is not equal to '?'**
