Example Answer:
The code adds the element at index `j` in the array `arr` to the set `vis`. The set `vis` now contains the element `arr[j]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **All elements in the array `arr` are equal to `arr[i]`, `vis` contains the element at index `j + k`, `i` is a valid starting index, `k` is a valid step size, and the element at index `j + k` in `arr` is not equal to '?', `vis` contains the element `arr[j]`**
