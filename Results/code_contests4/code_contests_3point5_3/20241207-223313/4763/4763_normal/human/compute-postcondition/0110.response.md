Postcondition: ***All elements in the array `arr` are equal to `arr[i]`, `vis`, `i`, `k`, and `put` remain the same. For the loop to execute one more time, the conditions for updating `arr[j]` are met where `j` is equal to the next value of `i` based on the increment `k` and `arr[j]` is not equal to `arr[i]`, and `arr[j]` is not equal to '?'. If `arr[j]` is not equal to `arr[i]` and `arr[j]` is not equal to '?', the program returns False.***
