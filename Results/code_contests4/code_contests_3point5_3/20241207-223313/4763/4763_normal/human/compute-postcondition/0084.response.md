According to the code, the loop can execute if the array `arr` has at least one element. The loop will iterate starting from index `i` and with a step size of `k`. Before the loop starts, the initial values of `i` and `k` need to be valid starting index and step size, respectively. Also, since `put` is assigned the first element in `vis`, `vis` must contain at least one non-'?' element. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time: `arr` must have at least one element, `vis` contains at least one non-'?' element, `i` is a valid starting index, `k` is a valid step size, and `put` is assigned the first element in `vis`.

State: **All elements in the array `arr` are equal to `arr[i]`, `vis` contains at least one non-'?' element, `i` is a valid starting index, `k` is a valid step size, `put` is assigned the first element in `vis`, for the loop to execute the first time `arr` has at least one element**
