Postcondition: ***All elements in the array `arr` are equal to `arr[i]`. If `arr[i]` is not equal to '?', then the array `arr` is updated with all elements being equal to `arr[i]`. If `arr[i]` is '?', then `vis` is a set containing all non-'?' elements from the array `arr`, `i` is a valid starting index, `arr` has been updated with the first (and only) element of `vis` converted to a list at all valid indices based on `k`, `k` is a valid step size, the length of `vis` is 1, and `put` is the first (and only) element of `vis` converted to a list.***
