Output State: **All elements in the array `arr` are equal to `arr[i]`, `vis`, `i`, `k`, and `put` remain the same. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than the length of `arr`. If the conditions for updating `arr[j]` are met, the value of `arr[j]` will be updated accordingly. If the loop does not execute, the initial state will remain unchanged.**
