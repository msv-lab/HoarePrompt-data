According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, `arr`, and `j`. If `i` is incremented by `k` and is less than the length of `arr`, and if `arr[j]` is equal to `arr[i]` or `arr[j]` is equal to '?', the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, all elements in the array `arr` are equal to `arr[i+k]`. For the loop to execute another time, `i` must be incremented by `k` and be less than the length of `arr`. Additionally, if `arr[j]` is not equal to `arr[i]` and `arr[j]` is not equal to '?', then the program returns False.

State: **All elements in the array `arr` are equal to `arr[i+k]`, `i` is incremented by `k` and is less than the length of `arr`, and if `arr[j]` is not equal to `arr[i]` and `arr[j]` is not equal to '?', then the loop can execute another time**
