According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the variable `y` is not falsy (i.e., not equal to 0). At the end of the previous iteration, `x` has been assigned the value of the list of tuples `y`, and `y` has been assigned the remainder of `x` divided by `y`. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` needs to have a value that is not equal to 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **x has the value of the list of tuples y, y has the remainder of x divided by y, for the loop to execute again y is not equal to 0**
