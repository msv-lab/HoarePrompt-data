Example Answer:
The code increments the value in the dictionary `dic` at the key `arr[i]` by 1. The initial values of `dic` are {'1': 0, '0': 0, '?': 0}, and `i` is 0. If `arr[i]` is '1', then after execution, the dictionary `dic` will be {'1': 1, '0': 0, '?': 0}. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`dic` is {'1': 1, '0': 0, '?': 0}, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is greater than 0**
