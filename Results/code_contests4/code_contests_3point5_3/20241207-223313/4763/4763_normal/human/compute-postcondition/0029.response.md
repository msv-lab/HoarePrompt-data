According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j`, `i`, `arr`, and `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `vis` is a set containing the elements `arr[j]`, `i` is a valid starting index, `arr` is a non-empty array, `k` is a valid step size, `j` is less than the length of `arr` and incremented by `k` after adding `arr[j]` to `vis` if `arr[j]` is not equal to '?'. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- `j` needs to be updated to the next value based on the step size `k`.
- If `arr[j]` is not equal to '?', then `arr[j]` should be added to `vis`.
- Ensure that the new `j` value is still less than the length of `arr`.

State: **`vis` is a set containing the elements `arr[j_next]`, `i` is a valid starting index, `arr` is a non-empty array, `k` is a valid step size, `j_next` is less than the length of `arr` and incremented by `k` after adding `arr[j_next]` to `vis` if `arr[j_next]` is not equal to '?'**.
