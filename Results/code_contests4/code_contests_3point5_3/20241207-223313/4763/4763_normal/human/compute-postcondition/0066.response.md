Postcondition: ***All elements in the array `arr` are equal to `arr[i]`. `arr[i]` is equal to '?'. `vis` is a set containing all non-'?' elements from the array `arr`. `i` is a valid starting index. `arr` has been updated with the first (and only) element of `vis` converted to a list at all valid indices based on `k`. `k` is a valid step size. The length of `vis` is 1. `put` is the first (and only) element of `vis` converted to a list. The length of `arr` is not greater than the current value of `i`.***
