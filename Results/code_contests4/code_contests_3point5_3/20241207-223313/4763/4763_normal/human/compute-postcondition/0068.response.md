According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and the length of the array `arr`. Since `i` is a valid starting index, `k` is a valid step size, and all elements in the array `arr` are equal to `arr[i]`, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `vis` is an empty set and `put` is not defined, which are not relevant to the loop execution.
State: **All elements in the array `arr` are equal to `arr[i]`, `vis` is an empty set, `i` is a valid starting index, `k` is a valid step size.**
