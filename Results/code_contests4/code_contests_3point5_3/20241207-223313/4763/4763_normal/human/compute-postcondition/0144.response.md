Example Answer:
The value at the index `i` of the array `arr` is used as a key in the dictionary `dic`, and 1 is added to its value. Since `i` is 1, the value at index 1 of `arr` is '0'. Therefore, the value associated with the key '0' in `dic` will be incremented by 1. The updated dictionary becomes {'1': 1, '0': 1, '?': 0}. The values of `k` and other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`dic` is {'1': 1, '0': 1, '?': 0}, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be greater than 1**
