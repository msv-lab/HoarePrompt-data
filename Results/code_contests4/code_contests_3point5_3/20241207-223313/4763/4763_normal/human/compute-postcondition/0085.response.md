Example Answer:
The value of `put` is assigned to `arr[j]`, where `j` is the index variable. As `put` is assigned the first element of `vis`, the value of `arr[j]` becomes the first element of `vis`. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements in the array `arr` are equal to `arr[i]`, `vis` contains at least one non-'?' element, `i` is a valid starting index, `k` is a valid step size, `put` is assigned the first element in `vis`, and the element at index `j` in `arr` is now the first element of `vis`.
Output State: **All elements in the array `arr` are equal to `arr[i]`, `vis` contains at least one non-'?' element, `i` is a valid starting index, `k` is a valid step size, `put` is assigned the first element in `vis`, and the element at index `j` in `arr` is now the first element of `vis`**
