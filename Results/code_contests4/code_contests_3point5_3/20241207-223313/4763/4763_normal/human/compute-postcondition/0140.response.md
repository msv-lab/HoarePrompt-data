Example Answer:
Initially, the dictionary `dic` is defined with keys '1', '0', and '?' each initialized to 0. The loop will update the values in the dictionary based on the elements in the array `arr`. Since the loop does not execute, the initial state of the dictionary remains unchanged.
Output State: **dic = {'1': 0, '0': 0, '?': 0}**
