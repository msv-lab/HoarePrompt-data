Example Answer:
The value of `sep` is written to the `file`. The default value of `sep` is ' ' and it is popped from `kwargs`, and the default value of `file` is `sys.stdout` and it is also popped from `kwargs`. `at_start` is True and the `file` writes the value of `sep`. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is assigned the value popped from kwargs with a default of ' ', `file` is assigned the value popped from kwargs with a default of `sys.stdout`, `args` has at least 3 elements, `at_start` is True, `sep` value is written to the `file`.
Output State: **`sep` is assigned the value popped from kwargs with a default of ' ', `file` is assigned the value popped from kwargs with a default of `sys.stdout`, `args` has at least 3 elements, `at_start` is True, `sep` value is written to the `file`**
