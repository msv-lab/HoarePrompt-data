Example Answer:
`x` is now assigned the previous value of `y`, and `y` is now assigned the remainder of the division of the previous values of `x` and `y`. For the loop to execute again, `y` must not be equal to 0. 
Output State: **`x` has the value of the list of tuples y, `y` has the remainder of x divided by y, for the loop to execute again `y` is not equal to 0**
