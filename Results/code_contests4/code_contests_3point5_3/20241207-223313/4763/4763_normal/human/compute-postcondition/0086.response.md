According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and the length of the array `arr`. If the index `j` is within the bounds of the array, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, all elements in the array `arr` are equal, `vis` contains at least one non-'?' element, `i` is a valid starting index, `k` is a valid step size, `put` is assigned the first element in `vis`, and the element at index `j` in `arr` is now the first element of `vis`. 

To execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- The index `j` should be updated to the next valid index based on the step size `k`.
- The element at the new index `j` in `arr` should now be the first element of `vis`.

State: **All elements in the array `arr` are equal to `arr[i]`, `vis` contains at least one non-'?' element, `i` is a valid starting index, `k` is a valid step size, `put` is assigned the first element in `vis`, and the element at index `j` in `arr` is now the first element of `vis`, for the loop to execute one more time the element at the new index after applying step size `k` in `arr` is now the first element of `vis`**
