According to the code, the loop can execute if the list `y` is not empty. Right before the loop, `x` represents the number of test cases, `y` is a list of tuples. For the loop to execute the first time, the list `y` needs to contain at least one tuple. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **x is an integer representing the number of test cases, y is a list of tuples containing at least one tuple for the loop to execute the first time**
