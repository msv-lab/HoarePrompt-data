Functionality: The function `func_3` takes two parameters, `arr` and `k`, where `arr` is a list of tuples containing integers and a string with specific constraints, and `k` is an even integer. The function iterates through `arr` and modifies it based on certain conditions. After the execution, the function returns True if specific conditions are met, otherwise, it returns False. The functionality includes updating `arr` so that groups of `k` consecutive elements contain the same non-'?' element or are filled with '?' characters. However, the actual code does not cover all potential cases described in the annotations, so additional edge cases and missing functionality need to be considered for a complete summary.
