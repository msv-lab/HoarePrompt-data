Example Answer:
The values of `sep` and `file` are extracted from the `kwargs` dictionary using the `pop` method. If 'sep' key exists in `kwargs`, its corresponding value is assigned to `sep`, otherwise, the default value ' ' is used. Similarly, if 'file' key exists in `kwargs`, its corresponding value is assigned to `file`, otherwise, `sys.stdout` is used. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is either the value extracted from `kwargs` or ' ', `file` is the value extracted from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`.
Output State: **`sep` is either the value extracted from `kwargs` or ' ', `file` is the value extracted from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`**
