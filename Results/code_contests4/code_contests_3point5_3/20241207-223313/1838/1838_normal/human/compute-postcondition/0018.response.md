Example Answer:
`at_start` is assigned the value `False`, which remains the same as its previous value. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is either the value extracted from `kwargs` or ' ', `file` is the value extracted from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least one more element.
Output State: **`sep` is either the value extracted from `kwargs` or ' ', `file` is the value extracted from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least one more element.**
