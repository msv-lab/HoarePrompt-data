Example Answer:
`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file. The value of `sep` is either the value extracted from `kwargs` or ' ', and the value of `file` is the value extracted from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`. The value of `at_start` is False, and `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least one more element. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is either the value extracted from `kwargs` or ' ', `file` is the value extracted from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least one more element.
Output State: **`sep` is either the value extracted from `kwargs` or ' ', `file` is the value extracted from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least one more element**
