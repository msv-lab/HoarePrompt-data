According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `args`. If `args` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `sep` can be any value, `file` can be any value, and `at_start` is True. So, to adjust the states for the loop to execute, `args` must be a non-empty iterable.
State: **`sep` is either the value extracted from `kwargs` or ' ', `file` is the value extracted from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is True, for the loop to execute `args` is a non-empty iterable**
