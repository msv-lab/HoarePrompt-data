Example Answer: 
The value of `x` is converted to a string using `str(x)` and then written to the file specified by `file`. The value of `sep`, `file`, `at_start`, and `args` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is either the value extracted from `kwargs` or ' ', `file` is the value extracted from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable.
Output State: **`sep` is either the value extracted from `kwargs` or ' ', `file` is the value extracted from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable**
