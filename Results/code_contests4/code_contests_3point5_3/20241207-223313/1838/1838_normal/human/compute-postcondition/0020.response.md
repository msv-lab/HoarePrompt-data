Example Answer:
The `end` key is popped from `kwargs` with a default value of '\n' if it does not exist. The value extracted is written to the `file`. The variables `sep`, `file`, `at_start`, and `args` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is either the value extracted from `kwargs` or ' ', `file` is the value extracted from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable.
Output State: **`sep` is either the value extracted from `kwargs` or ' ', `file` is the value extracted from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable**
