Example Answer:
`at_start` is reassigned the value `False`, which is the same as the initial state. No other variables are affected. 
Output State: **`sep` is either the value extracted from `kwargs` or ' ', `file` is the value extracted from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable**
