Example Answer:
The `write` method of the `file` object is called with the string representation of `x` as its argument. The output is written by the `write` method to the specified file or `sys.stdout`. `sep`, `file`, `at_start`, and `args` are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **`sep` is either the value extracted from `kwargs` or ' ', `file` is the value extracted from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least one more element.**
