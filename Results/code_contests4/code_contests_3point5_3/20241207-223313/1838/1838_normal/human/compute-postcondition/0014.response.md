According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `args`. If there is at least one more element in `args`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `sep`, `file`, `at_start`, and `args` are given values. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `args` must still be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, and `at_start` must remain False.
State: **`sep` is either the value extracted from `kwargs` or ' ', `file` is the value extracted from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least one more element**
