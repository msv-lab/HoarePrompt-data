According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `args` variable, which is a non-empty iterable. If there are more elements in the iterable, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `sep`, `file`, `at_start` remain unchanged. So, for the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more element in the iterable.
State: **`sep` is either the value extracted from `kwargs` or ' ', `file` is the value extracted from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least one more element**
