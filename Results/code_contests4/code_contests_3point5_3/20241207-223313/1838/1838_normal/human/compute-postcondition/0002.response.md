Example Answer:
`at_start` is assigned the value `True`. There are no other variables affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is either the value extracted from `kwargs` or ' ', `file` is the value extracted from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is True.
Output State: **`sep` is either the value extracted from `kwargs` or ' ', `file` is the value extracted from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is True**
