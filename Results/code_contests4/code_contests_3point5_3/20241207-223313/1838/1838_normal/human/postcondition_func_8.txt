The function `func_9` accepts three parameters: `n` (number of rows), `m` (number of elements in each row), and `num` (the value to be repeated in each row). After executing the function body, the program returns a 2D list where each row contains 'm' number of 'num' elements, and there are 'n' rows in total. The function successfully creates a 2D list based on the input parameters `n`, `m`, and `num`.
