The function `func_20` does not accept any parameters and prints the number 20 to a stream, or to `sys.stdout` by default. It handles optional keyword arguments like `sep`, `file`, `end`, and `flush` to customize the output. However, there seems to be missing logic in the code as it does not utilize the `args` variable in the for loop, which might lead to unexpected behavior. Additionally, the function does not explicitly return any value other than writing to the specified file.
