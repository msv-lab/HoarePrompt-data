The function `func_6` sets the recursion limit and stack size, creates a new thread that executes the `main` function, and starts the thread. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It should be noted that the annotations mention preconditions regarding the values of variables `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, but these variables are not used or defined within the `func_6` function.
