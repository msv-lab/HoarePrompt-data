The function `func_15` accepts three integers `x`, `y`, and `p`, where `x`, `y`, and `p` have values between 1 and 10^9. It updates the value of `res` based on the modulus operation with `p` while iterating through a loop. After the loop, it returns the final value of `res`. The functionality of the function is to perform modular exponentiation with base `x`, exponent `y`, and modulus `p` to calculate `res` and return the result.
