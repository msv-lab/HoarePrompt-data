You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Yura is tasked to build a closed fence in shape of an arbitrary non-degenerate simple quadrilateral. He's already got three straight fence segments with known lengths a, b, and c. Now he needs to find out some possible integer length d of the fourth straight fence segment so that he can build the fence using these four segments. In other words, the fence should have a quadrilateral shape with side lengths equal to a, b, c, and d. Help Yura, find any possible length of the fourth side.

A non-degenerate simple quadrilateral is such a quadrilateral that no three of its corners lie on the same line, and it does not cross itself.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t — the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). The next t lines describe the test cases.

Each line contains three integers a, b, and c — the lengths of the three fence segments (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9).

Output

For each test case print a single integer d — the length of the fourth fence segment that is suitable for building the fence. If there are multiple answers, print any. We can show that an answer always exists.

Example

Input


2
1 2 3
12 34 56


Output


4
42

Note

We can build a quadrilateral with sides 1, 2, 3, 4.

We can build a quadrilateral with sides 12, 34, 56, 42.

    return x
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor of the initial values of `x` and `y`, which is the initial value of `x`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_16` accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`. It calculates the greatest common divisor of the initial values of `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm.

        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer. `n` is greater than 1. `n` is larger than 3. The value of `n` is not divisible by 2 or 3
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        
        i = i + 6
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: If `n` is not divisible by any number `i` or `i+2` where `i` is 5, 11, 17, ..., then the function returns True. Otherwise, the function returns False.
    return True
    #The program returns True if 'n' is not divisible by any number 'i' or 'i+2' where 'i' is 5, 11, 17, ..., otherwise it returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_17` accepts an integer `n` and returns False if `n` is less than or equal to 1, True if `n` is less than or equal to 3, and False if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3. Additionally, it returns True if `n` is not divisible by any number `i` or `i+2` where `i` is 5, 11, 17, and so on; otherwise, it returns False. The function covers all potential cases specified in the annotations.

#Function 18:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_18():
    sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
    sys.stdout = open('output.txt', 'w')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_18` sets the standard input to read from a file named 'input.txt' and the standard output to write to a file named 'output.txt'. It does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.

#Function 19:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of three integers a, b, and c representing the lengths of the three fence segments, where 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9.**
def func_19():
    for _ in range(func_1()):
        a, b, c = func_3()
        
        func_20(c + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: The values of a, b, and c after all iterations of the loop will be the values returned by `func_3()` for each variable.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function iterates over a range of values returned by `func_1()`, where for each iteration, it assigns values to variables a, b, and c by calling `func_3()`. Then, it calls `func_20` with the parameter c + 1. The function aims to interact with other functions to perform calculations related to fence segments; however, the actual calculation or manipulation logic is not present in the provided code.

#Function 20:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_20():
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        
        file.write(str(x))
        
        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sep` is either the value extracted from `kwargs` or ' ', `file` is the value extracted from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`sep` is either the value extracted from `kwargs` or ' ', `file` is the value extracted from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable. If the 'flush' key is present in `kwargs` and its value is True, then the key is removed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_20` does not accept any parameters and prints the number 20 to a stream, or to `sys.stdout` by default. It handles optional keyword arguments like `sep`, `file`, `end`, and `flush` to customize the output. However, there seems to be missing logic in the code as it does not utilize the `args` variable in the for loop, which might lead to unexpected behavior. Additionally, the function does not explicitly return any value other than writing to the specified file.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
