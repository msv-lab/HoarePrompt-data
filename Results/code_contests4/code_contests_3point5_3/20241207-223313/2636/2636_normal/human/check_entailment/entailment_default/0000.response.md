Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The code calculates the sum of the first two cards, then counts how many other cards can be drawn without exceeding a total of 20. If this count is greater than 3, the program outputs 'YES', otherwise 'NO'. However, the program does not consider all possible combinations of drawing an additional card to reach a total of 20 or less. For example, if the sum of the first two cards is 18 and the opponent's card is 1, it is possible to draw a card with a value of 1 to reach a total of 19 and win, but the program does not account for this scenario. Hence, the program is incorrect.
