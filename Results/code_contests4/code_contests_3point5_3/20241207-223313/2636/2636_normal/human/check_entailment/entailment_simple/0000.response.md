Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the sum of the player's two cards and then counts the number of additional cards that can be drawn without exceeding a total of 20. If the number of additional cards that can be drawn without exceeding 20 is greater than 3, it outputs 'YES', otherwise 'NO'. This logic aligns with the problem description provided, where the player should draw an additional card if there is a 50% or greater probability that the total will be 20 or less.

The program iterates through multiple datasets and produces the correct output 'YES' or 'NO' for each dataset based on the calculated probability. Therefore, the program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.
