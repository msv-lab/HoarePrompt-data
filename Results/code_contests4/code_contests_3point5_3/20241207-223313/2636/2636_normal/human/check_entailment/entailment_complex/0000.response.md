Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the rules of the game described in the problem description. It calculates the total of the first two cards, then determines the number of additional cards that can be drawn to keep the total at 20 or less. If the count is greater than 3, it outputs 'YES', otherwise 'NO'. This decision-making process aligns with the probability-based strategy outlined in the problem description. The program handles multiple datasets as well. Overall, the program follows the problem description accurately.
