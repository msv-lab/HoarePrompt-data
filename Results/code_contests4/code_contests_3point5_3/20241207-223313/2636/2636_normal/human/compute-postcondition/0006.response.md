According to the code, the loop can execute multiple times as long as there is input available from stdin. At the end of the previous iteration, C1, C2, and C3 are integers between 1 and 10, c contains the integers obtained from the input line split by spaces, cards is a list containing integers from 1 to 10 excluding those present in c, and the result of the print statement ('YES' or 'NO') depending on the value of e. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
State: **C1, C2, and C3 are integers between 1 and 10, c contains the integers obtained from the next input line split by spaces, cards is a list containing integers from 1 to 10 excluding those present in c, and the result of the print statement ('YES' or 'NO') depending on the value of e**
