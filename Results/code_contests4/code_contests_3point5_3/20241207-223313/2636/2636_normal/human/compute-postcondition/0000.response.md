According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are lines to read from the standard input (stdin). Since we do not have information about the exact number of lines, we need to focus on adjusting the states C1, C2, and C3 to ensure the loop can execute.

State: **C1, C2, and C3 are integers between 1 and 10, for the loop to execute there must be lines to read from stdin**
