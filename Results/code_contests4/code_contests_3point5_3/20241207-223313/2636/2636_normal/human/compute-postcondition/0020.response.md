Functionality: **The function `func` iterates over input lines, transforms the input into a list of integers, calculates the sum of the first two elements, determines the count of elements in a range based on a condition, and prints 'YES' if this count is greater than 3, otherwise prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
