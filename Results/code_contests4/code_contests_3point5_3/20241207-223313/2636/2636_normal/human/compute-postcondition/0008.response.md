Example Answer:
The list comprehension creates a new list `cards` that contains integers from 1 to 10 excluding those present in the list `c`. The previous values of `C1`, `C2`, `C3`, `c` are not affected, and the value of `e` is not provided. Therefore, the Output State is: C1, C2, and C3 are integers between 1 and 10, c contains the integers obtained from the input line split by spaces, cards is a list containing integers from 1 to 10 excluding those present in c, and the result of the print statement ('YES' or 'NO') depending on the value of e.
Output State: **C1, C2, and C3 are integers between 1 and 10, c contains the integers obtained from the input line split by spaces, cards is a list containing integers from 1 to 10 excluding those present in c, and the result of the print statement ('YES' or 'NO') depending on the value of e**
