Example Answer:
The list c is assigned the integers obtained from the input line after splitting by spaces. The values of C1, C2, C3, cards, and the result of the print statement are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: C1, C2, and C3 are integers between 1 and 10, c contains the integers obtained from the input line split by spaces, cards is a list containing integers from 1 to 10 excluding those present in c, and the result of the print statement ('YES' or 'NO') depending on the value of e.
Output State: **C1, C2, and C3 are integers between 1 and 10, c contains the integers obtained from the input line split by spaces, cards is a list containing integers from 1 to 10 excluding those present in c, and the result of the print statement ('YES' or 'NO') depending on the value of e**
