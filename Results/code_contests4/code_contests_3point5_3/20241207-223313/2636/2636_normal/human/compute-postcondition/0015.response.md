Example Answer: 
`c1c2` is assigned the sum of the first two elements of list `c`, where `c` is a list containing integers obtained from the input separated by spaces. The value of `c1c2` is dependent on the input values. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: C1, C2, and C3 are integers between 1 and 10, c contains the integers obtained from the input line split by spaces, cards is a list containing integers from 1 to 10 excluding those present in c, c1c2 is the sum of the first two elements of list c, e is the count of elements in cards that are less than or equal to 20 when added to c1c2.
Output State: **C1, C2, and C3 are integers between 1 and 10, c contains the integers obtained from the input line split by spaces, cards is a list containing integers from 1 to 10 excluding those present in c, c1c2 is the sum of the first two elements of list c, e is the count of elements in cards that are less than or equal to 20 when added to c1c2**
