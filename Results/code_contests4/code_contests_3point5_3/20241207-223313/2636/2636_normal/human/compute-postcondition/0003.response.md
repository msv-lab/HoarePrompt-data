Example Answer:
`c1c2` is assigned the value of the sum of the first two integers in the list `c`. The values of C1, C2, C3, and `cards` list are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: C1, C2, and C3 are integers between 1 and 10, `c` contains the integers obtained from the input line split by spaces, `cards` is a list containing integers from 1 to 10 excluding those present in `c`.
Output State: **C1, C2, and C3 are integers between 1 and 10, `c` contains the integers obtained from the input line split by spaces, `cards` is a list containing integers from 1 to 10 excluding those present in `c`**
