Example Answer:
The list `c` is assigned the values obtained by converting each element `s` in the input line split by spaces to integers. Since there must be lines to read from stdin for the loop to execute, the values of C1, C2, and C3 are utilized for this conversion. Therefore, the Output State is: C1, C2, and C3 are integers between 1 and 10, `c` contains the integers obtained from the input line split by spaces.
Output State: **C1, C2, and C3 are integers between 1 and 10, `c` contains the integers obtained from the input line split by spaces**
