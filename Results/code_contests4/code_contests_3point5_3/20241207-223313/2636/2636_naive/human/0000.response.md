Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the probability of the total being 20 or less when drawing one more card. The calculation of `e` is incorrect as it only considers if the total is less than or equal to 20, but does not take into account the opponent's front card. This can lead to incorrect probabilities being calculated. 

For example, if the input is `1 2 5`, the correct output should be "YES" because drawing any card from 3 to 10 (except 5) would result in a total less than or equal to 20. However, the program would output "NO" in this case because it does not consider the opponent's front card in the calculation. This shows that the program is incorrect and does not adhere to the problem description for all potential cases.
