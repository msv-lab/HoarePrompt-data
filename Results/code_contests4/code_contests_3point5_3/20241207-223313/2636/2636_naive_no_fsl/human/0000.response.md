Correctness: False

The given program does not correctly implement the rules of the game described in the problem description. The logic used to calculate the probability of the total being 20 or less when drawing one more card is incorrect. The program simply counts the number of cards that would keep the total at 20 or less without considering the actual probabilities involved.

An example where the program does not work correctly:
Input:
1 2 3

Expected Output:
YES

Explanation:
In this case, the player has cards 1 and 2, and the opponent's face card is 3. Drawing any card from 4 to 10 would result in a total of 7 to 13, which would be less than 20. Therefore, the correct output should be "YES" as there is a high probability of the total being 20 or less when drawing one more card. However, the program might output "NO" in this case due to incorrect logic.
