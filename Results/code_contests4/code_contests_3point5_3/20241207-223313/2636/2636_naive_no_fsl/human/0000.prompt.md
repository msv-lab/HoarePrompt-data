You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is one card each with the numbers from "1" to "10", for a total of 10 cards. This card has numbers on the front and nothing on the back. Using this card, you and your opponent will play the game according to the following rules.

1. You and your opponent are dealt a total of two cards, one face up and one back up. You can see the numbers on the front card of your opponent, but not the numbers on the back card.
2. You win when the total number of cards dealt is 20 or less and greater than the total number of your opponent. For example, if your card is "7" "8" (15 total) and your opponent's card is "9" "10" (19 total), your opponent wins.
3. You and your opponent can draw up to one more card. You don't have to pull it.



Now, as a guide to deciding whether to draw one more card, consider the probability that the total will be 20 or less when you draw a card, and if that probability is 50% or more, draw a card. When calculating this probability, you can use the information of your two cards and the card on the opponent's table for a total of three cards. In other words, you don't draw those cards because you only have one for each card.

A program that reads your two cards and your opponent's front card, and outputs YES if there is a 50% or greater probability that the total will be 20 or less when you draw one more card, otherwise it will output NO. Please create.



Input

The input consists of multiple datasets. Given that the number on your first card is C1, the number on your second card is C2, and the number on your opponent's face card is C3, each dataset is given in the following format: ..


C1 C2 C3


Output

Print YES or NO on one line for each dataset.

Example

Input

1 2 3
5 6 9
8 9 10


Output

YES
YES
NO
Program:
```
for line in stdin:
    c = [int(s) for s in line.split()]
    cards = [i for i in range(1, 11) if i not in c]
    c1c2 = c[0] + c[1]
    e = sum((int(i + c1c2 <= 20) for i in cards))
    print('YES' if e > 3 else 'NO')
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
