Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the datasets are separated by a single blank line. The program reads the input dataset as a continuous string without considering the blank line separator. This will lead to incorrect island count calculation as the program will not treat each dataset separately.

Therefore, the program needs to be modified to correctly handle the separation of datasets by a blank line in the input.
