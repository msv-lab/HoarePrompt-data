Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the input dataset for each plan view is separated by a single blank line. The while loop does not account for this case and will continue processing the input datasets without resetting the necessary variables. This will lead to incorrect island count calculations for subsequent datasets.
