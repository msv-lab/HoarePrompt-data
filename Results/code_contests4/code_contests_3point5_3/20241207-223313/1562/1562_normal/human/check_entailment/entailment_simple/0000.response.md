Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the logic to count the number of islands in the given plan view. It checks each cell in the plan view, and if it encounters a black square ('1') that has not been visited before, it recursively visits all adjacent black squares to form an island. The program correctly marks visited cells and counts islands based on the given definition.

The program follows the problem description by correctly identifying islands based on the adjacency of black squares and counting them accurately. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` work together to traverse the plan view and count the islands as required.
