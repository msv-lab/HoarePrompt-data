Correctness: **False**

Explanation: Upon reviewing the code and the problem description, the code seems to follow the requirements of counting the number of islands based on the presence of black squares. The functions provided handle the grid manipulation and island counting logic as described. 

However, the output hints indicate that the datasets are separated by a single blank line, which the code does not account for. The code reads the grid row by row without considering the blank line separator between datasets. This means that the code will not handle multiple datasets correctly and may provide inaccurate results. Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, making the correctness **False**.
