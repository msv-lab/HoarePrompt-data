You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: There is a plan view consisting of 12 vertical and 12 horizontal squares showing the terrain. Each square is painted white or black. White represents the sea and black represents the land. When two black squares touch each other vertically or horizontally, they are said to be continuous. In this plan view, the area created by only one black square or a continuous black square is called an "island". For example, in the figure below, there are five islands.

Input

The input consists of multiple datasets. One plan view is given for each dataset. A plan view is represented by 12 rows of 12 number columns, with black squares represented by 1 and white squares represented by 0. The datasets are separated by a single blank line.

The number of datasets does not exceed 20.

Output

Outputs the number of islands on one line for each dataset.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **y is an integer representing the number of rows in the plan view, and x is an integer representing the number of columns in the plan view.**
def func_1(y, x):
    if (0 <= y <= 11 and 0 <= x <= 11) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: y is an integer representing the number of rows in the plan view, and x is an integer representing the number of columns in the plan view. y is not in the range from 0 to 11 or x is not in the range from 0 to 11
    return False
    #The program returns False

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: y and x are integers such that 0 <= y < 12 and 0 <= x < 12.**
def func_2(y, x):
    if (g[y][x] == '0') :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *y and x are integers such that 0 <= y < 12 and 0 <= x < 12. The value of g[y][x] is not '0'
    g[y][x] = '0'
    for i in xrange(4):
        nexty = y + dy[i]
        
        nextx = x + dx[i]
        
        if not func_1(nexty, nextx):
            continue
        
        if visited[nexty][nextx] == 0 and g[nexty][nextx] == '1':
            visited[nexty][nextx] = 1
            func_2(nexty, nextx)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `g[y][x]` is '0', all cells in `visited` that were set to 1 by the loop are still 1, `i` is 3, `nexty` and `nextx` are the final values after the last iteration, `g[nexty][nextx]` is the value of `g` at the final `(nexty, nextx)` coordinates.
    return 1
    #The program returns 1


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
