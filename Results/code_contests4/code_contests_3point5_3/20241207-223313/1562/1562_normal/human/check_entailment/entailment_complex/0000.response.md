Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program includes two functions `func_1` and `func_2` which are used to determine the number of islands in a plan view consisting of black and white squares. The functions correctly handle the case where two black squares are considered to be continuous and form an island. The program iterates through the grid, marking visited cells and recursively exploring neighboring black squares.

The annotations provided for the functions explain the purpose of each function and the conditions under which they return specific values. The annotations cover potential cases such as checking if the input coordinates are within the specified range and handling cases where the grid cells are not black or have already been visited.

Based on the code and the annotations, it can be concluded that the program follows the problem description for every potential case and correctly calculates the number of islands in the plan view.
