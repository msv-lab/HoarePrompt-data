The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `y` and `x`, both integers such that 0 <= y < 12 and 0 <= x < 12. If `g[y][x]` is '0', the function returns 0. Otherwise, it sets `g[y][x]` to '0' and iterates through neighboring cells based on predefined directions. It recursively calls itself for cells meeting specific conditions. The function returns 1 at the end. The functionality of the function is to manipulate a grid `g` based on certain conditions and return either 0 or 1.
