According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `visited`, `g`, `nexty`, `nextx`, `dx`, and the condition `visited[nexty][nextx] == 0 and g[nexty][nextx] == '1'`. If the condition is satisfied and `func_1` returns False, the loop proceeds to the next iteration. 

At the end of the last iteration, `g[y][x]` is '0', `i` is 0, `visited[nexty][nextx]` is 1, `g[nexty][nextx]` is '1', `nextx` is the result of `x + dx[i]`. For the loop to execute one more time, the next iteration should be considered. Therefore, the next state should be: 
State: **`g[y][x]` is '0', `i` is 1, `visited[nexty][nextx]` is 1, `g[nexty][nextx]` is '1', `nextx` is the result of `x + dx[1]`**
