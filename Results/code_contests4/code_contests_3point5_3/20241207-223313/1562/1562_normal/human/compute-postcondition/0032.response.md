The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `y` and `x`, both of which are integers such that 0 <= y < 12 and 0 <= x < 12. 

The function has two cases:
- Case 1: The program returns 0
- Case 2: The program returns 1

Therefore, the functionality of the function func_2 is to accept two integer parameters y and x, and return either 0 or 1 based on certain conditions.
