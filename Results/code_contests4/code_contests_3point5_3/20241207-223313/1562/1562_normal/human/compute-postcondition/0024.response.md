Example Answer:
`nextx` is assigned the value of `x` plus the value of `dx` at index `1`. The value of `x` is not specified, but based on the given information, `dx[1]` is the change in the x-coordinate when `i` is 1. Since `i` is 1, `dx[1]` is the change in the x-coordinate when moving in the positive x-direction. Therefore, `nextx` is the result of moving one step in the positive x-direction from the current `x`.

Output State: **`g[y][x]` is '0', `i` is 1, `visited[nexty][nextx]` is 1, `g[nexty][nextx]` is '1', `nextx` is the result of moving one step in the positive x-direction from the current `x`**
