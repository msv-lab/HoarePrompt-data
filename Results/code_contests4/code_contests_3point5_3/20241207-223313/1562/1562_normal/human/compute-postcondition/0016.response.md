Example Answer:
`nextx` is assigned the value of `x + dx[i]`, where the initial values of `x` and `i` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `g[y][x]` is '0', `i` is 0, `visited[nexty][nextx]` is 0, `g[nexty][nextx]` is '1', `nextx` is the result of `x + dx[i]`.
Output State: **`g[y][x]` is '0', `i` is 0, `visited[nexty][nextx]` is 0, `g[nexty][nextx]` is '1', `nextx` is the result of `x + dx[i]`**
