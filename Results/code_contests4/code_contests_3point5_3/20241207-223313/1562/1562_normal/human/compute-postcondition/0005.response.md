Example Answer:
`nexty` is assigned the value of `y + dy[i]`. The values of `y` and `dy[i]` are unknown, so the value of `nexty` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `g[y][x]` is '0', `i` is 0 for the loop to execute.
Output State: **`g[y][x]` is '0', `i` is 0 for the loop to execute**
