Example Answer:
`func_2(nexty, nextx)` is called, but the outcome of the function is not specified. The initial state variables are not affected by the code snippet provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `g[y][x]` is '0', `i` is 0, `visited[nexty][nextx]` is 1, `g[nexty][nextx]` is '1', `nextx` is the result of `x + dx[i]`, and the program proceeds to the next iteration if `func_1` returns False.
Output State: **`g[y][x]` is '0', `i` is 0, `visited[nexty][nextx]` is 1, `g[nexty][nextx]` is '1', `nextx` is the result of `x + dx[i]`, and the program proceeds to the next iteration if `func_1` returns False.**
