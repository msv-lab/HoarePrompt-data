Example Answer:
`nexty` is assigned the value `y + dy[i]`, where `dy` is an array and `i` is an index. The values of `y` and `i` are unknown, so the value of `nexty` cannot be determined accurately. Therefore, the Output State is: `g[y][x]` is '0', `i` is 0, `visited[nexty][nextx]` is 0, `g[nexty][nextx]` is '1'.
Output State: **`g[y][x]` is '0', `i` is 0, `visited[nexty][nextx]` is 0, `g[nexty][nextx]` is '1'**
