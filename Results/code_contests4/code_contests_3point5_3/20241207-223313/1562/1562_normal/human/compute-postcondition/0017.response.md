Example Answer:
The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but it skips the rest of the current iteration in a loop and continues with the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `g[y][x]` is '0', `i` is 0, `visited[nexty][nextx]` is 0, `g[nexty][nextx]` is '1', `nextx` is the result of `x + dx[i]` and the loop or if statement continues with the next iteration.
Output State: **`g[y][x]` is '0', `i` is 0, `visited[nexty][nextx]` is 0, `g[nexty][nextx]` is '1', `nextx` is the result of `x + dx[i]` and the loop or if statement continues with the next iteration.**
