Example Answer:
`visited[nexty][nextx]` is assigned the value 1. The initial state indicates that `visited[nexty][nextx]` is already 1. Therefore, the value remains the same. Other variables are not affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **`g[y][x]` is '0', `i` is 1, `visited[nexty][nextx]` is 1, `g[nexty][nextx]` is '1', `nextx` is the result of moving one step in the positive x-direction from the current `x`.**
