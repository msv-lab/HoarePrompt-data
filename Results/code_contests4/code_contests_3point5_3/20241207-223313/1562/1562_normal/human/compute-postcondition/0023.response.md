Example Answer:
`nexty` is assigned the value of `y + dy[i]`, where `dy` is a list of values and `i` is 1. The value of `y` is unknown, so `nexty` cannot be determined accurately. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `g[y][x]` is '0', `i` is 1, `visited[nexty][nextx]` is 1, `g[nexty][nextx]` is '1', `nextx` is the result of `x + dx[1]`.
Output State: **`g[y][x]` is '0', `i` is 1, `visited[nexty][nextx]` is 1, `g[nexty][nextx]` is '1', `nextx` is the result of `x + dx[1]`**
