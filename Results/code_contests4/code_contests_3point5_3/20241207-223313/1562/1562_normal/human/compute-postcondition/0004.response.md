According to the code, the loop will execute 4 times as `i` ranges from 0 to 3. Since the loop does not depend on the value of `g[y][x]`, we do not need to adjust that. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the state needs to be adjusted to `i` is 0.
State: **g[y][x] is '0', `i` is 0 for the loop to execute**
