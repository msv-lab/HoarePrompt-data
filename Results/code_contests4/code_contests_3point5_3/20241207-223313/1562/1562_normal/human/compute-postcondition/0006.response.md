Example Answer: 
nextx is assigned the value of x + dx[i]. The value of dx[i] is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of nextx. Therefore, the Output State is: g[y][x] is '0', i is 0 for the loop to execute.
Output State: **g[y][x] is '0', i is 0 for the loop to execute**
