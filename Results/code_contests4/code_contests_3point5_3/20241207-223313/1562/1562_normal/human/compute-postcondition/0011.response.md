Example Answer:
The value of `visited[nexty][nextx]` is updated to 1. The previous values of the affected variables are known. Therefore, the Output State is: `g[y][x] is '0', i is 0 for the loop to execute, visited[nexty][nextx] is 1, g[nexty][nextx] is '1'.
Output State: **`g[y][x] is '0', i is 0 for the loop to execute, visited[nexty][nextx] is 1, g[nexty][nextx] is '1'**
