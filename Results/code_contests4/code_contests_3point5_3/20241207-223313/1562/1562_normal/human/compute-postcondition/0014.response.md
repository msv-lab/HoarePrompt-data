According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `visited[nexty][nextx]` and `g[nexty][nextx]`. If `visited[nexty][nextx]` is 0 and `g[nexty][nextx]` is '1', the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `g[y][x]` is '0', `i` is 0, `visited[nexty][nextx]` is 1, `g[nexty][nextx]` is '1'. So, for the loop to be executed one more time, `visited[nexty][nextx]` should be 0 and `g[nexty][nextx]` should be '1'.
State: **`g[y][x]` is '0', `i` is 0, `visited[nexty][nextx]` is 0, `g[nexty][nextx]` is '1'**
