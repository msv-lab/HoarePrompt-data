The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `y` and `x`, representing the number of rows and columns in the plan view, respectively. It returns True if both `y` and `x` are within the range of 0 to 11, otherwise it returns False. The function covers the cases where `y` and `x` are outside the specified range as well, where it should potentially handle those cases.
