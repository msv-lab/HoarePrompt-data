The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function is responsible for processing a series of inputs following the specified constraints. The inputs consist of two positive integers `h` and `w`, followed by `h` lines each containing `w` space-separated integers between 0 and 255. The height `h` is always even. The function processes these inputs and performs a specific task based on the values provided. The function does not return any value explicitly, as it is designed to process the input data according to the given constraints.
