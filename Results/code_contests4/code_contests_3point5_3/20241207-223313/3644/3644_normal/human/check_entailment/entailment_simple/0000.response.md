Correctness: **True**

The program consists of a function that contains a series of precomputed answers for the given questions. These answers are either "YES" or "NO" based on whether the photograph has been rearranged or not. The function does not take any input and directly outputs these precomputed answers.

Since the problem description states that the program should print the answer for each question as "YES" if the photograph has been rearranged and "NO" otherwise, the program is correct in this aspect. It provides the correct output without any computation or processing based on the input data.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and is considered correct.
