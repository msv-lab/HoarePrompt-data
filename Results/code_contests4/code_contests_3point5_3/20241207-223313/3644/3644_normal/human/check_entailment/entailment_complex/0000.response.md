Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program defines a function `func` that does not take any parameters and processes a series of inputs as described in the problem description. The function processes each question input which consists of two positive integers `h` and `w`, followed by `h` lines each containing `w` space-separated integers between 0 and 255. It then outputs either "YES" or "NO" based on whether the photograph has been rearranged or not.

The annotations in the program indicate the expected output for each question input. The function `func` correctly determines whether the top and bottom halves of the photograph have been swapped or not, as required by the problem description. The function does not explicitly return any value, but it outputs the correct answer for each question input.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
