The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It processes a series of inputs consisting of two positive integers `h` and `w`, followed by `h` lines each containing `w` space-separated integers between 0 and 255. The height `h` is always even. The function is designed to handle and process these inputs according to the specified constraints. It does not explicitly return any value, as its main purpose is to process the input data.
