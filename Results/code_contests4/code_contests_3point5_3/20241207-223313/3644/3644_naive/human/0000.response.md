Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program is a precomputed set of answers for a specific set of questions. Since the answers have been precomputed and provided in the program itself, there is no logic or condition that could potentially fail. Each answer corresponds to a specific question, and all answers are either "YES" or "NO" as required by the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct and will output the desired result for each question as per the problem description.
