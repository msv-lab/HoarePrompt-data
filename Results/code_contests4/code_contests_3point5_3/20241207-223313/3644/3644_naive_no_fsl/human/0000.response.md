Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program provided correctly follows the problem description. It takes in a series of questions, processes the input images, and determines whether the top and bottom halves of the photograph have been swapped or not. The program outputs "YES" if the photograph has been rearranged and "NO" otherwise, as required. The logic seems sound and there are no obvious cases where the program would not work as expected.
