Example Answer:
The count of the next character in the list `c` at the index represented by the integer value of `j` is incremented by 1. The value of `j` is not provided in the initial state, so the exact index is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 5, the table of panels is represented as a 4x4 grid, `n` has at least 1 character, `i` is 5, list `c` is updated with the count of the next character.
Output State: **`k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 5, the table of panels is represented as a 4x4 grid, `n` has at least 1 character, `i` is 5, list `c` is updated with the count of the next character**
