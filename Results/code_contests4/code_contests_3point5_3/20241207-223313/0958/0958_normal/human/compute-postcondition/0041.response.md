Functionality: ** The function `func` reads user input and populates a list `c` with the count of each digit from 1 to 9 in the input. It then prints either 'NO' or 'YES' based on whether the maximum count of any digit is less than or equal to twice the user input `n`. The function does not accept any parameters and operates on a 4x4 grid of panels, each cell containing a digit or a period. **
