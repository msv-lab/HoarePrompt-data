According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the list obtained from raw_input() is not empty. Since n is the user input with at least 3 characters, that condition is satisfied. Additionally, `i` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute another time, so `i` should be adjusted to 1. However, the initial state does not specify the size of the list obtained from raw_input(), so we cannot make any assumptions about `j`. 
State: **k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 5, the table of panels is represented as a 4x4 grid, n is the user input with at least 3 characters, `i` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time**
