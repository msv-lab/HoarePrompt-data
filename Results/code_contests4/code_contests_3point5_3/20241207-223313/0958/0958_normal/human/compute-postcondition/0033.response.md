Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 5, the table of panels is represented as a 4x4 grid, `n` has at least 1 character, `i` is 5, list `c` is updated with the next character count. If `j` is not equal to '.', then the program updates the list `c` with the count of the next character input. Otherwise, there is no change in the program state.***
