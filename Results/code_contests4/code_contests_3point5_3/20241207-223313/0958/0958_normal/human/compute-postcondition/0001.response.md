Example Answer:
`c` is initialized as a list of 10 zeros. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 5. The table of panels is represented as a 4x4 grid with each cell containing either a digit from 1 to 9 or a period; n is the user input. c is a list of 10 zeros.
Output State: **k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 5. The table of panels is represented as a 4x4 grid with each cell containing either a digit from 1 to 9 or a period; n is the user input. c is a list of 10 zeros.**
