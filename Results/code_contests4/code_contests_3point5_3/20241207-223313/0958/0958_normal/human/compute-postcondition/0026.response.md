According to the code, the loop will execute for a total of 4 times, as specified by the `range(4)` statement. At the end of the previous iteration, k is an integer between 1 and 5, the table of panels is a 4x4 grid, n is a user input with at least 3 characters, and i is the total number of characters in the user input. The list `c` contains the count of each non-'.' character in the user input. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- Since the loop is on its last iteration and will execute one more time, the loop counter `i` should be incremented by 1.
- The loop will execute for a total of 4 times, so the loop counter `i` should be incremented to 4.
- No changes need to be made to the table of panels, user input length, or count list for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 5, the table of panels is represented as a 4x4 grid, n is the user input with at least 3 characters, i is 4, the list `c` contains the count of each non-'.' character in the user input.**
