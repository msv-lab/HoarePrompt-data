Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts user input. The value of `k` is not directly affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state is: k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 5. The table of panels is represented as a 4x4 grid with each cell containing either a digit from 1 to 9 or a period; n is the user input.
Output State: **k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 5. The table of panels is represented as a 4x4 grid with each cell containing either a digit from 1 to 9 or a period; n is the user input.**
