According to the code, for the loop to execute again, the variable `i` must be less than 4. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than 4. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and the table of panels should remain the same, k should remain an integer such that 1 <= k <= 5, and n should still have at least 3 characters.
State: **k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 5, the table of panels is represented as a 4x4 grid, n is the user input with at least 3 characters, `i` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute another time**
