According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the user input `n`. If there are more characters in the input, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 5, the table of panels is represented as a 4x4 grid, and n is the user input with at least 1 character. 

For the loop to execute one more time, there must be more characters in the input.
State: **k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 5, the table of panels is represented as a 4x4 grid, n is the user input with at least 2 characters**
