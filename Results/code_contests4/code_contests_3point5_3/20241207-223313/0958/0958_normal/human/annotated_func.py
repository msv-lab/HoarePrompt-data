#State of the program right berfore the function call: k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 5. The table of panels is represented as a 4x4 grid with each cell containing either a digit from 1 to 9 or a period.**
def func():
    n = input()
    c = [0] * 10
    for i in range(4):
        for j in list(raw_input()):
            if j != '.':
                c[int(j)] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 5, the table of panels is represented as a 4x4 grid, n is the user input with at least 1 character, i is 5, list c contains the final count of each non-'.' character in the user input
    print['NO', 'YES'][max(c) <= n * 2]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads user input and populates a list `c` with the count of each digit from 1 to 9 in the input. It then prints either 'NO' or 'YES' based on whether the maximum count of any digit is less than or equal to twice the user input `n`. The function does not accept any parameters and operates on a 4x4 grid of panels, each cell containing a digit or a period.
