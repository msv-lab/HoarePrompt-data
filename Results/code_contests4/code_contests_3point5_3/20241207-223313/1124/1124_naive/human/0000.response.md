Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program defines a function `func_1` to calculate the difficulty of a track after removing a hold at a certain index. It then calculates the minimum difficulty by trying all possible combinations of holds to be removed. The logic seems to be correct as it considers all possible scenarios where a hold can be removed and calculates the difficulty accordingly. The program uses the itertools library to generate combinations of indices to remove holds and then calculates the difficulty for each combination. Finally, it returns the minimum difficulty among all combinations. The program seems to correctly implement the problem description and handle all edge cases.
