Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It follows the logic described in the problem statement by creating a new list `temp` based on the indices specified in the input list `c`. It then calculates the maximum difference between adjacent elements in `temp` if both 0 and n - 1 are present in list `c`. If the condition is not met, it returns the default value of 10000000000.

The program handles all possible cases as described in the problem description and returns the correct output accordingly. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
