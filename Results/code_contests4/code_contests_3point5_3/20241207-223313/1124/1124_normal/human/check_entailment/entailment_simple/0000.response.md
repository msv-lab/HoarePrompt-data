Correctness: **False**

The program provided is not correct as it does not solve the problem as described in the problem description. The function `func_1` only returns the maximum difference between any two adjacent elements in the list `temp`, but it does not consider the case of removing one hold to minimize the difficulty of the track.

The program should find the minimum difficulty of the track after removing a single hold, but the function `func_1` does not handle this requirement. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description.
