Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. 

1. The code has duplicate sections for taking input and processing the logic, which is unnecessary and redundant.
2. The function `func_1` is not correctly implemented to determine the minimum difficulty of the track after removing a single hold. It does not accurately calculate the maximum difference of heights between adjacent holds after removing the hold.

Therefore, the code is incorrect based on the above observations.
