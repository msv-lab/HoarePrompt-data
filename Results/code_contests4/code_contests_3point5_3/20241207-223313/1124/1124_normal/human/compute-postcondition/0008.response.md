Example Answer:
`awk` is assigned the value -1. The values of `temp`, `lst`, and `c` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` contains all the values from list `lst` at the indices specified in list `c`; `awk` is -1.
Output State: **`temp` contains all the values from list `lst` at the indices specified in list `c`; `awk` is -1**
