According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `c`. If `c` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `temp` being an empty list `[]` does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `c` is not empty and `i` is the first element in `c`.
State: **`temp` is an empty list `[]`, for the loop to execute the first time `c` is not empty, `i` is the first element in `c`**
