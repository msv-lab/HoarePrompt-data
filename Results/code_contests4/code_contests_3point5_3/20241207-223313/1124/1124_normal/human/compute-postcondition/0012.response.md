According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `temp`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` reaches len(temp) - 1. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to len(temp) and the `awk` value should also be updated. Since `awk` is updated to the maximum value between `awk` and `temp[i] - temp[i - 1]`, the new `awk` value needs to be calculated based on the updated `temp` values. Additionally, if -1, 0, and n-1 are present in list `c`, then the list `c` must contain at least 3 elements for the loop to execute another time.
State: **`temp` contains all the values from list `lst` at the indices specified in list `c`; `awk` is updated to the maximum value between `awk` and `temp[i] - temp[i - 1]`; `awk`, -1, 0, and n-1 are present in list `c`; `i` is len(temp), `i` goes up to len(temp) for the loop to execute another time**
