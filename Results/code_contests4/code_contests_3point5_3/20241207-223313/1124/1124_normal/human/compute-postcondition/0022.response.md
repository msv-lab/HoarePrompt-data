The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a list `lst` and a list `c`. 

Case 1: The function returns 10000000000.

Case 2: The function returns the maximum difference between any two adjacent elements in the list `lst` if both 0 and n - 1 are present in list `c`. If 0 and n - 1 are not both present in list `c`, the function returns -1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and a list `c`, and based on the conditions specified in the output cases, return either 10000000000 or the maximum difference between adjacent elements in `lst` if the conditions are met.
