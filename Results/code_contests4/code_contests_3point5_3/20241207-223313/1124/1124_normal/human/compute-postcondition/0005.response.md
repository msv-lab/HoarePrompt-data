According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `c`. If `i` is less than the length of `c`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `temp` contains the appended value from `lst`, `i` is in its previous state, and the loop continues as long as `i` is less than the length of `c`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `temp` should still contain the appended value from `lst`, `i` should be increased by 1, and the loop should continue as long as `i` is less than the length of `c`.
State: **`temp` contains the appended value from `lst`, `i` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute again `i` must be less than the length of `c`**
