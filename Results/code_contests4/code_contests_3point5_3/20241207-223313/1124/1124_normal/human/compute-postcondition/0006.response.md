Example Answer:
`temp` contains the appended value from `lst`, and `i` is increased by 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than the length of `c`. After execution, a value from `lst` is appended to `temp`, and `i` is incremented. 
Output State: **`temp` contains the appended value from `lst`, `i` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute again `i` must be less than the length of `c`**
