According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `c`. If `i` is less than the length of `c`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `temp` contains the value at index `i` from list `lst`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **`temp` contains the value at index `i+1` from list `lst`, for the loop to execute another time `i` must be less than the length of `c`**
