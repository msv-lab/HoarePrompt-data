Example Answer:
`awk` is updated to the maximum value between `awk` and `temp[i] - temp[i - 1]`. Since `i` starts at 0, `temp[i - 1]` is undefined. The loop runs from 0 to len(temp) - 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` contains all the values from list `lst` at the indices specified in list `c`; `awk` is updated to the maximum value between `awk` and `temp[i] - temp[i - 1]`, `awk` is -1, 0 and n-1 are present in list `c`, `i` starts at 0, `i` goes up to len(temp) - 1 for the loop to execute.
Output State: **`temp` contains all the values from list `lst` at the indices specified in list `c`; `awk` is updated to the maximum value between `awk` and `temp[i] - temp[i - 1]`, `awk` is -1, 0 and n-1 are present in list `c`, `i` starts at 0, `i` goes up to len(temp) - 1 for the loop to execute**
