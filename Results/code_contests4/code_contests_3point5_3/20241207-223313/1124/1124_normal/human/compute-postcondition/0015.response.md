Example Answer:
The value of `awk` is updated to the maximum value between the current value of `awk` and the difference between the current element `temp[i]` and the previous element `temp[i - 1]`. Since `awk` is already set to the maximum value, it remains the same. The list `c` still contains -1, 0, and n-1 as specified. The value of `i` is updated to len(temp) + 1 for the loop to execute another time.
Output State: **`temp` contains all the values from list `lst` at the indices specified in list `c`; `awk` is updated to the maximum value between `awk` and `temp[i] - temp[i - 1]`; `awk`, -1, 0, and n-1 are present in list `c`; `i` is len(temp) + 1 for the loop to execute another time**
