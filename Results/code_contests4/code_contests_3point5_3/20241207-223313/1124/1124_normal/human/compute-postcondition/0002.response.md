Example Answer:
The value at index `i` in list `lst` is appended to the list `temp`. The initial state of `temp` being an empty list `[]`, and `i` being the first element in list `c`, the value at index `i` in list `lst` is appended to `temp`. 
Output State: **`temp` contains the value at index `i` from list `lst`**
