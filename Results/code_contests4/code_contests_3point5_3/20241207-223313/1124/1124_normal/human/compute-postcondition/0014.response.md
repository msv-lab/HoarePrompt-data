According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the length of the list `temp`. If `i` is less than the length of `temp`, the loop can execute another time. 

At the end of the last iteration, `temp` contains all the values from list `lst` at the indices specified in list `c`; `awk` is updated to the maximum value between `awk` and `temp[i] - temp[i - 1]`; `awk`, -1, 0, and n-1 are present in list `c`; `i` is len(temp). 

For the loop to execute another time, `i` needs to be less than the length of `temp` after being incremented by 1.
State: **`temp` contains all the values from list `lst` at the indices specified in list `c`; `awk` is updated to the maximum value between `awk` and `temp[i] - temp[i - 1]`; `awk`, -1, 0, and n-1 are present in list `c`; `i` is len(temp) + 1 for the loop to execute another time**
