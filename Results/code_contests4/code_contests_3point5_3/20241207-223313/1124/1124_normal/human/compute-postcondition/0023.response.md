Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes two parameters, a list `lst` and a list `c`. It then creates a new list `temp` containing elements from `lst` based on the indices specified in `c`. 

- If both 0 and n - 1 are present in list `c`, the function calculates the maximum difference between any two adjacent elements in `temp` and returns that value.
- If 0 and n - 1 are not both present in list `c`, the function returns -1.
- In the case where the condition for calculating the maximum difference is not met, the function returns a default value of 10000000000.

Overall, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to process the list `lst` based on the indices provided in list `c` and return either the maximum difference between adjacent elements or specific default values depending on the conditions met. **
