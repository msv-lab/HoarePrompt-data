According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `temp` has at least one element. The loop will iterate through the elements in `temp`. Since the loop is iterating through the length of `temp`, `i` will start from 0 and go up to len(temp) - 1. 

Before the loop starts, `temp` containing all the values from list `lst` at the indices specified in list `c` ensures that the loop can execute. Additionally, since 0 and n-1 are present in list `c`, it indicates that the loop will iterate through all the elements in `temp` starting from the first element.

State: **`temp` contains all the values from list `lst` at the indices specified in list `c`; `awk` is -1, 0 and n-1 are present in list `c`, `i` starts at 0, `i` goes up to len(temp) - 1 for the loop to execute**
