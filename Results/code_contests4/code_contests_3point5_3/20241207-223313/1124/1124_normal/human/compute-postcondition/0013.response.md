Example Answer:
`awk` is updated to the maximum value between `awk` and `temp[i] - temp[i - 1]`. The initial state specifies that `awk` is updated to the maximum value between `awk` and `temp[i] - temp[i - 1]`, where `temp` contains all the values from list `lst` at the indices specified in list `c`; `awk` is updated to the maximum value between `awk` and `temp[i] - temp[i - 1]`; `awk`, -1, 0, and n-1 are present in list `c`; `i` is len(temp), and `i` goes up to len(temp) for the loop to execute another time. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` contains all the values from list `lst` at the indices specified in list `c`; `awk` is updated to the maximum value between `awk` and `temp[i] - temp[i - 1]`; `awk`, -1, 0, and n-1 are present in list `c`; `i` is len(temp), `i` goes up to len(temp) for the loop to execute another time.
Output State: **`temp` contains all the values from list `lst` at the indices specified in list `c`; `awk` is updated to the maximum value between `awk` and `temp[i] - temp[i - 1]`; `awk`, -1, 0, and n-1 are present in list `c`; `i` is len(temp), `i` goes up to len(temp) for the loop to execute another time**
