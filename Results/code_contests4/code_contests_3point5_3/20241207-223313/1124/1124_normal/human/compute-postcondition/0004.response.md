Example Answer:
`temp` is appended with the value at index `i+1` from list `lst`, and for the loop to execute another time, `i` must be less than the length of `c`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` contains the appended value from `lst`, `i` is in its previous state, and the loop continues as long as `i` is less than the length of `c`.
Output State: **`temp` contains the appended value from `lst`, `i` is in its previous state, and the loop continues as long as `i` is less than the length of `c`**
