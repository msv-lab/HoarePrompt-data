#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_1(lst, c):
    temp = []
    for i in c:
        temp.append(lst[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `temp` contains all the values from list `lst` at the indices specified in list `c`
    awk = -1
    if (0 in c and n - 1 in c) :
        for i in range(len(temp)):
            awk = max(awk, temp[i] - temp[i - 1])
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: The final value of `awk` will be the maximum difference between any two adjacent elements in `temp`
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`temp` contains all the values from list `lst` at the indices specified in list `c`; `awk` is the maximum difference between any two adjacent elements in `temp` if 0 and n - 1 are present in list `c`. Otherwise, `awk` remains -1.
    if (awk == -1) :
        return 10000000000
        #The program returns 10000000000
    else :
        return awk
        #The program returns the maximum difference between any two adjacent elements in 'temp' if 0 and n - 1 are present in list 'c', otherwise it returns -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two parameters, a list `lst` and a list `c`. It then creates a new list `temp` containing elements from `lst` based on the indices specified in `c`. 

- If both 0 and n - 1 are present in list `c`, the function calculates the maximum difference between any two adjacent elements in `temp` and returns that value.
- If 0 and n - 1 are not both present in list `c`, the function returns -1.
- In the case where the condition for calculating the maximum difference is not met, the function returns a default value of 10000000000.

Overall, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to process the list `lst` based on the indices provided in list `c` and return either the maximum difference between adjacent elements or specific default values depending on the conditions met.
