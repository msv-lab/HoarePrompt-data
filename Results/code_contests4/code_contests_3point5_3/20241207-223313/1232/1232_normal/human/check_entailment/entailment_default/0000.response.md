Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The main issue lies in the calculation of the minimum number of bullets required to kill all monsters. The code does not handle the case where an explosion triggers another explosion, potentially leading to additional damage to monsters. This is a crucial aspect of the problem description that the code fails to address. The code needs to be modified to correctly account for the cascading effect of explosions when a monster dies.
