You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those output hints describes certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```

Output hints: The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation:The code originally looks correct. The function hints agree with the code and with their help we determine that the code indeed follows the problem description. the function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints: The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The code seems to be incorrect and not follow the problem description. We also see that the output hints agree with the code and they also help prove that the code is incorrect.  The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Output hints: The function returns the index of the target number in the input list `arr` if it is present; otherwise, it returns -1. If the taget is at the last index it wont be found as the loop will break before reaching the last index.

Example answer 3:
Explanation: Originnaly the code looks correct but after confirming that the output hints agree with the code,we can see the function returns the index of the target number in the input list `arr` if it is present; otherwise, it returns -1. The function uses a binary search algorithm to find the target number in the list. However, the termination condition of the while loop is `left < right`, which may cause the loop to terminate prematurely when `left` is equal to `right`. This condition can lead to missing the target element if it is at the last index of the list. Also when left and right are adjacent then mid will always be left leading to infinate loop.
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are playing another computer game, and now you have to slay n monsters. These monsters are standing in a circle, numbered clockwise from 1 to n. Initially, the i-th monster has a_i health.

You may shoot the monsters to kill them. Each shot requires exactly one bullet and decreases the health of the targeted monster by 1 (deals 1 damage to it). Furthermore, when the health of some monster i becomes 0 or less than 0, it dies and explodes, dealing b_i damage to the next monster (monster i + 1, if i < n, or monster 1, if i = n). If the next monster is already dead, then nothing happens. If the explosion kills the next monster, it explodes too, damaging the monster after it and possibly triggering another explosion, and so on.

You have to calculate the minimum number of bullets you have to fire to kill all n monsters in the circle.

Input

The first line contains one integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 150000) — the number of test cases.

Then the test cases follow, each test case begins with a line containing one integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 300000) — the number of monsters. Then n lines follow, each containing two integers a_i and b_i (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^{12}) — the parameters of the i-th monster in the circle.

It is guaranteed that the total number of monsters in all test cases does not exceed 300000.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of bullets you have to fire to kill all of the monsters.

Program:

from sys import maxint, stdin, stdout
import os
from io import BytesIO

stdin = BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size))
stdout = BytesIO()
res = []
inp = stdin.readlines()
T = int(inp[0])
_i = 1
for t in range(T):
    N = int(inp[_i])
    _i += 1
    monsters = []
    mnShots = 0
    start = maxint
    for n in range(N):
        cur = map(int, inp[_i].split())
        _i += 1
        monsters.append(cur)
        if n > 0:
            dam = max(0, cur[0] - monsters[n - 1][1])
            mnShots += dam
            start = min(start, cur[0] - dam)
    dam = max(0, monsters[0][0] - monsters[-1][1])
    mnShots += dam
    start = min(start, monsters[0][0] - dam)
    res.append(mnShots + start)
os.write(1, '\n'.join((str(x) for x in res)))
```
Output hints: The function reads input from standard input, processes the data to calculate certain values related to monsters, and then writes the results to standard output. It iterates through a loop for a specified number of test cases, calculates values based on the input data, and appends the results to a list. Finally, it writes the calculated results to standard output. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.

First I want you to try to see if the code does what the description says. Look at only the code and the description and make an initial assesment.Try to think of any edge cases that the code might not be handling. The code must exactly follow the problem description for all cases to be correct.

Then I want you to see if the output hints agree with the code. Sometimes the output hints hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the output hints says are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to make a more informed decision and detrmine if the code is correct or not.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
