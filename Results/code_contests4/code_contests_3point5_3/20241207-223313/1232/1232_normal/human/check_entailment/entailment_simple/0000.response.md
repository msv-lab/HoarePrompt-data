Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly calculates the minimum number of bullets required to kill all monsters in the circle based on the given parameters of each monster. It iterates through each test case, calculates the damage dealt by each monster to the next one, and keeps track of the minimum number of shots required to kill all monsters. The program considers all edge cases, such as when a monster dies and explodes, potentially triggering a chain reaction of explosions.

The program follows the problem description accurately for all possible test cases and provides the correct output.
