Example Answer: 
`start` is assigned the minimum value between its current value and the result of `cur[0] - dam`. The value of `cur[0] - dam` depends on the values of `cur` and `dam`, which are specified. Therefore, the output state is: `_i` is 1, `monsters` contains `cur`, `mnShots` is the sum of its previous value and `dam`, `start` is assigned the minimum value between its previous value and `cur[0] - dam`, `N` is greater than 0, `cur` is assigned the mapped integer values of `inp[1]`, `n` is greater than 0, `dam` is the maximum value between 0 and the difference of the first element of `cur` and the second element of the last monster in the list `monsters`.
Output State: **`_i` is 1, `monsters` contains `cur`, `mnShots` is the sum of its previous value and `dam`, `start` is assigned the minimum value between its previous value and `cur[0] - dam`, `N` is greater than 0, `cur` is assigned the mapped integer values of `inp[1]`, `n` is greater than 0, `dam` is the maximum value between 0 and the difference of the first element of `cur` and the second element of the last monster in the list `monsters`**
