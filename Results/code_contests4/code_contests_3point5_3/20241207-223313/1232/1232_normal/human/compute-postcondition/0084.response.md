According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `N`. If `N` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `_i` is increased by 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `_i` is now 0, `monsters` is an empty list, `mnShots` is 0, and `start` is assigned the value of `maxint`.
State: **`_i` is 0, `monsters` is an empty list, `mnShots` is 0, `start` is assigned the value of `maxint`, for the loop to execute the first time `N` is greater than 0**
