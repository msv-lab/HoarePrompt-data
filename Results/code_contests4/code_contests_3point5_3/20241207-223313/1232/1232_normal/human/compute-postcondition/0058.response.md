Example Answer:
The `cur` variable is assigned the result of mapping the `int` function to each element of the list obtained by splitting `inp[_i]`. The previous values of the affected variables are not provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `stdin`, `stdout`, `res`, `inp`, `T`, `_i`, `t`, `N`, `monsters`, `mnShots`, `start`, `n` is incremented by 1, `cur`, `dam` are as described in the precondition, if `n > 0`, `dam` is calculated as `max(0, cur[0] - monsters[n - 1][1]`, `mnShots` is incremented by `dam`, and `start` is updated accordingly, `cur` is assigned the mapped integers from `inp[_i]`.
Output State: **`stdin`, `stdout`, `res`, `inp`, `T`, `_i`, `t`, `N`, `monsters`, `mnShots`, `start`, `n` is incremented by 1, `cur`, `dam` are as described in the precondition, if `n > 0`, `dam` is calculated as `max(0, cur[0] - monsters[n - 1][1]`, `mnShots` is incremented by `dam`, and `start` is updated accordingly, `cur` is assigned the mapped integers from `inp[_i]`**
