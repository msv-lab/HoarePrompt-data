Example Answer:
`start` is assigned the minimum value between its previous value and `cur[0] - dam`. The previous values of `start`, `cur`, and `dam` are not provided, so the output state is: `_i` is increased by 1; `monsters` contains `cur` with an additional element; `mnShots` is the sum of its previous value and `dam`; `start` is assigned the minimum value between its previous value and `cur[0] - dam`; `N` is greater than 0; `cur` is assigned the mapped integer values of `inp[1]`; `n` is greater than 2; `dam` is the maximum value between 0 and the difference of the first element of `cur` and the second element of the last monster in the list `monsters`. The list `monsters` now has an additional element `cur` appended to it; `mnShots` is increased by `dam`.
Output State: **`_i` is increased by 1; `monsters` contains `cur` with an additional element; `mnShots` is the sum of its previous value and `dam`; `start` is assigned the minimum value between its previous value and `cur[0] - dam`; `N` is greater than 0; `cur` is assigned the mapped integer values of `inp[1]`; `n` is greater than 2; `dam` is the maximum value between 0 and the difference of the first element of `cur` and the second element of the last monster in the list `monsters`. The list `monsters` now has an additional element `cur` appended to it; `mnShots` is increased by `dam`**
