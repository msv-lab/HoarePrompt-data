Example Answer:
The value of `start` is updated to the minimum value between the current `start` and the difference between the first element of `cur` and `dam`. The previous value of `start` is unknown, so the output state is: variable `mnShots` is incremented by an unknown value, `start` is updated to the minimum value between the current `start` and the difference between the first element of `cur` and `dam`.
Output State: **variable `mnShots` is incremented by an unknown value, `start` is updated to the minimum value between the current `start` and the difference between the first element of `cur` and `dam`**
