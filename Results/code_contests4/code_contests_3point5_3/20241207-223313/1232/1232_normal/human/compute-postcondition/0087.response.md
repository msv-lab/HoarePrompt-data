Example Answer:
`cur` is appended to the `monsters` list. The value of `cur` is assigned the mapped integer values of `inp[1]`, which means `cur` is added to the `monsters` list. Other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `_i` is 1, `monsters` contains `cur`, `mnShots` is 0, `start` is assigned the value of `maxint`, `N` is greater than 0, `cur` is assigned the mapped integer values of `inp[1]`.
Output State: **`_i` is 1, `monsters` contains `cur`, `mnShots` is 0, `start` is assigned the value of `maxint`, `N` is greater than 0, `cur` is assigned the mapped integer values of `inp[1]`**
