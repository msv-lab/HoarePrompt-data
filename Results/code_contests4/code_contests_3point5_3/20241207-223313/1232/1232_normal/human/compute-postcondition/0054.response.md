Example Answer:
`dam` is the result of the calculation `max(0, cur[0] - monsters[n - 1][1])`. The value of `dam` depends on the values of `cur`, `monsters`, and `n`. After that, `mnShots` is incremented by the value of `dam`. Therefore, the Output State is: `dam` is the result of the calculation `max(0, cur[0] - monsters[n - 1][1])`, `mnShots` is incremented by the value of `dam`.
Output State: **`dam` is the result of the calculation `max(0, cur[0] - monsters[n - 1][1])`, `mnShots` is incremented by the value of `dam`**
