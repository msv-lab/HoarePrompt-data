Postcondition: ***`cur` is updated by mapping the integers from the split elements of `inp[_i]`, `_i` is incremented by 1, `monsters` list now contains the updated `cur`. If `n` > 0, `mnShots` is incremented by the calculated maximum value, and `start` is updated to the new minimum value. Otherwise, no changes are made to the program state.***
