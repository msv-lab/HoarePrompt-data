Example Answer:
`cur` is assigned the result of mapping integers to the elements of `inp[_i]` after splitting it. The initial values of `_i` is 0, `monsters` is an empty list, `mnShots` is 0, `start` is assigned the value of `maxint`, and `N` is greater than 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `_i` is 0, `monsters` is an empty list, `mnShots` is 0, `start` is assigned the value of `maxint`, `N` is greater than 0, `cur` is assigned the mapped integer values of `inp[_i]`.
Output State: **`_i` is 0, `monsters` is an empty list, `mnShots` is 0, `start` is assigned the value of `maxint`, `N` is greater than 0, `cur` is assigned the mapped integer values of `inp[_i]`**
