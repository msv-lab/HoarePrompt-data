Example Answer:
The list `monsters` is initialized as an empty list. The value of `_i` being increased by 1 does not affect the initialization of the list `monsters`. Therefore, the Output State is: `_i` is increased by 1; `monsters` is an empty list.
Output State: **`_i` is increased by 1; `monsters` is an empty list**
