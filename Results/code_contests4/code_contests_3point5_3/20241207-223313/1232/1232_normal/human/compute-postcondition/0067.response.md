Example Answer:
The value of `_i` is incremented by 1. The value of `cur` is updated by mapping the integers from the split elements of `inp[_i]`. Other variables remain the same.
Output State: **`cur` is updated by mapping the integers from the split elements of `inp[_i]`, `_i` is incremented by 1**
