Postcondition: ***`stdin`, `stdout`, `res`, `inp`, `T`, `_i`, `t`, `N`, `monsters`, `mnShots`, `start`, `n`, `cur`, `dam` are all as described in the precondition. If `n > 0`, `dam` is calculated as `max(0, cur[0] - monsters[n - 1][1]`, `mnShots` is incremented by `dam`, and `start` is updated accordingly.***
