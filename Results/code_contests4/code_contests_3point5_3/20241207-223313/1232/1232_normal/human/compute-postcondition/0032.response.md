Example Answer:
The value stored in variable `cur` is appended to the list `monsters`. The value of variable `_i` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `_i` is increased by 1, `monsters` list contains the value of `cur`.
Output State: **variable `_i` is increased by 1, `monsters` list contains the value of `cur`**
