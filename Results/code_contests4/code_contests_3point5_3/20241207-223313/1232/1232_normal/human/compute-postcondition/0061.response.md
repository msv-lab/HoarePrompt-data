Example Answer:
`dam` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and the difference between the first element of the list `cur` and the second element of the last element in the list `monsters`. If `cur` contains [3, 2] and `monsters` contains [[1, 1], [2, 3], [3, 4]], then `dam` would be 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `stdin`, `stdout`, `res`, `inp`, `T`, `_i` is incremented by 1, `t`, `N`, `monsters` contains the updated values, `mnShots`, `start`, `n`, `cur` are updated according to the described precondition, `dam` is calculated as described.
