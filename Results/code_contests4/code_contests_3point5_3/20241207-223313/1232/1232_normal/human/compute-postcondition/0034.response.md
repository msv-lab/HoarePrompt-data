Example Answer:
`mnShots` is increased by the value of `dam`. The previous values of `_i`, `monsters`, `cur`, and `dam` are unknown, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `mnShots`. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `_i` is increased by 1, `monsters` list contains the value of `cur`, and `dam` is calculated based on the given formula.
Output State: **variable `_i` is increased by 1, `monsters` list contains the value of `cur`, `dam` is calculated based on the given formula**
