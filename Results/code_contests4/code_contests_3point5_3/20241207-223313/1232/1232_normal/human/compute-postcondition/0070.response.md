Example Answer:
`mnShots` is incremented by the value of `dam`. The previous value of `mnShots` is unknown, and `dam` is the calculated maximum value. Therefore, the Output State is: `cur` is updated by mapping the integers from the split elements of `inp[_i]`, `_i` is incremented by 1, `monsters` list now contains the updated `cur`, `mnShots` is incremented by the calculated maximum value.
Output State: **`cur` is updated by mapping the integers from the split elements of `inp[_i]`, `_i` is incremented by 1, `monsters` list now contains the updated `cur`, `mnShots` is incremented by the calculated maximum value**
