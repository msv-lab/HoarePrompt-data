Example Answer:
`dam` is calculated as the maximum of 0 and the result of `cur[0] - monsters[n - 1][1]`. Then, `mnShots` is incremented by the value of `dam`. 
After that, `start` is updated to be the minimum value between `start` and `cur[0] - dam`. 
The previous values of the variables are not mentioned, so the Output State is: `dam` is the result of the calculation `max(0, cur[0] - monsters[n - 1][1]`, `mnShots` is incremented by the value of `dam`, `start` is updated accordingly.
Output State: **`dam` is the result of the calculation `max(0, cur[0] - monsters[n - 1][1]`, `mnShots` is incremented by the value of `dam`, `start` is updated accordingly**
