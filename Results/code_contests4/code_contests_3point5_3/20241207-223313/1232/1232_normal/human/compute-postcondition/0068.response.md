Example Answer:
`cur` is updated by mapping the integers from the split elements of `inp[_i]`, and `_i` is incremented by 1. The updated `cur` is then appended to the `monsters` list. Therefore, the Output State is: `cur` is updated by mapping the integers from the split elements of `inp[_i]`, `_i` is incremented by 1, `monsters` list now contains the updated `cur`.
Output State: **`cur` is updated by mapping the integers from the split elements of `inp[_i]`, `_i` is incremented by 1, `monsters` list now contains the updated `cur`**
