Example Answer:
The variable `_i` is assigned the value 1. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `stdin` is assigned the input read from standard input; `stdout` is a BytesIO object, `res` is an empty list, `inp` is a list containing the lines read from standard input, `T` is assigned the integer value of the first element in the list `inp`; `_i` is 1.
Output State: **`stdin` is assigned the input read from standard input; `stdout` is a BytesIO object, `res` is an empty list, `inp` is a list containing the lines read from standard input, `T` is assigned the integer value of the first element in the list `inp`; `_i` is 1**
