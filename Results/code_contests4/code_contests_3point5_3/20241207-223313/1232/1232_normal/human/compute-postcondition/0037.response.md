Output State: `stdin` is assigned the input read from standard input, `stdout` is a BytesIO object, `res` is an empty list, `inp` is a list containing the lines read from standard input, `T` is greater than 0, `_i` is incremented by the total number of elements in `inp`, `t` is the total number of elements in `inp`, `N` is assigned the last integer value in the list `inp`, `monsters` contains the maps of integers extracted from the split elements of `inp`, `mnShots` is the sum of all `dam` values calculated, `start` is assigned the minimum value between all the `cur[0] - dam` results, `n` is equal to `N - 1`, `cur` is a map object with integer values extracted from the split elements of the last element of `inp`, `dam` is the result of the calculation described above after all iterations of the loop.
