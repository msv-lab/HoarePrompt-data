Example Answer:
`mnShots` is incremented by the result of the calculation described above. The value of `dam` is the result of the calculation `max(0, cur[0] - monsters[n - 1][1])`. If `n` is greater than 0, `mnShots` is further incremented by the result of the calculation, and `start` is updated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `stdin` is assigned the input read from standard input, `stdout` is a BytesIO object, `res` is an empty list, `inp` is a list containing the lines read from standard input, `T` is greater than 0, `_i` is incremented by 1, `t` is 0, `N` is assigned the integer value of the element at index `_i` in the list `inp`, `monsters` contains the updated `cur` map object, `mnShots` is incremented by the result of the calculation described above, `start` is assigned the minimum value between the current value of `start` and the result of `cur[0] - dam`, `n` is 1, `cur` is a map object with integer values extracted from the split elements of `inp[_i]`, `dam` is the result of the calculation `max(0, cur[0] - monsters[n - 1][1])`, if `n` is greater than 0, `mnShots` is incremented by the result of the calculation, and `start` is updated accordingly, `cur` is a map object with integer values extracted from the split elements of `inp[_i]`, `_i` is incremented by 1.
