Example Answer:
The value of `mnShots` is added to `start`, and the result is appended to the list `res`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `mnShots` is updated with the total sum of damage calculated throughout the loop, `start` is updated based on the described operation, and the result of `mnShots + start` is appended to the list `res`.
Output State: **`mnShots` is updated with the total sum of damage calculated throughout the loop, `start` is updated based on the described operation, and the result of `mnShots + start` is appended to the list `res`**
