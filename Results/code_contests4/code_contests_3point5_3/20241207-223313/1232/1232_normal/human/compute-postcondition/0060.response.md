Example Answer:
The current value of `cur` is added to the `monsters` list. After execution, the `monsters` list will have the updated values. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `stdin`, `stdout`, `res`, `inp`, `T`, `_i` is incremented by 1, `t`, `N`, `monsters` contains the updated values, `mnShots`, `start`, `n`, `cur`, `dam` are updated according to the described precondition.
Output State: **`stdin`, `stdout`, `res`, `inp`, `T`, `_i` is incremented by 1, `t`, `N`, `monsters` contains the updated values, `mnShots`, `start`, `n`, `cur`, `dam` are updated according to the described precondition**
