Correctness: **False**

The given program does not seem to be correct based on the problem description. The logic implemented in the program does not account for the scenario where an explosion kills multiple monsters in a chain reaction. This can lead to incorrect calculations of the minimum number of bullets required to kill all monsters.

For example, consider a scenario where there are 3 monsters with the following parameters:
- Monster 1: Health (a1) = 4, Damage (b1) = 5
- Monster 2: Health (a2) = 5, Damage (b2) = 6
- Monster 3: Health (a3) = 6, Damage (b3) = 4

In this case, the correct minimum number of bullets required should be 8. However, the program may not calculate this correctly due to the chain reaction of explosions when a monster dies.

Therefore, the program needs to be revised to handle such chain reactions and calculate the minimum number of bullets accurately.
