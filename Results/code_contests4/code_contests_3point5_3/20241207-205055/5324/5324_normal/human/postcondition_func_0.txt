The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, both being integers. It repeatedly swaps the values of `x` and `y` until `y` becomes 0. Finally, it returns the final value of `x` after the swapping process. This function effectively calculates the greatest common divisor of the two input integers `x` and `y`.
