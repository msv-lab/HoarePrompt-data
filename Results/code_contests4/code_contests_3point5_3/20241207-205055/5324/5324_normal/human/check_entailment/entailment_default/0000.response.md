Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program reads an integer `n` representing the number of tiers in each cake.
- It then reads `2n` integers representing the sizes of the tiers that can be bought in each house.
- The program then sorts the tiers along with their indices.
- It calculates the total distance by summing the absolute differences between consecutive positions in the sorted list.
- Finally, it prints the total distance as output.

The program correctly calculates the minimum distance that Sasha and Dima will have to walk in total to buy both cakes as per the problem description. The logic implemented in the code aligns with the requirements, and there are no potential cases identified where the program does not work as expected. Hence, the correctness of the program is **True**.
