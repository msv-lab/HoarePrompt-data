Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. It calculates the minimum distance that Sasha and Dima have to walk to buy both cakes by iterating through the list of tiers and summing the absolute differences between consecutive positions. The functions provided in the code also align with the problem requirements of calculating the greatest common divisor and processing the input data. The examples given in the problem description are consistent with the expected output of the program. Therefore, the code is correct.
