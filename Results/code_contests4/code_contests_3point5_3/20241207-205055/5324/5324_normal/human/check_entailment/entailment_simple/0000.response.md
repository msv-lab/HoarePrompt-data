Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It calculates the minimum distance that Sasha and Dima will have to walk to buy both cakes by sorting the tiers in ascending order of their sizes and then calculating the absolute differences between the positions of the tiers they need to buy. The program iterates over the sorted list of tiers twice, once for Sasha and once for Dima, and calculates the total distance correctly.
