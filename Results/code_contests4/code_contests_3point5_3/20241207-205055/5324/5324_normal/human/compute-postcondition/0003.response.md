Example Answer:
`prev` is assigned the value 1. The values of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of tuples containing integers from the input and corresponding numbers from 1 to 2 * n, `dist` is 0, `prev` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of tuples containing integers from the input and corresponding numbers from 1 to 2 * n, `dist` is 0, `prev` is 1**
