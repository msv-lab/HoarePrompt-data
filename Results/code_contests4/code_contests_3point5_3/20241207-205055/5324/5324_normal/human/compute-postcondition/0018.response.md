According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times where `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `a` is a sorted list of tuples containing integers from the input and corresponding numbers from 1 to 2 * n, `dist` is the sum of absolute differences between consecutive positions in the list `a`, `prev` is 1, `pos` is the last position in the list `a`, and `i` is equal to `n-1`. In order for the loop to execute, `i` should be updated to 0 at the beginning of the loop.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of tuples containing integers from the input and corresponding numbers from 1 to 2 * n, `dist` is the sum of absolute differences between consecutive positions in the list `a`, `prev` is 1, `pos` is the last position in the list `a`, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
