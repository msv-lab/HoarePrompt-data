Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of tuples containing integers from the input and corresponding numbers from 1 to 2 * n, `dist` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `pos` and `prev`, `prev` is now equal to the value of `pos`, `pos` is the value of the second element in the tuple at index 2 * 2 + 1 in list `a`, `i` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time, `pos` is now equal to the value of the second element in the tuple at index 2 * 2 + 1 in list `a`**
