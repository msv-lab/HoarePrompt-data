Example Answer:
The code snippet sorts a list of tuples where each tuple consists of an integer from the input and a corresponding number from 1 to 2 * n. The value of `n` is an input integer, so the output state depends on the input values. The list `a` will be sorted based on the integer values from the input. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of tuples containing integers from the input and corresponding numbers from 1 to 2 * n**
