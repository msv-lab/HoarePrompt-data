According to the code, for the loop to execute again, the value of `i` must be less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `pos` should be updated to the value of the 1st integer in the 3rd tuple of the list `a`, `prev` should be updated to the value of `pos`, and `dist` should be updated with the absolute difference between the new `pos` and `prev`.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of tuples containing integers from the input and corresponding numbers from 1 to 2 * n, `dist` is the absolute difference between `pos` and `prev`, `prev` is now equal to the value of `pos`, `i` is 2, `pos` is now assigned the value of the 1st integer in the 3rd tuple of the list `a`, `dist` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `pos` and `prev`**.
