Example Answer:
`dist` is assigned the value 0. The other variables `n` and `a` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of tuples containing integers from the input and corresponding numbers from 1 to 2 * n, `dist` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of tuples containing integers from the input and corresponding numbers from 1 to 2 * n, `dist` is 0**
