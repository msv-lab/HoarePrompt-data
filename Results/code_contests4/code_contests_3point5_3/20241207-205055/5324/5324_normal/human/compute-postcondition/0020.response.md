Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of tuples containing integers from the input and corresponding numbers from 1 to 2 * n, `dist` is the sum of absolute differences between consecutive positions in the list `a`, `prev` is 1, `pos` is the value of the second element in the tuple at index 2 * `i` + 1 in list `a`, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, and `dist` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `pos` and `prev`.**
