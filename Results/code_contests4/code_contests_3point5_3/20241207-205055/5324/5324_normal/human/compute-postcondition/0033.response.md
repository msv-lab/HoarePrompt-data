Functionality: **The function `func_2` reads an integer `n` from the user input, then reads `2n` integers and their corresponding indices to form a list of tuples. It calculates the total distance by summing the absolute differences between consecutive positions in the list. Finally, it prints the total distance as output. The function does not accept any parameters and performs the described operations based on the user input.**
