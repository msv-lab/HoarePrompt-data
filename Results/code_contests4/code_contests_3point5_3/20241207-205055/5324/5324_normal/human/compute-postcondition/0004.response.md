According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `dist` is 0 and `prev` is 1 does not affect the loop execution, they can remain unchanged. However, to ensure the loop executes correctly, `i` should start from 0.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of tuples containing integers from the input and corresponding numbers from 1 to 2 * n, `dist` is 0, `prev` is 1, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
