Correctness: **False**

For the given program, the logic implemented does not seem to match the problem description. The calculations in the `func_1` function do not accurately represent the shortest distance between two points on a square. Additionally, the final calculations at the end of the program do not seem to provide the correct result based on the problem description.

Therefore, based on the discrepancy between the implemented logic and the problem description, the correctness of the program is deemed to be false.
