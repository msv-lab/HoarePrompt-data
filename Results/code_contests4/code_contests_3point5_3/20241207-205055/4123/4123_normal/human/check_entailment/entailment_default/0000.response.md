Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` in the code does not accurately cover all the cases mentioned in the problem description. For example, the condition `if y == 0` is missing in the code, which is specified in the problem description. This means that the function does not return the correct value when `y` is equal to 0. Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not handle all the cases specified in the problem description.
