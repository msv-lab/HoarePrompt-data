Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in two parameters `x` and `y` which represent the coordinates of two points on the square. The function then calculates and returns the shortest distance between the two points based on the conditions provided in the problem description.

The program handles all possible cases as described in the problem description:
- If `y` is equal to 0, it returns the value of `x`, which corresponds to the coordinates being on the sides of the square.
- If `x` is equal to `n`, it returns the sum of `y` and `n`, which again corresponds to the coordinates being on the sides of the square.
- If `y` is equal to `n`, it returns the result of `n - x + n + n`, which is the shortest distance between the two points.
- For all other cases, it returns the result of `4n - y`, which is also the correct calculation for the shortest distance.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
