#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the side length of the square, x1, y1, x2, y2 are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x1, y1, x2, y2 <= n.**
def func_1(x, y):
    if (y == 0) :
        return x
        #The program returns the value of 'x' after entering the if condition (y == 0), where y is equal to 0.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is a positive integer representing the side length of the square, x1, y1, x2, y2 are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x1, y1, x2, y2 <= n. (y != 0)
    if (x == n) :
        return y + n
        #The program returns the sum of y (a non-zero non-negative integer) and n (a positive integer representing the side length of the square)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is a positive integer representing the side length of the square, x1, y1, x2, y2 are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x1, y1, x2, y2 <= n. (y != 0). The condition (x != n) is true after not entering the if block.
    if (y == n) :
        return n - x + n + n
        #The program returns n - x + n + n
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is a positive integer representing the side length of the square, x1, y1, x2, y2 are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x1, y1, x2, y2 <= n. (y != 0) and (x != n).
    return n - y + n + n + n
    #The program returns 4n - y
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, where `n` is a positive integer representing the side length of the square. The function returns different values based on the following cases:
- Case 1: If `y` is equal to 0, the function returns the value of `x`.
- Case 2: If `x` is equal to `n`, the function returns the sum of `y` and `n`.
- Case 3: If `y` is equal to `n`, the function returns the result of `n - x + n + n`.
- Case 4: For all other cases, the function returns the result of `4n - y`.
Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to return different values based on the conditions specified in each case.
