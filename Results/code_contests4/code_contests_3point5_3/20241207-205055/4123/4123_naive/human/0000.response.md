Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly calculate the shortest distance between two points on a square as described in the problem statement. The logic in the `func_1` function does not seem to adhere to the rules of moving along the sides of the square to calculate the shortest distance. 

For example, let's consider the input:
```
2 0 0 1 0
```
The expected output should be 1, but the program outputs:
```
3
```
This discrepancy indicates that the program is not correctly calculating the shortest distance between the points on the square.
