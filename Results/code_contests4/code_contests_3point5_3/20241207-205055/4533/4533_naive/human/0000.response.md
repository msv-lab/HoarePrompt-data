Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly calculates the number of floors that need to be added to each house to make it luxurious. It iterates through the list of floors in reverse order, keeping track of the maximum number of floors seen so far. It then calculates the difference between the maximum number of floors and the current house's floors, adding 1 if the result is greater than 0, else adding 0. The program then prints the results in the correct order. 

Based on the problem description, the program handles each house independently and calculates the required number of floors accurately. The logic in the program aligns with the requirements of the problem, and there are no potential cases identified where the program does not work as expected.
