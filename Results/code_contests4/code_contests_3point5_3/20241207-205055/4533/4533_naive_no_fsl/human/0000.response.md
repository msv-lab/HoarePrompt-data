Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the number of floors that need to be added to each house to make it luxurious. It iterates through the list of floors in reverse order, keeping track of the maximum number of floors encountered so far. It then calculates the difference between the current number of floors and the maximum number encountered, or 0 if the difference is negative. This logic ensures that the program correctly identifies the number of floors that need to be added to each house. The program then prints the results in the correct order. 
Overall, the program follows the problem description and provides the correct output for all potential cases.
