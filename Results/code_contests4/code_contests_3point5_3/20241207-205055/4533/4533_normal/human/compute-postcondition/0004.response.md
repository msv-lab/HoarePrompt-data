According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `floors`. If the list `floors` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `m` is 0 and `s` is an empty list do not ensure that the loop will execute, so they need to be adjusted to `floors` is not empty, `h` is the last element in the `floors` list, and `h` is now the last element in the list.
State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of houses in the capital of Berland, `hi` is a list of positive integers where each element represents the number of floors in each house, `m` is 0, `s` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `floors` is not empty, `h` is the last element in the `floors` list**
