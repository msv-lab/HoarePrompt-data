Example Answer:
`m` is assigned the maximum value between the current maximum `m` and the number of floors in the last house `h`. Since `m` is initially 0 and `h` is the number of floors in the last house, the new value of `m` will be the maximum value between 0 and the number of floors in the last house. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of houses in the capital of Berland, `hi` is a list of positive integers representing the number of floors in each house, `m` is the maximum number of floors among all houses, `s` is a list containing the calculated values.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of houses in the capital of Berland, `hi` is a list of positive integers representing the number of floors in each house, `m` is the maximum number of floors among all houses, `s` is a list containing the calculated values**
