Example Answer:
The expression inside the `append` function calculates `m - h + 1`, where `m` is 0 and `h` is the last element in the `floors` list. Since `floors` is not empty and `h` is the last element, `h` is the number of floors in the last house. The value of `m - h + 1` is dependent on the number of floors in the last house. If the result is greater than 0, it is appended to list `s`, otherwise 0 is appended. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of houses in the capital of Berland, `hi` is a list of positive integers representing the number of floors in each house, `m` is 0, `s` is a list containing the calculated values.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of houses in the capital of Berland, `hi` is a list of positive integers representing the number of floors in each house, `m` is 0, `s` is a list containing the calculated values**
