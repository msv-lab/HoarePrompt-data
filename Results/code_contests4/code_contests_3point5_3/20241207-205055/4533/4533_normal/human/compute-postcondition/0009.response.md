Example Answer:
The value of `m` is assigned the maximum value between the current value of `m` and the maximum value in the `hi` list. As `m` represents the maximum number of floors among all houses, the new value of `m` will be the maximum value between the current `m` and the largest value in `hi`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `hi` is a list of positive integers representing the number of floors in each house, `m` is the maximum number of floors among all houses, `s` is a list containing the calculated values, and the loop needs more elements in the `floors` list to iterate through in reverse.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `hi` is a list of positive integers representing the number of floors in each house, `m` is the maximum number of floors among all houses, `s` is a list containing the calculated values, and the loop needs more elements in the `floors` list to iterate through in reverse**
