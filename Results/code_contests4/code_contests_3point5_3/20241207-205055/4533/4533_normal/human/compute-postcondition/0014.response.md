Example Answer:
The code reverses the list `s` and then joins the elements with a space in between. The output is then printed. The variables `n`, `hi`, `m` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `hi` is a list of positive integers representing the number of floors in each house, `m` is the maximum number of floors among all houses, and the reversed and joined list `s` is printed.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `hi` is a list of positive integers representing the number of floors in each house, `m` is the maximum number of floors among all houses, and the reversed and joined list `s` is printed**
