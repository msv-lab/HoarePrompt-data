Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `int(sys.stdin.next())`, where `sys.stdin.next()` reads the input as an integer. The number of houses in the capital of Berland is represented by `n`, which is a positive integer. The initial state of the number of floors in each house is represented by the list `hi` of positive integers. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of houses in the capital of Berland. `hi` is a list of positive integers where each element represents the number of floors in each house.**
