Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the number of floors that need to be added to each house to make it luxurious. It iterates through the list of house floor heights in reverse order, keeping track of the maximum floor height encountered so far. For each house, it calculates the difference between the maximum floor height and the current house's floor height, adding 1 to account for the fact that the house itself is included. If this difference is negative, it is set to 0. This value is then appended to the list `s`. 

After the loop finishes, the list `s` is reversed and joined into a string, which is then printed as the output.

The program correctly follows the problem description by independently calculating the number of floors to be added to each house to make it luxurious, without affecting the other houses.
