Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It reads the input values, calculates the number of floors that need to be added to each house to make it luxurious, and then prints the output as required. The program iterates through the list of floor numbers, keeps track of the maximum floor number seen so far, and calculates the difference between the maximum floor number and the current house's floor number to determine the number of floors needed to make it luxurious. This logic aligns with the problem description, making the program correct.
