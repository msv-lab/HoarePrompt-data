Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly reads the input numbers, sorts them in ascending order, and then calculates the values of a, b, and c by subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value, the second minimum value from the maximum value, and the third minimum value from the maximum value respectively. This logic works correctly for all potential cases as per the problem description.
