Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly reads the four input numbers, sorts them in ascending order, and then calculates the possible values of a, b, and c based on the given equations. Since the program always sorts the input numbers and calculates the values of a, b, and c according to the problem description, it will always produce the correct output regardless of the input values. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
