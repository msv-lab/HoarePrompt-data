Correctness: **True**

The program takes in four positive integers x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4 and sorts them in ascending order. Then, it calculates the values of a, b, and c by subtracting the smallest number from the largest number and printing these values in the required format. This approach will always work because the sum of all three numbers will be the largest number and the other three numbers will be pairwise sums of the three numbers. This program correctly calculates a, b, and c based on the provided problem description.
