Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly solves the problem as described in the problem description. It takes in four positive integers, sorts them, and then calculates the values of a, b, and c by subtracting the minimum number from the maximum number. The program outputs the correct values of a, b, and c in any order, as required by the problem description. The annotations also confirm that the program processes a list of four positive integers within the specified range and prints the differences between the maximum number and the other numbers. Therefore, the program meets all the requirements of the problem description.
