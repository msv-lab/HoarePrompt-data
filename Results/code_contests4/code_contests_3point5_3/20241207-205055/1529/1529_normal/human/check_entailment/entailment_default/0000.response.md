Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly processes the given input of four positive integers and sorts them in ascending order. Then, it calculates the differences between the maximum number (which is the sum of a, b, and c) and the other numbers to deduce the values of a, b, and c. Since the code follows the problem description for all potential cases, and there are no edge cases or missing functionalities mentioned in the output hints, we can conclude that the code is correct.
