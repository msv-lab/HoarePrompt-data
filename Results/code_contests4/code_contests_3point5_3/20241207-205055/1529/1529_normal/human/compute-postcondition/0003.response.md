The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates solely on the positive integers x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, where 2 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9. The function does not return any values explicitly, but its functionality involves some operations or calculations on these input integers x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4. Since there is no specific output mentioned, the function may have side effects or perform some internal computations without returning a value.
