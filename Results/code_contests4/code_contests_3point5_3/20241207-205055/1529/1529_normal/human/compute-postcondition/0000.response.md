Example Answer:
The list `numbers` is assigned the values converted to integers from the input separated by spaces. The variables x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4 are positive integers, so after execution, the list `numbers` contains those integers. Therefore, the Output State is: x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4 are positive integers such that 2 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9; `numbers` is a list containing those integers.
Output State: **x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4 are positive integers such that 2 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9; `numbers` is a list containing those integers**
