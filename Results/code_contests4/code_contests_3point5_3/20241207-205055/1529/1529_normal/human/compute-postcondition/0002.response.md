Example Answer:
The code calculates the differences between the maximum value in the `numbers` list (numbers[3]) and the other elements in the list. Since the list is sorted in ascending order, numbers[3] will be the maximum value and numbers[0] will be the minimum value. Therefore, the differences will be: numbers[3] - numbers[0], numbers[3] - numbers[1], and numbers[3] - numbers[2]. 
Output State: **`numbers` list is sorted in ascending order, the differences between the maximum value and other elements are calculated and printed.**
