Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of soldiers that can be simultaneously positioned on the field without conflicting. The program simply multiplies the dimensions of the field and then divides the result by 2, which does not align with the problem description. 

For example, for the input 3 4, the correct output should be 6 as mentioned in the problem description. However, the program will output 6 / 2 = 3, which is incorrect. 

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, making the correctness False.
