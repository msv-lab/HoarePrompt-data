Correctness: False

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of soldiers that can be simultaneously positioned on the field without conflicting with each other. The program simply multiplies n by m and divides the result by 2, which does not align with the problem description. The correct approach should involve finding a way to position the soldiers such that no two soldiers fall under the curse described by the Fairy Godmother. The program does not implement this logic and therefore does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
