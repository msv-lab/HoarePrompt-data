Correctness: **False**

The program defined above does not solve the problem described in the problem description. The program simply calculates the product of `n` and `m` and divides it by 2, without considering the constraints imposed by the Fairy Godmother's curse. The program does not calculate the maximum number of soldiers that can be placed on the field without conflicting with each other, as required by the problem description.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
