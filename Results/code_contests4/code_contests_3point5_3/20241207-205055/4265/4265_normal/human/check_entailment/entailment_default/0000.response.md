Correctness: **False**

The given code snippet does not correctly implement the problem description. The code is simply calculating the product of `n` and `m` and then dividing it by 2, but this does not align with the curse imposed by the Fairy Godmother. The curse states that if the squared distance between some two soldiers equals 5, then those soldiers will conflict with each other. 

The correct approach to solve this problem involves placing soldiers on the field in a way that no two soldiers are in conflict according to the curse. This can be achieved by placing soldiers on alternate squares of the field (like a chessboard pattern), ensuring that no two soldiers are at a squared distance of 5 from each other.

For example, in the case of 2 x 4 field:
- Soldier at (1, 1) - No conflicts
- Soldier at (1, 3) - No conflicts
- Soldier at (2, 2) - Conflicts with soldier at (1, 1)
- Soldier at (2, 4) - Conflicts with soldier at (1, 3)

Hence, the correct output for the first sample test should be 2, not 4.

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description and is incorrect.
