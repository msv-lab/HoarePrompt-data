Example Answer:
The code calculates the product of `n` and `m`, then divides the result by 2. Since `n` and `m` are positive integers between 1 and 1000, the product of `n` and `m` will also be a positive integer. Therefore, after the calculation, the output state is: `n` and `m` are positive integers between 1 and 1000.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers between 1 and 1000**
