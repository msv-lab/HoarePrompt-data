Example Answer:
`n` and `m` are assigned values by mapping integers from the input split by space. Since the initial state mentions that `n` and `m` are positive integers between 1 and 1000, after execution, the values of `n` and `m` are the positive integers input by the user. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers between 1 and 1000.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers between 1 and 1000**
