Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes two positive integers a and b as input and calculates the minimum positive value x such that the polyline passes through the point (a, b) as described in the problem statement. The program correctly handles the case where a < b and outputs -1. In all other cases, it calculates the value of x as (a + b) / (2 * floor((a + b) / (2 * b))) and outputs the result. The code also uses the math module for floor division which ensures correct calculation. 

After analyzing the program and the problem description, it can be concluded that the program works correctly for all potential cases and inputs as per the given problem statement.
