Example Answer:
`a` and `b` are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input using `split()` and converting them to float using `map(float, ...)`. Since the initial state does not mention any input, the values of `a` and `b` are unknown after execution. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are assigned unknown float values obtained from the input.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are assigned unknown float values obtained from the input**
