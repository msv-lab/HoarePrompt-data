Example Answer: 
The code snippet does not affect the variables `a` and `b` as it only prints -1 and does not involve any variable assignment or calculation. Therefore, the Output State remains the same.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are assigned unknown float values obtained from the input. `a` is less than `b`**
