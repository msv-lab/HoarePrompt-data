Functionality: ** The function `func` reads two float values `a` and `b` from the input, compares them, and if `a` is less than `b`, it prints -1 and exits with code 0. Then, it calculates a mathematical expression involving `a` and `b` and prints the result. The function does not specify any return value. The code does not handle the case where the input values are not valid floats or if the input is not formatted correctly. **
