Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It reads two float values `a` and `b` from the input, compares them, and if `a` is less than `b`, it prints -1 and exits. Otherwise, it calculates a mathematical expression involving `a` and `b` to find the minimum positive value of `x` and prints the result. The program handles the case where `a` and `b` are valid positive integers within the specified range.
