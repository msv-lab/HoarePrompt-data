Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It takes two positive integers `a` and `b` as input, checks if `a` is less than `b`, and if so, it outputs -1. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum positive value of `x` as described in the problem and outputs it. The program uses the formula provided in the problem description to calculate the value of `x` and outputs it with the required precision.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and provides the expected output for the given inputs.
