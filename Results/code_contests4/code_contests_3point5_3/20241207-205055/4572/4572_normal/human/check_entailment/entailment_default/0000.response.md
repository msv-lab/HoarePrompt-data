Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads two float values `a` and `b` from the input.
- It compares the values of `a` and `b`, and if `a` is less than `b`, it prints -1 and exits.
- The mathematical expression used to calculate the result is accurate and follows the problem description.
- The code handles the case where the input values are not valid floats by checking the condition `if a < b` before performing any calculations.
- The code does not explicitly state a return value, but it does print the correct answer based on the problem description for all potential cases.
- The output hints also align with the code's functionality and confirm that the code is following the problem description accurately.
