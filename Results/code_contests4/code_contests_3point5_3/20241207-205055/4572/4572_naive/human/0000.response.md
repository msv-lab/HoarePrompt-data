Correctness: **False**

The given program does not handle the case where a > b correctly. According to the problem description, if a < b, the program should output -1. However, the program is not checking for this condition and will proceed to calculate the result, leading to incorrect output. 

For example, if we input 1 3, the expected output should be -1, but the program will calculate the result without considering the condition a < b, resulting in incorrect output.
