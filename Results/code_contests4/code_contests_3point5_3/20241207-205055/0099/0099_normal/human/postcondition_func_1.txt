The function `func_2` accepts two integer parameters `n` and `r`. If `n` is less than `r`, it returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the division of the factorial of `n` by the factorial of `(n - r)` and returns the result. The function covers the cases where `n` is less than `r` and where `n` is greater than or equal to `r`, providing different outcomes accordingly.
