According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and the length of the `arr`. If `i` is less than the length of `arr`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `tem` is a list containing [0, sum of element at index 0 of arr, updated value at index 1 of tem], `i` is 1. So, for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to become 2.
State: **`tem` is a list containing [0, sum of element at index 0 of arr, updated value at index 1 of tem], `i` is 2**
