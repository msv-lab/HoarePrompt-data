Example Answer:
The `atexit.register` function registers a callback function to be executed when the Python script exits. In this case, a lambda function is registered which writes the contents of `sys.stdout` to the standard output. The standard output is redirected to a `BytesIO` object using `sys.stdout`. Therefore, the Output State is: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n. Each pair of integers l_i and r_i (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ 10^9) represents the period of time when the i-th lamp is turned on. `sys.stdout` is assigned to `BytesIO()`.
