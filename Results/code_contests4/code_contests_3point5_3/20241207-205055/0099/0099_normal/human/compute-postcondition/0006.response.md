Example Answer: 
The value at index 2 of list `tem` is updated with the sum of the value at index 2 of `tem` and the value at index 2 of list `arr`. The initial value at index 2 of `tem` is unknown, but the value at index 2 of `arr` is used for calculation. Therefore, the Output State is: `tem` is a list containing [0, sum of element at index 0 of arr, updated value at index 1 of tem, new computed value].
Output State: **`tem` is a list containing [0, sum of element at index 0 of arr, updated value at index 1 of tem, new computed value]**
