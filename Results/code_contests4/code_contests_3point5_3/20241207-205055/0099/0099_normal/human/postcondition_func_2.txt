The function accepts a list `arr` and returns a new list `tem` where each element is the accumulated sum of elements in `arr`. The function initializes `tem` with [0] and iterates over the elements in `arr` to calculate the cumulative sum. The returned list `tem` contains the cumulative sum of elements in `arr`.
