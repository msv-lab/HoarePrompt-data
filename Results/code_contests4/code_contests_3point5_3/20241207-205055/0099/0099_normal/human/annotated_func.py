def func_1(be, en):
    res = [1]
    for i in range(be, en + 1):
        res.append(mult(res[-1], i))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `res` is a list containing the updated list with all the intermediate multiplication results, `be` is less than or equal to `en`, `i` is `en + 1`
    return res
    #The program returns the list `res` containing all the intermediate multiplication results
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `be` and `en`, then calculates and stores all the intermediate multiplication results from `be` to `en` in a list `res`. Finally, it returns the list `res` containing these results. The function correctly computes the intermediate multiplication results as described in the annotations.

def func_2(n, r):
    if (n < r) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: n is an integer, r is an integer. n is greater than or equal to r
    return div(facs[n], facs[n - r])
    #The program returns the division of the factorial of n by the factorial of (n - r)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two integer parameters `n` and `r`. If `n` is less than `r`, it returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the division of the factorial of `n` by the factorial of `(n - r)` and returns the result. The function covers the cases where `n` is less than `r` and where `n` is greater than or equal to `r`, providing different outcomes accordingly.

def func_3(arr):
    tem = [0]
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        tem.append(tem[i] + arr[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `tem` is a list containing the accumulated sum of elements in arr, `i` is the last index of arr
    return tem
    #The program returns the list `tem` containing the accumulated sum of elements in `arr`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `arr` and returns a new list `tem` where each element is the accumulated sum of elements in `arr`. The function initializes `tem` with [0] and iterates over the elements in `arr` to calculate the cumulative sum. The returned list `tem` contains the cumulative sum of elements in `arr`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n. Each pair of integers l_i and r_i (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ 10^9) represents the period of time when the i-th lamp is turned on.**
def func_4():
    sys.stdout = BytesIO()
    atexit.register(lambda : os.write(1, sys.stdout.getvalue()))
    return BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline
    #The program returns a function that reads a line from the input and assigns it to `sys.stdout` which is assigned to `BytesIO()`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. The program returns a function that reads a line from the input and assigns it to `sys.stdout`, which is then assigned to `BytesIO()`.
