Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After reviewing the code and the problem description, it appears that the code correctly implements the logic required to solve the given problem. The functions provided in the code handle the calculations related to finding the number of ways to pick k lamps such that they are all turned on simultaneously. The annotations also align with the problem description, providing details on the state of the program before and after function calls. Additionally, the code covers various edge cases such as when n < r or when k = 1, ensuring that the program behaves correctly in all scenarios mentioned in the problem description. Therefore, based on the analysis, the code is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
