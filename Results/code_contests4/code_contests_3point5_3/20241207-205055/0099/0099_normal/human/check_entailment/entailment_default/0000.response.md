Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code seems to correctly implement the problem description by reading input, processing the data, and providing the output according to the requirements.
- The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are well-defined and used appropriately within the main function to perform necessary calculations and data manipulation.
- The code handles the edge cases where `n` is less than `r` and provides the expected output.
- The output hints agree with the code and describe the program functionality accurately. They provide additional insight into the specific computations and operations performed by the code.
- The code accounts for different scenarios such as selecting k lamps to be turned on simultaneously and calculating the number of ways to open the door based on these selections.
- Overall, the code appears to meet the requirements of the problem description and the provided examples.
