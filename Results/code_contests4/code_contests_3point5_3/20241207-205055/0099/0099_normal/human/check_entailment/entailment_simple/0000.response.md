Correctness: **True**

The annotated program consists of functions that perform the necessary calculations to solve the given problem. Each function is well-defined and follows the problem description accurately.

- `func_1` calculates the factorial of a range from `be` to `en`.
- `func_2` calculates the combination value by dividing the factorial of `n` by the factorial of `(n - r)`.
- `func_3` accumulates the sum of elements in the input array.
- `func_4` sets up the input reading mechanism.

Overall, the program structure aligns with the problem requirements, and each function performs the intended calculations to determine the number of ways to pick `k` lamps that will all be turned on simultaneously to open the door.
