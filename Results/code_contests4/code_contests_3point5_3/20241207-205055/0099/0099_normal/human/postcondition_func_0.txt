The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `be` and `en`, then calculates and stores all the intermediate multiplication results from `be` to `en` in a list `res`. Finally, it returns the list `res` containing these results. The function correctly computes the intermediate multiplication results as described in the annotations.
