Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It calculates the number of ways to choose k lamps such that they will all be turned on at the same time. The program handles all the edge cases such as when k is equal to 1, when there are no pairs of lamps to choose from, and when all lamps are turned on at the same time. The output is also calculated modulo 998244353 as required. Overall, the program seems to be correct for all potential cases.
