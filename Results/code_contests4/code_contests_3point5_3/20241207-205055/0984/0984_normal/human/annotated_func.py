#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer. Array a contains n integers where each integer is between 0 and 10^9.**
def func_1():
    return int(sys.stdin.readline())
    #The program returns an integer input from the standard input using `sys.stdin.readline()`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer input from the standard input using `sys.stdin.readline()` and returns this integer.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_2():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing integers parsed from the input read from the standard input
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads input from the standard input and returns a map object containing integers parsed from the input.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_3():
    return sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()
    #The program returns the input string read from the standard input and removes any trailing whitespace characters.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_3 reads an input string from the standard input and removes any trailing whitespace characters before returning the cleaned input string.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_4():
    for s in args:
        sys.stdout.write(str(s) + ' ')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: All elements in `args` are written to the standard output separated by a space, `s` is the last element in `args`
    sys.stdout.write('\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_4 does not accept any parameters. It iterates over elements in `args` and writes each element to the standard output separated by a space. After writing all elements, it adds a new line character. Therefore, the functionality is to print all elements in `args` with spaces in between and a new line character at the end.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_5():
    for s in args:
        sys.stdout.write(str(s))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: All elements in `args` are written to the standard output in the order they appear in the list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_5 does not accept any parameters and iterates through all elements in the list args, writing each element to the standard output sequentially. This function solely focuses on outputting the elements in args to the standard output.
