Functionality: **The function func_4 does not accept any parameters. It iterates over elements in `args` and writes each element to the standard output separated by a space. After writing all elements, it adds a new line character. Therefore, the functionality is to print all elements in `args` with spaces in between and a new line character at the end.**
