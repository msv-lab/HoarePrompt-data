You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. Find the subsegment a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) with maximum arithmetic mean (1)/(r - l + 1)∑_{i=l}^{r}{a_i} (in floating-point numbers, i.e. without any rounding).

If there are many such subsegments find the longest one.

Input

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — length of the array a.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the array a.

Output

Print the single integer — the length of the longest subsegment with maximum possible arithmetic mean.

Example

Input


5
6 1 6 6 0


Output


2

Note

The subsegment [3, 4] is the longest among all subsegments with maximum arithmetic mean.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer. Array a contains n integers where each integer is between 0 and 10^9.**
def func_1():
    return int(sys.stdin.readline())
    #The program returns an integer input from the standard input using `sys.stdin.readline()`

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_2():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing integers parsed from the input read from the standard input

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_3():
    return sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()
    #The program returns the input string read from the standard input and removes any trailing whitespace characters.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_4():
    for s in args:
        sys.stdout.write(str(s) + ' ')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: All elements in `args` are written to the standard output separated by a space, `s` is the last element in `args`
    sys.stdout.write('\n')

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_5():
    for s in args:
        sys.stdout.write(str(s))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: All elements in `args` are written to the standard output in the order they appear in the list


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
