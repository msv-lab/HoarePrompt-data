Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads an integer `n` which represents the length of the array `a`. It then reads the array `a` and finds the maximum element in the array. After that, it iterates through the array and counts the consecutive occurrences of the maximum element. It keeps track of the maximum count of consecutive occurrences. Finally, it prints the length of the longest subsegment with the maximum possible arithmetic mean.

The code seems to follow the problem description accurately. It correctly identifies the longest subsegment with the maximum arithmetic mean by counting the consecutive occurrences of the maximum element in the array. There are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description that the code does not handle, and the output hints do not provide any conflicting information. Therefore, the code is correct.
