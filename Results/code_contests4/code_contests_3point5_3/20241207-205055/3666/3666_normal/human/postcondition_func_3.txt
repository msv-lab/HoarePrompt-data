The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It reads an input string, splits it using space as the delimiter, and returns a list of strings. However, the annotation mentions specific input requirements that are not validated or handled in the code. Missing functionality includes parsing the input to check if it meets the specified format before splitting it.
