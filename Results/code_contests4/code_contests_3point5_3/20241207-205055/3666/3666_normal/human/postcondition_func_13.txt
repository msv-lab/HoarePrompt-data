The function `func_14` accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`. It calculates the result by performing a series of operations based on the value of `y`. If `y` is odd, it multiplies the current `res` by `x`, squares `x`, and shifts `y` to the right by 1. If `y` is even, it only squares `x` and shifts `y` to the right by 1. The function returns the final value of `res` after these calculations.
