The function `func_10` accepts two variables `a` and `b`. In Case_1, if `a` is equal to 0, it returns variables `b`, 0, and 1. In Case_2, it recursively calculates the greatest common divisor (`gcd`), and the values of `x` and `y` based on the Euclidean algorithm. Despite the annotations mentioning a ZeroDivisionError, the function does not handle this error explicitly, so potential division by zero errors may occur.
