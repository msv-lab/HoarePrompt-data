#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer value taken as input from the user
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 does not accept any parameters. It prompts the user to input an integer value and returns that integer value. The function does not have any specific edge cases or missing functionality as it straightforwardly follows the annotations provided.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of q queries, where each query contains four integers l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, and r_{2_i} such that 1 ≤ l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, r_{2_i} ≤ 10^9 and l_{1_i} < r_{1_i}, l_{2_i} < r_{2_i}.**
def func_2():
    return input()
    #The program returns the input consisting of q queries, each containing four integers l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, and r_{2_i} where 1 ≤ l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, r_{2_i} ≤ 10^9 and l_{1_i} < r_{1_i}, l_{2_i} < r_{2_i}.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_2 does not accept any parameters and simply returns the input consisting of q queries. Each query contains four integers l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, and r_{2_i} where 1 ≤ l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, r_{2_i} ≤ 10^9 and l_{1_i} < r_{1_i}, l_{2_i} < r_{2_i}.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: q is a positive integer. For each query i, l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, r_{2_i} are integers such that 1 ≤ l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, r_{2_i} ≤ 10^9 and l_{1_i} < r_{1_i}, l_{2_i} < r_{2_i}.**
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().split(' '))
    #The program returns a map object with integers converted from the input separated by spaces
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads input from the user, splits the input by spaces, converts the values to integers, and returns a map object containing those integers. The function assumes that the input consists of integers separated by spaces. However, it lacks error handling for cases where the input format does not match the expected integer space integer format.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: q is a positive integer. Each query consists of four integers l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, and r_{2_i} such that 1 ≤ l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, r_{2_i} ≤ 10^9 and l_{1_i} < r_{1_i}, l_{2_i} < r_{2_i}.**
def func_4():
    return map(str, input().split(' '))
    #The program returns a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string using space as the delimiter
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It reads an input string, splits it using space as the delimiter, and returns a list of strings. However, the annotation mentions specific input requirements that are not validated or handled in the code. Missing functionality includes parsing the input to check if it meets the specified format before splitting it.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **q is a positive integer. Each query contains four integers l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, and r_{2_i} such that 1 ≤ l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, r_{2_i} ≤ 10^9 and l_{1_i} < r_{1_i}, l_{2_i} < r_{2_i}.**
def func_5():
    return list(func_3())
    #The program returns a list of values returned by the function func_3()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters. It returns a list of values returned by the function `func_3()`. The function does not have any additional logic or edge cases beyond this.

    sys.setrecursionlimit(1000000)
    threading.stack_size(1024000)
    thread = threading.Thread(target=main)
    thread.start()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` sets the recursion limit and stack size, creates a new thread targeting the `main` function, and starts the thread. This function does not accept any parameters and does not explicitly return any value.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.**
def func_7(n):
    sum = 0
    while n > 0:
        sum += int(n % 10)

    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: Output State: `n` is 0, `sum` is the sum of all the digits of the original value of `n`
    return sum
    #The program returns the sum of all the digits of the original value of 'n'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_7 accepts a positive integer n and calculates the sum of all the digits of n. It uses a while loop to extract each digit from n, summing them up. Finally, it returns the total sum of the digits of the original value of n. The function does not account for any edge cases such as negative numbers or non-integer inputs.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of q queries, each containing four integers l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, and r_{2_i}, where 1 ≤ l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, r_{2_i} ≤ 10^9, l_{1_i} < r_{1_i}, l_{2_i} < r_{2_i}.**
def func_8(x):
    return x and not x & x - 1
    #The program returns the result of the logical operation between x and not x & x - 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` accepts an integer `x` and returns the result of the logical operation between `x` and `not x & x - 1`. The function checks if `x` is a power of 2, returning True if `x` is a power of 2, and False otherwise.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_9(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` and `y` are the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `x` and `y`, `y` is 0
    return x
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of 'x' and 'y'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_9` accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`. It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm and returns the result. The loop inside the function iterates until `y` becomes 0, and at that point, `x` holds the GCD. If the initial value of `y` is 0, the function returns the initial value of `x` as the GCD.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_10(a, b):
    if (a == 0) :
        return b, 0, 1
        #The program returns variables b, 0, and 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` is equal to 0 and the program does not enter the if block.
    gcd, x1, y1 = func_10(b % a, a)
    x = y1 - b // a * x1
    y = x1
    return gcd, x, y
    #The program returns the variables `gcd`, `x`, and `y` despite encountering a ZeroDivisionError
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_10` accepts two variables `a` and `b`. In Case_1, if `a` is equal to 0, it returns variables `b`, 0, and 1. In Case_2, it recursively calculates the greatest common divisor (`gcd`), and the values of `x` and `y` based on the Euclidean algorithm. Despite the annotations mentioning a ZeroDivisionError, the function does not handle this error explicitly, so potential division by zero errors may occur.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_11(n):
    if (n <= 1) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer. n is larger than 1.
    if (n <= 3) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer. n is larger than 1. n is larger than 3
    if (n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0) :

        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer. n is larger than 1 and larger than 3. n is not divisible by either 2 or 3
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:

    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_11` accepts an integer parameter `n` and returns False if `n` is less than or equal to 1, True if `n` is less than or equal to 3, and False if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3. It then iterates through a loop to check if `n` is divisible by numbers starting from 5 and increments by 6. If `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, it returns False. If none of these conditions are met, it returns True.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_12(n):
    if (n == 0) :
        return 0, 1
        #The program returns 0 and 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` can have any value except 0
    p = func_12(n >> 1)

    d = p[0] * p[0] + p[1] * p[1]
    if (n & 1) :
        return c + 2 * d
        #The program returns the sum of the calculated value 'c' and twice the value of 'd'
    else :
        return c + d
        #The program returns the sum of the calculated value 'c' and the result 'd'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` recursively calculates values 'c' and 'd' based on the input parameter `n`. It then returns different values depending on whether `n` is 0 or not, incorporating the calculated values 'c' and 'd' accordingly. The function has three possible return cases:
Case 1: The function returns 0 and 1 if `n` is 0.
Case 2: If `n` is not 0 and it is odd, the function returns the sum of the calculated value 'c' and twice the value of 'd'.
Case 3: If `n` is not 0 and it is even, the function returns the sum of the calculated value 'c' and the value of 'd'.
The actual code does not explicitly handle cases where `n` is negative or other potential edge cases, so it is assumed that the function is intended for non-negative integer inputs only.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each query consists of four integers l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, r_{2_i} such that 1 ≤ l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, r_{2_i} ≤ 10^9, l_{1_i} < r_{1_i}, l_{2_i} < r_{2_i}.**
def func_13():
    sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` sets the standard input to read from a file named 'input.txt'. It does not accept any parameters and does not explicitly return any value. The function lacks detailed annotations on its operation or purpose beyond modifying the standard input configuration.

        x = x * x
        
        y >>= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: If the final value of `y` is odd, `res` is the result of multiplying its previous value by the square of `x`, `x` is the square of its previous value squared, and `y` is 0. If the final value of `y` is even, there is no change in the values of `res`, `x`, and `y`.
    return res
    #The program returns the final value of 'res' after the calculations based on the conditions mentioned.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`. It calculates the result by performing a series of operations based on the value of `y`. If `y` is odd, it multiplies the current `res` by `x`, squares `x`, and shifts `y` to the right by 1. If `y` is even, it only squares `x` and shifts `y` to the right by 1. The function returns the final value of `res` after these calculations.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each query has four integers l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, r_{2_i} such that 1 ≤ l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, r_{2_i} ≤ 10^9, l_{1_i} < r_{1_i}, l_{2_i} < r_{2_i}.**

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: Each query has four integers `l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, r_{2_i}` such that 1 ≤ `l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, r_{2_i}` ≤ 10^9, `l_{1_i} < r_{1_i}, l_{2_i} < r_{2_i}`. The loop will execute `q` times, where `q` is the total number of queries. After all iterations of the loop, the values of `l1, r1, l2, r2` will be assigned the return values of the last call to `func_3()` in the loop. The function `func_16` will be called with the final values of `l1` and `r2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_15` does not accept any parameters and internally calls other functions to process queries. Each query contains four integers `l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, r_{2_i}` with specific constraints. The function iterates `q` times, where `q` is the total number of queries, and assigns the values of `l1, r1, l2, r2` from the last call to `func_3()` in the loop. It then calls `func_16` with the final values of `l1` and `r2`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_16` does not accept any parameters. It iterates through the elements in `args`, writing their string representation to the specified file. It then writes the 'end' value, which defaults to a newline character. If the 'flush' key is present in the given `kwargs` dictionary and is set to True, it flushes the file. The function does not have a specified return value.
