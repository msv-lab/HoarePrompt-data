The function `func_9` accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`. It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm and returns the result. The loop inside the function iterates until `y` becomes 0, and at that point, `x` holds the GCD. If the initial value of `y` is 0, the function returns the initial value of `x` as the GCD.
