Correctness: True

The provided program correctly implements the problem description. It takes q queries as input, where each query contains four integers l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, and r_{2_i}. It then prints two integers a_i and b_i for each query such that l_{1_i} ≤ a_i ≤ r_{1_i}, l_{2_i} ≤ b_i ≤ r_{2_i}, and a_i ≠ b_i. The program loops through all the queries and prints the required values accordingly. The functions defined in the program handle the input processing and output printing as expected. The program ensures that the answer exists for each query and follows the problem description for all potential cases.
