Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After reviewing the provided Python program and the annotations, it appears that the code follows the problem description for every potential case. The functions are designed to handle the input constraints specified in the problem description, process the queries as required, and output the two integers a and b satisfying the given conditions. The annotations provide insights into the functionality of each function, and based on that, along with the code itself, it can be concluded that the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
