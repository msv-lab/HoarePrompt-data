You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those output hints describes certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given two segments [l_1; r_1] and [l_2; r_2] on the x-axis. It is guaranteed that l_1 < r_1 and l_2 < r_2. Segments may intersect, overlap or even coincide with each other.

<image> The example of two segments on the x-axis.

Your problem is to find two integers a and b such that l_1 ≤ a ≤ r_1, l_2 ≤ b ≤ r_2 and a ≠ b. In other words, you have to choose two distinct integer points in such a way that the first point belongs to the segment [l_1; r_1] and the second one belongs to the segment [l_2; r_2].

It is guaranteed that the answer exists. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.

You have to answer q independent queries.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 500) — the number of queries.

Each of the next q lines contains four integers l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i} and r_{2_i} (1 ≤ l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, r_{2_i} ≤ 10^9, l_{1_i} < r_{1_i}, l_{2_i} < r_{2_i}) — the ends of the segments in the i-th query.

Output

Print 2q integers. For the i-th query print two integers a_i and b_i — such numbers that l_{1_i} ≤ a_i ≤ r_{1_i}, l_{2_i} ≤ b_i ≤ r_{2_i} and a_i ≠ b_i. Queries are numbered in order of the input.

It is guaranteed that the answer exists. If there are multiple answers, you can print any.

Functions with output description for each function:
Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output decription for function1:  The function func_1 does not accept any parameters. It prompts the user to input an integer value and returns that integer value. The function does not have any specific edge cases or missing functionality as it straightforwardly follows the annotations provided.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return input()
''' 

 Output decription for function2:  The function func_2 does not accept any parameters and simply returns the input consisting of q queries. Each query contains four integers l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, and r_{2_i} where 1 ≤ l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, r_{2_i} ≤ 10^9 and l_{1_i} < r_{1_i}, l_{2_i} < r_{2_i}.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().split(' '))
''' 

 Output decription for function3:  The function `func_3` reads input from the user, splits the input by spaces, converts the values to integers, and returns a map object containing those integers. The function assumes that the input consists of integers separated by spaces. However, it lacks error handling for cases where the input format does not match the expected integer space integer format.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    return map(str, input().split(' '))
''' 

 Output decription for function4:  The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It reads an input string, splits it using space as the delimiter, and returns a list of strings. However, the annotation mentions specific input requirements that are not validated or handled in the code. Missing functionality includes parsing the input to check if it meets the specified format before splitting it.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return list(func_3())
''' 

 Output decription for function5:  The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters. It returns a list of values returned by the function `func_3()`. The function does not have any additional logic or edge cases beyond this.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1000000)
    threading.stack_size(1024000)
    thread = threading.Thread(target=main)
    thread.start()
''' 

 Output decription for function6:  The function `func_6` sets the recursion limit and stack size, creates a new thread targeting the `main` function, and starts the thread. This function does not accept any parameters and does not explicitly return any value.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7(n):
    sum = 0
    while n > 0:
        sum += int(n % 10)
        n = int(n / 10)
    return sum
''' 

 Output decription for function7:  The function func_7 accepts a positive integer n and calculates the sum of all the digits of n. It uses a while loop to extract each digit from n, summing them up. Finally, it returns the total sum of the digits of the original value of n. The function does not account for any edge cases such as negative numbers or non-integer inputs.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(x):
    return x and (not x & x - 1)
''' 

 Output decription for function8:  The function `func_8` accepts an integer `x` and returns the result of the logical operation between `x` and `not x & x - 1`. The function checks if `x` is a power of 2, returning True if `x` is a power of 2, and False otherwise.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
''' 

 Output decription for function9:  The function `func_9` accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`. It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm and returns the result. The loop inside the function iterates until `y` becomes 0, and at that point, `x` holds the GCD. If the initial value of `y` is 0, the function returns the initial value of `x` as the GCD.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10(a, b):
    if a == 0:
        return (b, 0, 1)
    (gcd, x1, y1) = func_10(b % a, a)
    x = y1 - b // a * x1
    y = x1
    return (gcd, x, y)
''' 

 Output decription for function10:  The function `func_10` accepts two variables `a` and `b`. In Case_1, if `a` is equal to 0, it returns variables `b`, 0, and 1. In Case_2, it recursively calculates the greatest common divisor (`gcd`), and the values of `x` and `y` based on the Euclidean algorithm. Despite the annotations mentioning a ZeroDivisionError, the function does not handle this error explicitly, so potential division by zero errors may occur.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i = i + 6
    return True
''' 

 Output decription for function11:  The function `func_11` accepts an integer parameter `n` and returns False if `n` is less than or equal to 1, True if `n` is less than or equal to 3, and False if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3. It then iterates through a loop to check if `n` is divisible by numbers starting from 5 and increments by 6. If `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, it returns False. If none of these conditions are met, it returns True.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(n):
    if n == 0:
        return (0, 1)
    p = func_12(n >> 1)
    c = p[0] * (2 * p[1] - p[0])
    d = p[0] * p[0] + p[1] * p[1]
    if n & 1:
        return c + 2 * d
    else:
        return c + d
''' 

 Output decription for function12:  The function `func_12` recursively calculates values 'c' and 'd' based on the input parameter `n`. It then returns different values depending on whether `n` is 0 or not, incorporating the calculated values 'c' and 'd' accordingly. The function has three possible return cases:
Case 1: The function returns 0 and 1 if `n` is 0.
Case 2: If `n` is not 0 and it is odd, the function returns the sum of the calculated value 'c' and twice the value of 'd'.
Case 3: If `n` is not 0 and it is even, the function returns the sum of the calculated value 'c' and the value of 'd'.
The actual code does not explicitly handle cases where `n` is negative or other potential edge cases, so it is assumed that the function is intended for non-negative integer inputs only.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13():
    sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
''' 

 Output decription for function13:  The function `func_13` sets the standard input to read from a file named 'input.txt'. It does not accept any parameters and does not explicitly return any value. The function lacks detailed annotations on its operation or purpose beyond modifying the standard input configuration.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14(x, y):
    res = 1
    while y > 0:
        if y & 1:
            res = res * x
        x = x * x
        y >>= 1
    return res
''' 

 Output decription for function14:  The function `func_14` accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`. It calculates the result by performing a series of operations based on the value of `y`. If `y` is odd, it multiplies the current `res` by `x`, squares `x`, and shifts `y` to the right by 1. If `y` is even, it only squares `x` and shifts `y` to the right by 1. The function returns the final value of `res` after these calculations.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15():
    q = func_1()
    for i in range(q):
        (l1, r1, l2, r2) = func_3()
        func_16(l1, r2)
''' 

 Output decription for function15:  The function `func_15` does not accept any parameters and internally calls other functions to process queries. Each query contains four integers `l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, r_{2_i}` with specific constraints. The function iterates `q` times, where `q` is the total number of queries, and assigns the values of `l1, r1, l2, r2` from the last call to `func_3()` in the loop. It then calls `func_16` with the final values of `l1` and `r2`.
Function number 16 :

First I want you to try to see if the program (including all the functions) does what the description says. Look at only the code and the description and make an initial assesment.Try to think of any edge cases that the code might not be handling.

Then I want you to see if the output hints agree with the code. Sometimes the output hints hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the output hints says are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to make a more informed decision and detrmine if the code is correct or not.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code.
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
