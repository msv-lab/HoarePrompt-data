Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided seems to correctly address the problem description. It takes as input the number of queries, followed by the segments [l_1, r_1, l_2, r_2] for each query. The code then prints two integers a and b for each query, satisfying the conditions l_1 ≤ a ≤ r_1, l_2 ≤ b ≤ r_2, and a ≠ b. 

The functions described for input handling and processing queries appear to align with the problem requirements. The functions read the input, split it into integers, and then process the queries accordingly. The output hints also provide a clear description of the expected output format and constraints, which match the code implementation.

Given that the code structure and functionality seem to be in line with the problem description and the output hints do not indicate any discrepancy or edge cases that are not handled by the code, we can conclude that the code is correct in this case.
