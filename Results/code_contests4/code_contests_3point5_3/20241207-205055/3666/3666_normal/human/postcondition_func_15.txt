The function `func_16` does not accept any parameters. It iterates through the elements in `args`, writing their string representation to the specified file. It then writes the 'end' value, which defaults to a newline character. If the 'flush' key is present in the given `kwargs` dictionary and is set to True, it flushes the file. The function does not have a specified return value.
