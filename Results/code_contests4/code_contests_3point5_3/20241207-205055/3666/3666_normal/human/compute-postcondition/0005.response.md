The `file.write(sep)` statement writes the value of `sep` to the file. The variables `at_start` and `args` are not affected by this statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `at_start` is True, `args` is an iterable with at least one element, `at_start` is not True.
Output State: **`at_start` is True, `args` is an iterable with at least one element, `at_start` is not True**
