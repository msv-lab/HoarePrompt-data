According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `args`. If args is an iterable with at least one element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `at_start` being True does not directly affect the execution of the loop. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted so that `args` is an iterable with at least one element.
State: **`at_start` is True, for the loop to execute `args` is an iterable with at least one element**
