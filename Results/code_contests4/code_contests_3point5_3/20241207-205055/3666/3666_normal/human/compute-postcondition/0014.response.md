According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are more elements in the `args` iterable. At the end of the last iteration, `at_start` is False, and `args` has at least two elements. 
To execute the loop one more time, `at_start` should remain False, and the `args` iterable should still have at least two elements.
State: **`at_start` is False, `args` is an iterable with at least two elements for the loop to execute another time**
