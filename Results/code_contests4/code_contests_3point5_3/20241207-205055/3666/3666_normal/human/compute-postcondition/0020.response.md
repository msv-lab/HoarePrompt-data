Example Answer:
The `pop` method removes and returns the value associated with the key 'end' from the `kwargs` dictionary. If 'end' key is not present, it returns '\n' by default. The returned value is then written to the file. The state of `at_start` remains unchanged, and the file now contains the string representation of all elements in `args` followed by the popped value. Therefore, the Output State is: `at_start` is False, the file has been written with the string representation of all elements in `args` followed by the popped value.
Output State: **`at_start` is False, the file has been written with the string representation of all elements in `args` followed by the popped value**
