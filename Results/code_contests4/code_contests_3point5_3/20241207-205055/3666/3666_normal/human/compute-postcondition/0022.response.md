Example Answer:
The `flush()` method is called on the `file` object. If the 'flush' key exists in `kwargs` and is set to True, it is popped from `kwargs`. The file has been written with the string representation of all elements in `args` followed by the popped value. Therefore, the Output State is: `at_start` is False, the file has been written with the string representation of all elements in `args` followed by the popped value. If the 'flush' key exists in `kwargs` and is set to True, it has been popped from `kwargs`.
Output State: **`at_start` is False, the file has been written with the string representation of all elements in `args` followed by the popped value. If the 'flush' key exists in `kwargs` and is set to True, it has been popped from `kwargs`**
