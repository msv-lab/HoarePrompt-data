According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `args`. If `args` still has elements left, the loop can execute one more time. 

At the end of the last iteration, `at_start` is False, `args` is an iterable with at least one element. So for the loop to execute one more time, `args` must still have elements left after the previous iteration.

State: **`at_start` is False, `args` is an iterable with at least two elements for the loop to execute another time**
