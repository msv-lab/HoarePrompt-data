The function `func_12` recursively calculates values 'c' and 'd' based on the input parameter `n`. It then returns different values depending on whether `n` is 0 or not, incorporating the calculated values 'c' and 'd' accordingly. The function has three possible return cases:
Case 1: The function returns 0 and 1 if `n` is 0.
Case 2: If `n` is not 0 and it is odd, the function returns the sum of the calculated value 'c' and twice the value of 'd'.
Case 3: If `n` is not 0 and it is even, the function returns the sum of the calculated value 'c' and the value of 'd'.
The actual code does not explicitly handle cases where `n` is negative or other potential edge cases, so it is assumed that the function is intended for non-negative integer inputs only.
