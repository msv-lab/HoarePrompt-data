The function `func_11` accepts an integer parameter `n` and returns False if `n` is less than or equal to 1, True if `n` is less than or equal to 3, and False if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3. It then iterates through a loop to check if `n` is divisible by numbers starting from 5 and increments by 6. If `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, it returns False. If none of these conditions are met, it returns True.
