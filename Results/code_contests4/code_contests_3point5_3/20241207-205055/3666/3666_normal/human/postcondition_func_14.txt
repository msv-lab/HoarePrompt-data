The function `func_15` does not accept any parameters and internally calls other functions to process queries. Each query contains four integers `l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, r_{2_i}` with specific constraints. The function iterates `q` times, where `q` is the total number of queries, and assigns the values of `l1, r1, l2, r2` from the last call to `func_3()` in the loop. It then calls `func_16` with the final values of `l1` and `r2`.
