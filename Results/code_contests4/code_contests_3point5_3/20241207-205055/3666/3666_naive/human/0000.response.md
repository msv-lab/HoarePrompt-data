Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided program takes the input for the number of queries and the endpoints of the segments for each query. It then prints two integers a and b such that l_1 ≤ a ≤ r_1, l_2 ≤ b ≤ r_2, and a ≠ b for each query. The program loops through each query, calculates the desired integers a and b, and prints them accordingly. 

The program follows the problem description accurately and handles all potential cases correctly. There are no apparent issues or edge cases where the program would not work as expected. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.
