Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided code reads the number of queries and the segments for each query, then prints two integers a and b such that l_{1_i} ≤ a ≤ r_{1_i}, l_{2_i} ≤ b ≤ r_{2_i} and a ≠ b for each query. The code follows the problem description accurately and there are no missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. Additionally, the output format and the way queries are processed align with the problem requirements. Thus, the code is correct for all potential cases.
