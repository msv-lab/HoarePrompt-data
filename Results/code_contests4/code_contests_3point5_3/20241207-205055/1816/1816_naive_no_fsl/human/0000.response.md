Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It calculates the minimum number of Jedi Knights that need to be removed from the sequence in order to select an interval with the desired counts of lightsaber colors. The program iterates through the sequence and keeps track of the counts of each color of lightsaber. It then adjusts the interval based on the counts until the desired interval is found or it is not possible. The code covers all potential cases and correctly outputs the minimum number of Jedi Knights to be removed.
