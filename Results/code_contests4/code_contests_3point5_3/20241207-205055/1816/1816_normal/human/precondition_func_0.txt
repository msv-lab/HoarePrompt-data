n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5 and 1 <= m <= n. The list of n integers representing colors of lightsabers is non-empty and contains integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m}. The list of m integers representing desired counts of Jedi Knights with lightsabers of each color is non-empty.**
