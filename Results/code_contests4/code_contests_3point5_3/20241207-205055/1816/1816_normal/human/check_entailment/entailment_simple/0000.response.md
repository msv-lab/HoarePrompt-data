Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It calculates the minimum number of Jedi Knights that need to be removed from the sequence so that an interval with the prescribed counts of lightsaber colors can be selected. It uses two pointers to iterate through the list of Jedi Knights and keeps track of the counts of each color in a separate list. It then adjusts the pointers and counts accordingly to find the minimum number of Jedi Knights that need to be removed.

The program handles cases where it is not possible to select the desired interval by outputting -1. It also correctly calculates the minimum number of Jedi Knights to be removed in all other cases.
