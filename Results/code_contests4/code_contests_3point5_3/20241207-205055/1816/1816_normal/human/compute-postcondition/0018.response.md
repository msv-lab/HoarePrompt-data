Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers, `a` is a map object created by applying the lambda function to the input split, `c` is a list of `m` zeros with the element at index `a[r]` incremented by 2, `l` is 0, `r` is a positive integer incremented by 1, `ans` is -1, for the loop to execute `t` is greater than 1, `r + 1` is less than `n`, the element in `c` at index `a[r]` is equal to the corresponding element in `b` at index `a[r]`, and `t` is decreased by 1 after the if statement is executed.***
