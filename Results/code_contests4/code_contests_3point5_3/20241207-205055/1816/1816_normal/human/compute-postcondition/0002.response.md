Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the result of applying the `int` function to each element of the input split. The input is taken through `raw_input()` and then split. The `map` function applies the `int` function to each element of the split input. Since `n` and `m` are not directly affected by this code snippet, the output state is: `n` and `m` are positive integers satisfying the constraints, `a` is a map object created by applying the lambda function to the input split.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers satisfying the constraints, `a` is a map object created by applying the lambda function to the input split**
