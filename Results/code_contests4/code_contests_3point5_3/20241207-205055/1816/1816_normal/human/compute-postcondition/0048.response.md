Example Answer:
The value of `c[a[l]]` is decremented by 1. The states of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the output state is: `ans` is updated with the minimum value between its current value and `r - (l+1) + 1 - s`, for the loop to execute again `l` must be less than or equal to `r`; `c[a[l]]` is decremented by 1.
Output State: **`ans` is updated with the minimum value between its current value and `r - (l+1) + 1 - s`, for the loop to execute again `l` must be less than or equal to `r`; `c[a[l]]` is decremented by 1**
