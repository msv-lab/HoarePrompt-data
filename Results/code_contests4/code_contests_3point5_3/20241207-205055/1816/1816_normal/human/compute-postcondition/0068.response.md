Output State: **`ans` is updated with the minimum value, `r` is incremented by 1, `l`, `s`, `c`, `a`, `b`, `n` are all modified. For the loop to execute the first time, `l` needs to be less than or equal to `r`, `r + 1` is less than `n`, and `c[a[l]]` is less than `b[a[l]]. `c[a[r]]` is incremented by 1.**
