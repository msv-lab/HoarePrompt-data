Example Answer:
`n` and `m` are assigned values using `map(int, raw_input().split())`, where `raw_input().split()` accepts input and splits it based on spaces, and `map(int, ...)` converts each split value to an integer. The values of `n` and `m` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers satisfying the constraints.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers satisfying the constraints**
