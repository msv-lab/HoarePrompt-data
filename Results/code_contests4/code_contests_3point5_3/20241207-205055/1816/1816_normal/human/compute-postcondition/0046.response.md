Example Answer:
The variable `ans` is updated with the minimum value between its current value and the expression `r - l + 1 - s`. Since `l` is incremented by 1 and the rest of the variables remain unchanged, the new value of `ans` will depend on the current values of `ans`, `r`, `l`, and `s`. 
Output State: **`ans` is updated with the minimum value between its current value and `r - (l+1) + 1 - s`**
