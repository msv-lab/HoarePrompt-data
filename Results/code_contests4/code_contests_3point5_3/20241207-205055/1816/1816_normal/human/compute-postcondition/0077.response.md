Output State: **`ans` is updated with the minimum value, `r` is such that `r + 1 = n`, `l` is such that `l = r`, `s`, `c`, `a`, `b`, `n` are all modified as per the loop execution, the loop doesn't execute anymore as `r + 1` is not less than `n`, and the condition `c[a[l]] < b[a[l]]` is not satisfied anymore. The condition `c[a[l]] < b[a[l]]` is true.**
