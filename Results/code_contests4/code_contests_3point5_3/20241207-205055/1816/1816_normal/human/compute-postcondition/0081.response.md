Output State: **`n` and `m` remain positive integers, `a` is a map object created by applying the lambda function to the input split, `c` is a list of `m` zeros with each element at index `a[r]` incremented by the number of times it appeared in the loop, `l` is equal to `r + 1`, `r` is equal to the total number of loop iterations, `ans` is the minimum value between its current value and `r - l + 1 - s`, `t` remains 0 indicating loop termination.**
