Output State: `ans` is updated with the minimum value, `r` is incremented by 1, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `s`, `c`, `a`, `b`, `n` are all modified appropriately, `r + 1` is less than `n`, `c[a[l]]` is less than `b[a[l]]`, `c[a[r]]` is incremented by 3, for the loop to execute one more time `l` needs to be adjusted, and the values of `s`, `c`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `c[a[l]]`, `c[a[r]]` need to be modified accordingly.
