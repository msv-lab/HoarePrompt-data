Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` remain positive integers, `a` is a map object created by applying the lambda function to the input split, `c` is a list of `m` zeros with each element at index `a[r]` incremented by the number of times it appeared in the loop, `l` is incremented by the total number of loop iterations, `r` is a positive integer that has been incremented by the total number of loop iterations, `ans` is calculated as `r - l + 1 - s`, `t` is 0 indicating loop termination, the loop has terminated as `r + 1 >= n` and `c[a[l]] >= b[a[l]]` is false. Additionally, after entering the if condition `(c[a[l]] < b[a[l]])`, the program state is such that the condition is true.***
