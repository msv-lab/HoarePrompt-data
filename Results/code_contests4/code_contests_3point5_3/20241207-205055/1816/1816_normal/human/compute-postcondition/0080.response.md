Output State: **All variables remain updated as per the loop execution. The loop has stopped as `r + 1` is not less than `n` and the condition `c[a[l]] < b[a[l]]` is not satisfied anymore. `l` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the current `ans` value and `r - l + 1 - s`.**
