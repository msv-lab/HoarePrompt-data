Example Answer:
The value of `t` is assigned the value of `m`, which is a positive integer. Therefore, after execution, `t` will hold the same value as `m`. The other variables remain unaffected. 
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers satisfying the constraints, `a` is a map object created by applying the lambda function to the input split; `c` is a list of `m` zeros, `l` is 0, `r` is -1, `ans` is -1, `t` is equal to `m`**
