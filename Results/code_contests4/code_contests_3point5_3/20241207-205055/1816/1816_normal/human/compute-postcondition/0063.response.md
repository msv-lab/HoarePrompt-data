Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is updated with the minimum value between its current value and `(r - (l+1) + 1 - s)`. The indices `r` and `l` are modified during the execution, and `c[a[i]]` is incremented for all `i` from the initial value of `r` to the final value of `r`. The condition `c[a[l]] < b[a[l]]` still holds after the if statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is updated with the minimum value; `r`, `l`, `s`, `c`, `a`, `b`, `n` are all modified accordingly.
Output State: **`ans` is updated with the minimum value; `r`, `l`, `s`, `c`, `a`, `b`, `n` are all modified accordingly**
