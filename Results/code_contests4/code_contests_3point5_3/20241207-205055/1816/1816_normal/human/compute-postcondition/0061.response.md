Postcondition: ***`ans` is updated with the minimum value between its current value and `(r - (l+1) + 1 - s)`, where `r` is the index where the condition `c[a[l]] < b[a[l]]` no longer holds or `r + 1 == n`. The index `l` corresponds to where the loop stopped executing. Additionally, `c[a[i]]` has been incremented by 1 for all `i` from the initial value of `r` to the final value of `r`. The condition `c[a[l]] < b[a[l]]` remains true after the if statement executes.***
