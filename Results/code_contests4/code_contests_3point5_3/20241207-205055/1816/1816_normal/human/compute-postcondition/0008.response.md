According to the code, the loop can execute if `t` is greater than 0 and `r + 1` is less than `n`. Right before the loop, `t` is equal to `m`, `r` is -1, and `n` is a positive integer. Therefore, in order for the loop to execute the first time, `t` must be greater than 0 and `r + 1` must be less than `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `a` is a map object created by applying the lambda function to the input split, `c` is a list of `m` zeros, `l` is 0, `r` is -1, `ans` is -1, for the loop to execute the first time `t` is greater than 0 and `r + 1` is less than `n`**
