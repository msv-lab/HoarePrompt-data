Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input data about the colors of lightsabers and desired counts of Jedi Knights with lightsabers of each color. It then processes this information to allocate the lightsabers to the Jedi Knights based on the desired counts for each color. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return anything. However, there is a potential issue where the loop condition may not be properly handling all cases, potentially leading to incorrect output or unexpected behavior.**
