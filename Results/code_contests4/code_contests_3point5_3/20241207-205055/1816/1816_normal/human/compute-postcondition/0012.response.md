Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `a` is a map object created by applying the lambda function to the input split, `c` is a list of `m` zeros with the element at index `a[r]` incremented by 1, `l` is 0, `r` is a positive integer incremented by 1, `ans` is -1, for the loop to execute the first time `t` is greater than 0 and `r + 1` is less than `n`. Additionally, the element in `c` at index `a[r]` is equal to the corresponding element in `b` at index `a[r]`. `t` is decreased by 1.**
