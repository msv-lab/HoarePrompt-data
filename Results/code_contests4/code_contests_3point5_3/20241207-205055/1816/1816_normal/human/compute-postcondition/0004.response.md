Example Answer: 
A list `c` is created containing `m` number of zeros. The values of `n`, `m`, and `a` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers satisfying the constraints, `a` is a map object created by applying the lambda function to the input split; `c` is a list of `m` zeros.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers satisfying the constraints, `a` is a map object created by applying the lambda function to the input split; `c` is a list of `m` zeros**
