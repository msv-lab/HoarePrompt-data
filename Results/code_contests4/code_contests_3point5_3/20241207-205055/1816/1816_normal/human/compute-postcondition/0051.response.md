Output State: **`ans` is updated with the minimum value between its current value and `(r - (l+1) + 1 - s)`, `r` is incremented by 1. For the loop to execute again, `r` must be less than `n-1`, `c[a[l]]` must be less than `b[a[l]]`, and `l` must be less than or equal to `r. `c[a[r]]` is incremented by 1.**
