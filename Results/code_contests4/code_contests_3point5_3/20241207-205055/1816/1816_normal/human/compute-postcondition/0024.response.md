Output State: **After the loop executes, `n` and `m` remain positive integers, `a` is a map object created by applying the lambda function to the input split, `c` is a list of `m` zeros with each element at index `a[r]` incremented by the number of times it appeared in the loop, `l` is 0, `r` is a positive integer that has been incremented by the total number of loop iterations, `ans` remains -1. The loop control variable `t` becomes 0 after all iterations, indicating the loop termination.**
