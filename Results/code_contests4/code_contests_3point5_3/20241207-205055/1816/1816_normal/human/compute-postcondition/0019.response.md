According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `t` and `r`. If `t` is greater than 0 and `r + 1` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 1, `r` is a positive integer incremented by 1, and `r + 1` is less than `n`. Additionally, the element in `c` at index `a[r]` is equal to the corresponding element in `b` at index `a[r]`. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 1, and `r + 1` must be less than `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `a` is a map object created by applying the lambda function to the input split, `c` is a list of `m` zeros with the element at index `a[r]` incremented by 2, `l` is 0, `r` is a positive integer incremented by 1, `ans` is -1, for the loop to execute `t` is greater than 1, `r + 1` is less than `n`, the element in `c` at index `a[r]` is equal to the corresponding element in `b` at index `a[r]`, and `t` is decreased by 1 after the if statement is executed**.
