Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem description. It simply takes the input, adds 4 to it, then divides the result by 5 without considering the minimum number of steps the elephant needs to make to get from point 0 to point x. 

For example, if the input is 12, the program would output 3, which is incorrect. The elephant can reach point 12 by taking steps of 5, 5, and 2, which is a total of 3 steps. So, the correct output should be 3, not the result of the formula in the given program.
