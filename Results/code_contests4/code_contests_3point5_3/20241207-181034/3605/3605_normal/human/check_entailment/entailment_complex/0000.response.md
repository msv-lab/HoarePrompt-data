Correctness: **False**

The given program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The program is supposed to calculate the minimum number of steps an elephant needs to make to get from point 0 to point x, where the elephant can move 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 positions forward in one step. However, the provided function `func` does not correctly calculate this. It simply takes an input, adds 4 to it, and then tries to divide by 5, which results in a TypeError due to the incorrect syntax.

Therefore, the program does not perform the required calculation to determine the minimum number of steps for the elephant to reach its friend's house. Hence, the Correctness is **False**.
