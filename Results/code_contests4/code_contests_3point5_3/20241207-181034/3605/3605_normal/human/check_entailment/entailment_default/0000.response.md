Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description. The program is supposed to determine the minimum number of steps the elephant needs to make to get from point 0 to point x, where the elephant can move 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 positions forward in one step. However, the provided code simply adds 4 to the input and then divides it by 5, which does not calculate the minimum number of steps correctly. This means the code does not handle the problem as described.
