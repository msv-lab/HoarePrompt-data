#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 1,000,000.**
def func():
    print(input() + 4) / 5
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It prints the result of adding 4 to the input divided by 5. The code contains a syntax error as the division operation is outside the print statement resulting in a TypeError. Therefore, the functionality is to perform an incorrect mathematical operation and raise a TypeError.
