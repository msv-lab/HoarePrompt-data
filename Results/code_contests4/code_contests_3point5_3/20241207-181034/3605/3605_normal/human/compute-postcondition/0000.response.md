Example Answer:
The code tries to print the result of adding 4 to the input value and then dividing the sum by 5. Since the initial state does not provide the specific input value, the output state cannot be determined accurately. However, it can be noted that there is a syntax error in the code as the division operation is outside the print function. Therefore, the code will result in an error.
Output State: **Error: SyntaxError in the code**
