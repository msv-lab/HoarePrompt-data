Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of steps needed for the elephant to reach its friend's house. The program simply adds 4 to the input value and then divides the result by 5, which does not follow the logic described in the problem statement. The correct approach should involve dividing the input value by 5 and then taking the ceiling value to get the minimum number of steps required. 

For example, if the input is 12, the output should be 3 according to the problem description. However, the given program would output 3.2 which is incorrect.
