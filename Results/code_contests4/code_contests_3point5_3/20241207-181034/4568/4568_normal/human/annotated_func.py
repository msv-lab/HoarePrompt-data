If `odd_w` is True and even_w is True for all child nodes, then `odd_ret` and `even_ret` will remain True.
    return odd_ret, even_ret
    #The program returns True for both odd_ret and even_ret if odd_w is True and even_w is True for all child nodes
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts two parameters, `node` and `level`. It checks if `node` is not None and is a word. If the level is odd, it returns True, False; if it's even, it returns False, True. Then, it recursively calls itself on the child nodes of `node`, updating `odd_ret` and `even_ret` based on the return values. The function returns True for both `odd_ret` and `even_ret` if all child nodes return True for `odd_w` and `even_w`.

    return 2
    #The program returns 2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `ttree` and iterates through the child nodes of the root of the tree. It then calls `func_1` on each child to get `odd_w` and `even_w` values. After the loop, it sets `canwin` to True if any `even_w` is True and `canloss` to True if any `odd_w` is True. Depending on the combination of `canwin` and `canloss`, the function returns different integer values: 3, 1, or 2. There are missing annotations for scenarios where neither `canwin` nor `canloss` are True, so the behavior in such cases is not clearly defined based on the provided annotations.
