The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `ttree` and iterates through the child nodes of the root of the tree. It then calls `func_1` on each child to get `odd_w` and `even_w` values. After the loop, it sets `canwin` to True if any `even_w` is True and `canloss` to True if any `odd_w` is True. Depending on the combination of `canwin` and `canloss`, the function returns different integer values: 3, 1, or 2. There are missing annotations for scenarios where neither `canwin` nor `canloss` are True, so the behavior in such cases is not clearly defined based on the provided annotations.
