Postcondition: ***canloss is False, canwin is True, node is assigned the child nodes of the root of the tree, it is the first child node, child is assigned the value of the child node retrieved from node using it, odd_w and even_w are the return values of func_1 when called with child and 0 as arguments. If even_w is True, the program enters the if statement. If odd_w is True, canloss is True, canwin is True, node is assigned the child nodes of the root of the tree, it is the first child node, child is assigned the value of the child node retrieved from node using it, odd_w and even_w are the return values of func_1 when called with child and 0 as arguments, odd_w is True, and even_w is True.***
