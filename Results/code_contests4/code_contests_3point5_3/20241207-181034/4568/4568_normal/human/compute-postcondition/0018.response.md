According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are more child nodes in the `node` list. At the end of the last iteration, the states are as follows: canloss is False, canwin is True, node is assigned the child nodes of the root of the tree, it is the first child node, child is assigned the value of the child node retrieved from node using it, odd_w and even_w are the return values of func_1 when called with child and 0 as arguments, even_w is True, and odd_w is True.

For the loop to execute one more time, the `node` list must have more child nodes, and the loop iterator `it` should be assigned the next child node in the list.

State: **canloss is False, canwin is True, node is assigned the child nodes of the root of the tree, it is the second child node, child is assigned the value of the child node retrieved from node using it, odd_w and even_w are the return values of func_1 when called with child and 0 as arguments, odd_w is True, and even_w is True**
