According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `node`. If `node` has at least 1 child node, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `canloss` is False and `canwin` is False do not directly impact the loop execution, so they can remain unchanged. In order for the loop to execute, `it` should be assigned the first child node in `node`.
State: **`canloss` is False, `canwin` is False, `node` is assigned the child nodes of the root of the ttree, for the loop to execute the first time `it` is assigned the first child node in `node`**
