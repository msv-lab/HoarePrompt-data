Postcondition: ***`canloss` and `canwin` will be True if either `odd_w` or `even_w` is True at least once during the iterations of the loop. `node` will still be assigned the child nodes of the root of the tree, and the variables `child`, `odd_w`, and `even_w` will retain their values after the loop finishes executing. The condition (canloss and canwin) is false***
