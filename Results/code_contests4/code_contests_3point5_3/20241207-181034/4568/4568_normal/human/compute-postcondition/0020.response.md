Example Answer: 
The variables `odd_w` and `even_w` are reassigned the return values of `func_1` when called with `child` and `0` as arguments. Given that `odd_w` is True and `even_w` is True, the new values of `odd_w` and `even_w` will depend on the implementation of `func_1` with the provided arguments. Therefore, the Output State is: canloss is False, canwin is True, node is assigned the child nodes of the root of the tree, it is the second child node, child is assigned the value of the child node retrieved from node using it, `odd_w` and `even_w` are the new return values obtained from `func_1` when called with `child` and `0` as arguments.
Output State: **canloss is False, canwin is True, node is assigned the child nodes of the root of the tree, it is the second child node, child is assigned the value of the child node retrieved from node using it, odd_w and even_w are the new return values obtained from `func_1` when called with `child` and `0` as arguments**
