You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Andrew, Fedor and Alex are inventive guys. Now they invent the game with strings for two players.

Given a group of n non-empty strings. During the game two players build the word together, initially the word is empty. The players move in turns. On his step player must add a single letter in the end of the word, the resulting word must be prefix of at least one string from the group. A player loses if he cannot move.

Andrew and Alex decided to play this game k times. The player who is the loser of the i-th game makes the first move in the (i + 1)-th game. Guys decided that the winner of all games is the player who wins the last (k-th) game. Andrew and Alex already started the game. Fedor wants to know who wins the game if both players will play optimally. Help him.

Input

The first line contains two integers, n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 1 ≤ k ≤ 109).

Each of the next n lines contains a single non-empty string from the given group. The total length of all strings from the group doesn't exceed 105. Each string of the group consists only of lowercase English letters.

Output

If the player who moves first wins, print "First", otherwise print "Second" (without the quotes).

Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_1(node, level):
    if (node is not None and node.isWord) :
        if (level % 2 == 1) :
            return True, False
            #The program returns True, False
        else :
            return False, True
            #The program returns False and True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`node` is not None and `node` is not a word
    nodes = node.childs
    odd_ret = False
    even_ret = False
    for it in nodes:
        child = nodes.get(it)
        
        odd_w, even_w = func_1(child, level + 1)
        
        if odd_w == True:
            odd_ret = True
        
        if even_w == True:
            even_ret = True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `node` is not None and not a word, `nodes` is assigned the child nodes of `node` and not empty, `odd_ret` is True, `even_ret` is True, `it` is the last element in `nodes`, `child` is assigned the child node corresponding to the last element in `nodes`, `odd_w` and `even_w` are the values returned by `func_1` for the last child node and `level + 1`. If `odd_w` is True and even_w is True for all child nodes, then `odd_ret` and `even_ret` will remain True.
    return odd_ret, even_ret
    #The program returns True for both odd_ret and even_ret if odd_w is True and even_w is True for all child nodes
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts two parameters, `node` and `level`. It checks if `node` is not None and is a word. If the level is odd, it returns True, False; if it's even, it returns False, True. Then, it recursively calls itself on the child nodes of `node`, updating `odd_ret` and `even_ret` based on the return values. The function returns True for both `odd_ret` and `even_ret` if all child nodes return True for `odd_w` and `even_w`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_2(ttree):
    canloss = False
    canwin = False
    node = ttree.root.childs
    for it in node:
        child = node.get(it)
        
        odd_w, even_w = func_1(child, 0)
        
        if odd_w == True:
            odd_w = True
        
        if even_w == True:
            even_w = True
        
        if even_w:
            canwin = True
        
        if odd_w:
            canloss = True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `canloss` and `canwin` will be True if either `odd_w` or `even_w` is True at least once during the iterations of the loop. `node` will still be assigned the child nodes of the root of the tree, and the variables `child`, `odd_w`, and `even_w` will retain their values after the loop finishes executing.
    if (canloss and canwin) :
        return 3
        #The program returns the integer 3
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`canloss` and `canwin` will be True if either `odd_w` or `even_w` is True at least once during the iterations of the loop. `node` will still be assigned the child nodes of the root of the tree, and the variables `child`, `odd_w`, and `even_w` will retain their values after the loop finishes executing. The condition (canloss and canwin) is false
    if canloss :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`canloss` and `canwin` will be True if either `odd_w` or `even_w` is True at least once during the iterations of the loop. `node` will still be assigned the child nodes of the root of the tree, and the variables `child`, `odd_w`, and `even_w` will retain their values after the loop finishes executing. The condition (canloss and canwin) is false. `canloss` is false
    return 2
    #The program returns 2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `ttree` and iterates through the child nodes of the root of the tree. It then calls `func_1` on each child to get `odd_w` and `even_w` values. After the loop, it sets `canwin` to True if any `even_w` is True and `canloss` to True if any `odd_w` is True. Depending on the combination of `canwin` and `canloss`, the function returns different integer values: 3, 1, or 2. There are missing annotations for scenarios where neither `canwin` nor `canloss` are True, so the behavior in such cases is not clearly defined based on the provided annotations.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
