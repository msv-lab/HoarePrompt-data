Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem description. The program seems to be related to a tree structure and checking whether the first player can win or not, but it does not follow the rules of the game described in the problem statement involving string manipulation and determining the winner based on the number of games played. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not handle the game logic as described in the problem. Hence, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
