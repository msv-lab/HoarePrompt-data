Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not implemented in a way that accurately determines the winner of the game as described in the problem statement. The annotations in the code do not provide a clear explanation of how the game is being played and how the winner is determined. Additionally, there are missing annotations for scenarios where neither `canwin` nor `canloss` are True, which makes it unclear how the function `func_2` should behave in those cases.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not accurately solve the game described in the problem statement.
