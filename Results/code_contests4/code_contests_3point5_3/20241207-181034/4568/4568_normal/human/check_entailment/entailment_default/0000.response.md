Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
1. The code does not handle the case where both players can win or lose. The function `func_2` iterates through the child nodes of the root of the tree and calls `func_1` on each child to get `odd_w` and `even_w` values. If any `even_w` is True, it sets `canwin` to True, and if any `odd_w` is True, it sets `canloss` to True. However, the code does not account for the scenario where both `canwin` and `canloss` are True. This means that there is a missing annotation for this specific case, which leads to incorrect behavior. 

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and the Correctness is **False**.
