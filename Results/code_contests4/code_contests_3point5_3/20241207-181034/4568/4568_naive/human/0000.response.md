Correctness: **False**

In the given program, the logic for determining the winner of the game is not correct. The function `func_1` is supposed to recursively determine if a player can win or lose the game based on the current state of the trie. However, there are issues with the logic inside the `func_1` function which may lead to incorrect results. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
Input
2 1
ab
ac
Output
Second
```
In this case, the correct output should be "First" because the first player can always win by choosing the last letter of the second string "ac". However, the given program may produce the incorrect output "Second" for this case.

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases, and hence the correctness is **False**.
