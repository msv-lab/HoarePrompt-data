Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of moves Anatoly needs to perform in order to make the colors of cockroaches in the line alternate. It considers both swapping two cockroaches and changing the color of a single cockroach as valid moves. The function `func_1` calculates the number of misplaced cockroaches for both odd and even positions, then determines the minimum number of swaps and color changes required to achieve the desired alternating pattern. The program then outputs the minimum of the results obtained by considering 'r' as oddchar and 'b' as evenchar, and vice versa. Overall, the program addresses the problem description accurately and handles all potential cases.
