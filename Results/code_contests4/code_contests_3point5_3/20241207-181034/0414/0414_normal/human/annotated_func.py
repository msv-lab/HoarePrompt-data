#State of the program right berfore the function call: sequence is a string of length n, oddchar and evenchar are characters 'b' or 'r'.**
def func_1(sequence, oddchar, evenchar):
    length = len(sequence)
    oddmisplaced = 0
    evenmisplaced = 0
    for i in range(length):
        if i % 2 == 0 and sequence[i] != evenchar:
            evenmisplaced = evenmisplaced + 1
        
        if i % 2 == 1 and sequence[i] != oddchar:
            oddmisplaced = oddmisplaced + 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sequence` is a string of length n, `oddmisplaced` is the count of odd indices with characters not equal to `oddchar`, `evenmisplaced` is the count of even indices with characters not equal to `evenchar`
    swaps = min(evenmisplaced, oddmisplaced)
    color = abs(evenmisplaced - oddmisplaced)
    return swaps + color
    #The program returns the sum of the minimum value between `evenmisplaced` and `oddmisplaced` and the absolute difference between `evenmisplaced` and `oddmisplaced`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a string sequence of length n, along with two characters oddchar and evenchar. It then iterates through the sequence and counts the number of odd and even indices where the characters do not match the specified oddchar and evenchar. The function calculates and returns the sum of the minimum value between evenmisplaced and oddmisplaced, added to the absolute difference between evenmisplaced and oddmisplaced.
