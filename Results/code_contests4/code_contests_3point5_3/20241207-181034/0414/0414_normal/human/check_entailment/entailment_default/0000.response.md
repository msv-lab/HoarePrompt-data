Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided seems to correctly implement the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a string sequence of cockroaches along with two characters `oddchar` and `evenchar`, then iterates through the sequence to count the number of odd and even indices where the characters do not match the specified colors. It calculates the minimum number of swaps required to make the colors alternate and returns the result.

The output hints also align with the code, describing the functionality of the `func_1` function accurately. The code handles cases where the colors of cockroaches need to be swapped or changed, and the final result is the minimum number of moves Anatoly needs to perform to achieve the alternating colors in the line.

Overall, based on the code and the provided problem description along with the output hints, the program appears to be correct and meets the requirements for all potential cases.
