Postcondition: ***`sequence` is a string of length n. If `i` is an even number and the character at index `i` is not equal to `evenchar`, then `oddmisplaced` remains 0 and `evenmisplaced` is updated to 1. The loop will execute the first time when `length` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0. Additionally, if `i` is an odd number and the character at index `i` is not equal to `oddchar`, then `oddmisplaced` is incremented by 1.***
