Example Answer:
The variable `length` is assigned the length of the string `sequence`. Since the length of the string is denoted by `n`, the value of `length` is equal to `n`. The values of `oddchar` and `evenchar` are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **sequence is a string of length n, oddchar and evenchar are characters 'b' or 'r'; length is equal to n**
