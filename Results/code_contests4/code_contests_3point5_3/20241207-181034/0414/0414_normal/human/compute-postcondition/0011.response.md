Example Answer:
`evenmisplaced` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `evenmisplaced` was not provided, so the new value after execution is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `sequence` is a string of length n, `i` is 1, `oddmisplaced` is incremented by 1, `evenmisplaced` is 2.
Output State: **`sequence` is a string of length n, `i` is 1, `oddmisplaced` is incremented by 1, `evenmisplaced` is 2**
