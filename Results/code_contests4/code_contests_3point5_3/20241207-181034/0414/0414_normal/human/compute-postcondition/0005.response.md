Example Answer:
`evenmisplaced` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `evenmisplaced` is 0, so after execution, `evenmisplaced` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `sequence` is a string of length n, `oddmisplaced` is 0, `evenmisplaced` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `length` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `i` is an even number, and the character at index `i` in `sequence` is not equal to `evenchar`.
Output State: **`sequence` is a string of length n, `oddmisplaced` is 0, `evenmisplaced` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `length` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `i` is an even number, and the character at index `i` in `sequence` is not equal to `evenchar`**
