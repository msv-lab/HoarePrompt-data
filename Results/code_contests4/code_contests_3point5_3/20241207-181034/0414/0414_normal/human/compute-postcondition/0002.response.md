Example Answer:
`evenmisplaced` is assigned the value 0. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: sequence is a string of length n, oddchar and evenchar are characters 'b' or 'r'; length is equal to n, `oddmisplaced` is 0, `evenmisplaced` is 0.
Output State: **sequence is a string of length n, oddchar and evenchar are characters 'b' or 'r'; length is equal to n, `oddmisplaced` is 0, `evenmisplaced` is 0**
