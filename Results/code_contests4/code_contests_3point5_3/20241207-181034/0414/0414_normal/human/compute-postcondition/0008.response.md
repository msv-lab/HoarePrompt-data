Output State: **`sequence` is a string of length n, `i` is an even number, character at index `i` is not equal to `evenchar`, `oddmisplaced` is 0, `evenmisplaced` is 1. Loop executes when `length` > 0 and `i` = 0. Additionally, `i` is an odd number, character at index `i` is not equal to `oddchar`, `oddmisplaced` is incremented by 1.**
