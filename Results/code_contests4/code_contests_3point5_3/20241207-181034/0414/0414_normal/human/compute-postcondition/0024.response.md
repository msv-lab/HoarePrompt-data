The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `sequence`, `oddchar`, and `evenchar`. `sequence` is a string of length n, where n is the length of the sequence. `oddchar` and `evenchar` are characters 'b' or 'r'. After executing the function body, the program returns the sum of the minimum value between `evenmisplaced` and `oddmisplaced` and the absolute difference between `evenmisplaced` and `oddmisplaced`. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a string sequence of length n, where n is the length of the sequence, and two characters oddchar and evenchar. It then calculates and returns the sum of the minimum value between evenmisplaced and oddmisplaced, along with the absolute difference between evenmisplaced and oddmisplaced.**
