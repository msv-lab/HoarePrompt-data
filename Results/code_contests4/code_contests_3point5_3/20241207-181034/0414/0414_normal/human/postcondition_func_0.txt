The function func_1 accepts a string sequence of length n, along with two characters oddchar and evenchar. It then iterates through the sequence and counts the number of odd and even indices where the characters do not match the specified oddchar and evenchar. The function calculates and returns the sum of the minimum value between evenmisplaced and oddmisplaced, added to the absolute difference between evenmisplaced and oddmisplaced.
