Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of moves required to make the colors of cockroaches in the line alternate. It considers both swapping two cockroaches and changing the color of a single cockroach as possible moves. The function `func_1` calculates the number of misplaced cockroaches for both odd and even positions, then determines the minimum number of swaps and color changes needed. The program handles all possible cases and provides the correct output for the given input examples.
