Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes two integers A and B as input, then checks if A is a divisor of B. If A is a divisor of B, it prints A + B, otherwise it prints B - A. The program correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases as it handles the condition of A being a divisor of B and performs the correct arithmetic operations based on that condition. Additionally, the constraints are met as the input values are checked to be within the range of 1 to 20.
