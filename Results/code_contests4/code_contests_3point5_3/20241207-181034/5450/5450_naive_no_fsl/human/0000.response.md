Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes two integers A and B as input, checks if A is a divisor of B, and then prints either A + B or B - A based on the condition. The logic implemented in the program matches the problem description for all potential cases within the given constraints. The program correctly handles the scenario where A is a divisor of B and where A is not a divisor of B. Therefore, the program is correct for all possible inputs.
