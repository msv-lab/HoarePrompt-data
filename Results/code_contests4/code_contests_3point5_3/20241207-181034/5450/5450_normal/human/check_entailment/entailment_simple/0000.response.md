Correctness: **True**

The program takes two positive integers A and B as input. It then checks if A is a divisor of B by checking if B % A == 0. If A is a divisor of B, it prints the sum of A and B. Otherwise, it prints the difference between B and A. The program correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases as specified in the constraints.
