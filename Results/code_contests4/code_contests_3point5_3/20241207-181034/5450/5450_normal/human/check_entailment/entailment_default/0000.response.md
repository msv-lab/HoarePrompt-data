Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads two integers A and B from user input and correctly calculates the sum of A and B if B is divisible by A, otherwise it calculates the difference between B and A. The code handles the constraints specified in the problem description where A and B are positive integers between 1 and 20. Additionally, the output hints confirm that the code is correctly implementing the logic described in the problem statement. Since there are no edge cases or scenarios identified where the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description, we can conclude that the code is correct.
