Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It reads two integers A and B from the user input, and then checks if A is a divisor of B. If A is a divisor of B, it prints the sum of A and B. If A is not a divisor of B, it prints the difference between B and A. The constraints specified in the problem description are also satisfied by the program. Therefore, the program always does what the problem description asks for.
