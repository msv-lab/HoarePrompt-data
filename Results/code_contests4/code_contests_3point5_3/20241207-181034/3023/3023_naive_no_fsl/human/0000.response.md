Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum total cost required to collect all the balls by choosing two integers p and q optimally. It iterates through all possible pairs of balls, calculates the score for each pair, and keeps track of the minimum score. The program efficiently handles the constraints provided such as the number of balls, coordinates, and the condition that if a ball at coordinates (a - p, b - q) was collected in the previous operation, the cost is 0. Additionally, the program uses defaultdict and sets to store and retrieve the coordinates of the balls, improving efficiency. Overall, the program seems to cover all potential cases and works as expected based on the problem description.
