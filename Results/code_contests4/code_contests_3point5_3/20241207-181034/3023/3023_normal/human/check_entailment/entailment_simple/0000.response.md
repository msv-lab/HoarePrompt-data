Correctness: **True**

The program follows the problem description by implementing the logic to find the minimum total cost required to collect all the balls by choosing the optimal values of `p` and `q`. The program iterates through all possible pairs of balls, calculates the differences in x and y coordinates, and checks if those differences result in a cost lower than the current minimum cost. The `score` function evaluates the cost of collecting all the balls based on the selected `p` and `q` values. The program correctly determines the optimal values of `p` and `q` to minimize the total cost of collecting all the balls.
