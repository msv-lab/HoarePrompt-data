You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those output hints describes certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are N balls in a two-dimensional plane. The i-th ball is at coordinates (x_i, y_i).

We will collect all of these balls, by choosing two integers p and q such that p \neq 0 or q \neq 0 and then repeating the following operation:

* Choose a ball remaining in the plane and collect it. Let (a, b) be the coordinates of this ball. If we collected a ball at coordinates (a - p, b - q) in the previous operation, the cost of this operation is 0. Otherwise, including when this is the first time to do this operation, the cost of this operation is 1.



Find the minimum total cost required to collect all the balls when we optimally choose p and q.

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 50
* |x_i|, |y_i| \leq 10^9
* If i \neq j, x_i \neq x_j or y_i \neq y_j.
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

Functions with output description for each function:
Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    N = read_int()
    balls = []
    for _ in range(N):
        balls.append(read_int_array())
    func_8(func_2(N, balls))
''' 

 Output decription for function1:  The function func_1 reads an integer N, creates a list of N arrays by appending integer arrays to the balls list, and then calls func_8 with the result of func_2(N, balls). The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(n, balls):
    bdict = collections.defaultdict(set)
    for (x, y) in balls:
        bdict[x].add(y)

    tried = set()
    ans = n
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i):
            (p, q) = (balls[j][0] - balls[i][0], balls[j][1] - balls[i][1])
            if (p, q) not in tried:
                tried.add((p, q))
                tried.add((-p, -q))
                points = score(p, q)
                if points < ans:
                    ans = points
    return ans
''' 

 Output decription for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `n` and `balls`. It creates a dictionary `bdict` where each key `x` holds a set of corresponding `y` values from the `balls` list. Then, it iterates over all pairs of balls, calculates the differences in coordinates, calls the `score` function to get points, and updates the minimum `ans` value. Finally, it returns the minimum points value obtained by pairing up all the balls in the list. The function does not handle cases where `n` or `balls` are empty or when the `score` function is not defined.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def score(p, q):
    out = n
    for (x, y) in balls:
        (nx, ny) = (x + p, y + q)
        if ny in bdict.get(nx, []):
            out -= 1
    return out
''' 

 Output decription for function3:  The function `score` accepts two parameters `p` and `q`, both integers. It iterates through a list of 'balls', updating 'nx' and 'ny' based on the values of 'p' and 'q'. If the value of 'ny' is in the list associated with key 'nx' in 'bdict', 'out' is decreased by 1 for each occurrence. The function then returns the final value of 'out'.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    if False and 'PYCHARM_HOSTED' in os.environ:
        func_4()
    else:
        func_1()
''' 

 Output decription for function4:  The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It conditionally calls either `func_4` or `func_1` based on whether 'PYCHARM_HOSTED' is in the os.environ dictionary. The program variables remain unchanged after the if-else block has been executed. The function does not have any specific output defined.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    solution = solve
    test_inputs = None
    test_outputs = None
    judge = None
    slow_solution = None
    if solution is not None:

        if judge is not None:
            func_6(solution, test_inputs, judge)
        if slow_solution is not None:
            func_7(solution, test_inputs, slow_solution)
''' 

 Output decription for function5:  The function `func_4` is a parameterless function that does not accept any input. After execution, it performs certain calculations or logic based on the values of `solution`, `test_inputs`, `test_outputs`, `judge`, and `slow_solution`. The function interacts with other functions `func_5`, `func_6`, and `func_7` based on the conditions of these variables. The final output returned by `func_4` is dependent on the constraints specified for the parameters `N`, `x_i`, and `y_i`. The function does not have a clear defined output based on the annotations, and its actual functionality is not fully specified. It seems to serve as a control flow mechanism for interacting with other functions based on certain conditions.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5(solution, inputs_answers):
    (total, wrong) = (0, 0)
    for (args, test_ans) in inputs_answers:
        ans = solution(*args.copy())

        total += 1
    func_8('ALL %d TESTS PASSED' % total if not wrong else '%d out of %d tests are WRONG' % (wrong, total))
''' 

 Output decription for function6:  The function `func_5` takes two parameters: `solution` representing the solution to a problem and `inputs_answers` containing input-output pairs. It iterates through the input-answer pairs, calls the `solution` function with the input arguments, compares the output to the expected answer, and prints whether the test passed or failed. The function keeps track of the total number of tests and the number of incorrect results. At the end, it prints a summary indicating if all tests passed or how many tests were incorrect. The function does not have a specific return value, as it is used for verification purposes.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6(solution, inputs_gen, judge):
    (total, wrong) = (0, 0)
    for args in inputs_gen:

        total += 1
    func_8('ALL %d TESTS PASSED' % total if not wrong else '%d out of %d tests are WRONG' % (wrong, total))
''' 

 Output decription for function7:  The function `func_6` accepts three parameters: `solution`, `inputs_gen`, and `judge`. It iterates through the inputs generated by `inputs_gen`, applies the `solution` function to the arguments, and checks the result using the `judge` function. It keeps track of the number of correct and wrong answers. Finally, it outputs a message indicating whether all tests passed or the number of wrong tests out of the total. The function does not have a specific return value defined in the provided information.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7(solution, inputs_gen, solution_slow):
    (total, wrong) = (0, 0)
    for args in inputs_gen:

        total += 1
    func_8('ALL %d TESTS PASSED' % total if not wrong else '%d out of %d tests are WRONG' % (wrong, total))
''' 

 Output decription for function8:  The function `func_7` iterates over a generator `inputs_gen` containing arguments, calls the `solution` and `solution_slow` functions with each set of arguments after making deep copies, compares the results, and increments a counter for any mismatches. It then outputs the total number of tests run and the number of test mismatches. If all tests pass, it will print 'ALL %d TESTS PASSED', otherwise it will print '%d out of %d tests are WRONG'. The function does not explicitly return a value.

 Output decription for function9:  The function `func_8` does not accept any parameters explicitly. However, it processes keyword arguments (kwargs) such as 'sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush'. The function iterates over the arguments provided in args, writes them to the specified file or sys.stdout with the given separator, and appends the 'end' character at the end. If the 'flush' key is present and set to True in kwargs, the file will be flushed. The function provides flexibility in handling input arguments and writing them to a stream or file.



First I want you to try to see if the program (including all the functions) does what the description says. Look at only the code and the description and make an initial assesment.Try to think of any edge cases that the code might not be handling.

Then I want you to see if the output hints agree with the code. Sometimes the output hints hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the output hints says are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to make a more informed decision and detrmine if the code is correct or not.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code.
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
