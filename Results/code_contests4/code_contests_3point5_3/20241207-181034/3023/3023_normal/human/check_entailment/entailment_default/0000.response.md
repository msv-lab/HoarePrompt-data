Based on the provided code and problem description, let's analyze if the program is correct or not.

Initial Assessment:
The program seems to be aimed at finding the minimum total cost required to collect all balls by choosing optimal p and q values. The code includes functions to read input, iterate over balls, calculate scores, and determine the minimum cost. The main function `func_1` orchestrates the overall process.

Edge Cases:
1. The program should handle the constraints specified for the input range and number of balls.
2. The program should correctly calculate the minimum cost to collect all balls by choosing the optimal p and q values.
3. The code should consider all possible combinations of p and q to find the minimum total cost.

Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints provide details about the functions involved in the program and their purpose. They describe the functionality of each function and how they contribute to determining the minimum cost. The hints mention the use of dictionaries, sets, and iteration to find the optimal solution.

Considering the initial assessment and the output hints, it seems that the code is correctly implemented to find the minimum total cost required to collect all balls. The functions are appropriately structured to handle the problem description, and the output hints align with the code logic.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code has been structured to iterate over pairs of balls, calculate the difference in coordinates, and find the minimum cost by considering all possible combinations of p and q. The functions work together to efficiently determine the optimal solution, as described in the problem statement. The code handles the given constraints and edge cases, ensuring that the minimum total cost is accurately calculated in all scenarios.
