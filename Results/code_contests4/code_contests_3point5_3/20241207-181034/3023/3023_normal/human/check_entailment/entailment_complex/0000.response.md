Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_2` calculates the minimum total cost required to collect all the balls by pairing them up based on their coordinates. However, the implementation does not consider the condition where the balls are aligned in a straight line, which would require a different approach to minimize the cost. For example, if all balls are in a straight line either horizontally or vertically, the current logic of pairing them based on differences in coordinates will not yield the correct minimum cost.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
