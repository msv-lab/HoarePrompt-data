Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `n` and `balls`. It creates a dictionary `bdict` where each key `x` holds a set of corresponding `y` values from the `balls` list. Then, it iterates over all pairs of balls, calculates the differences in coordinates, calls the `score` function to get points, and updates the minimum `ans` value. Finally, it returns the minimum points value obtained by pairing up all the balls in the list. The function does not handle cases where `n` or `balls` are empty or when the `score` function is not defined. **
