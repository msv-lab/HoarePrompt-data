Functionality: ** The function `func_5` takes two parameters: `solution` representing the solution to a problem and `inputs_answers` containing input-output pairs. It iterates through the input-answer pairs, calls the `solution` function with the input arguments, compares the output to the expected answer, and prints whether the test passed or failed. The function keeps track of the total number of tests and the number of incorrect results. At the end, it prints a summary indicating if all tests passed or how many tests were incorrect. The function does not have a specific return value, as it is used for verification purposes.**
