Example Answer:
The `pop` method removes and returns the value of the key 'end' from the dictionary `kwargs`. If 'end' is not present in `kwargs`, '\n' is returned. The `write` method writes the returned value to the file. Since the value of 'end' is not specified in the initial state, '\n' will be written to the file. Therefore, the Output State is: at_start is False, '\n' is written to the file.
Output State: **at_start is False, '\n' is written to the file**
