Output State: **`bdict` is a defaultdict of sets with all `y` values added to the corresponding sets for each `x` from the `balls` list, `tried` contains all unique tuples `(p, q)` and `(-p, -q)` where `p` and `q` are the differences in x and y coordinates between all pairs of balls, `ans` is the minimum score calculated for all pairs of balls, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0. The loop iterates over all possible combinations of `p` and `q` for each pair of `balls`, updates `tried` with each unique tuple and its negative, calculates the score using `score` function, and updates `ans` with the minimum score calculated.**
