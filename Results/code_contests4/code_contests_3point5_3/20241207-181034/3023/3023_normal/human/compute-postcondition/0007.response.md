Example Answer:
The value of `x` is converted to a string using `str()` and then written to the file. The values of `N`, `x_i`, and `y_i` remain unchanged. If `at_start` is False, then the separator specified by `sep` is written to the file. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer, x_i, y_i are integers such that 1 <= i <= N and |x_i|, |y_i| <= 10^9. If not at_start, the separator specified by `sep` is written to the file.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, x_i, y_i are integers such that 1 <= i <= N and |x_i|, |y_i| <= 10^9. If not at_start, the separator specified by `sep` is written to the file.**
