Output State: **`bdict` is a defaultdict of sets with all `y` values added to the corresponding sets for each `x` from the `balls` list, `tried` contains all unique tuples `(p, q)` and `(-p, -q)` where `p` and `q` are the differences in x and y coordinates between all pairs of balls, `ans` is the minimum score calculated for all pairs of balls, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `j` needs to be greater than 1 for the loop to execute a second time, `p` and `q` are calculated based on the differences in x and y coordinates between the balls at index `j` and `i`, and a new tuple `(p, q)` is added to `tried`.**
