Example Answer:
The code snippet removes the 'sep' and 'file' key-value pairs from the 'kwargs' dictionary if they exist and assigns their values to 'sep' and 'file' variables. If 'sep' and 'file' keys are not present in 'kwargs', then 'sep' is assigned the default value ' ' (space) and 'file' is assigned the value 'sys.stdout'. The other variables and initial state remain unchanged.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, x_i, y_i are integers such that 1 <= i <= N and |x_i|, |y_i| <= 10^9.**
