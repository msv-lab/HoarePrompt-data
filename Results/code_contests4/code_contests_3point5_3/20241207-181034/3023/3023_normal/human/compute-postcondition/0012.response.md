Example Answer: 
The code writes the string representation of `x` to the file. The value of `x` is not given in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact output. The variable `at_start` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: at_start is False.
Output State: **at_start is False**
