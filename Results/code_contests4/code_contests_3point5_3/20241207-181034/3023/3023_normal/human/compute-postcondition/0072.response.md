Example Answer:
The function `score(p, q)` is called with the values `p` and `q` from each tuple in `tried`. Since the initial state is not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of `p` and `q`. However, the function `score(p, q)` will return a value based on the input `p` and `q`. Therefore, the Output State is: `tried` contains all unique tuples `(p, q)` and `(-p, -q)` where `p` and `q` are the differences in x and y coordinates between all pairs of balls, and `(p, q)` has been added to `tried`, and the function `score(p, q)` has been called with unknown values of `p` and `q`.
Output State: **`tried` contains all unique tuples `(p, q)` and `(-p, -q)` where `p` and `q` are the differences in x and y coordinates between all pairs of balls, and `(p, q)` has been added to `tried`, and the function `score(p, q)` has been called with unknown values of `p` and `q**`.
