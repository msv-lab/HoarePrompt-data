Example Answer:
The tuple `(p, q)` is added to the set `tried`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `bdict` is a defaultdict of sets with all `y` values added to the corresponding sets for each `x` from the `balls` list, `tried` contains the tuples `(p, q)`, `(-p, -q)`, `ans` is assigned the value of `points`, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 3, `p` is the difference in x coordinates between balls at indices 3 and 0, `q` is the difference in y coordinates between balls at indices 3 and 0, `points` is the result of calling the function `score` with arguments `p` and `q.
