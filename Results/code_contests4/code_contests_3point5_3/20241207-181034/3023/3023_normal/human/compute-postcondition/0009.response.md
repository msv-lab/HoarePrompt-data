According to the code, the loop can execute one more time as long as there are more elements in the `args` collection. At the end of the last iteration, `at_start` is False. In order for the loop to execute again, there must be at least one more element in the `args` collection.
State: **at_start is False, for the loop to execute one more time there must be at least one more element in the args collection**
