Output State: **`bdict` is a defaultdict of sets with all `y` values added to the corresponding sets for each `x` from the `balls` list, `tried` contains all unique tuples `(p, q)` and `(-p, -q)` where `p` and `q` are the differences in x and y coordinates between all pairs of balls, `ans` is the minimum score calculated for all pairs of balls, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute `i` is greater than or equal to 0, `tried` has been updated to include the tuple `(p, q), (-p, -q)`**
