The function `func_8` does not accept any parameters. However, based on the provided constraints, it can be inferred that the function is expected to handle a positive integer `N`, and integers `x_i` and `y_i` where `1 <= i <= N` and `|x_i|, |y_i| <= 10^9`. The function is expected to perform some operations based on these inputs and return a specific output.
