Postcondition: ***`bdict` is a defaultdict of sets with all `y` values added to the corresponding sets for each `x` from the `balls` list, `tried` contains the tuples `(p, q)`, `(-p, -q)`, `ans` is assigned the value of `points`. If `(p, q)` is not in `tried`, `(p, q)` is added to `tried`, `tried` also contains the tuple `(-p, -q)`, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `p` is the difference in x coordinates between balls at indices 1 and 0, `q` is the difference in y coordinates between balls at indices 1 and 0, `points` is the result of calling the function `score` with arguments `p` and `q, `p` is updated to `balls[2][0] - balls[0][0]`, `q` is updated to `balls[2][1] - balls[0][1`, If `points` is less than `ans`, then the overall state of the program remains the same.***
