Example Answer:
The `points` variable is assigned the result of the `score(p, q)` function with unknown values of `p` and `q`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `bdict` is a defaultdict of sets with all `y` values added to the corresponding sets for each `x` from the `balls` list, `tried` contains all unique tuples `(p, q)` and `(-p, -q)` where `p` and `q` are the differences in x and y coordinates between all pairs of balls, `(-p, -q)` has been added to `tried`, `points` variable is assigned the result of the `score(p, q)` function, `ans` is assigned the value of `points`, `i`, `n`, `j`, `p`, and `q` remain unchanged, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be greater than the current `i` value, `p` and `q` are assigned the differences in x and y coordinates between `balls[j]` and `balls[i]`.
