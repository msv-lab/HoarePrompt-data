Postcondition: ***`bdict` is a defaultdict of sets with all `y` values added to the corresponding sets for each `x` from the `balls` list. `tried` contains all unique tuples `(p, q)` and `(-p, -q)` where `p` and `q` are the differences in x and y coordinates between all pairs of balls, and `(p, q)` has been added to `tried`. The function `score(p, q)` has been called with unknown values of `p` and `q. Additionally, `points` variable is less than `ans`, and `ans` is assigned the value of `points`. The values of `i`, `n`, `j`, `p`, and `q` remain unchanged.***
