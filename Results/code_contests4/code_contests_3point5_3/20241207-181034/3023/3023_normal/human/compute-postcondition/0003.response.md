According to the code, the loop can execute if the args list has at least 1 element. Since N is a positive integer, it already satisfies the condition that args has at least 1 element. At the start, at_start is True. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, x is the first element in args.
State: **N is a positive integer, x_i, y_i are integers such that 1 <= i <= N and |x_i|, |y_i| <= 10^9, at_start is True, for the loop to execute the first time x is the first element in args**
