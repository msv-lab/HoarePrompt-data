According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `args`. If there are more elements in `args`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `at_start` is False. For the loop to be executed one more time, there must be more elements in `args`.
State: **at_start is False, for the loop to execute one more time, `args` must have more elements**
