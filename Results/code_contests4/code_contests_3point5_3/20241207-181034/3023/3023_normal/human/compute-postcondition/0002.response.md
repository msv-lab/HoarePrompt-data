Example Answer:
`at_start` is assigned the boolean value `True`. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is: N is a positive integer, x_i, y_i are integers such that 1 <= i <= N and |x_i|, |y_i| <= 10^9, at_start is True.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, x_i, y_i are integers such that 1 <= i <= N and |x_i|, |y_i| <= 10^9, at_start is True**
