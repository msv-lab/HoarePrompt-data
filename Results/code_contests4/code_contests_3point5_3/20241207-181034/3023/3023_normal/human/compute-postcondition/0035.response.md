Postcondition: ***`bdict` is a defaultdict of sets with all `y` values added to the corresponding sets for each `x` from the `balls` list, `tried` contains the tuples `(p, q)`, `(-p, -q)`, `(-p, -q)`, `ans` is assigned the value of `points`, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 3, `p` is the difference in x coordinates between balls at indices 3 and 0, `q` is the difference in y coordinates between balls at indices 3 and 0, `points` is the result of calling the function `score` with arguments `p` and `q, `tried` now includes the tuple `(-p, -q)`, `points` is the result of calling the function `score` with arguments `p` and `q. If `points` is less than `ans`, the program remains in the same state without any changes.***
