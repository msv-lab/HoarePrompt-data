Output State: **`bdict` is a defaultdict of sets with all `y` values added to the corresponding sets for each `x` from the `balls` list. `tried` contains all unique tuples `(p, q)` and `(-p, -q)` where `p` and `q` are the differences in x and y coordinates between all pairs of balls. The function `score(p, q)` has been called with various values of `p` and `q`, resulting in different `points` values. The `ans` variable holds the minimum `points` value calculated for all pairs of balls. `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is greater than 0.**
