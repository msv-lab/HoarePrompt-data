Example Answer:
The differences in x and y coordinates between the balls at indices `j` and `i` are calculated and assigned to variables `p` and `q`. The previous values of `balls`, `tried`, `ans`, `i`, `n`, and `j` are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **`bdict` is a defaultdict of sets with all `y` values added to the corresponding sets for each `x` from the `balls` list, `tried` contains all unique tuples `(p, q)` and `(-p, -q)` where `p` and `q` are the differences in x and y coordinates between all pairs of balls, `ans` is the minimum score calculated for all pairs of balls, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `p` and `q` are the differences in x and y coordinates between balls at indices `j` and `i`.**
