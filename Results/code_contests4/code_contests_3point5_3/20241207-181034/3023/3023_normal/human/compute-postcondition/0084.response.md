Postcondition: ***`bdict` is a defaultdict of sets with all `y` values added to the corresponding sets for each `x` from the `balls` list. `tried` contains all unique tuples `(p, q)` and `(-p, -q)` where `p` and `q` are the differences in x and y coordinates between all pairs of balls, `(p, q)` has been added to `tried`. The function `score(p, q)` has been called with the values of `p` and `q`, and `points` variable is assigned the result of this function. If `(p, q)` is not in `tried` and `points` is less than `ans`, then `ans` is updated to the value of `points`. The values of `i`, `n`, `j`, `p`, and `q` remain unchanged, and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be greater than the current `i` value.***
