The function `func_8` does not accept any parameters explicitly. However, it processes keyword arguments (kwargs) such as 'sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush'. The function iterates over the arguments provided in args, writes them to the specified file or sys.stdout with the given separator, and appends the 'end' character at the end. If the 'flush' key is present and set to True in kwargs, the file will be flushed. The function provides flexibility in handling input arguments and writing them to a stream or file.
