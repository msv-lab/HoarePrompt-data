The function `func_6` accepts three parameters: `solution`, `inputs_gen`, and `judge`. It iterates through the inputs generated by `inputs_gen`, applies the `solution` function to the arguments, and checks the result using the `judge` function. It keeps track of the number of correct and wrong answers. Finally, it outputs a message indicating whether all tests passed or the number of wrong tests out of the total. The function does not have a specific return value defined in the provided information.
