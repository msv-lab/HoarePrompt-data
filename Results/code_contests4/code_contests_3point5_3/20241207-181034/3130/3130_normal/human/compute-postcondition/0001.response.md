Example Answer:
Two variables are affected by this code snippet. `out` is assigned a list of `-1` values with a length of `n`, and `que` is initialized as an empty deque. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer input, `a` is a list of integers with specified range, `out` is a list of `-1` values with length equal to `n`, `que` is an empty deque.
Output State: **`n` is an integer input, `a` is a list of integers with specified range, `out` is a list of `-1` values with length equal to `n`, `que` is an empty deque**
