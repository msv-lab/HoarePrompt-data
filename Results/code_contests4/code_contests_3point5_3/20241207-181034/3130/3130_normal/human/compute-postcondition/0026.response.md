Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, elements in list `a` are within the specified range. `out` has a length equal to `n` with updated value at index `ix` as `lev`. `que` is a deque with tuples (i, 0) where `n` + 1 tuples are present with updated values of i increased by 1 for each index `i` where `a[i]` is false and `ix - 1` is within the range of the list `a` and `n`.**
