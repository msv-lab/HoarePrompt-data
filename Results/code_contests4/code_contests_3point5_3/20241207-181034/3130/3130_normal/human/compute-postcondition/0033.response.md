Example Answer:
The values of `ix` and `lev` are dequeued from `que` using `que.popleft()`. The values of `ix` and `lev` are updated accordingly. The length of `out` remains the same as `n`, and the elements at index `ix` in `out` are updated to `lev`. The deque `que` now has one less tuple. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, elements in list `a` are within the specified range, `out` has a length equal to `n` with updated value at index `ix` as `lev`, `que` is a deque with appropriate tuples, and `que` might be empty for the loop to execute again.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, elements in list `a` are within the specified range, `out` has a length equal to `n` with updated value at index `ix` as `lev`, `que` is a deque with appropriate tuples, and `que` might be empty for the loop to execute again**
