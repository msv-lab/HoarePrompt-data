Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, elements in list `a` are within the specified range, `out` has a length equal to `n` with updated value at index `ix` as `lev`, `que` is a deque with tuples (i, 0) where one tuple (i, 0) was already present and `n` tuples are present with updated values of i increased by 1 for each index `i` where `a[i]` is false, `ix` is the index from the deque tuple popped, `lev` is the level associated with the popped tuple. Additionally, the condition (0 <= ix + 1 <= n - 1) is satisfied***
