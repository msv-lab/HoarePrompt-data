Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, elements in list `a` are within the specified range. `out` has a length equal to `n` with updated values at corresponding indices. `que` is a deque with tuples (i, lev) where `lev` denotes the level associated with the popped tuple. The loop will execute until `que` is empty, and all valid indices `ix` will have their corresponding `lev` values updated in `out`. The values in `out` are printed with spaces in between.**
