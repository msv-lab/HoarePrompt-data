Example Answer:
`(ix + 1, lev + 1)` is appended to the deque `que`. The values of `ix` and `lev` are incremented by 1 before appending to `que`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, elements in list `a` are within the specified range, `out` has a length equal to `n` with updated value at index `ix` as `lev`, `que` is a deque with appropriate tuples, and `que` might be empty for the loop to execute again, `(ix + 1, lev + 1)` is appended to `que`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, elements in list `a` are within the specified range, `out` has a length equal to `n` with updated value at index `ix` as `lev`, `que` is a deque with appropriate tuples, and `que` might be empty for the loop to execute again, `(ix + 1, lev + 1)` is appended to `que`**
