According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the deque `que` is not empty. Right before the loop, `que` is a deque with tuples (i, 0) where one tuple (i, 0) was already present and `n` tuples are present with updated values of i increased by 1 for each index `i` where `a[i]` is false. So, in order for the loop to execute one more time, the deque `que` should have at least one more tuple added to it.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, elements in list `a` are within the specified range, `out` still has a length equal to `n` with all values as -1, `que` is a deque with tuples (i, 0) where one tuple (i, 0) was already present and `n+1` tuples are present with updated values of i increased by 1 for each index `i` where `a[i]` is false**
