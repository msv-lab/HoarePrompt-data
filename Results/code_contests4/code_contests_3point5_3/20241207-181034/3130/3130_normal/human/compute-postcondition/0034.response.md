Example Answer:
The value at index `ix` in the list `out` is updated to `lev`. All other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, elements in list `a` are within the specified range, `out` has a length equal to `n` with updated value at index `ix` as `lev`, `que` is a deque with appropriate tuples, and `que` might be empty for the loop to execute again**
