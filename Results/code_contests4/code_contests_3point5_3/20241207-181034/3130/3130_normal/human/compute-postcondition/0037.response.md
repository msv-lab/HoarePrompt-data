Example Answer:
The code appends the tuple `(ix - 1, lev + 1)` to the deque `que`. The value of `ix` is decreased by 1, and the value of `lev` is increased by 1 when appending the tuple. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, elements in list `a` are within the specified range, `out` has a length equal to `n` with updated value at index `ix` as `lev`, `que` is a deque with appropriate tuples, and `que` might be empty for the loop to execute again. If 0 <= ix + 1 <= n - 1, `(ix + 1, lev + 1)` is appended to `que`, `(ix - 1, lev + 1)` is also appended to `que`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, elements in list `a` are within the specified range, `out` has a length equal to `n` with updated value at index `ix` as `lev`, `que` is a deque with appropriate tuples, and `que` might be empty for the loop to execute again. If 0 <= ix + 1 <= n - 1, `(ix + 1, lev + 1)` is appended to `que`, `(ix - 1, lev + 1)` is also appended to `que`**
