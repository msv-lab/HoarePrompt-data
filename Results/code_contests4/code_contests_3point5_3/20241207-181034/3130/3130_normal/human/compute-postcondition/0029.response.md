Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, elements in list `a` are within the specified range, `out` has a length equal to `n` with updated value at index `ix` as `lev`, `que` is a deque with tuples (i, 0) where `n` + 1 tuples are present with updated values of i increased by 1 for each index `i` where `a[i]` is false and `ix - 1` is within the range of the list `a` and `n`. Additionally, a new tuple `(ix + 1, lev + 1)` is appended to `que` if 0 <= ix + 1 <= n - 1. A new tuple `(ix - 1, lev + 1)` is appended to `que`.**
