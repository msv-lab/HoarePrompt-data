According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the list `a` should have elements within the specified range, `out` should have a length equal to `n` with all values as `-1`, and `que` should be an empty deque. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: `n` is greater than 0, elements in list `a` are within the specified range, `out` has a length equal to `n` with all values as `-1`, and `que` is an empty deque.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, elements in list `a` are within the specified range, `out` has a length equal to `n` with all values as `-1`, `que` is an empty deque**
