According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, elements in list `a` are within the specified range, `out` has a length equal to `n` with all values as -1, `que` is a deque with one tuple (i, 0) appended to it. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `n` remains greater than 0, elements in list `a` are within the specified range, `out` still has a length equal to `n` with all values as -1, `que` still contains the tuple (i, 0), and `i` is increased by 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, elements in list `a` are within the specified range, `out` still has a length equal to `n` with all values as -1, `que` is a deque with one tuple (i, 0) appended to it, for the loop to execute another time `i` is increased by 1**
