According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `que`. If `que` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the states are as follows:
- `n` is greater than 0
- elements in list `a` are within the specified range
- `out` has a length equal to `n` with updated value at index `ix` as `lev`
- `que` is a deque with tuples (i, 0) where `n` + 1 tuples are present with updated values of i increased by 1 for each index `i` where `a[i]` is false and `ix - 1` is within the range of the list `a` and `n`
- Additionally, a new tuple `(ix + 1, lev + 1)` is appended to `que` if 0 <= ix + 1 <= n - 1
- A new tuple `(ix - 1, lev + 1)` is appended to `que` if `out[ix] != -1`

Based on the above states, in order for the loop to execute one more time, the following state needs to be adjusted:
- `que` should not be empty

State: **`n` is greater than 0, elements in list `a` are within the specified range, `out` has a length equal to `n` with updated value at index `ix` as `lev`, `que` is a deque with appropriate tuples, and `que` is not empty for the loop to execute again**.
