Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which is an integer input. `a` is assigned a list of integers created by converting each element from the input separated by spaces. The elements of `a` can range from -10^9 to 10^9. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer input, a is a list of integers with specified range.
Output State: **n is an integer input, a is a list of integers with specified range**
