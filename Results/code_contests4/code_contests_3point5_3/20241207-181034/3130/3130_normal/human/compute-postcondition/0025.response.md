Example Answer:
The tuple (i, 0) is popped from the left side of the deque `que`, and its values are assigned to `ix` and `lev`. The deque `que` loses one tuple and `ix` and `lev` are updated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, elements in list `a` are within the specified range. `out` has a length equal to `n` with updated value at index `ix` as `lev`. `que` is a deque with tuples (i, 0) where `n` + 1 tuples are present with updated values of i increased by 1 for each index `i` where `a[i]` is false. `ix` is the index from the deque tuple popped, `lev` is the level associated with the popped tuple after the execution of the program fragment. Additionally, the index `ix - 1` is within the range of the list `a` and `n`, where `a[ix - 1]` is a valid element, and for the loop to execute again `que` should not be empty.
