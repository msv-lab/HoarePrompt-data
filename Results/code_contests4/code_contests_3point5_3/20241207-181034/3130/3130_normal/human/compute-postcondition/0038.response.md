Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, elements in list `a` are within the specified range, `out` has a length equal to `n` with updated value at index `ix` as `lev`, `que` is a deque with appropriate tuples, and `que` might be empty for the loop to execute again. If 0 <= ix + 1 <= n - 1, `(ix + 1, lev + 1)` is appended to `que`, and `(ix - 1, lev + 1)` is also appended to `que` if 0 <= ix - 1 <= n - 1.***
