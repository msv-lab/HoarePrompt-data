Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, elements in list `a` are within the specified range, `out` still has a length equal to `n` with all values as -1, `que` is a deque with tuples (i, 0) where one tuple (i, 0) was already present and three tuples are present with updated values of i increased by 1 if not a[i].***
