The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of integers, then processes the elements of `a` based on certain conditions. It initializes two lists, `out` and `que`, with initial values. It iterates over the elements of `a` and updates the queues `que` accordingly. The function then processes the elements in `que` to update the `out` list with certain conditions. Finally, it prints the updated `out` list as space-separated integers.
