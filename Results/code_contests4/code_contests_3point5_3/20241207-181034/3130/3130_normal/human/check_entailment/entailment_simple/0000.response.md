Correctness: **True**

The program correctly finds the distance to the nearest zero element for each element in the input array. It uses a breadth-first search approach starting from the zero elements and updating the distances to each element accordingly. The final output is the sequence of distances as required by the problem description. The program handles all cases where there is at least one zero element in the input array and produces the correct output.
