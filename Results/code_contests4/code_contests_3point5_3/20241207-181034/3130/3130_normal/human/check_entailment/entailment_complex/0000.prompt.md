You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given the array of integer numbers a0, a1, ..., an - 1. For each element find the distance to the nearest zero (to the element which equals to zero). There is at least one zero element in the given array.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·105) — length of the array a. The second line contains integer elements of the array separated by single spaces ( - 109 ≤ ai ≤ 109).

Output

Print the sequence d0, d1, ..., dn - 1, where di is the difference of indices between i and nearest j such that aj = 0. It is possible that i = j.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5. The array a contains integer elements with -10^9 <= ai <= 10^9.**
def func():
    n, a = int(input()), [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    out, que = [-1] * n, deque()
    for i in range(n):
        if not a[i]:
            que.append((i, 0))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is greater than 0, elements in list `a` are within the specified range, `out` still has a length equal to `n` with all values as -1, `que` is a deque with tuples (i, 0) where one tuple (i, 0) was already present and `n` tuples are present with updated values of i increased by 1 for each index `i` where `a[i]` is false.
    while que:
        ix, lev = que.popleft()
        
        if out[ix] != -1:
            out[ix] = lev
            if 0 <= ix + 1 <= n - 1:
                que.append((ix + 1, lev + 1))
            if 0 <= ix - 1 <= n - 1:
                que.append((ix - 1, lev + 1))
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is greater than 0, elements in list `a` are within the specified range. `out` has a length equal to `n` with updated values at corresponding indices. `que` is a deque with tuples (i, lev) where `lev` denotes the level associated with the popped tuple. The loop will execute until `que` is empty, and all valid indices `ix` will have their corresponding `lev` values updated in `out`.
    print(' '.join(map(str, out)))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of integers, then processes the elements of `a` based on certain conditions. It initializes two lists, `out` and `que`, with initial values. It iterates over the elements of `a` and updates the queues `que` accordingly. The function then processes the elements in `que` to update the `out` list with certain conditions. Finally, it prints the updated `out` list as space-separated integers.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
