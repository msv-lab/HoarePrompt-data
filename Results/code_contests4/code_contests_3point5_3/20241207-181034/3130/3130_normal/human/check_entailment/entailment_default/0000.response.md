Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the input integer `n` and the list `a` of integers.
- It initializes two lists, `out` and `que`, with initial values of -1 and an empty deque, respectively.
- It iterates over the elements of the list `a` and updates the queue `que` with the indices of elements that are zeros.
- It then processes the elements in the queue `que` by updating the `out` list with the distances based on the indices of zeros.
- Finally, it prints the updated `out` list as space-separated integers.

The code correctly implements the logic to find the distance to the nearest zero for each element in the list as required by the problem description. The output hints also agree with the code in terms of the processing steps and the final output. Therefore, the code is correct.
