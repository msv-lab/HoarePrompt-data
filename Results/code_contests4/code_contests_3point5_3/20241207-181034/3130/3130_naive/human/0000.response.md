Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly finds the distance to the nearest zero for each element in the array. It uses a queue to efficiently traverse the array, updating the distance values as it goes along. The program ensures that the output for each element is the correct distance to the nearest zero element, as specified in the problem description. The logic of the program seems to handle all edge cases and potential scenarios, making it correct.
