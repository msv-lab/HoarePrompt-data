Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly finds the distance to the nearest zero for each element in the array as described in the problem statement. It initializes an output array with -1 values, then uses a deque to perform a breadth-first search starting from the zero elements in the array. The program updates the output array with the distance to the nearest zero element and continues the search in both directions until all elements have been processed. The output is then printed in the required format. The program handles all potential cases and works as expected for the given problem description.
