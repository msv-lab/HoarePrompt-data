Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The annotated program provided does not contain any actual implementation of the function `func_1`. It only describes the constraints of the input parameters and does not provide any logic or code to actually sort the arrays as described in the problem description. Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description requirements.
