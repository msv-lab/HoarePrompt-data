The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function calculates the sum of p1, p2, p3, and p4, and then computes the result of raising this sum to the power of a and taking the remainder when divided by b. The function returns this final result. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to calculate the result of raising the sum of p1, p2, p3, and p4 to the power of a and finding the remainder when divided by b.
