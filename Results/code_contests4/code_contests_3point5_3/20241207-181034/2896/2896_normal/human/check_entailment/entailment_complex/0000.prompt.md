You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Little Petya was given this problem for homework:

You are given function <image> (here <image> represents the operation of taking the remainder). His task is to count the number of integers x in range [a;b] with property f(x) = x.

It is a pity that Petya forgot the order in which the remainders should be taken and wrote down only 4 numbers. Each of 24 possible orders of taking the remainder has equal probability of being chosen. For example, if Petya has numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 then he can take remainders in that order or first take remainder modulo 4, then modulo 2, 3, 1. There also are 22 other permutations of these numbers that represent orders in which remainder can be taken. In this problem 4 numbers wrote down by Petya will be pairwise distinct.

Now it is impossible for Petya to complete the task given by teacher but just for fun he decided to find the number of integers <image> with property that probability that f(x) = x is not less than 31.4159265352718281828459045%. In other words, Petya will pick up the number x if there exist at least 7 permutations of numbers p1, p2, p3, p4, for which f(x) = x.

Input

First line of the input will contain 6 integers, separated by spaces: p1, p2, p3, p4, a, b (1 ≤ p1, p2, p3, p4 ≤ 1000, 0 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 31415). 

It is guaranteed that numbers p1, p2, p3, p4 will be pairwise distinct.

Output

Output the number of integers in the given range that have the given property.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: p1, p2, p3, p4, a, b are integers such that 1 ≤ p1, p2, p3, p4 ≤ 1000 and 0 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 31415.
def func():
    p1, p2, p3, p4, a, b = map(int, raw_input().split())
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads input values for p1, p2, p3, p4, a, and b. It then calculates the sum of p1, p2, p3, and p4, raises this sum to the power of a, and returns the remainder when divided by b. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
