Example Answer: 
`ss` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`. Since `raw_input()` is not a valid function in Python 3, this code will result in an error. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an input value and an error occurs due to the use of `raw_input()`.
Output State: **`N` is an input value and an error occurs due to the use of `raw_input()`**
