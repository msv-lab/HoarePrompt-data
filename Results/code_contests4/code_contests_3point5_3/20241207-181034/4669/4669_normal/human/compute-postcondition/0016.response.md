Example Answer: 
Variable `a` is assigned an empty string. The values of other variables remain the same as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: Error: `raw_input()` is not a valid function, `ss` is not defined, `s` is a list of substrings, and `s` has a length of 1; `a` is an empty string.
Output State: **Error: `raw_input()` is not a valid function, `ss` is not defined, `s` is a list of substrings, and `s` has a length of 1; `a` is an empty string**
