Example Answer:
The code snippet `print(s)` will print the value of the variable `s`, which is a joined string. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: Error: `raw_input()` is not a valid function, `ss` is not defined, `s` is a joined string.
Output State: **Error: `raw_input()` is not a valid function, `ss` is not defined, `s` is a joined string**
