Example Answer:
`s` is split using the delimiter '()', resulting in a list of substrings. Since `s` is a single string, it will be split into two substrings. The Error: `raw_input()` is not a valid function, `ss` is not defined, `s` is defined and a single string.
Output State: **Error: `raw_input()` is not a valid function, `ss` is not defined, `s` is defined and a single string**
