Example Answer:
An error occurs due to the use of `raw_input()` which is not a valid function in Python 3. The code snippet `s = ss.split('()')` cannot be executed as `ss` is not defined. Therefore, the program cannot proceed and an error is encountered.
Output State: **Error: `raw_input()` is not a valid function, `ss` is not defined**
