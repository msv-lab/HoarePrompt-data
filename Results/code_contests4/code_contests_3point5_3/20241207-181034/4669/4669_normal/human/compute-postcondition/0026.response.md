Postcondition: ***`raw_input()` is not a valid function, `ss` is not defined, `s` is a string containing the first substring of the original list, `a` is a string containing the character ')' concatenated to it if `s[i] == ')'`, `b` is an empty string, `N` is the length of string `s`, and `N` is greater than 0. When the program enters the if condition `s[i]` is equal to '(', `a` contains the character ')' concatenated to it.***
