Postcondition: ***`raw_input()` is not a valid function, `ss` is not defined, `s` is a string containing the first substring of the original list, `a` is a string containing the character ')' concatenated to it if `s[i] == ')'`, `b` is an empty string concatenated with '(', `N` is the length of string `s`, `i` is incremented by 1, and for the loop to execute again `N` must be greater than the new value of `i`, `a` is concatenated with ')' if `s[i] == '('`. After the execution of the if else block, the program variables remain in the same state as described in the precondition, with the addition that `a` is concatenated with ')' if `s[i] == '('`, and `b` is concatenated with '('.***
