Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code attempts to manipulate the input string by splitting it based on '()', joining the substrings, and then reversing the parentheses. However, there are several issues with the code:
1. The code uses deprecated functions like `raw_input()` which is not valid in Python3.
2. The variable `ss` is not defined in the code.
3. The split operation `s.split('()')` is not correctly handling all cases.
4. There is no explicit return value from the function as required in the problem description.

Therefore, the code is incorrect and does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
