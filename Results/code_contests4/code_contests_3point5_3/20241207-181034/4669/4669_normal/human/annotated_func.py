#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func():
    N = input()
    ss = raw_input()
    s = ss.split('()')
    while len(s) > 1:
        s = ''.join(s)
        
        print(s)
        
        s = s.split('()')
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: Error: `raw_input()` is not a valid function, `ss` is not defined, `s` is a list of substrings, and `s` has a length of 1
    a = ''
    b = ''
    s = s[0]
    N = len(s)
    for i in range(N):
        if s[i] == '(':
            a += ')'
        
        if s[i] == ')':
            b += '('
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `raw_input()` is not a valid function, `ss` is not defined, `s` is a string containing the first substring of the original list, `a` contains the characters ')' concatenated to it for each '(' in `s`, `b` contains the characters '(' concatenated to it for each ')' in `s`, `N` is the length of string `s`
    print(b + ss + a)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an input, which is not specified in the code, and attempts to manipulate the input string by splitting it based on '()', joining the substrings, and then reversing the parentheses. However, the code contains errors such as using deprecated functions like `raw_input()`, undefined variables like `ss`, and incorrect split operations. There is no explicit return value from the function.
