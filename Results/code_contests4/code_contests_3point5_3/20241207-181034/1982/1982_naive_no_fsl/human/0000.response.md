Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly implements the logic to find the greatest beautiful divisor of the input number n. It iterates through all possible beautiful numbers in binary representation, starting from '110' and checks if the number n is divisible by that beautiful number. If it is divisible, it updates the greatest beautiful divisor found so far. The program terminates when the next beautiful number exceeds the input number n. Since the logic is correctly implemented and there are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description where the program might fail, the code is correct.
