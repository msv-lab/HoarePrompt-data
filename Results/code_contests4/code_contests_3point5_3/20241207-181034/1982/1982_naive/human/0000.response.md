Correctness: **False**

The given program does not provide the correct output for all potential cases. For example, when the input is 7, the program should output 1 (as 7 is divisible by the greatest beautiful divisor 1), but the program outputs 3. Hence, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
