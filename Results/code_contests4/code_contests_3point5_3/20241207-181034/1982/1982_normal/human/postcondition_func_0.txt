The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user input, then iterates through binary numbers increasing in length until reaching a binary number greater than `n`. During this iteration, it checks if `n` is divisible by the binary representation of the current number. If it is divisible, it updates the variable `p` to that binary number. Finally, it prints the value of `p`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any values.
