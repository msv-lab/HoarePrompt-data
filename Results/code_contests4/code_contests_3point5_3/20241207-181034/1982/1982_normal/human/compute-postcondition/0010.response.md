Postcondition: ***n is an input integer, i is '1110', p is 1, for the loop to execute the first time, n needs to be greater than or equal to 6. For the loop to execute again, int(i, 2) is less than or equal to the modified value of n. If n is divisible by the integer value of i in base 2, then the loop continues.***
