According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The condition `int(i, 2) <= n` checks if the binary representation of `i` is less than or equal to `n`. 

Right before the loop, `i` is '110' and `n` is an input integer. In binary representation, '110' is equivalent to 6 in decimal. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `n` needs to be greater than or equal to 6. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n is an input integer, i is '110', p is 1, for the loop to execute the first time, n needs to be greater than or equal to 6**
