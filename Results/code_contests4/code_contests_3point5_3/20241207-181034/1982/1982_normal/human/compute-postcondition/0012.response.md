According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If the binary representation of `i` converted to an integer is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is '111110', and `n` is an input integer. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to a binary representation that is less than or equal to `n` when converted to an integer. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n is an input integer, i is '111110', p is 1, for the loop to execute again, the integer value of i is less than or equal to n**
