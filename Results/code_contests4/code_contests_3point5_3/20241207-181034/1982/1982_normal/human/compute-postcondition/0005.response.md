Example Answer: 
`p` is assigned the integer value of `i` in base 2, where `i` is '110'. When '110' is converted to an integer in base 2, it becomes 6. Therefore, `p` is now 6. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **n is an input integer, i is '110', p is 6, n is greater than or equal to 6. The remainder of n divided by the integer value of i in base 2 is 0**
