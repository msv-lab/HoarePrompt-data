Example Answer: 
The code appends '1' at the beginning and '0' at the end of the string 'i', which results in '11111100'. The values of n and p remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an input integer, i is '11111100', p is 1.
Output State: **n is an input integer, i is '11111100', p is 1**
