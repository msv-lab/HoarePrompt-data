Example Answer:
`p` is assigned the integer value of `i` in base 2. Since `i` is '111110', its integer value in base 2 is 62. Therefore, after execution, `p` is 62. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an input integer, i is '111110', p is 62.
Output State: **n is an input integer, i is '111110', p is 62**
