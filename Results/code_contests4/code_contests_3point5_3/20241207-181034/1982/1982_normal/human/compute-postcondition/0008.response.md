According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `int(i, 2)` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` needs to be greater than or equal to 6 for the loop to execute the first time. Additionally, for the loop to execute multiple times, `int(i, 2)` needs to be less than or equal to the modified value of `n` after the previous iteration. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n is an input integer, i is '1110', p is 1, for the loop to execute the first time, n needs to be greater than or equal to 6. For the loop to execute again, int(i, 2) is less than or equal to the modified value of n**
