Correctness: **True**

The program correctly finds the greatest beautiful divisor of the given number `n` by iterating through binary numbers with increasing length until reaching a binary number greater than `n`. It then checks if `n` is divisible by the binary representation of the current number and updates the variable `p` accordingly. Finally, it prints the value of `p`.

The program follows the problem description as it effectively determines the greatest beautiful divisor for any given input within the specified constraints.
