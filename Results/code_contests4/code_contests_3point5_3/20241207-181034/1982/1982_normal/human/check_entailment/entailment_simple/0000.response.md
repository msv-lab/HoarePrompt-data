Correctness: **False**

The program does not always find the greatest beautiful divisor of the input number as described in the problem statement. The program is only checking for divisors in the form of '110', '1110', '11110', etc. However, the problem statement specifies that the number should be in the form (2k - 1) * (2k - 1). 

For example, if the input number is 992, the correct output should be 496, which is the greatest beautiful divisor. However, the program will output 248, as it does not consider the correct form of the beautiful divisor.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
