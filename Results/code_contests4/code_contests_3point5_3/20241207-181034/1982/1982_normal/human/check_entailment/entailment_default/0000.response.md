Correctness: **False**

The provided code fails to correctly identify the greatest beautiful divisor for the input number. It does not follow the problem description for every potential case. For example, if the input number is 15, the code will output 7 as the greatest beautiful divisor, whereas the correct output should be 1. This is because the code only considers checking divisibility by binary numbers that consist of k + 1 consecutive ones followed by k consecutive zeroes. However, the definition of a beautiful number also includes considering binary numbers that consist of k consecutive ones followed by k - 1 consecutive zeroes.

Therefore, the code does not cover all potential cases as required by the problem description, making it incorrect.
