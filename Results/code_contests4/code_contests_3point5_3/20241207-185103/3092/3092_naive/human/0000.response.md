Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of changes needed to make all substrings of the given string distinct. 
- If the length of the string is less than or equal to 26 (number of lowercase English letters), it calculates the difference between the length of the string and the length of the set of characters in the string to determine the minimum number of changes.
- If the length of the string is greater than 26, it correctly outputs -1 as it is impossible to make all substrings distinct in this case. 

The program covers all potential cases and follows the problem description, thus it is correct.
