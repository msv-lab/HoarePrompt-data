Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description by checking if the length of the string is less than or equal to 26 (since there are only 26 lowercase English letters) and calculates the minimum number of changes needed to make all substrings distinct. If the length of the string is greater than 26, it correctly outputs -1. The logic implemented in the program is sound and covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
