The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from the input. If the value of `n` is less than or equal to 26, it calculates the difference between `n` and the number of unique characters in the string `s` and prints the result. If `n` is greater than 26, it prints -1. The function does not have a return value. Edge cases to consider are when `n` is exactly 26 and when `s` contains all unique characters.
