Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It takes an input string `s` and checks if the length of the string is less than or equal to 26. If it is, it calculates the minimum number of changes needed to make all substrings distinct by finding the difference between the length of the string and the number of unique characters. If the length of the string is greater than 26, it returns -1 as it is impossible to make all substrings distinct. The program outputs the result which is either the minimum number of changes or -1.

The program covers all the cases mentioned in the problem description and gives the correct output. It correctly determines if it is possible to make all substrings distinct and calculates the minimum number of changes required.
