Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from the input. If the value of `n` is less than or equal to 26, it calculates the difference between `n` and the number of unique characters in the string `s` and prints the result. If `n` is greater than 26, it prints -1. This aligns with the requirement of finding the minimum number of changes needed to make all the substrings of the given string distinct, or determining that it is impossible. The program covers all potential cases and provides the correct output as specified in the problem description.
