You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: A wise man told Kerem "Different is good" once, so Kerem wants all things in his life to be different. 

Kerem recently got a string s consisting of lowercase English letters. Since Kerem likes it when things are different, he wants all substrings of his string s to be distinct. Substring is a string formed by some number of consecutive characters of the string. For example, string "aba" has substrings "" (empty substring), "a", "b", "a", "ab", "ba", "aba".

If string s has at least two equal substrings then Kerem will change characters at some positions to some other lowercase English letters. Changing characters is a very tiring job, so Kerem want to perform as few changes as possible.

Your task is to find the minimum number of changes needed to make all the substrings of the given string distinct, or determine that it is impossible.

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the length of the string s.

The second line contains the string s of length n consisting of only lowercase English letters.

Output

If it's impossible to change the string s such that all its substring are distinct print -1. Otherwise print the minimum required number of changes.

Examples

Input

2
aa


Output

1


Input

4
koko


Output

2


Input

5
murat


Output

0

Note

In the first sample one of the possible solutions is to change the first character to 'b'.

In the second sample, one may change the first character to 'a' and second character to 'b', so the string becomes "abko".
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100,000 and s is a string of length n consisting of only lowercase English letters.**
def func():
    if (__name__ == '__main__') :
        n = int(raw_input())
        s = raw_input()
        if (n <= 26) :
            result = n - len(set(s))
        else :
            result = -1
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 100,000, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of only lowercase English letters. If `n` is less than or equal to 26, then `result` is the difference between `n` and the number of unique characters in `s`. Otherwise, if `n` is greater than 26, then `result` is -1
        print(str(result))
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100,000 and `s` is a string of length n consisting of only lowercase English letters. Depending on the values of `n` and the number of unique characters in `s`, the `result` will be computed accordingly and printed as a string.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
