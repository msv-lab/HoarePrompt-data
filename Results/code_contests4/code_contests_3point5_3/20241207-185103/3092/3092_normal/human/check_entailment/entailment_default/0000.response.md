Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code seems to correctly implement the problem description. It reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from the input. If the value of `n` is less than or equal to 26, it calculates the difference between `n` and the number of unique characters in the string `s` and prints the result. If `n` is greater than 26, it prints -1. The code handles the case where all substrings are distinct by checking if `n` is less than or equal to 26. 

Considering all possible cases, the code seems to be correct as per the problem description. The output hints also confirm that the code is correctly implementing the requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the code is True.
