The value of `s` is assigned the input string obtained from `raw_input()`. The length of the string `s` is `n` which is an integer between 1 and 100,000, and it consists of only lowercase English letters. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100,000, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of only lowercase English letters.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100,000, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of only lowercase English letters**
