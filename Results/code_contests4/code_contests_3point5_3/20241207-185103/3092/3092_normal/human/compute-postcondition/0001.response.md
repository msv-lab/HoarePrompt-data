Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of the integer obtained from the input using `raw_input()`. The value of `n` is between 1 and 100,000. The value of `s` is not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer between 1 and 100,000, s is a string of length n consisting of only lowercase English letters.
Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 100,000, s is a string of length n consisting of only lowercase English letters**
