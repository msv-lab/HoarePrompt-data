Example Answer:
The value of `result` depends on the value of `n` and the number of unique characters in `s`. If `n` is less than or equal to 26, then `result` is the difference between `n` and the number of unique characters in `s`. If `n` is greater than 26, then `result` is -1. After running the code, the value of `result` will be printed as a string.

Output State: **Depends on the values of `n` and the number of unique characters in `s`, `result` will be computed accordingly and printed as a string.**
