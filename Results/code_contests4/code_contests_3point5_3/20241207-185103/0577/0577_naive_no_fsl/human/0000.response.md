Correctness: **False**

The given program has several issues that make it incorrect:
1. The initialization of `query` should be a list of lists, not a list of sets. So the line `query = [list({}) for i in range(0, n + 1)]` should be changed to `query = [[] for i in range(0, n + 1)]`.
2. The implementation of the `func_1` function is incorrect and does not correctly update the `ans` dictionary. The logic within the function is not handling the relationships between ancestors and sons properly.
3. The usage of `dict(set({}))`, `list({})`, and other similar constructs is inappropriate and unnecessary.

Overall, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem statement.
