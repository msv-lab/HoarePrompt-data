Correctness: **False**

The given Python program does not follow the problem description for all potential cases. The issue lies in the function `func_1(x, dep)`. The implementation of this function is incorrect and does not accurately calculate the number of distinct names among all names of the ki-sons of the man with number vi.

A potential case where the program does not work correctly is when there are multiple sons with the same name but different ancestors. In such cases, the program may incorrectly count the number of distinct names among all names of the ki-sons.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description for all potential cases.
