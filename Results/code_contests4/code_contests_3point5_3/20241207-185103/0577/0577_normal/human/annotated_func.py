    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: All variables have reached their final values based on the conditions and operations within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` iterates through a series of conditions and operations within a while loop based on the values of parameters `x` and `dep`. The loop continues until `x` becomes -1. There are transformations and assignments happening to various variables such as `ans`, `answer`, and `nowChild`. However, it is unclear from the code what specific task or processing is being carried out by this function as there is no explicit return value or output mentioned. The annotations provide some insight into the state of variables after the loop execution, but the overall purpose or functionality of the function is ambiguous due to the lack of a clear indication of the end goal or intended behavior. It seems to involve updating some data structures based on certain conditions, but the exact nature of these updates and their significance is not apparent. Further clarification or additional context is needed to determine the precise functionality of this function.
