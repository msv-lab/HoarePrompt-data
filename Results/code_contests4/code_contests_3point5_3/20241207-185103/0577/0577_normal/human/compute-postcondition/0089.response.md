Example Answer:
The value of `ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, but the loop will not execute one more time as `len(ans[x][j])` is not greater than `len(ans[fa[x]][j])`. Therefore, the Output State is: The loop will not execute one more time as `len(ans[x][j])` is not greater than `len(ans[fa[x]][j]).
Output State: **The loop will not execute one more time as `len(ans[x][j])` is not greater than `len(ans[fa[x]][j])**.
