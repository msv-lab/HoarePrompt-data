Example Answer:
The operation `ans[fa[x]][j].clear()` clears the list stored at `ans[fa[x]][j]`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans[x][j]` is updated based on the bitwise OR operation with `ans[fa[x]][j]`, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now an empty list.
Output State: **`ans[x][j]` is updated based on the bitwise OR operation with `ans[fa[x]][j]`, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is an empty list**
