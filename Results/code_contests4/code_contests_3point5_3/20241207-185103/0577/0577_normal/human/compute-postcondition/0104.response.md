According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is not equal to -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nowChild[x]`, `lenChild[x]`, `dep` are integers. If `nowChild[x]` is equal to `lenChild[x]`, then `nowChild[x]` is incremented by 1 and `dep` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `dep` is increased by 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be adjusted so that it is not equal to -1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`nowChild[x]`, `lenChild[x]`, `dep` are integers and for the loop to execute again `x` is not equal to -1**
