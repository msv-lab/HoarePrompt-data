Example Answer:
`j` is now assigned the value of `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]` and `i` is assigned the value of `query[x][nowlistindex]`. The length of `ans[x][dep + i]` is calculated and stored in `answer[j]`. 
Output State: **`j` is now `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]`, `i` is assigned the value of `query[x][nowlistindex]`, `answer[j]` is the length of `ans[x][dep + i]`**
