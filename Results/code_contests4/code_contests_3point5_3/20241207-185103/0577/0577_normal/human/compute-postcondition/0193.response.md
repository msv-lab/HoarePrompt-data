Postcondition: ***All variables are integers. If `j` is not in `ans[x]`, then the assignment of `ans[x][j]` to `ans[fa[x]][j]` has occurred. If `j` is in `ans[x]`, the length of `ans[x][j]` is compared to the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater, `ans[x][j]` is updated with the result of a bitwise OR operation between `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]`. `j` is updated to the next element in `ans[fa[x]]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is not greater, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated after performing a bitwise OR operation and `ans[x][j]` is cleared.***
