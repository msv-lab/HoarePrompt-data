Example Answer:
`ans[x][j]` is updated by performing a bitwise OR operation between `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]`. The previous values of `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]` are not provided, so the final value of `ans[x][j]` depends on the values of `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]`. The variable `j` remains the next element in `ans[x]` if available for the loop to execute another time. 
Output State: **`ans[x][j]` is updated based on the bitwise OR operation with `ans[fa[x]][j]`, `j` remains the next element in `ans[x]` if available for the loop to execute another time**
