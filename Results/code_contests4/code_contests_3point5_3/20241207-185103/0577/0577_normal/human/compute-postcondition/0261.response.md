Postcondition: ***All variables are integers. If j is not in ans[fa[x]], then the state remains unchanged. If the length of ans[x][j] is less than the length of ans[fa[x]][j], then ans[fa[x]][j] will be updated to match ans[x][j]. Otherwise, ans[fa[x]][j] will be modified based on the conditions mentioned in the else part of the code block.***
