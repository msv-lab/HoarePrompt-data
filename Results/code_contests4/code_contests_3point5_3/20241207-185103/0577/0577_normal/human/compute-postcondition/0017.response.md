Postcondition: ***`query[x]` has a length of at least 2, `nowlistindex` is incremented by 2, `i` is assigned the value `query[x][nowlistindex]`, `j` is assigned the value of the second element in `query[x]`, `i` is updated to the element at index `nowlistindex` in `query[x]`, `j` is assigned the value of `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]`. If `dep + i` is not in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is set to 0. Otherwise, `answer[j]` is assigned the length of `ans[x][dep + i]`.***
