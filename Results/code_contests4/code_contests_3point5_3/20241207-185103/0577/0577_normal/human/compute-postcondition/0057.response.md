Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if else block, either `j` is not in `ans[fa[x]]` or the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, the content of `ans[x][j]` is cleared. Otherwise, no changes occur in the variables.***
