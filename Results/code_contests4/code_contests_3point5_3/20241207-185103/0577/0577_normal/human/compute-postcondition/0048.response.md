Postcondition: ***Adjust the states to enable the loop to execute one more time. If j is not in ans[fa[x]], the loop will execute one more time. Otherwise, if the length of ans[x][j] is less than the length of ans[fa[x]][j], the loop will execute one more time. If ans[x][j] is True and ans[fa[x]][j] is True, the loop will not execute another time.***
