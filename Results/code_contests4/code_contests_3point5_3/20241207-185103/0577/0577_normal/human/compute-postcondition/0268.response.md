Postcondition: ***`nowChild[x]`, `lenChild[x]`, `dep`, `x` are integers. `x` is not equal to -1. `ans[x][dep]` is a set containing the value of `ss[x]`. `answer[j]` is either 0 or the length of `ans[x][dep + i]` depending on whether `dep + i` is in `ans[x]`. The length of `ans[x]` is greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, for the loop to execute the first time `ans[fa[x]]` has at least one element, `j` is the first element in `ans[fa[x]]. `j` is in `ans[x]`.***
