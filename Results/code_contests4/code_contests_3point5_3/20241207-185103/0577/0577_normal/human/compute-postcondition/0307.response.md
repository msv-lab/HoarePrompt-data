Postcondition: ***`nowChild[x]`, `lenChild[x]`, `dep` are integers and `x` is not equal to -1. If `nowChild[x]` is equal to `lenChild[x]`, then `nowChild[x]` is increased by 1 and `dep` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `nowChild[x]` is updated to the value `Child[x][nowChild[x]]`, `lenChild[x]` remains unchanged, and `dep` is incremented by 1.***
